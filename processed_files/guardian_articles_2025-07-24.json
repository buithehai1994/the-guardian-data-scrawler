Nearly 100,000 women and children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition, and a third of Gaza’s population is going days without eating, according to anexpert from the UN World Food Programme. Tons of food sitsrotting in warehousesjust outside Gaza but the government of Israel will not allow it to be freely delivered. Instead, starving Palestinians must contend with a real-life version of The Hunger Games to try to eat.More than 1,000 desperate Palestinianshave been shot dead by Israeli forces since the end of May trying to reach food distribution points run by the US – and the Israel-backedGaza “Humanitarian” Foundation.But enough about that, eh! Who wants to hear about starving babies who will either die painful deaths or never fully recover from the long-term consequences ofmalnutritionin early childhood? I’m sure what you really want to know is what Benjamin Netanyahu’s favourite fast-food order is. And, luckily, I’ve got some answers for you.On Monday Netanyahu, one of the main architects of Gaza’shuman-made mass starvation campaign, gave an hour-long interview toNelk Boy membersKyle Forgeard and Aaron Steinberg on their Full Send Podcast.If you are not in their target demographic (a young man with right-leaning tendencies), you might not know much about the collection of media personalities known as the Nelk Boys, but they wield a lot of influence. They have more than 8.5 million subscribers on YouTube and have interviewed Donald Trump multiple times. While they initially built a name for themselves as pranksters, they’ve nowaligned themselveswith the likes of the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate and went all-in onTrump’s 2024 campaign. Some political scientists believe thatthey are partly responsible for Trump’s second term. Indeed, the Nelk Boys, along with other “manosphere”-adjacent podcasters such as Adin Ross, Theo Von and Joe Rogan, even got a shout-out from the UFC CEO ,Dana White, atTrump’s election night victory party.Benjamin Netanyahu on the fullsendpodcast LIVE at 12PM/ESTpic.twitter.com/eJLLxYvhMd— Full Send Podcast (@fullsendpodcast)July 21, 2025How they brokered the Netanyahu interview is unclear, although an entrepreneur namedElkana Bar Eitan,who previously arrangeda trip to Israel for the Nelk Boys, is claiming hesuggested it in orderto help “convey pro-Israel messages to a younger audience”.You can watch the entire inane 70 minutes for yourself if you want to sacrifice some braincells and get served annoying ads for sports betting and cryptocurrency. But the “too long; didn’t listen” summary of the conversation is that Netanyahu touched on all his preferred talking points and lied continuously without any pushback. He started by sucking up to Trump – something he’s very skilled at – praising the US president’s sense of humour and sharing the fact that his wife, Sara, told him that Trump “is a good person with a good heart”. He claimed that most civilian casualties inGazaare Hamas’s fault and, engaging in a little pinkwashing, said that it was nonsensical for women and gay people to support Gaza: “It’s like chickens for KFC, right?” He also said that everyone in Gaza wants to be transferred to another country, and falsely claimed that Hamas isn’t letting them leave. He also said Hamas was responsible for the fact Gaza is starving. And then he pivoted to the topic of Zohran Mamdani (he’s not a fan) before spending a lot of time talking about Iran.But don’t worry, this tour-de-force of hard-hitting journalism was interspersed with lighter moments like when the Nelk Boys asked what Netanyahu’s favourite McDonald’s order is and Netanyahu replied that he preferred Burger King. “That’s your worst take, I think,” Steinberg responded jokingly.Hilarious, right? It’s just side-splittingly funny that kids aredying of starvation in Gazathanks to a man who is a big fan of Whoppers.If Steinberg wants to see some more of Netanyahu’s “bad takes”, I strongly suggest he look up a few things the prime minister has said about Palestinians. In 2001, for example, Netanyahu saidhis approach to Palestiniansis that you should: “Beat them up, not once but repeatedly, beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it’s unbearable.” Of course, that would require the Nelk Boys doing any research before having Netanyahu on. “I see so much stuff about what’s going on in Israel and Iran and Palestine, and to be honest, I just really don’t know what is going on there,” Forgeard said. I think we all saw that.It’s not some fratty podcasters asking a man who should be in the Hague what his favourite burger is who are the real problemNetanyahu made it very clear why he was on the podcast, stating that he was sitting down with the Nelk Boys “to reach young people”.After almost two years of carnage which has left more than17,000 children dead, support for Israel is dropping, particularlyamong young Americans.Whether Netanyahu achieved what he wanted from the useful idiots interviewing him is unclear. And while the Nelk Boys received a lot of publicity for the interview, I’m not sure they’re happy with the backlash they’re getting. They’ve lost more than10,000 subscribersin less than a day and thecomment sectionisn’t exactly flattering. (One of the top YouTube comments says: “Holy shit this is insane. War criminal. You will be remembered for centuries for this interview.”)The Nelk Boys, meanwhile, are doing their best to defend themselves. They jumped on a stream with the leftwing podcaster Hasan Piker after the Netanyahu interview to explain they know the Israeli prime minister was trying to promote his actions, and that’s fine because that’s what everyone does on podcasts. “Benjamin Netanyahu isn’t promoting a book, he’s promoting a genocide,”Piker replied. They’ve alsoadmitted“we’re probably not the best at asking questions.”Perhaps the Nelk Boys shouldn’t feel so bad. Large swathes of the mainstream media seem to have little interest in hearing the Palestinian point of view or pushing back against Israeli propaganda. One analysis of media coverage found thatUS cable showsdisplayed consistent anti-Palestinian bias and went for months without speaking to a single Palestinian. When Ta-Nehisi Coates went on the media circuit to discuss his new book, The Message, one section of which criticizes Israel’s treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, he was smeared as anextremist by CBS Mornings’ Tony Dokoupil. Despite winning an Oscar,no major US distributorwould touch No Other Land, the Palestinian-Israeli documentary which looks at how the Israeli government is trying to force Palestinians from their homes in the southern West Bank.While peacefully waving a Palestinian flag or speaking up for Palestinians can have you threatened witharrest in the UKordeportationfrom the US, accused war criminals are getting the kid-gloves treatment. The international criminal court (ICC)issued a warrant of arrestfor Netanyahu for crimes against humanity and war crimes. In a just world, this would make him a pariah. Instead, the ICC arrest warrant, which is still active, has been swept under the rug. It rarely comes up in news reports that mention the prime minister of Israel, and it hasn’t stopped US politicians cheerfully hobnobbing with him. Even the likes of Cory Booker, who postures as some sort of civil rights activist, posed for photos withNetanyahu earlier this month.I’m witnessing the deliberate starvation of Gaza’s children – why is the world letting it happen? | Nick MaynardRead moreI’m pointing all this out because the normalization of Netanyahu, the constant whitewashing of Israel’salleged war crimesby “respectable” figures, is why a man who has blood dripping from his hands, a man who is responsible for whatmany expertssay “is the worst humanitarian situation they have ever seen”, can be invited on to the Nelk Boys’highly influential podcastto jokes about whether he prefers McDonald’s or Burger King.While condemnation of Israel’s actions has increased in recent months, the media still often presents what is happening as a response to 7 October 2023, rather than looking at the broader historical context. Israel weaponized food long before 7 October. In 2008, for example, Israeli authorities calculated the minimum caloric intake necessary for Palestinians to avoid malnutrition so they couldlimit the amount of foodinto Gaza without causing a famine. For decades Israel has controlled almost every aspect of Palestinian lives and stripped them of every facet of human dignity; today, people in Gaza are not even allowed todip their feet in the sea.So while the Nelk Boys interview is unpleasant listening, it’s not some fratty podcasters asking a man who should be in The Hague what his favourite burger is who are the real problem. It’s decades of the mainstream media systematicallydehumanizingPalestinians. As an apocalyptic Gaza starves, there are a lot of politicians and journalists in the US who should be asking themselves how they helped pave the way for agenocideto happen.This article was amended on 24 July 2025; a previous version of the body and subhead incorrectly stated that Full Send Podcast lost more than 100,000 subscribers in less than a day, when it was in fact more than 10,000 subscribers.Explore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionIsraelGazaIsrael-Gaza warPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaPodcastingcommentShareReuse this content"

They woke on Thursday with their assignment crystal clear: outwit a seemingly invincible Spain if they are to cement their place in history and retain the European Championship title on Sunday.A thankless task? It has been billed that way but there were elements of encouragement during asapping, knife-edge semi-finalin Zurich that Spain could easily have lost. For the first time this summer they were taken to the wire and the thought occurred that, if a weakened Germany could run them to within an Aitana Bonmatí masterstroke of the full distance, the Lionesses’ haphazard winning machine stands a fighting chance of curtailing the favourites’ party.England’s Keira Walsh hopes Spain can enjoy a controversy-free final after Rubiales affairRead more“I feel like the hard work has paid off,” the Spain manager, Montse Tomé, said after they had edged through. They were tested to the limit by a Germany team that squeezed space and, when opportunities arose, flooded forward. The goalkeeper Cata Coll made a handful of decisive saves and England will spend the coming days poring over the ways in which she can be exposed further.They will certainly have noted how Germany, happy to give up possession in the first two-thirds of the pitch, caused intermittent havoc on the counter. Lauren Hemp may take particular interest in how Klara Bühl, whose blend of power and trickery deserved greater reward, exposed them repeatedly on Germany’s left side. Bühl was never afraid to let fly and worked numerous positions in which to do so, although her best chance came when Spain were caught cold by a long pass by the keeper Ann-Katrin Berger.Jule Brand, a sparkling presence on the other side, caused headaches of her own. If England can expose the Spain full-backs, Ona Batlle and Olga Carmona, there will be opportunities to make hay. The question is whether Sarina Wiegman would willingly encourage the kind of punchy, sometimes scrappy showing Germany produced to invite them on. Like Spain, the reigning European champions would rather have the ball: they have dominated it in all of their five games, comprehensively in most cases. Do England have it in them to set up for a smash and grab?Evidence that they may do presented itself in February, when Wiegman’s sidewon 1-0 at Wembleywith a triumph of guts over guile. They had 41% of possession but nicked the spoils through Jess Park and could consider the outcome deserved. Two-thirds of the starters from this week’s semi-finals also began that game; perhaps the concern is that, since then, England have neither looked similarly solid nor fluent enough to compensate.View image in fullscreenLinda Dallmann (left) and the Germany midfield put pressure on Spain during the semi-final.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockSpain appear perfectly aware of that judging by Mariona Caldentey’s unprompted acknowledgment during the post-game melee in Zurich that England are yet to truly sparkle. It remains possible that they will not need to. Wiegman may also note the way Germany’s midfield of Elisa Senss, Sara Däbritz and Janina Minge set into their counterparts whenever danger threatened.Bonmatí was, bar a couple of silky incursions, restrained until her angled bolt from the blue; Alexia Putellas was uncharacteristically quiet and few of those little pockets, the half-gaps between the lines, in which Spain love to wreak chaos were made available. If Wiegman wants to take inspiration then the insertion of Grace Clinton, who shone in that Nations League triumph five months ago, alongside Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway could generate a similar energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Balls down the centre-backs’ sides also caused occasional trouble on Wednesday night. But for all these shoots of encouragement, they will require a far more clinical edge than Germany proved capable of mustering.Perhaps, in such a delicate match-up, intangibles come into play. It was clear from the extent of Spain’s celebrations that debuting in a continental final, and a first win over Germany, meant the world. “An infinite joy,” Tomé said. A weight of expectation accompanies that opportunity to make the next step, especially when you have been heavily backed to cruise home. Failure stings, just as seven of Spain’s likely starting lineup will remember from Barcelona’s Women’sChampions League finalagainst Arsenal two months ago, when the English side played the upstart role to perfection.“This is not over yet,” Bonmatí said. England remain the team that have it all to do. Eyes may burn with the vision of decisively avenging thatWorld Cup final defeatin Sydney two years ago, but the bottom line is that they must improve significantly on that performance. Germany’s organised, aggressive and whip-smart offering may just have shown how to go about it.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Take Change UK, which launched amid much fanfare in the spring of 2019 and had disbanded by the end of the same year. So can Jeremy Corbyn andZarah Sultanafare any better? In part it depends on the question you ask.The new and as-yet unnamed leftwing partyformally announcedby Corbyn and his fellow ex-Labour MP on Thursday, has one major advantage at its disposal: the former Labour leader’s very strong public profile.According to arolling YouGov pollof politicians’ name recognition, Corbyn is known by 98% of voters, more than Keir Starmer or Nigel Farage.“Everyone knows whoJeremy Corbynis, everyone knows who he stands for. And with any new party, that is not even half the battle. It’s three-quarters of the battle,” said Robert Ford, a professor of political science at Manchester University.“A lot of people don’t like what he stands for, but that doesn’t matter, because he’s not aiming for everyone.”That is the second likely advantage for the organisation, launched under the interim title of “Your Party”. Unlike Change UK, a collection of centrist MPs who defected from Labour and the Conservatives, or indeed unlike Corbyn’s task when he led Labour, there is no need to temper opinions to court the middle ground.Co-led by Corbyn and Sultana, the party is explicitly aiming itself at left-leaning voters who until now are likely to have backed Labour, the Greens or the collection ofGaza-focused independentswho saw off Labour candidates in four constituencies in last year’s election.“With the best will in the world, not even Zarah Sultana, I suspect, is expecting Jeremy Corbyn to be the next prime minister,” Ford said. “That’s not the purpose of it. The purpose of it is to offer an outlet for those who think Labour have driven too far to the right. So he doesn’t have the same problem that he and his advisers had a few years ago.”Polling before the party launched suggested it could gather as much as 10% of the vote nationally. However, new parties traditionally struggle to maintain momentum, and turning polls into votes relies on building an effective campaign machine, which is tricky to do from scratch.All this could make for a complex picture at a constituency level, with Ford noting that it could variously make electoral life harder or easier for Labour MPs, depending on the location and context.For example, even a 5% haul for a Corbyn-Sultana candidate could mean the difference between Labour win or a loss to the Conservatives or Reform UK.The new venture could also scupper the Greens in their hopes of taking seats from Labour in the 40 areas where they finished second in 2024, given its likely appeal to some Green voters.The Greens have dismissed the opening statement from the new party for making “only a passing glance to the climate crisis”, saying this left them stuck in the past, and it is possible that Corbyn’s main electoral hunting ground will be voters sympathetic to the Gaza-focused independents.The only Labour response has been a brief and scathing party source quote about the electorate having “twice given its verdict on a Jeremy Corbyn-led party”, in the 2017 and 2019 elections.But the new party is different in its aims, and, politically, 2025 is not 2019. An ostensibly new party, Reform UK, is leading the polls, even if it is Nigel Farage’s third incarnation of Ukip, which can trace its history back more than 30 years. And voter loyalties, which were once relatively fixed, are more fluid than ever.One thing, however, is constant: the identity of the co-protagonist. Corbyn has a name, but also political baggage, and a reputation for occasional prickliness and falling out with people. The launch of the new party has been slightly stumbling, with allies of Corbyn making plain their annoyance whenSultana announced herselfas co-leader of a new group in June. It is also unusual to launch a new party without having agreed on a name.Can Corbyn and Sultana confound the historical odds? To an extent it doesn’t entirely matter. In the currently fragmented multiparty world, even moderate success could have a disproportionate impact.Explore more on these topicsPoliticsJeremy CorbynZarah SultanaanalysisShareReuse this content"

Andy Goldsworthy has laid a sheepskin rug up the classical gallery’s grand staircase – very luxurious, except it’s made from the scraps thrown away after shearing, stained blue or red with farmers’ marks, all painstakingly stitched together with thorns.This is the Clarkson’s Farm of art retrospectives, plunging today’s urbanites into the raw sadness and beauty, the violence and slow natural cycles of the British countryside. Goldsworthy may love nature but he doesn’t sentimentalise it. At the top of the stairs there’s a screen and through its gaps you glimpse the galleries beyond. It feels mystical and calming, until you realise it’s made of rusty barbed wire strung between two of the building’s columns that serve as tightly-wound wire rollers. It made me think of Magnus Mills’ darkly hilarious rural novel about hapless fencers, The Restraint of Beasts.Later you can relax looking at seductive, purple abstract watercolours – until you discover they are made with hare’s blood and snow.View image in fullscreenSlow cycles … Elm leaves held with water to fractured bough of fallen elm. Dumfriesshire, 2010.Photograph: Andy GoldsworthyThe show is titled Fifty Years, which might make anyone feel old, and Goldsworthy may have been goaded by it. He fills the gallery’s main floor with new and recent work, while you’ll find an archive of his 20th-century career downstairs. But how could he exhibit his past achievements except in photos and video? Since the 1970s Goldsworthy, who was born in Cheshire and grew up on the outskirts of Leeds, has been making art with nature, in nature, even for nature, since some of his interventions could only be experienced by birds or sheep before the colour faded from a rubbed stone or a mat of leaves decayed. Other outdoor works are more permanent, using dry stone walling to make sheepfolds and little houses in sculpture parks and nature reserves.In Cumbria you’ll find his monumental Grizedale Wall snaking between the trees. What makes this a work of art? It’s simple. There’s no practical reason a farmer would place an elegantly curving stone line in a forest. But by making it, Goldsworthy insists you ask what art is. He’s a peasant dadaist. In photos of an early action he throws bunches of sticks in the sky to see how they fall – a fresh air reworking ofMarcel Duchamp’s 3 Standard Stoppagesin which chance determined how a string fell. An entertaining video shows what happened when Goldsworthy brought a giant snowball from the Scottish Highlands to London’s Smithfield meat market in June 2000: the meatpackers have fun moving it about with a forklift. Inside the snow, the artist gently explains, is a core of hair from Highland cattle. He’s not saying meat is murder so much as what we consume is divorced from any sense of natural life.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dumfriesshire, Scotland, 2016.Photograph: Andy GoldsworthyIt is our connection with nature he wants to reawaken, not in a quiet contemplative way but as a shock. Earth and blood are the same, he suggests in the most powerful room. It is dominated by a whole wall made of cracked red clay that he collected by hand in Dumfriesshire’s Lowther Hills. The epic scale and fiery colour seem more American than Scottish. Goldsworthy shows you this is a big country, too. The work is called Red Wall – but I don’t think it’s a political joke. The redness is all. In the same room a three-screen video records an alchemical performance in which Goldsworthy rubs a rock in a Dumfriesshire river to reveal a layer of iron-rich pure redness; the red appears as bloody clouds in the green water.Iron reddens the earth and reddens our blood. We are part of nature’s cycle. Our bodies will return to the earth – at least, if you live in rural Dumfriesshire as Goldsworthy does. When you die there you still get buried, in a churchyard, according to Goldsworthy’s grand project Gravestones, for which he has taken photographs of Dumfriesshire churchyards under stormy skies.Goldsworthy’s “gravestones” are not headstones but the pebbles and rocks that have to be removed when fresh graves are dug. He wants to create a vast monumental field with them, to show that there is animate nature and inanimate nature – blood and stone. We return to the earth, leaving our imperishable elements. He tests his idea in an installation here. Stones from graveyards form a continuous floor, like a rocky seashore, completely filling a room except for a narrow walkway.The stones have literally been cut short, neatly sliced through, to form a straight boundary between the artwork and the observer. It’s typical of this artist’s poetic precision. You wonder how he cut the stones in two so neatly, and accurately measured the perfect line they make. Then it hits you. This is the straight smooth absolute line between life and death. That’s true in the country, and the city, too.Andy Goldsworthy: Fifty Years is at theRoyal Scottish Academy, Edinburgh from 26 July until 2 November 2025Explore more on these topicsArt and designInstallationSculptureArtExhibitionsreviewsShareReuse this content"

In this particular endeavor, however, he failed.Donald Trump, far from being made a nonperson, became the first defeated US president in 132 years to win back the White House. And from the Club World Cup final to the Oval Office, Murdoch has been seen by his side.Trump news at a glance: Trump sues Murdoch and WSJ for libel and slander over Epstein claimsRead moreAs the Wall Street Journal prepared to report that Trump provided a bawdy birthday letter to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein last week, the president appealed to Murdoch – chair emeritus of News Corporation, the newspaper’s owner – to kill the story, claiming it was false. The story ran.But the story did not receive the same treatment across Murdoch’s empire. TheFox Newsanchor Laura Ingraham went on air 15 minutes after the Journal published its story, and talked about Epstein. “We have new news coming on about this, as well, from the Wall Street Journal. A new report tonight – next,” she said, throwing to a commercial break. When The Ingraham Angle returned, the new news did not feature.Preston Padden, who worked at Fox in the 1990s, is the veteran media industry operator whom Murdoch told of his plan to make Trump a “nonperson” in 2021. He was not surprised to see how his former boss, and his array of outlets, handled this story.“You’ve got the Wall Street Journal, and you’ve got the cable news channel. And they represent two different sides of Rupert’s brain,” Padden said in an interview. “He is, in his heart, a serious newsman, and that’s the Wall Street Journal. He’s also a brilliant businessman, and that’s Fox News.”Murdoch’s businesses are divided between two companies: Fox Corporation, which houses Fox News and the Tubi streaming platform, and News Corp, home to newspapers including the Australian, the Sun, the Journal; the digital real estate network REA; and HarperCollins, the publishing giant.“There is a more of a focus on the business than the journalism at Fox, than seems to be the case at News Corp,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst and former banker. “It always appeared to me that business was first” for Murdoch, he added. “Influence was a means to an end.”News Corp’s Dow Jones division – where the Wall Street Journal sits – generated revenue of $575m in the first three months of the year. Fox Corp’s cable network programming arm, meanwhile – led by Fox News, and also including Fox Sports – generated $1.64bn over the same period.“Fox News is the primordial asset of the collection of assets,” said media analyst Claire Enders, who said the network “has drawn no attention to the matter, exactly as the president has wished”.Covering the Journal’s reporting on Trump and Epstein “would not be good for business” at Fox News, suggested Padden, who observed how the network previously endured a backlash from the president’s supporters when it strayed significantly from his narrative. “And so you can watch this debate,” he claimed. “Should we report the truth, and lose viewers, or should we report what our viewers want?”In 2023, Foxreached a $787.5m settlementwith Dominion Voting Systems over the voting equipment firm’s defamation lawsuit against the network over the false narrative that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump.View image in fullscreenMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch looks on as Donald Trump speaks to members of the media as he signs proclamations, initiatives and appointments inside the Oval Office on 3 February 2025.Photograph: Craig Hudson/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesTrump, who has in recent days promoted Fox News segments on his Truth Social platform, seems perfectly happy with its output. But he promptly sued Murdoch, News Corp and the Journal reporters behind the story on his ties with Epstein, publicly goading Murdoch about the threat of testifying.Murdoch and Trump have engaged in a transactional relationship spanning decades, noted Enders. “There is also a very longstanding friendship between Trump and Mr Murdoch. And a symbiotic relationship with the cashflow machine,” she said. “They have fallen out before and made up quickly.”In December, Disney’s ABC agreed to pay $15m to a foundation and museum as part of a settlement in a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump. Earlier this month, Paramount reached a $16m settlement with the president over another lawsuit he filed over an interview with Kamala Harris, the Democrat candidate for president, by CBS News.Trump’s latest lawsuit raises the prospect of another prominent media organization – this time News Corp – potentially settling to avoid a lengthy legal battle. A Dow Jones spokesperson said: “We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.”“We do not anticipate any lasting repercussions from this unless the WSJ has in fact been hoaxed,” said Enders. “Otherwise, it will be shuffled away with a smaller settlement. That is how previous ginormous Trump lèse-majesté cases have been dealt with.”Fox News has covered the lawsuit sparingly in recent days, reporting on Trump’s initial filing on Friday, referencing the story briefly on Saturday, and then analyzing it in a segment on Sunday. The network declined to comment.Murdoch, 94, retired from management in 2023, when he handed over the reins at Fox Corp and News Corp to his son, Lachlan. At the time, however, he stressed he would remain “involved every day” in the businesses.“As long as he’s around, it’s his candy store,” said Padden.Explore more on these topicsMediaRupert MurdochDonald TrumpFox NewsTelevision industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

The UN and aid groups blame Israel’s blockade of almost all aid into the territory for the lack of food.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreLazzarini said in a statement that a colleague in the territory had told him: “People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses.”He said Unrwa had the equivalent of 6,000 loaded trucks of food and medical supplies waiting in Jordan and Egypt and urged Israel to allow “humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza”.Reports of people fainting and dropping dead of hunger have emerged in recent days. Civil defence workers have released photographs of gaunt bodies with little more than skin covering their bones.Medical sources in Gaza said two more people had died of hunger on Thursday, both of whom had been ill and had not eaten for days.As international pressure mounted for a breakthrough to end nearly two years of devastating war,Emmanuel Macron announced France would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in September.“True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine. I will make a formal announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September,” the French president wrote on X and Instagram.Earlier, Israel and the US announced they were recalling their negotiators from Doha, where peace talks were being held. The US envoy, Steve Witkoff, accused Hamas of not acting in good faith.“We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza,” he wrote on X.He said the US would consider “alternative options” to recover the hostages and “create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza” without elaborating on what those alternatives might be.Witkoff’s announcement came after Hamas sent its response on the latest ceasefire proposal to mediators. It was an abrupt about-face to the optimism earlier in the day, when the Associated Press reported an Israeli official saying the Hamas proposal was workable.Witkoff had also been scheduled to meet the top Israeli adviser, Ron Dermer, and the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Sardinia, which was regarded as a positive sign for the ceasefire talks. It was unclear if or when those meetings would still happen.Hamas’s proposal included requests on the number of prisoners exchanged, the agencies to be allowed to distribute aid in Gaza and a permanent end to the war rather than a ceasefire, Israeli media reported.The group’s demands came as global pressure mounted on Israel to stop fighting and a growing number of countries expressed horror at the scenes of starvation in the territory.A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters the Hamas response was “flexible, positive and took into consideration the growing suffering in Gaza and the need to stop the starvation”. A Hamas source said the proposal included a fresh roadmap for a prisoner exchange, which it told Reuters was a top priority for the group.chartThe Israeli Hostage Families Forum, representing the families of those held in Gaza, issued a statement of concern at the news that negotiators had been recalled and urged a ceasefire to be reached quickly.“Each day that passes endangers the hostages’ chances of recovery and risks losing the ability to locate the fallen or gain vital intelligence about them,” it said.The deal that was under consideration is expected to involve a 60-day ceasefire during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Talks would be held during the ceasefire period to reach a lasting truce and aid supplies to the besieged strip would be increased.It has only been since the end of the war between Iran and Israel last month that the serious prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza has emerged. As negotiations continued, Israeli attacks increased. At least 89 people were killed in the last 24 hours as Israeli airstrikes pounded central Gaza, health authorities said.BBC, AFP and other news outlets warn journalists in Gaza at risk of starvationRead moreIsrael says the global media is exaggerating the scale of the hunger crisis, even though aid groups and pictures coming from Gaza show clear evidence of starvation and doctors who treat malnourished children say they are unable to get enough to eat themselves.Israel only lets a trickle of aid into Gaza, the vast majority of which is distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private US firm. GHF operates four food distribution points staffed by US mercenaries,a system which has been described as a death trap.More than 1,000 people seeking aid have been killed trying to access supplies in the nearly two months since GHF began operating in Gaza.Aid was formerly distributed through more than 400 distribution points under a UN-led system, but Israel has all but stopped UN aid into the territory since March. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing UN aid, a claim for which humanitarians say there is little evidence.Aid groups say GHF, which was meant to replace the UN, lacks the capacity to do so and that its militarised model violates key humanitarian principles.Restoring the UN aid system as a part of a ceasefire deal is a key Hamas demand. Israeli negotiators have softened their stance on the issue as pressure grows even within Israel to stop the starvation crisis, which the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,described on Wednesday as man-made.Thousands of Israeli demonstrators carrying bags of flour and pictures of Palestinian children who died of starvation protested in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, calling for an end to the Gaza blockade.Hamas is also calling for a ceasefire deal to include a permanent end to the Gaza war, something that Israel has refused.A ceasefire deal is unpopular among the more extreme members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet and Israel has sought to keep open the possibility of restarting the war after the ceasefire period.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

He says that while there was 90% backing for the strike, it was on a turnout of just over 55% of members.Streeting says themove to strikeafter the offer of a 5.4% pay rise for 2025-26, was rushed into and is “bitterly disappointing” amid efforts to improve NHS services.“There was a deal here to be done,” he writes. “Instead, the BMA leadership’s decision to not even consider postponing these strikes will place an enormous burden on their colleagues, and hit the recovery we can all see our health service is making.“Not only that, it enormously undermines the entire trade union movement. No trade union in British history has seen its members receive a such a steep pay rise only to immediately respond with strikes – even when a majority of their members didn’t even vote to strike. This action is unprecedented, and it is unreasonable.”The BMA argues that resident doctors have seen their pay fall by a much greater amount in real terms since 2008-09 than the rest of the population.“Doctors are not worth less than they were 17 years ago, when austerity policies began driving wages down. We’re simply asking for that value to be restored,” it said.Streeting says resident doctors have privately contacted him to express their dismay at the decision to strike, saying they “feel the BMA’s leaders are out of lockstep with not just patients but most resident doctors themselves”.The health secretary urges doctors to defy their union and not join in the strike, which runs until 7am next Wednesday.“I am urging resident doctors to not follow the BMA leadership, who I do not believe are representing the best interests of their members, any further down this path as strikes begin on Friday at 7am,” he writes.The public have been urged to keep coming forward for NHS care during the strike, and NHSEnglandhas urged hospital chief executives to keep routine operations and appointments and only reschedule if there is a risk to patient safety.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)blognoted that the NHS was “taking a different approach” after learning lessons from previous strikes, and would avoid cancelling planned appointments for illnesses such as cancer because this posed “a risk to patients too”.On Wednesday, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges urged the BMA to suspend its guidance to resident doctors that they do not have to share their intentions to strike with their employers – as is their entitlement under employment law – to enable hospitals to better plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s going to strike most of the public that use the NHS as deeply unfair.”The DHSC said the BMA’s framing was “disingenuous”.“The average annual earnings per first year resident doctor last year was £43,275,” a spokesperson said. “That is significantly more, in a resident doctor’s first year, than the average full-time worker in this country earns.“Resident doctors in their second year earned an average of £52,300 last year and, at the top end of the scale, resident doctors in specialty training earned an average almost £75,000 – this is set to increase further with this year’s pay award.”Public support for the strikes has been waning. A YouGov poll showed that about half (52%) of people in the UK do not back them, broken down into 20% who are “somewhat opposed” and 32% who are “strongly opposed”.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsWes StreetingLabourNHSHospitalsHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The announcement comes as the US president finds himself mired in scandal over the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, and has tried to distract by pivoting conversation to retribution against his political enemies.On Thursday, two Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn, both members of the judiciary committee, called on Bondi to appoint a special counsel into what they called “an unprecedented and clear abuse of power” by theObama administration.Obama breaks silence on Trump’s ‘outrageous’ call to prosecute himRead more“For the good of the country, we urge Attorney General Bondi to appoint a special counsel to investigate the extent to which former President Obama, his staff and administration officials manipulated the US national security apparatus for a political outcome,” the senators said in a statement.Gabbard has alleged that Obama and his senior officials concocted a “years long coup” against Trump – manifested in a special counsel investigation and FBI inquiries – by “manufacturing” intelligence in the weeks after Trump’s 2016 victory overHillary Clintonthat was meant to show collusion between his campaign and Russia.She has recommended that criminal charges be pressed, including against Obama himself. Trump hasembraced her argumentand has said Gabbard’s findings reveal “irrefutable proof” of treason.Bondi set the scene for a justice department investigation after Gabbard presented what she claimed was evidence of a crime at a White House news conference on Wednesday.“The Department of Justice is proud to work with my friend Director Gabbard and we are grateful for her partnership in delivering accountability for the American people. We will investigate these troubling disclosures fully and leave no stone unturned to deliver justice,” Bondi said in a statement.Fox Newscited a source close to Bondi’s strike force as saying no serious lead is off the table.However, any moves to prosecute Obama are likely to be stymied by last year’sUS supreme court rulinggranting presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution for acts committed in the course of their presidential duties.The ruling was widely viewed as favoring Trump, who has faced criminal investigations for acts committed in his first presidency – including the retention of classified documents. Ironically, it may now form an obstacle to Trump’s stated desire to pursue “retribution” against his political opponents.Obama’s office issued a rare statement on Tuesday, calling the allegations “outrageous” and “ridiculous”.Several others named in Gabbard’s document could be targeted. They include James Clapper, her predecessor as director of national intelligence; John Brennan, the former CIA director; James Comey, who was FBI director until he was fired by Trump; Comey’s former deputy Andrew McCabe; ex-national security adviser Susan Rice; John Kerry, the former secretary of state; and Loretta Lynch, the former attorney general.Brennan has already been the subject of a criminal referral by the current CIA director, John Ratcliffe. Kash Patel, the FBI director, has opened a criminal investigation into Brennan and Comey, according to Fox News, although its scope is unclear.During his first presidency, Trump publicly accepted the FBI’s findings that Russia had sought to interfere in the 2016 race, although he alsopublicly accepted Putin’s denialsof the US intelligence community conclusions at a 2018 summit in Helsinki. A 1,000-pageSenate intelligence committee reportin 2020 also found that Russia had intervened on Trump’s behalf, noting that Trump’s campaign chair had regular contact with a Russian intelligence officer.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was also supposedly on a daily regimen of “heavy tranquilizers”.Gabbard also alleges that an intelligence community assessment of Putin’s efforts deliberately excluded “significant” intelligence that contradicted the key findings of Russia’s purported preference for Trump.Clinton has previously suggestedthat Gabbard – a former Democratic member of Congress – was being “groomed” by Russia as a possible presidential candidate. Gabbard, who has no prior intelligence experience, has also been criticized for repeating Kremlin talking points, including after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.Her report appears to misrepresent aspects of the intelligence agencies’ assessments of Russia’s meddling in the 2016 race. The assessment found that Russia did not conduct cyber-attacks against election infrastructure to change vote tallies, but hacked and leaked documents from the DNC to damage Clinton’s campaign – activity that Trump publicly encouraged at the time.While Obama’s national security officials have remained silent on the matter, some intelligence veterans have criticized Gabbard’s effort.“The Trump Admin’s politicization of the ‘intelligence community’ is very troubling. Every admin wishes they could do it, and several succeed, but this cohort is off to a flying start,” Fulton Armstrong, a former CIA analyst and national intelligence officer, wrote in an email. “It’s not an entirely new trick – books have been cooked for decades – but it’s now institutionalized and, as Tulsi’s behavior shows, encouraged.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS elections 2016Barack ObamaObama administrationHillary ClintonRussiaUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was “the biggest step forward for a young person’s experience online since the internet was created”.What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age checks on adult content be enforced?Read moreHe added: “I want to apologise to any kid who’s over 13 who has not had any of these protections, to parents who have strived and failed to keep their kids free from all this content because we have let them down.”Kyle said it “cannot be allowed to happen again” that urgent safety measures made necessary by technological advances should take seven years to come into force. He said a whole generation of children had been exposed to “torrid toxic material” because of the failure of politicians.Kyle is under pressure to go further in clamping down on social media use by children, and his department has been looking at curfews and time limits to help prevent addiction. Beeban Kidron,a crossbench peer and prominent internet safety campaigner, urged Kyle on Thursday to update the Online Safety Act to include measures tackling disinformation and the addictive nature of social media platforms.Kyle told Mumsnet he was looking at things that could be done “very rapidly” and called for “a national conversation about what a healthy childhood looks like online”. “We do it offline all the time. Parents set curfews and diet and exercise as part of the language and the vocabulary within families. We haven’t had that national debate about what health looks like and a healthy childhood looks like online yet,” he said.Justine Roberts, the founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, said the legislation would help stop children being exposed todamaging and inappropriate content online. But she said it must “only be the beginning” of changes to online safeguards for children, with teenagers spending 35 hours a week on smartphones at a cost to their mental health.“Big tech platforms still expose too many children to harm through addictive algorithms, and parents are deeply worried about the effects of social media on the still-developing brains of their children. The government must go further and faster to protect kids,” she said.Thelegislation means thatillegal content must be removed from platforms, such as suicide forums, and age has to be verified before content can be supplied to children to limit it to those 13 and over. X announced on Thursday that it would introduce age checking measures to prevent under-18s from accessing adult content, including pornography.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But please don’t take the phones [away from us] because also, there’s a lot of benefits to it,” he said.Asked whether he could raise the digital age of consent to 16, Kyle said that would be an easy thing to do if he concluded it was right.“The question for me is, what age should children be allowed to be online and have access to social media, rather than the digital age of consent,” he said. “I can pass the law, as I have, that says that no child under 13 should have access to social media, if you are having it from 13 up it has to be age appropriate from 13 up. So no child under 18 should have access to porn for example. No child under 13 should have violent misogyny coming into their feed. I don’t think digital age of consent would deliver the step-change that people think it would.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyChildrenYoung peopleInternetDigital mediaSocial mediaPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, his wife, Sky, denied rumors that he was in a coma, stating that his heart was “strong” after multiple operations.Instantly recognizable from his blonde horseshoe mustache and bandannas, Hogan was one of the most popular wrestling stars of the 1980s and considered one of the greatest of all time. Known for his ring theatrics and sizable physique–in his prime, Hogan clocked in at 6ft 7in and weighed 320lb (145kg) – he helped transform professional wrestling into home entertainment, primarily through his partnership with WorldwideWrestlingEntertainment (WWE) and the performance routine known as Hulkamania.The entertainment company confirmed Hogan’s death and mourned its former star in astatementon X: “WWE is saddened to learn WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan has passed away. One of pop culture’s most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan’s family, friends, and fans.”“The Hulkster” headlined WrestleMania, WWE’s signature event, eight times, including a seminal showdown in 1987 with his 520lb mentor Andre the Giant at Michigan’s Pontiac Silverdome, before a then record crowd of 93,173. Hogan won the WWE championship six times during his career.View image in fullscreenHulk Hogan in 2024.Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPAIn 1996, Hogan founded the New World Order (NWO) and became Hollywood Hulk Hogan. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, only to have his status revoked after scandal following the release of a secret recording of a sexual encounter, during which Hogan made numerous racist comments. The 2010s blog Gawker first published the recording; Hogan subsequently sued the website, winning and forcing it out of business.Hogan was once again inducted in 2020, as he became a more prominent figure in Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement. He starred at the 2024 Republican national convention, ripping off his shirt, WWE-style, to reveal a Trump 2024 T-shirt.Ever the performer, Hoganmaintained a decades-long acting career, appearing in the 1982 film Rocky III as the character Thunderlips, as well as films such as No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny, Santa With Muscles and the 1994 syndicated series Thunder in Paradise. As one of the most recognizable figures of the 1980s – at his peak, he was the most requested celebrity for the Make-a-Wish foundation – Hogan appeared as himself in many shows and movies, including the A-Team, Baywatch, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Spy Hard and Muppets From Space. He also lent his voice to episodes of Robot Chicken and American Dad!1:53Hulk Hogan, wrestling star and actor, dies aged 71 – video obituaryIn 1985, he co-hosted Saturday Night Live along with Mr T. The same year, he was the star of his own cartoon series on CBS, Hulk Hogan’s Rock ‘n’ Wrestling. Hogan parlayed his fame into reality television, starring on the VH1 reality show Hogan Knows Best along with his then wife Linda and his children Brooke and Nick, from 2005 until 2007.The Guardian has contacted Hogan’s representatives for comment.Tributes poured in on social media in the hours after his death, including from Maga political figures.“We lost a great friend today, the ‘Hulkster,’” Donald Trump, a longtime friend,postedon his official Truth Social account. “Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way – Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart. He gave an absolutely electric speech at the Republican National Convention, that was one of the highlights of the entire week. He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed!”JD Vance alsoposted a tribute on X: “Hulk Hogan was a great American icon. One of the first people I ever truly admired as a kid,” he wrote. “The last time I saw him we promised we’d get beers together next time we saw each other. The next time will have to be on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace.”“We all have fond memories of Hulk Hogan,”wroteMike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, on X, alongside two photos – one with Hogan, the other of Hogan arm-wrestling Trump. “From my childhood in the ‘80s, to campaigning with him last year, I always saw him as a giant in stature and in life. May he rest in peace.”Sylvester Stallone, Hogan’s co-star in Rocky III, saidvia Instagram: “I had the pleasure of meeting this brilliant personality and showman when he was 26 years old. He was absolutely wonderful and his amazing skill madeRockythree incredibly special. My heart breaks.”“I Am Absolutely Shocked To Hear About The Passing Of My Close Friend,” Hogan’s friend and fellow wrestling star Ric Flairpostedon X. “Hulk Has Been By My Side Since We Started In The Wrestling Business. An Incredible Athlete, Talent, Friend, And Father! Our Friendship Has Meant The World To Me.”And John Cena, who followed Hogan’s path from WWE star to Hollywood actor, simply posted a photo to hisInstagram accountof Hogan holding André the Giant’s head in one of their showdowns, appearing triumphant.Explore more on these topicsCultureUS televisionWrestling (Sport)Wrestling (Culture)TelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

It is really important frankly that people support our police rather than just attacking them continually.“As we have seen, Reform is one day calling for chief constables to resign, the next it is attacking women police officers who are out on our streets every single day of the week.”Farage has repeatedly weighed into the debate about the Epping migrant hotel and said this week: “Hard-left groups, Stand Up to Racism and Antifa, were given the red carpet treatment by Essex police, with the force literally escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest. They have been caught red-handed helping to light the fuse that led to violence.”Harrington said Reform’s claims were “categorically wrong” and that officers had organised a cordon around activists exercising their right to protest.Dal Babu, a former chief superintendent for the Metropolitan police, said Farage’s claims were wrong and he should correct the public record amid rising tensions.“British values mean if a politician makes a mistake, they put their hand up and acknowledge it. He knows it is false,” Babu said.On Thursday, Epping Forest district council unanimously voted to support a motion calling for the immediate closure of the Bell hotel for the purpose of asylum processing and for the “managed closure” of the Phoenix hotel. The vote was non-binding and purely symbolic.During the meeting Chris Whitbread, the leader of the council, reiterated that the local authority had no say on the use of the hotels and the decision was up to the Home Office, who he accused of “not being overly cooperative” when safeguarding concerns were raised.Hundreds of protesters, including many women and children, began marching from Epping town centre to the hotel at about 6pm in heavy rain. A ramped-up police operation included fences and a ban on the wearing of facial coverings.An 18-year-old man was arrested for breaching a section 60AA order, which prevents anyone wearing a face covering.Police have arrested 17 people in total over protests in Epping.Activists from the far-right Homeland group were behindan Epping Says No! Facebook group that has been behind much of the promotion of the protests. Members of Patriotic Alternative and White Vanguard have also been involved.While politicians have largely stayed away from the protest, two Reform councillors were present outside the Epping hotel last week, including James Regan who claimed in an interview that “they’re trying to dilute the Englishness out of us”.The Guardian also found evidence that a Reform official shared a platform in Epping with an agitator from Homeland.In last year’s summer riots, Keir Starmer, the prime minister, called out “far-right thuggery” and pledged to bring those involved to justice.However, the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said on Thursday that many of the Epping protesters were “upset for legitimate reasons”.Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, told the cabinet earlier this week that immigration and deprivation were among the main factors causing public disenchantment with politicians.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He denied the charge at Chelmsford magistrates court and will stand trial next month.A Reform official would not answer questions about sharing a platform with the far right or about Cooper’s claims that the party should back the police.Instead the spokesperson said the Guardian “cares more about attacking Reform UK than defending young girls who are being abused by illegal boat migrants”.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEssexYvette CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who works in security will also pick up on how they were standing. If you looked you could see they held their hands together to give a discreet thumbs up sign,” said the man, reluctant like so many other local people to go on the record, but who gave his name as “Steve Davis”.The only problem with this analysis was: it appeared to be entirely wrong.Essex police has “categorically” denied it bussed in antiracism protesters. The suggestion of state-sponsored “false flag” provocateurs – a frequent trope advanced on niche corners of social media at times of tensions on the streets – was also dismissed.The denials have often come too late to stop the conspiracies taking hold. They have been eagerly spread by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, and also carried on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.Disinformation has been one of the most alarming characteristics of the violent protests in Epping, whose focus has been the use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers.Local people have continued to turn out for the protests, which were sparked after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault – but far-right activists have played a key role in promoting them online. Activists from groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present.View image in fullscreenThe Bell hotel in Epping, used to house asylum seekers, has been a focus for the protests.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianOnline misinformation and disinformation originating on niche corners of X has been amplified – seemingly without attempt to corroborate whether it is true – by politicians such as Farage and commenters from the GB News channel.Video clips of Stand Up to Racism protesters being taken out of Epping last Thursday in police vans, after they were surrounded by groups of men who threw projectiles at them and the police, were quickly repurposed on social media – and presented as if they were images of protesters being transported from Epping station.In fact, as Essex police has confirmed, the Stand Up to Racism protesters had made their way on foot from the station earlier in the day, while police escorted them on foot to enable them to exercise a right to protest.By Friday, however, rightwing commenters such as the ex-GB News presenter Dan Wootton were also misrepresenting the footage. “They actually escorted people in police vans,” Wootton told the viewers of the online show he set up after leaving GB News.On Wednesday, Farage posted the same footage on X, saying: “This video proves [police] transported leftwing protesters to the Bell hotel in Epping” and calling for the resignation of the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington.The force issued a statement saying this was categorically untrue, while Harrington made pointed comments in a press conference where he urged commenters to be responsible for what they said online, adding that it had “real-world consequences”.Farage modulated his language after he was contacted on Wednesday, saying the police were “escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest”, but his original tweet remains on X.Later on Thursday, and in a tweet shortly after 10pm on Wednesday, Farage went on GB News to say he had received a call from a police officer who was in charge of the operation to say he was wrong. “If I was slightly out on accuracy I apologise but I think the gist of what I was saying was right,” he said.By then, however, the misinformation had spread like wildfire and done “real damage”, according to Lewis Nielsen of Stand Up to Racism.“It is a complete lie to say, as Farage has claimed, that Stand Up to Racism protesters were ‘bussed in’. We are mobilising antiracists, trade unionists, campaigners and faith groups against the far right in Epping,” he said.Yet more conspiracies – some outlandish, others more minor but corrosive – continue to circulate. They include unsubstantiated accusations that asylum seekers staying at the hotel are routinely shoplifting in Epping.Other claims – accompanied by pictures of the Stand Up to Racism protest – include one that Epping police has been paying protesters £40 “for three hours” work. It was among conspiracy theories being disseminated in online spaces including the Epping Says No! Facebook group, which has more than 1,600 members. Its administrators include activists from the far-right Homeland party, Adam Clegg and Callum Barker.The claims of undercover police officers being among the antiracism protesters have been accompanied by clips and pictures zeroing in on pictures of some of those protesters.The claims were also denied by Essex police, which has been trying to combat what it calls “myths” in videos fronted by an assistant chief constable. The force specifically picked out the claim that there were “police decoys in the crowd encouraging violence”, rebutting it on its YouTube channel.Nielsen also denied the claim: “It is categorically false that the police are involved in Stand Up to Racism protests, or play any role in organising them. If anything our protests – like others – have faced police repression in recent years.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsanalysisShareReuse this content"

You spend years – sometimes even decades – curating a reputation as a happy go lucky, physically anonymous everyman. ThenMarvelcomes knocking, and you realise that you might have to share a scene with Chris Hemsworth, and next to him you’re going to look like a weedy twig-worm hybrid. The next thing you know, you’re all over the internet, greased up and flexing. Which is a very long way of saying: Borat’s got abs now.Sacha Baron Cohen isthis month’s Men’s Fitness magazine cover model. His pecs are popping. His biceps are bulging. His forearms look like a sack of live snakes. His pants are, conservatively, two and half inches lower than they really should be. His entire torso looks like it’s been rolled around in margarine. He is, to use his own words, “hard launching my mid-life crisis”.View image in fullscreenBorat’s got abs now … Sacha Baron Cohen on the August issue of Men’s Fitness.Photograph: Simon Needham/mensfitness.co.ukAnd this is all because of Marvel.Sacha Baron Cohenstars in the Disney+ TV show Ironheart as Mephisto. Which might be news to a lot of you, since Ironheart was released right at the moment that superhero fatigue hit such terminal velocity that president of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige essentially chose to promote the Fantastic Four movie by promising everyone that he wasn’t going to make as many TV shows any more. But, really, that’s beside the point.Because, of all the shredded topless comic actor torso reveals, the only one to go on to any substantial screen time was Chris Pratt. It has now been 12 years since hetook his top off for Instagramto show his transformation from “the schlubby one from Parks and Recreation” to “man with abdominal muscles”, and he has since been in six MCU films, a Christmas special and several other projects that relied on him looking ripped.Contrast that with Kumail Nanjiani, who went from a round-faced, Oscar-nominated writer in 2017 to looking like avacuum-sealed walnut bag in 2019. And this because he had been cast in The Eternals, in which he effectively had a bit part as one of about 300 new superheroes. Aside from a voice acting gig in one episode of What If…?, that has been the sum total of his MCU output.Which is still a ton compared to Sacha Baron Cohen, whose Mephisto appeared fully clothed in just one episode of a television show that has left no cultural footprint whatsoever. The point is that, while a Marvel gig might ostensibly be the impetus to start pumping iron, it isn’t necessarily the end goal. For all anyone knows, we may never see Mephisto again. But the image of Cohen clutching a pair of dumbbells while being covered in more goose fat than a cross-channel swimmer will live for ever.View image in fullscreenSacha Baron Cohen in Men’s Fitness.Photograph: Simon Needham/mensfitness.co.ukEspecially since his earlier career relied upon him showing off as much of his body as he could. Go back and look at photos of him in a mankini as Borat, and you’ll see what a change this is. That said, despite being leaner and better defined now, those pictures demonstrate that the most effective element in his transformation may well have been a comprehensive chest wax.Still, let’s allow him this moment. If nothing else, Cohen is being neatly self-deprecating about how he looks on Instagram, quipping: “Some celebs use Ozempic and some use private chefs, others use personal trainers. I did all three,” and “This is not AI. I really am egotistical enough to do this.” And if it means that he’s moving away from comedy – there’s no way that Borat can ever wear another mankini unless he’s going to aggressively rebrand himself as a thirsty divorcee – then so be it. Between Ironheart and last year’s Disclosure, it seems like that’s where he was headed anyway.Besides, this reveal puts Sacha Baron Cohen one step closer to the next chapter in the MCU playbook: complaining about how horrible it is to look like this. Chris Pratt did it, claiming that he had to drink so much water that his life became a“nightmare”. Kumail Nanjiani did it,making a colossal show of getting to eat some cakelike a normal person. And so it will inevitably be with Sacha Baron Cohen. That is, unless Mephisto becomes a central part of the MCU in the future. If that’s the case, the brand sponsorship with Veet must be just around the corner.Explore more on these topicsFilmSacha Baron CohenMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

No matter how far we’ve gone, there’s a constant stream of demands for snacks, games, entertainment, stories, songs … the list goes on.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Every summer, we travel to the Lake District, a seven-hour drive. And we regularly holiday in France, which involves long train, ferry and car journeys, so my husband and I have become skilled at managing these.Keeping all ages happy – including my mum who often comes too – is by no means an easy task. Throw in delays, hot weather and travel sickness and it’s not just the kids having tantrums. So, here are my tips for surviving long trips for all ages, including those from other seasoned travellers and experts.How to survive long family journeysAudiobooksMy eldest daughter has used a Yoto –a small portable stereo with story cards– for years and loves it. They’re great with headphones, but you can play the cards from the car stereo too.

A total of 252 Venezuelan nationals were repatriated in the last week in a deal between the US and Venezuelan governments, with many able to reunite with family after their ordeal in El Salvador.Carlos Uzcátegui tightly hugged his sobbing wife and stepdaughter on Wednesday morning in westernVenezuelaafter he had been away for a year.Uzcátegui was among the migrants being reunited with loved ones after four months in prison in El Salvador, where the US government had transferred them without due process, sparking uproar among critics of Donald Trump’sharsh anti-immigration agenda. The US had accused all the men, on sometimes apparently flimsy evidence, of being members of a foreign gang living in the US illegally.Denied, detained, deported: the faces of Trump’s immigration crackdownRead more“Every day, we asked God for the blessing of freeing us from there so that we could be here with family, with my loved ones,” Uzcátegui, 33, said. “Every day, I woke up looking at the bars, wishing I wasn’t there.“They beat us, they kicked us. I even have quite a few bruises on my stomach,” he added before later showing a bruised left abdomen.The migrants were freed last Friday in a prisoner swap between the US andVenezuela.Arturo Suárez, whose reggaeton songs surfaced on social media after he was sent to El Salvador, arrived at his family’s home in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, on Tuesday. His sister hugged him after he emerged from a vehicle belonging to the country’s intelligence service.“It is hell. We met a lot of innocent people,” Suárez told reporters, referring to the prison he was held in. “To all those who mistreated us, to all those who negotiated with our lives and our freedom, I have one thing to say, and scripture says it well: vengeance and justice is mine, and you are going to give an account to God [the] Father.”Venezuela’s president,Nicolás Maduro, and other officials have said many of the immigrants were physically and psychologicallytorturedduring their detention in El Salvador, airing on state television videos of some of the men describing the alleged abuse, including rape, severe beatings and pellet-gun wounds. The narratives are reminiscent of the abuses that Maduro’s government has long been accused of committing against its real or perceived, jailed opponents.As the men reached their homes, they and their relatives shared deeply emotional moments.Uzcátegui’s wife, Gabriela Mora, 30, held on to their home’s fence and sobbed as she saw the military vehicle carrying him approach after a 30-plus-hour bus ride to their mining community nestled in Venezuela’s Andean mountains.The 252 men ended up in El Salvador on 16 March after the Trump administration agreed to pay $6m to the Central American country to house them in a mega-prison, where human rights groups have documented hundreds of deaths and cases of torture. Trump accused the men of belonging to theviolent Tren de Aragua street gang, which originated in Venezuela.The interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, last Friday said only seven of the men had pending cases in Venezuela, adding that all the deportees would undergo medical tests and background checks before they could go home.The Associated Press could not verify the abuse allegations that Suárez and other migrants narrated in video interviews aired by state media.Venezuela’s attorney general, Tarek William Saab, on Monday said he had opened an investigation against El Salvador’s PresidentNayib Bukelebased on the deportees’ allegations. Bukele’s office did not respond to requests for comment.Mora said her husband migrated after the coalmine where he had long worked halved his pay and their street food shop went out of business in 2023. Uzcátegui left Lobatera in March 2024 with an acquaintance’s promise to help him find a construction job in Orlando.On his way north, Uzcátegui crossed the punishingDarién Gapthat separates Colombia and Panama, and by mid-April he had reached Mexico City. There, he worked at a public market’s seafood stall until early December, when he was finally granted an appointment through a US government smartphone app to seek asylum at a border crossing.Upon beginning his second term in the White House, in January, Trump cancelled the app system brought in under his predecessor, Joe Biden. Regardless, Uzcátegui never walked free in the US, where authorities regarded his tattoos with suspicion, Mora said. He was sent to a detention center in Texas until he and other Venezuelans were put on the planes that landed inEl Salvador. Still, she said she did not regret supporting her husband’s decision to migrate.“It’s the country’s situation that forces one to make these decisions,” she said. “If [economic] conditions here were favorable … it wouldn’t have been necessary for him to leave to be able to fix the house or to provide my daughter with a better education.”For another man, Julio González Jr, he had believed he was being deported back to his native Venezuela when he was put on a flight in Texas in March. The 36-year-old, who worked cleaning offices and painting houses, had consented to his removal. But when the plane touched down, he realized he was in El Salvador.González and two other detainees toldthe Washington Postthat when shackled passengers resisted disembarking, chaos erupted. “We were yanked by our feet, beaten and shoved off board,” González said, recalling how the crew on the plane began to weep during the ordeal.The group was herded on to a bus and taken to a concrete compound, where they were forced to kneel with their heads pressed to the floor.“Welcome to El Salvador, you sons of bitches,” a masked guard reportedly said to them, the Post reported. They had arrived at the infamous Terrorism Confinement Center (Cecot).While held at Cecot for four months, González and others described being assaulted regularly with wooden bats. He said he was stripped of thousands of dollars, barred from calling family, and denied legal representation. This week, he was able to reunite with his family.Meanwhile,Andry José Hernández Romero, a gay makeup artist who had been deported to Cecot under an obscure wartime law invoked by the Trump administration, was among those released.Romero had entered the US legally through the CBP One app last summer, seeking asylum, but eventually was detained and removed to El Salvador with the others.The Immigrant Defenders Law Center, based in Los Angeles, is now appealing Romero’s case, according to ABC, asserting that he was denied his legal right to seek asylum.Romero broke down in tears when he was finally reunited with his parents in Venezuela on Wednesday, reportedABC News 10.“His entire town was waiting for him, preparing a meal,” said Melissa Shepard, legal services director at the California non-profit.Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationTrump administrationUS politicsVenezuelaEl SalvadornewsShareReuse this content"

In 2013, more than 100 countries signed up to theMinamata convention, committing to restrict its production, export and use, and phase it out altogether.Yet while Latin American countries claim to have ended production of the toxic element and controlled its movement across borders, they have simply driven the trade underground.A new reportfrom theEnvironmental Investigation Agency (EIA)has found that mercury production is “out of control” in Mexico – the world’s second largest producer – driven by high gold prices and cartel involvement.Through illicit networks, mercury is being smuggled into South American countries includingColombia,BoliviaandPeru. There, it fuels agold rush in the Amazon, contaminating rivers, soil and air, and causing severe environmental and social damage.View image in fullscreenAn illegal mining camp surrounding Indigenous Yanomami protected territory in Roraima state, Brazil. February 2023. Authorities estimated at least 15,000 people illegally invaded the reservation.Photograph: Alan Chaves/AFP/Getty ImagesWithgold prices at record highs, the mercury trade has become so lucrative that one of Mexico’s deadliest cartels has entered the business. Traffickers are smuggling the substance abroad, into tropical forests in large quantities.“It is absurd that mercury is one of the 10 most toxic substances in the world – yet smugglers are shipping tonnes of it out of major ports without detection just by hiding it in gravel,” says Adam Dolezal, investigations coordinator at the EIA.Over the past decade, illegal mining has soared, creating an environmental crisis. Mounting evidence of a public health catastrophe has led world leaders to agree on phasing out mercury production and banning its export for goldmining.Mexican documents sent to the UNreported a decline in domestic mercury productionfrom 442 tonnes in 2018 to zero in 2020, when the last mines were shut down. But EIA undercover investigators tracked 200 tonnes of mercury from the rainforests of the Amazon, thousands of miles away, to the dusty hills of northern Querétaro between 2019 and 2025.The EIA team identified at least 19 active mines in Querétaro, producing 100 tonnes a year, with no health, safety or environmental oversight. Investigators discovered that the illegal industry not only polluted rainforests but also one of Mexico’s most biodiverse regions: the Sierra Gorda biosphere reserve.View image in fullscreenA gold prospector handles mercury – one of the 10 most toxic substances in the world.Photograph: Graeme Wallace/Alamy“It’s a Unesco-protected site that is home to a third of the country’s butterfly species, yet mining is daily, largely unregulated, and contaminating rivers used by at least 17 downstream communities. Some soils have mercury levels up to 150 times the safe limit,” Dolezal says.By conservative estimates, mercury from these mines could have produced up to $8bn (£6bn) in illegal gold, and has attracted the attention of Mexican cartels, according to the report. Although the full extent of cartel involvement is unclear, the message to investigators was obvious.“The Jalisco New Generation cartel exerts a high degree of control in some of the mines,” Dolezal says. “Our team documented armed control points, surveillance towers and threats of violence. Cartel involvement has industrialised production and in some mines, where mercury is not processed on-site, ore is trucked out in bulk under cartel control.”The investigation led to the seizure of a five-tonne shipment of mercury hidden in gravel bags at the Peruvian port of Callao – the largest ever confiscated in an Amazonian country. The haul revealed the scale of the trade and how easily criminal networks move the toxic chemical abroad.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s very worryingDario Kopenawa Yanomami, Indigenous leaderAuthorities, often more focused on halting the flow of cocaine through Latin America, would probably not have detected the illegal mercury shipment without the EIA tip, says Luis E Fernández, executive director of the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation(Cincia), which joined the operation.Once across the border, criminal organisations extract the mercury from rock before sending it to the Amazon. In Colombia, the business is controlled by the same armed groups that run gold trafficking.Unlike deforestation, which leaves visible scars, mercury pollution is invisible. Starting as a grey sludge, it travels undetected for hundreds of kilometres in rivers. Indigenous groups, including the Yanomami in Brazil, suspect the toxin has disrupted the rainforest’s balance.View image in fullscreenA captured river dolphin has samples taken by experts to test for mercury contamination during an expedition in Colombia.Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty ImagesTheir first warning was dead fish washing up, threatening their food supply. Later, they noticed an increase in the number of babies born with missing limbs and developmental problems. Now, they realise they are victims of vast mercury dumping into their rivers.“We don’t know the full effect, but we know there is no cure,” says Dario Kopenawa Yanomami. “Experts have already told us the mercury will remain in the water and soil for at least 10 years. It’s very worrying.”‘Scratch the earth, there’s gold!’: Small miners, big firms and armed gangs fight over Peru’s mineral wealthRead moreIllegal mining in the Amazon has risen by50% in six years (between 2018 and 2024), and experts consider its impact devastating for the world’s most biodiverse ecosystems.A study in Yanomami territoryfound that local communities are highly exposed to mercury through fish consumption, according to safety levels established by theWorld Health Organization.These communities rely on fish as their primary source of protein. Although species low on the food chain may contain traces of the toxin, predators that eat hundreds or thousands of fish annually concentrate it at dangerous levels.The toxic metal is especially harmful to children, causing neurological disorders, learning disabilities, and visual and motor problems. The same study found mercury present hundreds of kilometres upstream from the mines, suggesting even isolated groups are being poisoned.View image in fullscreenAn Indigenous woman collects ants to eat in Yanomami territory, Roraima state, Brazil, where three-quarters of fish tested had mercury at dangerous levels.Photograph: Ueslei Marcelino/Reuters“Illegal goldmining is one of the greatest evils that afflict riverside communities and Indigenous populations in South America,” says Antenor Vaz, a specialist at an Indigenous people’s rights group, who was not involved in the report. “The indiscriminate use of liquid mercury contaminates numerous waterways, the food chain from these waters and all the populations that depend on this source of food and water.”Unless Latin American countries take the international mercury trade seriously, it will not stop, the report’s authors say. They call on Mexican authorities to regain control of Querétaro’s mines from organised crime and shut them down, and urge greater information sharing, the use of artificial intelligence to combat smuggling and the closing of loopholes in the Minamata convention.“The silence or absence of states in fighting these crimes does not mean neutrality,” Vaz says. “It means complicity.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanMiningGoldMexicoAmazon rainforestAmericasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We met in a hotel on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, where he proceeded to drink gallons of Diet Coke, and take the piss out of himself. He was the least pretentious rock star I ever met, and during my decade in the industry, I met hundreds.By the time I met Ozzy, I’d had enough of music journalism. I decided he should be my final interview because how do you beat that? I’d interviewed everyone I’d ever wanted to, including Nirvana, so it made sense to end my music journalism career by chatting with Ozzy.View image in fullscreenLiz Evans and Ozzy Osbourne in 1997.Photograph: Guardian CommunityOzzy was so self-effacing and hilarious. He told me about becoming partially deaf while working in a factory testing car horns, how he’d thought Spinal Tap was a documentary aboutBlack Sabbath, and how the band named themselves after a horror movie for a joke. He was already shaking back then, and seemed very small and frail, but he had this gorgeous twinkling quality, which I certainly hadn’t expected to encounter in the Prince of Darkness. And he clearly couldn’t do a thing without Sharon, which he was more than happy to admit.Liz Evans, Tasmania, Australia‘More energy than the younger bands put together’My first ever gig was Ozzfest 2002 at Donington. I was so excited, I dyed my hair black and carried a wallet chain thick enough to tie up a ship. When I arrived, a guy in a top hat with a voice like the devil said I’d be “lucky if I made it out alive”. I’d largely wanted to go because of System of a Down. But Ozzy was the show stealer. I’d become familiar with him due to the The Osbournes, then got into Black Sabbath. There was no other performer like him over the weekend. This – what I thought at the time – old guy had more energy than the younger bands put together. Needless to say, I was hooked on metal from that point onwards. Because of that festival so many bands got their big breaks. He not only invented metal with Sabbath but continued to support the genre the rest of his days.James, Cambridge‘We gatecrashed a hotel bar to meet him’View image in fullscreenNick Payne and Ozzy Osbourne in 1981.Photograph: Guardian CommunityI was a fairly obsessive heavy rock fan in my teens, and first saw Ozzy live when I was 16 at a one-day heavy metal festival at Port Vale’s football ground in Stoke-on-Trent in 1981, alongside a few other bands including Motörhead. A couple of years later I was at university in Sheffield, and saw him for a second time at the City Hall. Afterwards, a friend and I got tipped off about which hotel the band were staying in, so we gatecrashed the residents-only bar and ended up spending an hour or two in the company of Ozzy, Sharon, and the rest of the band. He was an absolute gentleman, happily putting up with a bunch of geeky 18-year-old fans asking him loads of questions, and he insisted on buying multiple rounds of drinks for everyone in the bar. Before we departed he also decided to sign our foreheads “Ozzy was here” with a Sharpie, as per the photo – earning us a huge amount of credibility when we finally got back to our hall of residence. What an absolute legend of a man – definitely one of a kind.Nick Payne, St Albans‘Like sitting with a mate’s older brother, shooting the breeze’As teenagers in the early 1980s we all used to go to venues early and hang around the loading areas and back-stage entrances, on the off-chance of picking up an autograph or seeing a rock star. We did so during the Blizzard of Ozz tour, which were his first UK appearances since being sacked from Sabbath. We got there very early, around 2pm, and turned the corner to find guitarist Randy Rhoads and Ozzy himself, sat quietly having a cup of tea. We gathered tentatively and joined him.Rhoads and Ozzy gave off an air of openness and gentle bonhomie. This wasn’t the Prince of Darkness, but a slightly apprehensive man who was hoping that the fans would accept his new musical incarnation. He was humble, communicative and very patient. It was like sitting with a mate’s older brother, shooting the breeze for 20 minutes. After he and Randy went back in to sound check, we all remained stunned for a few moments. We’d had a cup of tea with the Prince of Darkness, and it turned out he was a really nice bloke. It’s a real shame that successive generations only know him as the sometimes incoherent, grumpy old man of the TV show, The Osbournes. As in his heyday, he was the funniest and most disarming of all of the 1980s rock gods.Van Norris, Hampshire‘I’m still agog at how good he was’I was lucky enough to see Black Sabbath at Download festival in 2012. Ozzy was already a huge legend but hadn’t done a show in a while and we went genuinely thinking that it may be the last chance to see him. When he wobbled out on to the stage, clearly a bit frail, I was worried. Oh no, I thought, this is a cash grab and he’s really not up to it anymore ... but then he opened his mouth, and wow. His voice was still all there – it was like listening to him in his heyday. I’m still agog at how good he was. And he was clearly enjoying himself immensely. We’ve lost a great.Coral Pearce-Mariner, Norfolk‘We had a snowball fight’In February 1972, during the Master of Reality tour, my father was due to pick me and my mates up after the gig at De Montfort Hall in Leicester, but was delayed by the bad weather. We hung round the back stage door and eventually the band came out. We spoke to all of them but it was Ozzy and Bill who gave us the most time. Ozzy threw the first snowball at us. We then had an amazing snowball fight with Ozzy and Bill which seemed to go on for ages. Ozzy, laughing and out of breath, thanked us for the fight and left with Bill covered in snow. For four kids from a small rural town it was magical. The gig was incredible.Gazza, LeicesterView image in fullscreenTony Iommi, Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward in Black Sabbath’s early days.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/Alamy‘They didn’t have top billing in 1969, but they were the best band on stage that day’I saw Ozzy when I was 17, at one of the very first gigs they played as Black Sabbath, at a mini festival organised by the Midlands Arts Centre for Young People in Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham, on bank holiday Monday, 1 September 1969. They’d originally been billed as Earth, but by the time they went on stage, they had become Black Sabbath. Rumours abounded that they had played at a school dance at the Convent of the Holy Child Jesus school in Edgbaston, where they had performed with a huge inverted crucifix on the stage behind them, much to the outrage of the nuns who ran the school. Because we knew most of the security crew at the festival, we watched them from backstage. Though they didn’t have top billing, it was clear even then that they were the best band on stage that day, and that Ozzy had incredible charisma.That autumn, before they became nationally famous, I remember they occasionally used to turn up in the coffee bar at the arts centre where I and my friends hung out. Did I ever dare to speak to the Prince of Darkness? I doubt it, but he might once have asked me for a light ... When their first album came out the following year, I decided to model my own look on the spooky proto-Goth lady, dressed all in black, on the front cover. To my mind, that’s still their best album, and I have it still; it sums up for me the cusp between the 60s and the 70s, and the awkward but euphoric liminal space between my adolescence and adulthood.Jenni Mills, Wiltshire‘He looked like he was having the time of his life at Back to the Beginning’The importance and significance of both Ozzy and Sabbath only truly sunk into my brain during the Back to the Beginning gig on 5 July, which I saw on live stream. It was a wonderful day seeing so many of my favourite bands pay tribute. The nail was finally hit on the head seeing Ozzy at the end. Some members of the crowd were in tears to see him performing well despite his physical deterioration. I wasn’t sad for him at all – he looked like he was having the time of his life. I’ve also seen plenty of Ozzy live and am blown away by his stage persona.

Team America: World Police (2004)Trey Parker’s extraordinary puppet comedymay find its spoof status in dispute – perhaps because it spoofs more than one thing at a time: it spoofs action adventures and superhero combos as well as satirising gung-ho American nationalism and exceptionalism. Team America epitomises the belief that the US can and should get involved all over the world by kicking the ass of foreign people. Does it deserve a place on a spoof list? Fuck yeah!19. High Anxiety (1977)View image in fullscreenHomage to Hitchcock … High Anxiety.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyPerhaps it is strange that a full-dress spoof of Alfred Hitchcock took so long to arrive – it could be that the master’s own playful and self-aware sense of humour preempted it. But here is Mel Brooks’s send-up of Hitchcock’s psychological suspense thrillers, with Brooks as Dr Richard Thorndyke, the psychoanalyst neurotically afflicted with a fear of heights who somehow always finds himself in dangerous situations in which he is going to fall to his death. A sturdily impassive supporting cast includes Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn and a cameo for Brooks’s co-writer Barry Levinson.18. OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)There have been so many spy spoofs and Bond send-up movies: Johnny English, Austin Powers and the first (non-canonical) Casino Royale from 1967 with David Niven as Bond. So, given that only one will have to stand for them all, here is Michel Hazanavicius’s very closely observed and very funny spy spoof, riffing on the Bondian French agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, created by French author Jean Bruce in the late 1940s – starring the excellent Jean Dujardin as the suavely handsome daredevil with a touch of Clouseau-esque incompetence.17. I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988)View image in fullscreenSelf-referential comedy … I’m Gonna Git You Sucka.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyIn what may come to be seen as the golden age of 80s spoofs, Keenen Ivory Wayans produced his blaxploitation spoof, with the pedantically overextended title signalling its status as self-referential comedy. Wayans casts plenty of genuine titans of the blaxploitation world, including Antonio Fargas, Jim Brown, Isaac Hayes and Bernie Casey – riffing knowingly on the fact that black sports stars often graduated to the movies, although OJ Simpson was to appear in quite another spoof: the Naked Gun series.16. Duplicate Sholay (2002)Kanti Shah’s spoof version of the revered Bollywood action-adventure Sholay from 1975 – widely regarded as one of the greatest Indian films of all time – was cheeky and, to some, even a bit sacrilegious. The film uses lookalike casting and madly inflates the already grandiose plot, which involved a retired cop hiring two criminals to bring down a ruthless kingpin. This parody version rounds up a whole crew of reprobates.15. Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)View image in fullscreenTruly a spoof? Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Photograph: Python/AllstarIn any discussion of spoofs, there will always be debate about whether a certain film really counts as a spoof. When Python’s Life of Brian first came out and was threatened with censorship by the religious right, the spoof argument was deployed in its defence – ie it’s not an offensive attack on Christianity, it’s a spoof of religious Hollywood epics. That’s sort of true: the movie, starring Graham Chapman as the dozy bloke Brian Cohen who is mistaken for the Messiah in the time of Christ, used the locations and sets of Franco Zeffirelli’s TV extravaganza Jesus of Nazareth, and its generic resemblance was part of what made it funny.14. Scary Movie (2000)View image in fullscreenA single absurdist meme … Scary Movie.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyThe Scary Movie franchise and the comparably self-aware if not out-and-out spoofy Scream series were a big part of the mainstream horror revival at the beginning of the 00s. Wayans, with his habitual pile-’em-high attitude to gags, gives us references to Friday the 13th, Halloween, I Know What You Did Last Summer and many more. He cheekily plays up the genre’s trope of attractive young teen victims somehow always put themselves in harm’s way, epitomised by the demon in the Ghostface mask standing between two road signs pointing helpfully in different directions, SAFETY and DEATH, boiling down the slasher plot form to a single absurdist meme.13. Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982)A connoisseur spoof of 1940s noir detective stories, starring Steve Martin as the tough private investigator, directed and co-written by Carl Reiner, shot in black-and-white by Michael Chapman (who also shot Raging Bull) and accessorised with a gorgeously authentic musical score by Miklós Rózsa and costumes by Edith Head. Martin’s character effectively speaks to the ghosts of the past as clips of old movies are intercut into the action, featuring the likes of Bogart, Cagney and Veronica Lake. Is that cheating in spoof terms? Maybe. But this is very well observed.12. Catholic High School Girls in Trouble from The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)The porn spoof is a genre that is mostly under the radar and under the counter – the porn industry itself regularly produces porn-spoof versions of mainstream films (Shaving Ryan’s Privates, Everyone I Did Last Summer, For Your Thighs Only, etc), but that is a matter of porn spoofing the respectable films. For the other way around, there is possibly the (woefully unfunny) Carry On Emmannuelle, but more amusing and gleefully crass is the brief sketch in John Landis’s The Kentucky Fried Movie – a spoof of porn and a spoof of trailers. It’s a coming attraction taster for the shocking new adult film Catholic High School Girls In Trouble: “Never before has the beauty of the sexual act been so crassly exploited!”11. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988)View image in fullscreenAbsurd comedy … the original Naked Gun.Photograph: United Archives/AlamyHere is the original sequel-spawning Naked Gun, imminently to be revived with Liam Neeson playing the tough, stern detective: a movie spun off from the original Police Squad! TV comedy, which spoofed 60s TV cop shows such as The FBI. In fact, the original spoof targets of Naked Gun are so dim and distant in the pop culture collective memory that Naked Gun has its own kind of originality.Leslie Nielsen(carrying on from his brow-furrowing turn in the classic Airplane!) once again sent up the boilerplate heroic persona that he used to portray quite seriously, playing Det Lt Frank Drebin, and that rich baritone voice was vital to the absurd comedy.10. Bugsy Malone (1976)Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone was a movie-musical that spoofed the Prohibition-era Warner Bros gangster-crime genre by simply casting the film’s tough guys as children who hit each other with custard pies instead of shooting guns. However, Jodie Foster, appearing here in the same year as Taxi Driver, was so precocious that she was considered an honorary adult in an entirely different league from the innocent kids in the rest of the film. (The idea was not entirely original: the 1905 silent The Little Train Robbery spoofed The Great Train Robbery of 1903 by using children and a miniature railway set.)9. Clueless (1995)Amy Heckerling’s 90s masterpiece achieved a kind of double spoof: the story of high-school princess Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone, spoofed the form and content of teen movies by virtue of being elegantly modelled on a classic of English literature – Jane Austen’s Emma. (Gil Junger’s 10 Things I Hate About You did the same thing with Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew.) But, by the same token, it also slyly spoofed the generic mannerisms of Austen, and did so with loving admiration.8. Black Dynamite (2009)View image in fullscreenUproarious bad taste … Black Dynamite.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyScott Sanders’s blaxploitation spoof boasts a stream of outrageous gags, uproarious bad taste and strict attention to detail. It stars his formidable co-writer, the martial arts action lead Michael Jai White as Black Dynamite, who swears to avenge his dead brother and takes aim at the complicit white establishment in Washington DC and the “Honky House”. Sanders lovingly reproduces the paradoxically old-fashioned imperatives of blaxploitation, masculinity and heroism, which were being affirmed at a time when the white American new wave was undermining them.7. Hellzapoppin’ (1941)This is a screwball self-aware comedy, a crazy madcap romp that its ever-increasing number of fans believe is touched by genius. Originally a Broadway show, it’s a spoof of Broadway romances such as Gold Diggers of Broadway and The Great Ziegfeld. But it’s also a spoof of cinema and of musical theatre as represented in cinema, and of showbiz generally: the forms, the conventions and the grammar of all these are lovingly foregrounded. Actors Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson (from the original show) play themselves in the midst of a chaotic swirl of misadventures concerning whether or not a certain stage show can work in the world of motion pictures.6. They Came Together (2014)David Wain is a film-maker who spoofed sex comedies in his Wet Hot American Summer of 2001. But this is surely his masterpiece: a devastatingly realistic, rigorously maintained spoof of a mainstream romantic comedy, played with absolute conviction by Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler, with the New York locations, cinematography, production design and supporting cast that would be in the real thing. Rudd and Poehler are the couple who come together in the big city (which is itself a character in the movie, as in any self-respecting romcom), and the film takes us through a complete story, while always making us aware that it isn’t a “real” romcom – the effect is fascinating, amusing … and even slightly scary.5. Blazing Saddles (1974)Mel Brooks’s outrageous spoof westernwas, in one respect, very unlike the classic westerns it was sending up: it had a black man in the leading role. Cleavon Little is the railway worker Bart, who is promoted to sheriff by corrupt and cynical forces who expect him to fail (and so Blazing Saddles is not unlike Brooks’s The Producers). But Bart finds himself teaming up with boozy gunfighter The Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder, a tough guy who is, of course, on the point of redemption in the classic manner. There are some sophisticated fourth-wall-breaking gags and very unsophisticated farting jokes.4. Far From Heaven (2002)View image in fullscreenSpoof or homage? Far From Heaven.Photograph: Usa Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarDo spoof films have to generate comedy? And if their object is more serious, does that mean they need the posher title of homage? Todd Haynes’s romantic drama Far From Heaven is a spoof of Douglas Sirk pictures such as All That Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life: films about the passionate inner lives of women in 40s and 50s America. But Far From Heaven is much more explicit on the subject of race, racism and gay sexuality than Sirk could allow himself to be – Julianne Moore is superb as the prim and proper housewife whose husband (Dennis Quaid) has a secret gay existence, and she falls in love with a black man, played with Poitier-esque dignity by Dennis Haysbert.3. Young Frankenstein (1974)For some, this is Brooks’s greatest spoof, and possibly anyone’s greatest spoof: a lovingly detailed recreation in luminous black and white of James Whale’s original Boris Karloff-starring Frankenstein from 1931, pastiching the Gothic romance tradition of classic horror from the forested dark lands of central Europe and using some of the original film’s props. Cobbling together a recognisable human from disparate body parts – is that an allegory for spoof itself? Gene Wilder is the troubled neurophysiologist Dr Frederick Frankenstein, who realises that it is his terrible destiny to recreate the experiments of his disgraced grandfather Victor Frankenstein, creating a monster played by Peter Boyle.2. This Is Spın̈al Tap (1984)Rob Reiner’s brilliant comedy spoofed the vainglorious and Brit-heavy rockumentary genre like Zep’s The Song Remains the Same, but with superb incidental detail and observational flair that went beyond those films. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer are Nigel Tufnel, David St Hubbins and Derek Smalls of the legendary but failing heavy rock colossus Spın̈al Tap, here shown on an ill-fated comeback tour. Tap more or less spearheaded mockumentary comedy, cringe comedy and embarrassment comedy – later revived by Ricky Gervais and Steve Carell.1. Airplane! (1980)View image in fullscreenPure spoof nirvana … Airplane!Photograph: Paramount/AllstarIt had to be. This is the highest plane (as it were) of pure spoof nirvana, marrying original gags to strictly observed satire and an unflinchingly deadpan delivery, symbolised by its most famous joke: “Surely you can’t be serious?” (You know the punchline, which brilliantly and economically enacts the repudiation of seriousness). The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker masterpiece is a brilliant, vibrant parody of the airline disaster genre, spoofing the Airport movies generally and anticipating Robert Zemeckis’s later plane crash films like Cast Away and Flight. But it was in fact modelled with amazing closeness on one specific film: Zero Hour! from 1957 (by Arthur Hailey, who went on to write the Airport films), a melodrama that now cannot be watched except through a glaze of delirious disbelief. It was a masterstroke of Abrahams and the Zuckers to get veteran actorLeslie Nielsento play the heroic lead in exactly the same straight-faced, resonant way as he would have if he was in the original – and the same goes for troupers such as Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges and Peter “Mission: Impossible” Graves. Genius.This article was amended on 24 July 2025 to remove a reference to Sanjay Dutt, who did not star in Sholay.Explore more on these topicsRankedSpinal TapThis Is Spinal TapAirplane!Mel BrooksLeslie NielsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

This government inherited a situation in which too many staff were burnt out, demoralised and simply done in.It’s why one of my first acts as health and social care secretary was to get round the table, end the last resident doctor strikes and provide above inflation pay rises for all NHS staff, including a 22.3% rise for resident doctors (plus another 5.4% this year) – the biggest pay hike across the whole public sector.Since then, I’ve worked closely with NHS staff to deliver record investment and much-needed reforms to the NHS. From getting waiting lists down to hiring 2,000 more GPs, from bringing in new tech and equipment to making staff’s lives easier, to starting the shift from sickness to prevention – we are making real progress.When the prime minister launched our10-year health planearlier this month, NHS staff celebrated it. I knew from the hundreds of staff that were part of our engagement process – from doctors to nurses, health visitors to consultants, porters to midwives – that they were hungry for change. But their optimism, energy and ambition showed just how much we will be able to achieve if we work together, and the exciting future we can build.That is why the decision by theBritish Medical Association’s resident doctors committeeto rush into completely unnecessary strikes is so bitterly disappointing. Not only have we started turning the NHS around, we did it hand-in-hand.The government proposed a range of measures to massively improve the working conditions doctors face – from tackling the costs of mandatory exams, to dealing with exhausting rotations that involve doctors pinging from hospital to hospital, to tackling bottlenecks by bringing in more specialist training places.There was a deal here to be done. Instead, the BMA leadership’s decision to not even consider postponing these strikes will place an enormous burden on their colleagues, and hit the recovery we can all see our health service is making. Not only that, it enormously undermines the entire trade union movement. No trade union in British history has seen its members receive such a steep pay rise only to immediately respond with strikes – even when a majority of their members didn’t even vote to strike. This action is unprecedented, and it is unreasonable.My focus now is on doing everything to minimise harm to patients.This government is doing all it can to minimise the impact on patients from this strike, including trying to keep as much scheduled care as we can on track, as well as urgent and emergency care.The BMA leadership would rather we just cancel those appointments because they don’t recognise that someone with cancer, for example, who has a scheduled operation could end up in a far worse place if surgery is postponed. It is not for them to determine whether they think the bar for patient pain is high enough. This government will prioritise patients and do everything we can to protect them.All the same, these actions won’t just cause disruption, anxiety and patient harm. They are likely to cost a huge amount of money, which the NHS simply can’t afford. Instead of working with us on their conditions to put money back into the pockets of resident doctors, the BMA committee put their fingers in their ears and rushed out to strike.I know from the many resident doctors who have reached out to me, and those I’ve met since I became health and social care secretary, that they feel the BMA’s leaders are out of step not just with patients, but most resident doctors themselves. It is hardly surprising a majority of resident doctors did not vote for this strike.So I am urging resident doctors to not follow the BMA leadership, who I do not believe are representing the best interests of their members, any further down this path as strikes begin on Friday at 7am.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You don’t have to know anything about the Middle East to understand what those newspaper pictures of emaciated children, with their drawn little faces and heartbreakingly visible ribs, mean. This is what famine looks like, right downto the return of Bob Geldof, begging the world to act just as he did 40 years ago at Live Aid. Except this time it’s no natural disaster, but what the World Health Organization calls aman-made mass starvation: the chillingly avoidable consequence of an aid system forcing people to choose between risking their lives for a bag of flour, or dying for lack of one.View image in fullscreenThe Guardian’s front page, 24 July 2025.Photograph: GuardianMore than 1,000 people have beenkilled by Israeli forceswhile seeking food in Gaza since May,according to the UN. Médecins Sans Frontièressays even its staff, lucky enough still to be earning salaries, arenow going hungry: there’s almost nothing left to buy in the markets. The newswire Agence France-Presse spoke ofwatching helplesslyas its Palestinian freelancers, who have risked everything to get news out of Gaza when foreign journalists can’t get in, become too weak to work. Meanwhile, back in Britain, people who want to see arrests for war crimes read instead aboutclampdowns on pro-Palestine activists. That ministers have been quick to empathise with the frustrations of a very different crowdprotesting at the housingof asylum seekers in hotels merely adds salt to the wounds.Labour MPs are openly desperate now for their government to do something more than issue dramatically worded threats of future action that never quite materialises. Even cabinet ministers are publicly lobbying for the formal recognition of Palestinian statehood while (in the wordsof Wes Streeting,who could easily lose his marginal Ilford North seat over this war) there’s still a Palestine left.Recognition would be a largely symbolic act of solidarity, which in itself would do little to fill hungry bellies in Gaza. But ministers’ problem is that there seems increasingly little reason fornotdoing it now: the longstanding argument that this prize should be saved for the right moment, to help unlock progress towards a two-state solution, made more sense when the two-state dream wasn’t being actively crushed in front of us. But perhaps the real plea here is forKeir Starmerto recognise the country he actually leads.After the horrors of the 7 October 2023 massacre, there was broad acceptance that Israel could not be expected simply to sit back and do nothing. Even a year into what was by then a highly divisive war, YouGov found that more than half of Britons still felt Israel had been justified in going into Gaza. But critically,only 14% feltits use of force there was proportionate. Sympathy has drained away as Israel’s war of self-defence began to resemble first one of vengeance, and then something darker. In language no former Israeli prime minister uses lightly, Ehud Olmert has described a proposal to corral Palestinians into a settlement on the ruins of Rafah and prevent them leaving asin effect a “concentration camp”.More than half of Britonsnow favourfinancial sanctions like those slapped on prominent Russians over Ukraine, or suspending arms sales. These arguments are now mainstream, cross-party – the veteran Tory MPs Kit Malthouse and Edward Leighmade passionate casesin parliament this week for recognising Palestine – and driven not by the kind of creeping antisemitism Starmer was quite right to confront in his own party, but by what people see every morning, scrolling through their phones.British ministers are betting they won’t face justice for complicity over Gaza. It’s a big risk to take | Owen JonesRead moreDavid Lammy’s rhetoric is already about as strong as a foreign secretary’s can get – this week he condemned Israel’s“inhumane” and “dangerous”new aid system, and what he called“settler terrorism”in the West Bank – and many Labour MPs suspect he’d privately like to go further than the sanctions and restrictions on arms sales he listed. But Downing Street is said to be wary of getting ahead of Donald Trump at a crucial stage in ceasefire negotiations (with Israel’s parliament going into summer recess, relieving some pressure on the minority government of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s hoped there is a window for a deal). Britain has always argued that our influence over Israel is best magnified by synchronising efforts with the US, and though the chaos of this White House makes that harder, Trump’s is still the only voice Netanyahu really hears.Yet while everyone prays for that ceasefire deal to be done, a dangerous gap is opening in Britain between parliament and people.A year into power, Starmer is increasingly adept at foreign policy, but much less so at handling the emotive domestic blowback from it. Without seeing the intelligence reports crossing the desk of the home secretary, Yvette Cooper,I wouldn’t second-guess herdecision to proscribe Palestine Actionas a terror group. Abreach of securityat RAF Brize Norton was never going to be taken lightly. But, inevitably, the process of police officers trying to figure out in real time what elderly vicars can or can’t now say in public about Palestine has caused its share of farce and fury. After a retired teacher was arrested for allegedly holding a sign featuring a Private Eye cartoonabout the proscription, West Yorkshire police issued an unusual statement saying they were sorry if he was “unhappy with the circumstances” of his arrest.As with this summer’s other prospective powder keg, the protests building up outside some asylum seeker accommodation, doubtless everyone is learning as they go. There is, however, only so much policing can do to resolve what are really political conflicts, born in both cases of frustration with what both sets of protesters (in their very different ways) see as political failure to act.To hold together all these volatile, mutually hostile parts of a fractured society through a hot and angry summer will be head-spinningly complicated, a daunting ask even for an experienced government. Yet that’s the nature of the job Starmer applied for last July. A year on, we must all hope he is equal to it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Set against tests and exams, it is seen as a luxury: in fact it is essentialThu 24 Jul 2025 09.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareThe greatest failing of Britain’s schools is to teach children to read, write and count, but not to speak. They teach what technology can increasingly do for them, but not what it cannot. A regular complaint of today’s employers is that applicants for jobslack social skillsor work ethic.Pupils are rarely taught how to present themselves, handle arguments or form human relationships. The most basic requirements for entering adulthood are ignored. The one task to which teaching is almost exclusively dedicated – examination – is an activity conducted in total silence. No grown-up job involves answering exam questions. Education only in the “three Rs” is akin to where medicine was in the days of bleeding and leeches.The teaching of oracy, or the use of speech, was launched about 10 years ago by progressive educationists in an attempt to make schooling more relevant. A few charities have promoted it, such as Voice 21 and Impetus, and a few schools promised to teach it. Then, in 2024, came an independent commission on oracy, chaired by Geoff Barton of the Association of School and College Leaders. It reported that the revolution was overdue. Although the national curriculum for England includes the teaching of spoken language as part of English programmes, it is rarely emphasised or made prominent. Speaking ability, group working and class debating should have the same status as reading, literacy and numeracy. Oracy should be “the fourth R”.Just before the commission, the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was still burbling about everyonedoing maths until they were 18, as if calculators did not exist. But Keir Starmer grabbed the moment. He declared oracy was “not just a skill for learning, it’s also a skill for life … for working out who you are, for overcoming shyness or disaffection, anxiety or doubt … for opening up to our friends and family.” The Labour leaderpromised thatteaching oracy would be a priority of a Labour government. He had got the point.Or apparently not. Starmer’s remark was one of his familiar off-the-cuff moments. He never repeated the pledge. When the government’s interim curriculum and assessment review was published in March, the word oracy was absent. Instead there was rather a traditional emphasis on imparted knowledge, what Dickens satirised in Hard Times as filling “little pitchers” to the brim. On speaking, it was silent.This week, Starmer was called to account. He received an open letter from oracy campaigners demanding he stick to his pledge. It was signed by former education secretaries Charles Clarke and Estelle Morris, writer Michael Rosen, political pundit Alastair Campbell and 56 otherchampions of the skillof speaking. The writers pleaded with Starmer: “In a world shaped by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, deepening social divides and persistent inequality, the skills of speaking, listening and communicating have never been more urgently needed.” Rosen, a professor of children’s literature, added that “the backbone of language is our talk. It’s the everyday way we make and change relationships, share the events of our lives, hear about other people’s lives.”Young members of my family recently returned from school in California, where the essence of the new education is focused on performing and learning in groups. The teacher’s role is not to lecture but to guide discussion. This is alreadybeing testedin British universities, such as Reading and Bath. I imagine it is anathema to Ofsted as it cannot be measured. When I suggested it, a teacher replied: “Oh, you just want all schools to be like The Apprentice.”The essence of oracy is helping pupils articulate their thoughts to others, to listen and reply with courtesy and intelligence. Pupils at Winchester College used to start each day with a topical class discussion. All schools should do that. The nearest most children might get to hearing a public debate is witnessing idiot shrieking at prime minister’s questions. When I watch the pupils leaving my local comprehensive, they don’t converse. They look at their phones or they shout. AsJonathan Haidt has written, this is seriously bad news.The resistance of Britain’s school system to change is near fanatical. It says in effect that if the three Rs were good enough for Queen Victoria, they must be good enough for children now. The system still loves maths – which is not needed by 95% of job-seekers – because it is easy to measure and for governments to boast about. Even literature is reduced to multiple-choice questions. Every classroom minute must become a statistic and a league table.Everything we now hear about the teenage young is causing alarm. Mental illnessis soaring. So are absenteeism and, worst of all, un-employability. The world of work is irrelevant. School teaching appears trapped in a professional archaism that forbids reform. Class instruction, academic bias, length of terms and exam obsession are immutable. Parents and even pupils responded to the recent curriculum review by pleading for subjects such as “financial education, careers knowledge, and politics and governance”. The pleas were ignored. There will be no GCSEs in the world outside the school gates.As for Starmer, he is more interested in getting 16-year-olds to vote for him than in giving them a modern education. If he was a true radical, he would honour his pledge and get them talking.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEducationOpinionNational curriculumCurriculumsTeachingSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

As popular as professional wrestling became during the 1980s, its ins and outs were not as well-publicized as the highlights of more superficially respectable sports such as football, baseball and basketball. Even non-sporty 80s kids could probably name a bunch of teams and a few ultra-famous players such asMichael Jordan, Joe Montana or Darryl Strawberry. Wrestlers, meanwhile, were essentially both the players and the teams, which should have made them easier to differentiate – but, in reality, made the whole thing seem like a TV show that you either watched, or you didn’t. Hulk Hogan, whodied this weekjust shy of 72, was different. For better or worse.Hogan, born Terry Bollea, had a wrestling career that synced near-perfectly with wrestling’s growing 1980s-era popularity. After bouncing between the WorldWrestlingFederation (the Vince McMahon-run organization now known as WWE) and the American Wrestling Association in the early 80s, Hogan returned to the WWF in 1983 and presided over an outbreak of what was diagnosed as “Hulkamania”. Even those who received the proper vaccinations against Hulkamania – namely, not paying attention to wrestling – could see the symptoms manifesting in others, and especially in the Hulkster himself. The red-and-yellow shirt he would tear off, the biker stache, the bandanna atop his thinning blond mane became instantly recognizable trademarks even for non-fans.Hulk Hogan, wrestling star and actor, dies aged 71Read moreHe was so recognizable, in fact, that it’s surprising in retrospect that he wasn’t able to make the jump to feature films, his inability to establish a movie-world beachhead so vivid that later stars such as Dwayne Johnson and John Cena were considered almost miraculous when they made it happen. Even Stone Cold Steve Austin eventually established a somewhat more robust filmography, using supporting roles to consort with the likes of Sylvester Stallone (whom Hogan also knew, via an early part in Rocky III, where he’s ultimately upstaged by Mr T) and Adam Sandler. Hogan, meanwhile, had the one-two punch of a flop wrestling drama (No Holds Barred) and a flop kiddie comedy (Suburban Commando), the latter of which led to a few more movies of that ilk, presumably owed to some kid-driven home-video success.In terms of both quality and box office, the best Hogan could do was feature in a bizarre meta moment midway through Joe Dante’s anarchic horror-comedy sequel Gremlins 2: The New Batch in 1990. After the movie “breaks” as a result of mischievous Gremlins invading the projection booth, the film cuts to an usher fielding complaints about the holdup. He then makes his way into an auditorium, where a yellow-and-red-outfitted Hulk Hogan is munching popcorn, waiting for the movie to resume. At the behest of management, he loudly berates and threatens the creatures until they roll the film again. It’s his most memorable film moment, and it lasts all of about a minute and a half.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump and Hulk Hogan in 1987.Photograph: Jeffrey Asher/Getty ImagesYet that scene did speak to a bizarre, potent iconography. I had never seen a single wrestling match in my young life, but watching Gremlins 2 in a theater, I already knew Hulk Hogan and understood exactly what his deal was. It was a little odd that he was turning up in my Gremlins movie, but not as odd as it should have been. After all, he wasn’t Larry Bird or Magic Johnson, who were safely ensconced in the world of athletics and accompanying big-budget commercials. Hogan was more akin to a living action figure, or the Kool-Aid Man. You had to hand it to him. By the dawn of the 1990s, he wasn’t just the player and the team; he was the product, too.But Hogan was also a human, and by many accounts not a particularly good one. In the 2010s, he achieved a twofer of infamy. First, a sex tape he made in the 2000s was leaked. That was all consensual private business, but, more pressing, said tape featured a racist rant from Hogan, including the use of a particularly vile slur. When this portion of the tape came out in 2015, he was banned from the WWE ring, his still-existing merchandise was yanked from store shelves and he was removed from the WWE Hall of Fame.Hulk Hogan – a life in pictures from wrestling fame to Trump ralliesRead moreWell, for a few years. All of those distinctions were reversed by 2019, seemingly not because Hogan did anything more than clumsily apologize several years earlier. Just because, well, who is anyone else to say when someone’s horrible racial slurs are really racist? The more lasting effect of Hogan’s sex tape was that the website Gawker posted a portion of it in 2012. Hogan, quietly bankrolled by the billionairePeter Thiel, sued the site’s company more or less out of existence. Its assets were sold off and eventually controlled by private-equity firms that did their best to strip them for parts. (Gawker no longer exists, but some of its sibling sites have survived under new ownership.) Hogan was basically hired out as the face of billionaire vengeance.View image in fullscreenHulk Hogan testifies in court during his 2016 lawsuit against Gawker.Photograph: PR Company HandoutThis is all to say that while Hogan often felt like wrestling’s enthusiastic mascot to the outside world less steeped in the sport, there’s another, less whimsical symbol of capitalism run amok that Hogan also came to resemble. An 80s brand name who went on to feature on several reality TV series, make racist remarks and endorse a variety of questionable products using the power of a billionaire to exact personal vengeance that changed the media landscape? It’s no wonder that Hogan appeared at the 2024 Republican convention to endorse Donald Trump for president. Trump had essentially been following the Hulk Hogan handbook, right down to his refusal to go away. Though his peak was past by the mid-90s, Hogan never well and truly quit wrestling for good.His non-wrestling career as a jack-of-all-trades all-purpose Famous Brand Name also wasn’t unprecedented. But his particular brand of celebrity did feel like a 1980s novelty that metastasized into American culture as a whole. He was a consummate Famous for Famous figure not because wrestling is fake – plenty of wrestlers have built respectable careers in and out of the ring – but because he brought that fakeness with him, out into the world. There was scarcely a medium he couldn’t cheapen with a Mr Nanny (allegedly a movie), a Hulk Rules (allegedly an album) or a Pastamania (a short-lived restaurant that operated out of the Mall of America). Did anyone really want any of this? Maybe some kids or hardcore fans, which would give all of that a more natural fanbase than Trump-endorsed steaks and fake colleges. Hogan may have left us, but spiritually speaking, Hulkamania never died.Explore more on these topicsWrestlingOpinionTelevisionUS televisionPeter ThielGawker MediacommentShareReuse this content"

Because even during wartime, some red lines must not be crossedNataliya GumenyukA new law has caused uproar for a reason: it undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies and is an affront to the peopleThu 24 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareFor quite some time, foreign colleagues have been asking me about Ukraine’s democracy during wartime. Often these questions assume that political freedoms vanish by default in a country at war. They ask whether protests or critiques of the government are even possible.Ukraine is a democracy at war – and democracy itself is an existential matter. It is precisely what the country is fighting for. My usual answer has been: “The people will know when it’s time to protest.” They will sense when too much power is being concentrated in security services, when parliament’s role is being bypassed, when the prime minister or members of parliament are no longer acting independently. Ukrainians, I would say, will know when red lines are crossed.This week, many decided that such a red line had been crossed.On Tuesday thousands of peoplegathered in Kyiv to protestand call on Volodymyr Zelenskyy to veto legislation they believe undermines the independence of two keyanti-corruption institutions: the national anti-corruption bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office (Sapo).The protest was largely youthful – many would have been kids during the 2014Revolution of Dignity. Their chants included “Veto the law!” and “No to pressure on independent institutions”. Despite martial law, only two policemen were stationed nearby. The atmosphere was even cheerful. It was by far the largest protest since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Similar demonstrations took place in approximately 10 Ukrainian towns.And yet late that very night, Zelenskyy signed the bill into law.What shocked many was not just the content of the legislation but also the speed and manner in which it was pushed through: passed within a day, as an amendment hidden inside unrelated law enforcement reforms, and then signed and published almost immediately.Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, Ukrainians have demonstrated an extraordinary level of unity and civic responsibility. Citizens also showed renewed faith in the institutions of the state – even those long viewed with suspicion. People were willing to look past imperfections, to suspend criticism, and to focus on survival and victory. That is why there has been no serious internal push for wartime elections, despite foreign commentary. Elections – expensive, risky and constitutionally prohibited during war – are widely understood by Ukrainians to be unfeasible under current conditions. But this is different.This law has become a litmus test of whether public trust in the government can be sustained. And more than that, whether the unwritten social contract – between citizens and the state – still holds.The law adopted by Ukraine’s parliament – formally known as draft law 12414 – includes sweeping changes that fundamentally alter the authority of Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies. The prosecutor general now holds expanded powers over Nabu and Sapo – including control over investigations, case access and team composition, and the authority to shut down cases or transfer them to other law enforcement bodies.The vote took place just one day after the security service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted searches at Nabu’s offices, and Ukraine’s state bureau of investigation (SBI) filed criminal charges against three Nabu employees over car accidents that occurred in 2021 and 2023. These incidents raised eyebrows for their timing.According to Nabu, the new provisions “effectively destroy the independence of Sapo and place both Nabu and Sapounder the control of the prosecutor general”. The bureau reminded lawmakers that Ukraine’s anti-corruption infrastructure, built in partnership with international allies since 2015, was a key precondition for western financial and political support.As institutions, Nabu and Sapo are not without flaws. Government representatives – both formally and off the record – have raised concerns about politicised investigations, poor coordination with other law enforcement agencies and even alleged infiltration by individuals sympathetic to Russian interests. The quality of investigations has also been criticised. Some probes have dragged on for years without result. Others, including cases against prominent business figures or former officials, have been accused of selective prosecution. There are also persistent rumours that Nabu investigations havetouched individualsclose to Zelenskyy himself.What makes this even more complex is that these institutions are tied to Ukraine’s commitments for EU membership. And yet European integration – while deeply valued by Ukrainians – is no longer something the EU itself appears eager to actively advance. That makes it even easier for outside partners to use moments like this to distance themselves, to quietly say: “Maybe Ukraine isn’t ready after all.”Zelenskyy defends bill stripping anti-corruption bodies’ independence amid protestsRead moreBut the deeper issue is this: none of Ukraine’s law enforcement institutions are ideal – not during wartime, and arguably not before it. But Nabu and Sapo remain the most trusted parts of a law enforcement system long plagued by corruption and impunity. They were created not to be dismantled when they become inconvenient. The protesters are not defending a fantasy of flawless institutions but the principle that reform must not be replaced by control.Protests are likely to continue. The government will have to respond. Yes, there is war. But in a democracy there is a constitutional way forward: the law can be rescinded, amended, debated transparently. This cannot be fixed by one late-night briefing from the head of the security service or the newly appointed prosecutor general – nor by a photo opportunity where Zelenskyystands alongsidethe heads of all law enforcement bodies. It requires real, public consultation.The demonstrators in Kyiv this week are sending a message. If there were questions about what the limits of government power during war should be, they were answered on Tuesday.Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism LabExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

It deserves to loseNils PratleyClaims the two issues are inextricably entwined reads as self-interested waffleThu 24 Jul 2025 09.54 EDTFirst published on Thu 24 Jul 2025 09.31 EDTShareIf Wise, the money transfer company whose £10bn valuation makes it a big fish in London’s small pool of quoted financial technology companies, was only proposing toswitch its primary listing to New York, its plan would probably sail through.A few UK shareholders may regret the loss to the London stock market of a success story out of Shoreditch. But they usually vote in favour when management – in this case, the Wise co-founder Kristo Käärmann – says “major US growth opportunities” would be best pursued with a US listing.However, the listing location isn’t the sole big item on the agenda at its extraordinary general meeting this coming Monday. Controversially, Wise also wants to extend the company’s “dual-class” structure, which gives enhanced voting rights to those who hold the “B” class variety. A chief beneficiary would be Käärmann: the supercharged nature of the “Bs” means his 18% economic interest in Wise becomes 55% (though capped at 50% in practice) in terms of voting clout.This arrangement was setat listing in 2021and was due to expire next summer under a “sunset” clause. Wise wants to extend by a full 10 years, an idea that usually upsets those investors who think good governance requires “one share, one vote” and that tech founders are not obliged to adopt Mark Zuckerberg’s levels of control freakery when it comes to other shareholders’ rights.What’s the problem? you may ask. If shareholders don’t like the “B” class proposal, they can just vote against it while giving a thumbs up to the switch to New York. Except they can’t. Wise has structured the vote as an all-or-nothing affair. There is only one indivisible proposal on the table.If the tactic looks like a backdoor manoeuvre, the company’s other Estonian co-founder, Taavet Hinrikus, agrees. Hinrikus left the firm soon after listing but still has 5.1% of the shares (and 11.8% of the votes) via his vehicle Skaala Investments. Two fundamentally distinct issues should not be bundled into a single vote, he argues, adding: “Wise owners deserve governance structures that enhance value, not entrench power.”He’s right on both scores. Wise is now 15 years old and made pre-tax profits of £565m last year, so is no longer a youthful startup, one excuse tech founders offer for supercharged voting rights. In any case, Käärmann would still have almost a fifth of the shares, enough to resist most short-term agitators who may divert him from his long-term mission to have Wise handle trillions worth of cross-border transactions rather than mere billions.The essential point is that shareholders should be allowed to decide unrelated issues – the listing and the voting rights – separately. Wise’s claim that the two are inextricably entwined reads as self-interested waffle, a bad look for a company that trumpets transparency over fees in its day job.In an entertaining subplot, Wise has had to withdraw its claim that Pirc, one of the big proxy voting agencies, supported Monday’s proposal. The company says it only belatedly became aware that Pirc was recommending voting against. Indeed, the proxy firm’s stance is strong: “The retention of enhanced voting rights further suggests a shift toward entrenching management control.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They proclaim a bright future for humanity delivered by the rapid pursuit of technological advances.Of course, these techno-optimists are right that technology and science are unarguably among humanity’s greatest assets, and hope for the future. But they go too far, because it is also true that technology always creates new problems even as it solves others – this is also something we’ve learned through science. As a result, naive faith in technology is a recipe for repeatedly achieving a short-term buzz while also incurring long-term costs. Getting the best out of technology requires a more cautious and balanced approach.Why does technology so often go wrong – even as it gets many things right? The anthropologist Sander van der Leeuwe sketched out an answer about a decade ago, and it seems to be something like a law of nature. When we face a problem, we think about it and build a conceptual model of how part of the world works. We use it to propose a solution to our problem. Based on that understanding, we then act, and the technology we come up with often solves the problem. However, we then typically find that our model – of course – wasn’t actually a complete model of the world. Our simple model left some things out. Not surprisingly, it then turns out that our technology, operating in the real world, has effects on that world that we hadn’t foreseen – unanticipated consequences.We repeatedly encounter this pattern because simple models are so powerful, seductive and useful. Also, simple models leave details out so that we always misperceive the full consequences of our actions. We invent better fishing technology to feed more people, and then find we’ve wiped out fish populations. We create wonderful non-stick surfaces for cooking pans and then later discover that the chemicals in these materials cause health problems and have leached into the environment, spreading essentially everywhere. We make super-convenient plastics that end up as micro-particles in the oceans and in our own bodies. This is also the story of technology, along with the great victories.Because we understand this, anticipating problems should be part of technological development itself. A clear-eyed view of our ignorance doesn’t mean not pursuing technology, but counsels caution and wisdom by employing foresight, without expecting anything close to flawless prescience. It also means taking practical steps to regulate development and give time to redress emerging problems, while at the very least avoiding the worst possible outcomes.Our current approach to research and development in artificial intelligence or AI offers an example of the reckless approach. Right now a handful of the world’s largest technology companies are battling it out among themselves to control the market for this technology, rolling out one model after another as fast as they can with little oversight. As the neuroscientist Gary Marcus has argued, this race for near-term dominance has one obvious cost – it exposes everyone to the unknown risks of new and untested technologies. It also has a less obvious cost: the pitched urgency of the competition means that virtually all available resources get invested in research in the recent most promising area, currently so-called large-language models. This hoards resources away from other areas of computer science that might ultimately turn out to be more important to one day achieving true AI.Fortunately, not all Silicon Valley leaders accept the techno-optimist demand for uncontrolled technological acceleration. Dario Amodei, CEO of the AI company Anthropic, certainly shares their optimism, as he revealed in a recent essay expressing his view that AI research could lead to incredible improvements to human wellbeing. Exploring an admittedly optimistic scenario, he suggests that we might in a few decades eliminate essentially all diseases, spread beneficial economic growth across nations, even greatly improve humans’ collective ability to form consensus on issues of fundamental social importance.But Amodei also accepts that there’s plenty of room for things to go wrong – AI may not achieve any of these positives, and could instead radically exacerbate inequality, or provide a new class of autocrats with unprecedented powers of surveillance and control through AI-enhanced propaganda. What will happen depends on the choices we make.And, in this, he suggests that keeping a close focus on risks and regulation has to be the right way forward, rather than naively racing into the future with hope as our guide. People not only underestimate how good AI might one day be, he thinks, but also howbad the risks could be. And there’s natural asymmetry we need to respect.When billion-dollar AIs break down over puzzles a child can do, it’s time to rethink the hype | Gary MarcusRead more“The basic development of AI technology and many (not all) of its benefits seems inevitable,” as he sees it, as the result of powerful market forces. “On the other hand, the risks are not predetermined and our actions can greatly change their likelihood.”As so often with cultures such as Wall Street or Silicon Valley, the essential tension is between forces seeking short-term profits – whatever the long-term outcome – and others who would rather balance opportunities and risks, and thereby pursue more sustainable benefits. In arguments for and against such opposing views, there’s a natural imbalance, as alluring and obvious potential profits now get weighed up against harder-to-see and less-defined risks set in an unknown future. It’s not a fair comparison.Especially when it is so easy to make catastrophically huge errors when thinking about the future, even the near future. In his techno-optimist manifesto, the entrepreneur Marc Andreessen casually voices his dream that we might ramp up clean-energy resources so quickly that everyone on earth could soon use 1,000 times more energy a day than is currently typical for people in developed nations. Just think what people could achieve! Sounds great. Except that a little physics thinking also shows that using that much energy would immediately cause planetary warming about 30 times faster than we’re experiencing today, and we’d all be dead in a few years. Not so great after all.Of course, anyone might make this kind of mistake, because in our complex world, cause and effect is complex. Technology is tricky, and what might happen is far from obvious. That’s just the way it is – and why we need to think more carefully about risks and follow a more cautious approach.Mark Buchanan is a physicist and science writer and the author of Ubiquity and Nexus: Small Worlds and the New Science of Networks"

There are broader lessons for the president in this crisisThu 24 Jul 2025 13.54 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareWhen Russian troops rolled across the border in 2022, it established a new contract between Ukrainians and their president. The existential need for unity was cemented by admiration for Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s courage, and recognition of his ability to articulate the national mood and rally international support.Ordinary politics were suspended. Critics who were already suspicious of his populist instincts and centralising tendencies did not want to aid Russia’s cause. They understood that wartime could require a different mode of leadership. This informal contract essentially held despite growing concerns about the concentration of power, the role of Mr Zelenskyy’s right-hand man,Andriy Yermak, and the departure of popular figures seen as potential rivals –notably the military chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi, now ambassador to London, and the foreign ministerDmytro Kuleba.It is Mr Zelenskyy himself who broke it by stripping independence from Ukraine’s key anti-corruption bodies this week – prompting the first significant protests since the full-scale war began, withthousands demonstratingin Kyiv and other cities. The legislation brought the national anti-corruption bureau and specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office under the prosecutor general’s control – allowing him to access case files and to oversee and even close investigations. Demonstrators were angered by the way these changes were rushed into law as well as by their substance. The suspicion is that allies of the president felt under threat from investigators.The president, apparently taken aback by the reaction, has now approved a draft law that he said would restore the agencies’ independence. Those challenging him will want to see the details.For many, this crisis is the culmination of concerns about his style of rule and the conduct of some of those around him. It also has alarming echoes of his predecessors. Protesters are not suggesting that he isa new Viktor Yanukovych, still less the “dictator” he is portrayed as byRussian (and Maga) disinformation. But a new generation has taken to the streets, as their elders did, because they value democracy. As the broadcaster Tetyana Troshchynska wrote: “The existential threat from Russia is greater and more intense than from corruption … [but] you can’t spit on those values for which, in fact, the fight is going on.”The current US administration has no admiration for Ukraine’s anti-corruption investigators. That may have emboldened Mr Zelenskyy. ButEuropean partners do care– and have warned that this law hasendangered Ukraine’s path to EU membership. The agencies were created in part to protect foreign aid and investment. And allies had already been disturbed by moves such as last year’sdismissal of the deputy prime minister for restoration, Oleksandr Kubrakov, who had impressed them with his commitment to transparency. It’s also worrying that the president tried to tarnish the anti-corruption agencies with talk of “Russian connections”.Mr Zelenskyy has maintained strong support at home,boostedby Donald Trump’s bullying of him. His personal popularity has always been central to his leadership – too much so. But if that has prompted him to fully reverse course, that is all to the good. He should recover support at home and abroad not only by restoring the independence of anti-corruption investigators, but by taking heed of the broader lessons about the people’s justified expectations of their government.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

That’s not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainableThu 24 Jul 2025 13.53 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareThis year’s global wealth report by the City bankUBSconfirms what is self-evident but rarely confronted: while riches are accumulating, their distribution remains starkly unbalanced. In the 56 countries and economic areas surveyed, the report says global personal wealth grew 4.6% in 2024. However, not all boats have been lifted by this tide. The gap is growing between those who hold assets and those who don’t.The figures are shocking: just 60m of the world’s adults – 1.6% of the population – have net personal wealth of $226tn, or 48.1% of all the world’s riches. At the other extreme, four in 10 adults – 1.57bn people – have only $2.7tn, or just 0.6% of all the world’s personal wealth. Economists nowarguethatinequalityis no longer a by-product of growth but a condition of it.In the US, soaringbondmarkets andtech stockshave benefited the ultra-rich and deepened inequality. Nine households, it wasreported, control 15% of wealth in Silicon Valley. By contrast, UBS says British median wealth rose while average wealth fell. This is a rare divergence, probably caused by prosperous households inLondontaking a hit from interest rate hikes as house prices dropped and debt costs rose. This wasn’t a sign of shared prosperity but of paper losses at the top, while ordinary workers held steady.Unlike wages,wealthreflects not just income but also access to assets, favourable institutional conditions – such as low interest rates – and public policies like low taxes and housing shortages. In other words, wealth depends on political choices in ways that income currently does not. It’s not just the inequality itself that is the issue but the erosion of mechanisms that once constrained it. As the report notes, wealth and income inequality are linked. But where wages have stagnated andcollective bargaininghas weakened, capital income – derived from profits, rents and interest – has been boosted by design.Productivity gains, once expected to feed through to broader living standards, now primarily serve to enhance returns to wealth.Taxes on wealth are necessary to make societies more equal. Unfairness is aiding far-right autocrats whose rise brings the risk of democraticcollapse. In July seven Nobel laureates issued apowerfulcall for a minimum tax on the ultra-rich.Brazil, Spain and South Africahave demanded a global tax on the super-rich, placing the issue on the G20 agenda. Pioneering work byeconomistssuch as Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez led to the French national assemblypassing a lawthis year for a 2% minimum tax on wealth over €100m. The legislation, regrettably, has notproceededpast the senate.Progressive taxation is necessary, but it doesn’t address a core problem in many economies: when capital income outpaces labour income, redistribution may ease the symptoms of neoliberalism, but it leaves the underlying condition untreated. High inequality suppresses consumption,deters investment and slows growth. The gap between rich and poor is not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainable. Without strong domestic demand, economies increasingly rely ondebt, speculation and asset bubblesto fuel growth.Changing this would take more than fiscal transfers. It would require policies that boost wages: full employment, stronger labour unions and public investment. Privateownershipitself may need to be reconceived – less perhaps in the sense of expropriation, and more in terms of widening access to productive assets and social wealth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

As an adult, she helped expose the shocking scale of abuse it had perpetratedByBarbara SpeedThu 24 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 04.20 EDTShareUntil she was six, Philippa Barnes was surrounded by things that were hers. She had a favourite pair of red-and-white-striped dungarees and a long garden with a strawberry patch. She had a close-knit family: a mum, dad, two brothers and a sister, and grandparents who lived near the family home in Surrey. When her mum made lemon meringue pie, she would pass the curd pan out of the window to where Philippa was playing so she could lick it clean.One day, when Philippa was about two years old, a couple stopped by the family’s church. They, along with their three sons, were on their way to join the Jesus Fellowship, a Christian community in Northamptonshire led by Noel Stanton, a charismatic, white-haired pastor. Their enthusiasm was infectious, and Philippa’s family started visiting the fellowship a few times a year.At first, Philippa and her siblings loved these trips. Photos from that time of Cornhill Manor, one of the fellowship’s properties, show high windows looking out over green fields, airy communal kitchens, and a grand ballroom with a sprung dancefloor, where members of the community slept on mattresses. It was a far cry from Woking, where the family lived opposite a noisy train line. Although Philippa had to spend long religious meetings under her parents’ chairs, shushed and desperately bored, the rest of the weekend could be spent playing outside.When Philippa was five, on one of these weekends with the fellowship, something shifted. One evening, she and her two-year-old brother, as the two youngest siblings, were put to bed with a baby monitor while her parents went to a prayer meeting downstairs. “The message was, ‘We can hear you, but we don’t want to hear you,’” Philippa recalled. She had never before been afraid to disturb her parents, but when her brother started having diarrhoea and then both siblings began to vomit, she had to call for them. “My parents came, and my dad wasn’t too pleased,” she said. “Looking back, I can see they didn’t want to be embarrassed by being disturbed – they were newbies to the community.” But the lesson stuck: this new church was more important than she was.In 1984, Philippa’s parents told the children that the family was moving to the East Midlands to be nearer the fellowship. For her parents, the move made sense. Philippa’s father was a senior scientific officer for the Ministry of Defence and had to travel regularly for work, meaning her mother was often looking after the children alone. In Northamptonshire, they had been exposed to a new way of life, one based around simplicity and community, where music was played nightly, meals were communal and children were able to enjoy the outdoors.The Barnes family bought a house in the village of Bugbrooke and regularly attended fellowship meetings and worship sessions led by Stanton. Then, in 1987, just before Philippa’s ninth birthday, the family moved into what the fellowship called “community”: a farmhouse named Shalom, where about 20 people would live at any given time. Moving in meant surrendering proceeds from their house sale and Philippa’s father’s wages into the “common purse”. Most who lived in community were employed in the fellowship’s businesses, and Philippa’s father got a job at their builders’ merchant. All possessions, even down to items of clothing, were shared.In some ways, this life offered a new kind of freedom. The younger Barnes children spent time going for walks or picnics, or looking after the fellowship’s livestock. To her delight, Philippa was allowed to help with lambing. She and her brother would run riot away from adult eyes. They once built a petrol bomb using a milk bottle and blew up a wasp’s nest.There were also privations. Almost all of the children’s toys were taken away. “Cuddlies, gadgets or competitive toys” appeared on a list of things deemed “worldly” – and therefore unacceptable – by Stanton. The list of banned items changed according to his whims, but over the years it included secular TV, pop music, makeup, sporting events, restaurants, buffets, weight training, holidays, zoos, coffee, sunbathing, celebrating Christmas, swimming “for pleasure” and crisps.The children attended a local comprehensive school, but making friends outside the group was difficult. They were not allowed to eat school dinners, so every lunchtime they would troop to a fellowship house nearby. “The other children knew to avoid us, so we stuck together,” Philippa said.Of all the strangeness in their new life, Philippa found the fellowship’s approach to family hardest. Under Stanton’s rules, communal living meant renouncing your “natural family” in favour of the fellowship’s “spiritual family”. Women were called “sisters”, men were “brothers” and leaders were “elders”. Philippa’s parents, instead of just being responsible for their family unit, were given other duties: helping to cook and clean for the other Shalom residents, or finding new recruits. When Philippa turned 12, she was moved from the room she shared with her younger brother into a dormitory with women of all ages.Explaining this approach, Stanton would point to a passage from Matthew 10, in which Jesus said: “I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother … A man’s enemies will be members of his own household.” In the absence of the “natural family”, any adult could be responsible for disciplining children. Many did so through “rodding” – hitting children as young as two with sticks. “He who spares the rod hates his son,” Stanton would say, quoting from Proverbs. Exorcisms were also performed on children. When Philippa was caught drawing stick figures with breasts and genitals at a meeting, she was taken into a private room so an elder could pray for her “unclean spirit” and anoint her with oil.Philippa missed her parents. She managed to spend some time with her mum by helping in the garden and the kitchen, where they would skim cream off bottles of milk to make choux buns and eclairs, a welcome relief from bland meals of pork chops and boiled vegetables. But it never felt like enough: other girls her age were going shopping for clothes with their mums, watching TV as a family or going to the cinema or the zoo. In the communal house, doors were hung with curtains, and Philippa remembers hiding between her parents’ bedroom door and the curtain, hearing the murmur of their voices as they talked, laughed or argued; longing to be closer to them.Dressed in brightly coloured shirts and patterned ties, with his signature swirl of backcombed white hair, Stanton looked more like a magician than a man of the church. A Baptist pastor born on Christmas Day, he had founded the fellowship in his small local chapel in 1969 after a “life-changing” spiritual experience that led him to embrace exuberant worship sessions, speaking in tongues, exorcisms and communal living. From the fellowship’s early days, these practices attracted attention. In a 1974 Thames Television documentary, The Lord Took Hold of Bugbrooke, one local woman complained she couldn’t open her windows on Sundays because of the noise.Through the 1970s, young people and families flocked to Bugbrooke to join this new church, attracted by the stories of spiritual revelation and a thriving Christian community. There were two main levels of membership: some lived in their own home and attended worship and meetings; the hardcore lived in one of the fellowship’s communal houses. As all members living in community had to hand over their assets, the fellowship flourished financially. In 1984, it bought a nearby manor house, which it renamed New Creation Hall.By the early 80s, it owned at least 10 country houses in the area, and membership in communal houses was up to about 450. It was operating a chain of health food shops, a clothing shop and a building supply company. In 1982, the Northampton Chronicle and Echo described it as “the new aristocracy of the East Midlands”.The fellowship was a strict hierarchy, with Stanton at the top, a leadership circle below him, and an elder running each communal house. Only men were permitted to occupy these roles. Women were subordinate to men. (If a man was driving a car, women were expected to sit in the back.) Favoured members were given “virtue names” reflecting their most valued qualities: Valiant, Zealous, Forthright or, in one young woman’s case, Submission. Celibacy, especially among the male leadership, was encouraged as the highest ideal.View image in fullscreenThe Jesus Fellowship founder Noel Stanton.Photograph: John Angerson/BBC/Docsville StudiosThe fellowship’s first decade was punctuated by a series of strange incidents. In December 1976, a 26-year-old member, David Gavin Hooper, was found dead in a field on fellowship property, his socks and shirt folded neatly next to him. The death was put down to exposure, but the coroner, Michael Collcutt, noted that it was “extraordinary” that he should have gone out with no coat on such a cold morning. Less than 18 months later, 19-year-old Stephen Orchard was found decapitated on a nearby railway line, having told his parents he was considering leaving the fellowship. (His virtue name was “Faithful”.) The same coroner returned an open verdict, but noted his “concern” about the two strange deaths and the letters he had received from parents of young people in the fellowship, who were worried about their children’s safety. These incidents were closely reported by local media but never became national news. (When Philippa’s family were living in Woking and first encountering the fellowship, they hadn’t heard about them.)There were always explanations for the bad press: it was the product of misinformation or disgruntled former members who couldn’t be trusted. But after a string of negative stories, in 1986 – two years after the Barnes family moved into community – the Baptist Union of Great Britain voted to expel the fellowship, saying it had caused them “embarrassment”. The fellowship no longer fulfilled a requirement of Baptist churches: governance by the whole congregation. Stanton may have preached equality in the eyes of God, but within the fellowship some were more equal than others.After its expulsion, the fellowship went on the offensive. In 1987, in a bid to recruit hundreds of new members, it launched a new campaigning arm, which it called the Jesus Army. Stanton dreamed up a uniform for his troops: bomber jackets, in “army green, red for the blood of Jesus, white for purity, black for the darkness and gold for God’s glory”. On the jackets were embroidered the words LOVE, POWER AND SACRIFICE. Community houses were rebranded “battle stations”, money for campaigning was collected in a “war fund”, and the campaign to recruit new members was run by Jawbone, the Jesus Army War Battle Operations Network.The Jesus Army’s mission was to fight “economic recession, family breakdown and moral decay”, according to a 1997 Stanton-approved history of the fellowship. Homelessness in Britain had doubled between 1979 and 1986, driven by rising unemployment, government cuts and high inflation. Against this bleak backdrop, the fellowship’s troops travelled into city centres around the UK in colourful, Jesus Army-branded doubledecker buses, wearing their bomber jackets and camouflage trousers (for men only – trousers were banned for women). They would seek out homeless people and drug addicts, offering them a place to stay for the night, or longer. Back at the communal houses, these new recruits would sleep in the same dormitories as children as young as 12.The Jesus Army did wonders for the fellowship’s public image, projecting a young, hopeful, anti-capitalist version ofChristianity, dedicated to helping vulnerable people. “We [broke] through to the ‘forgotten people,’” the authors of the 1997 history wrote proudly. “Street kids, addicts, the poor, the homeless.” From the late 80s, the Jesus Army was a regular presence at Glastonbury, doubledecker bus in tow. In the 90s, as rave music was becoming popular, troops were sent out to nightclubs to recruit. By the mid-90s, the fellowship’s following had increased to nearly 2,000 people, with about 75 community houses, including outposts in London, Liverpool and Milton Keynes. It was fast becoming one of the largest residential Christian communities in Europe.View image in fullscreenThe Jesus Army’s bus.Photograph: Leo Reynolds/FlickrIn 1998, a Jesus Army delegation appeared on an episode of Jon Ronson’s Channel 4 talkshow, For the Love Of …, wearing glow-in-the-dark crucifix necklaces (“everyone in the clubs wears them, because they’re cool”) and bemoaning “misrepresentations” of the church. They prayed as a group over Ronson: “I’m a factual person, but the second you put your hand on my foot, it stopped itching,” he marvelled.At 16, Philippa became a covenant member of the church. After a full immersion baptism, she swore a vow of lifelong commitment. By now, her days were entirely ruled by the group: she sang in the worship band, and worked as an administrator at the group’s GP surgery, on top of the busy schedule of meetings, worship, and weekends spent evangelising. As a child, she had loved art and crafts, but there was no time for that now. The fellowship saw the pursuit of individual passions as too individualistic.Despite her outward commitment, Philippa had a growing feeling that something wasn’t right. From when she was about 13, an adult man in the fellowship had begun following her home on his motorbike and staring at her in meetings, which escalated to sending her love letters and telling her they should get married. His attentions would have been obvious to other adults, yet no one stopped him. To protect herself, she asked a friend’s brother to say he was her boyfriend, despite Stanton’s ban on flirting and dating.While her stalker went unchallenged, Philippa was hemmed in by the fellowship’s endless rules. Once, she was publicly chastised by her house elder for getting a haircut in town, using £10 her grandmother had sent her. “I could feel that rebellion inside me. Like, what does it really matter? It’s just hair.”When she was 17, her father gave her some news that would crystallise her growing distrust of the organisation that had raised her. A friend of Philippa’s, Marie*, had gone to the police with some information and it was now being investigated. He didn’t say more than that. That night, Philippa lay in bed turning this over and over in her mind. Marie had been her closest friend. She and her family had left the fellowship with no warning, which meant they were cut off from all contact with the group. Philippa had felt so hurt that she had burned Marie’s letters. Yet she knew what the police report must be about. To Philippa, it felt like Marie was reaching out for help.Philippa went to her dad and told him the truth. From the age of 13, on her regular visits to see Marie at the fellowship’s house in Acton, Philippa had been forced to act as a lookout while a 24-year-old man in the household abused Marie in the basement. She had remained silent, believing it wasn’t her story to tell. Now Marie had reported her abuser, and Philippa wanted to corroborate her story.Philippa and her father approached the elder of her household, who took the matter to Stanton. When the alleged perpetrator was questioned, he insisted the two girls were lying. Stanton accused Philippa and Marie of being “in cahoots”, as if their friendship was in itself cause for suspicion. Although Philippa’s father had lived for almost a decade in a community where family loyalty was considered sinful and hierarchy was everything, he stood by his daughter. So did her house elder, who insisted that he believed her. Philippa and her father were told to wait until the end of the week for a finaldecision about whether the information should be passed to the police.View image in fullscreenPhilippa and her brother.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianTo Philippa, it wasn’t up to the fellowship to decide. So, feeling like fugitives, she and her father bypassed the leadership. To avoid being overheard, they found a phone in a rarely used outbuilding where Jesus Army merchandise was spray-painted, and called the police. After Philippa was asked to give a statement, they secretly travelled to London.The case made it to court, and Philippa was called as a witness. Her older brother, who was by now in his late 20s and living in a fellowship house in Eastbourne, was summoned by elders to a meeting, where he was told his sister was lying, and that she was set on destroying the church. Like his father, he supported her, in spite of the pressure. Stanton held further meetings, condemning the whole family. When Philippa arrived at Isleworth crown court to give her testimony, the room was filled with fellowship members. They were there to support the accused.On 4 April 1997, a jury found the perpetrator guilty of two counts of sexual assault of a minor, for touching Marie’s breasts and trying to kiss her. The judge jailed him for three months, noting that the offence had taken place years earlier, and that the man may have struggled under the church’s “strict regime”, alluding to the limitations Stanton placed on sex and dating. “You were living in a society where your frustrations may well have built up,” the judge said. After the verdict, Marie told the Northampton Chronicle and Echo that the fellowship inflicted “constant mental abuse” on its members.Few outside the Acton house even knew that the perpetrator had been convicted. After his release, he was welcomed back to the fellowship with open arms.In 1979, John Everett, a student at Warwick University, began a sociological study of the Jesus Fellowship for his doctoral thesis. He had joined the group in the summer of 1977, experiencing it as a “pocket of utopian escape from a chaotic, frenetic, unsympathetic world”, something “very close to a classless society” where people of all kinds were accepted. Now, he had been commissioned by Stanton himself to go and study its unique makeup. Yet as he conducted his research, examining the group’s structure and practices through an academic lens, he began to reach a devastating conclusion: that the church was a cult.As Everett writes in War and Defeat, a history of the organisation that he self-published this year, he couldn’t escape the fact that the authority structure and separation from the rest of the world were hallmarks of cultic groups. “It would have taken a huge amount of self-deceit to deny what I could plainly see: the key characteristics of a cult were in our DNA,” he writes.There is a school of sociology that rejects the term “cult”, arguing that it has been used to dismiss unusual groups that challenge social norms, and preferring the category “new religious movements”. Many other scholars and survivors disagree, arguing that the methods cults use to control their members are distinct. Alexandra Stein, a British psychologist and survivor of a political cult, says that whether religious or non-religious, cults are remarkably similar: “If you’ve seen one car, you know what machinery is in another car, even if it’s a different colour.”In the popular imagination, cults are closed-off entities, physically removing their members from the outside world. The fellowship claimed to work differently: members were free to go to school, work, and live outside of community houses. But just as an abusive partner might exert influence over every aspect of a victim’s life, Stanton had built a system of mental and emotional control that relied on a common cultic tactic: gradually severing members’ attachments to the rest of society, to family members and even to one another. Those broken connections were replaced by a single reference point: the fellowship. With nowhere else to go, any feelings of fear and stress provoked by life in the organisation would only serve to drive members closer to it.This helps explain why, after the trial and their condemnation by the leadership, Philippa and her parents stayed in the fellowship. “Really, we should have left at that point,” she said. “But it didn’t occur to us. We had made a lifelong commitment.” Their homes, jobs, friendships and assets were entirely tied to the group. Anyone who left was shunned – members were banned from speaking or writing to them, and songs were sung at worship sessions about their betrayal.View image in fullscreenBugbrooke Baptist chapel, the birthplace of the Jesus Army in the 1960s.Photograph: Saxon Sky/FlickrOver time, though, Philippa felt that same flicker of rebellion that had allowed her to speak up for her friend. She had never felt fully spiritually moved in the group’s worship sessions. She never heard God speaking to her, or felt a genuine desire to speak in tongues. And now, as she sat through Stanton’s sermons about traitors and liars, knowing they were directed at her, she became more and more uncertain about the religion that governed her life.She was haunted by the contradictions her experience had exposed: a Christian community that claimed to preach the truth was persecuting her for her honesty. She had been taught that the “natural family” was meaningless, but her father and brother had been the ones to stand up for her. She struggled with depression, developed a stammer and began having stress-induced seizures. The leadership moved her to a fellowship house in Oxford, ostensibly to recuperate, though Philippa believes Stanton didn’t want her “anywhere near him”.The distance from Stanton and the church headquarters meant the community was more relaxed, and she got a non-fellowship job, working as an administrator at a pharmaceutical company. For the first time, she was given money from the common purse to buy clothes of her own, for work, that wouldn’t be shared communally. She bought a couple of pencil skirts and a couple of blouses. Work, too, opened her mind. “I was meeting people who were compassionate towards me, more so than the Christians I’d lived with all my life,” she said. “I was shocked, I suppose, that that was able to happen.”Those who spend their childhoods in cults, Stein said, can find leaving particularly hard: “They struggle to know what is the self, and what is the cult. It’s very complex to try to untangle that.” In 1999, Philippa reached a decision: she would move out of the fellowship house, though she would continue to attend services.With her own income, she was able to move into a big shared rental in central Oxford. Everything was new. She had to set up a bank account for the first time. Shopping for food and cooking for herself was a revelation. “I’d go to the shops almost every day, and I used to have stir-fries nearly every night because I couldn’t believe the variety, and how good vegetables could taste after all those years of boiled carrots and cabbage,” she said.When she attended fellowship meetings and worship sessions, it felt different. She was now an outsider, a second-tier member. Her parents had moved out from their communal house shortly before she did. On top of the toll of the court case, her father was having health problems and couldn’t keep up with the schedule of near-daily meetings. Unlike Philippa, her parents had fully left the fellowship, and they could see that her half-in, half-out status seemed only to be worsening her depression.Three months after Philippa moved out, she was about to set off for a fellowship meeting when her mum said she didn’t want her to go. Philippa sat and cried for hours, knowing this really was the end. “It was a visceral severing of all those relationships, all those friendships – your spiritual family.” Even decades later, she felt she hadn’t fully escaped.Noel Stanton died in 2009, aged 82. His funeral procession attracted huge crowds on to the streets of Northampton, where screens beamed out footage of his fire-and-brimstone baptisms. By then, the church had about 3,500 members around the UK, as well as drop-in “Jesus Centres” in Coventry and Northampton, which offered services to homeless people, asylum seekers and sex workers. Before his death, Stanton had become a distant figure, spending much of his time alone at New Creation Farm, handing down his rules through the network of elders, appointing five leaders called the Apostolic Group, who took over after his death.Stanton’s death did not mark a clean break with the past: the culture he created endured, and the darker aspects of the Jesus Fellowship’s history would not go away. In 2010, a volunteer gardener described by a judge as a “relentless paedophile” was found guilty of indecent assault against three young boys while living in the fellowship in the late 1990s. He had previous child sexual abuse convictions, and it became clear in the course of the investigation that the fellowship had not been conducting proper background checks.It seemed plausible that similar cases might emerge. Public awareness of historic abuse was rising, especially after revelations about Jimmy Savile in 2012. Concerned about the future costs of legal battles with former members, in 2013 the company that insured the fellowship and its businesses requested that the leadership take an unusual step: to ask its members for stories of abuse. (In the same year, the Methodist church started a similar process.) The leadership began gathering their responses in a file.Separately, the following year, police received two safeguarding referrals in quick succession that highlighted welfare concerns within the fellowship. They arranged a meeting on 2 December 2014, to discuss one of them with the group’s leadership. This was the kind of routine meeting that would normally be attended only by a junior officer, but two referrals from a single organisation raised a red flag for DI Ally White, so he decided to come along. At the meeting, White spotted a thick stack of papers: 133 responses sent in by fellowship members. He asked if he could take a look, and, flicking through, was shocked by what he saw. The papers contained allegations of everything from emotional abuse to serial sexual abuse: “That’s a crime, that’s a crime, that’s a rape, that’s another crime,” he remembered thinking. He told the leadership the police would need to take the forms back to the station, and they agreed.View image in fullscreenPhilippa Barnes today.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianWhite set a detective to work cataloguing them, and in early 2015 Northamptonshire police launched Operation Lifeboat, with five officers working under his supervision. “I had never seen anything like it,” White said of the scale of the allegations. “But then I don’t know of any other organisation like the Jesus Fellowship.” At the time, on a national level, the fellowship was generallylooked upon as an odd, but largelybenevolent organisation that helped vulnerable people. Only months earlier, the Jesus Army had featured on a Grayson Perry series about contemporary Britain, described as a “strong community” that helped homeless people. Perry said his evening with the group had been “like a 1950s family Christmas”.DC Mark Allbright, who worked on Operation Lifeboat, grew up in Northamptonshire, and knew the Jesus Army by sight: “Multicoloured camouflage-type jackets, colourful vans. You’d cross the street to avoid them in the town centre, that sort of thing.” Yet the contents of the file still came as a shock, both because of the sheer number of alleged victims and the fact that the majority of them had been children. “The culture was a recipe for disaster,” Allbright told me. It was also clear to him that when abuse was reported, it wasn’t dealt with: “The accused was pretty much asked to say sorry to the person, and then that was that.”As police tracked down members and looked for evidence of crimes, Allbright’s impression was that while some of the leadership wanted to “root this out”, others had “shall we say, selective memories”. After another appeal by police, the number of reports had almost doubled, but most came from people who had seen or heard about abuse rather than experienced it themselves. Some alleged victims couldn’t be traced; others, when contacted, denied that anything had happened, or didn’t want police action to be taken.In total, only five people were convicted as part of Operation Lifeboat. The details of those convictions were disturbing: four of the five perpetrators had targeted children under the age of 16, and several were shown to be prolific. The fellowship commissioned an independent review into its safeguarding practices in 2015, yet itcontinued to blamethese cases on a criminal minority, rather than a wider culture of abuse. The Jesus Army, they implied, had simply had the misfortune of attracting a few bad apples.In the two decades after she left the fellowship, Philippa built herself a life, plank by plank. She married, had children and lived in Germany for a year. Moving on had meant blocking out thoughts and news of the fellowship – she didn’t even know Operation Lifeboat had taken place – but the cult still cast a shadow. She found it hard to stand up for herself, having had it drummed into her that individual wants were sinful.By 2017, she had moved back to Northamptonshire and was raising her two boys as a single mother, working as an administrative assistant in a school. Having noticed that a few other former members were living in the area, Philippa had an idea. Her older sister, who also lived nearby, struggled to connect with people who didn’t share their history, but maybe, Philippa thought, she would feel more comfortable with people who did. In 2017, Philippa created a Facebook group, as a place where those who had also been in the fellowship as children could catch up and socialise. Within a week, more than 100 people had joined. As members reconnected and shared their memories, the tone quickly grew darker, as individuals began to share stories of abuse they had experienced while in the fellowship. So many allegations of physical, sexual and emotional abuse were being shared that Philippa and a few other group members set up a spreadsheet to keep track of them.A few months after the group was created, some of the members went out for dinner to catch up. “We were just talking and getting to know each other again,” Philippa recalls. But through the evening, the conversation kept returning to the same themes: that former fellowship members needed more support, and that something had to be done about the abuse allegations. Based on what they were hearing now, Operation Lifeboat had barely scratched the surface.The Northampton Jesus centre.Photograph: WikimediaIn 2018, 10 people from the group, including Philippa, launched the Jesus Fellowship Survivors Association, aiming to expose the truth about the church, support survivors and get justice for those who had been abused. Instead of pushing for a public inquiry or trying to bring multiple cases to court, a solicitor suggested that they should pressure the church to set up a “redress scheme”, like the one launched in response to abuse allegations atLambeth children’s homes. The Jesus Fellowship was believed to be worth about £58m, and a scheme like this would allow former members to apply for compensation without having to pursue a criminal case.One of the women who played a vital role in the fight for compensation was Becky Ayers. She had been brought into the fellowship as a seven-year-old child in 1976 and left in her 20s. Now, with one or two other members of the survivors’ association, she began attending gruelling monthly meetings in a nondescript office block in Northampton, in which they tried to convince the fellowship’s trustees to set up a redress scheme. At one meeting, Ayers presented a “Truth Document”, compiled by the survivors’ association, which set out all the allegations that had been made on the Facebook page. She pushed the trustees to show it to the fellowship’s membership. They refused.“They were all completely entrenched,” Ayers said. She is an articulate, confident speaker, but in those meetings, she would freeze up, lose her words, even wonder if she had it all wrong. But the sheer number of survivors’ stories, along with therapy sessions from a cult specialist, kept her going. Frustrated by the slow progress on a redress scheme, the survivors’ association also began planning a group civil claim for “sexual, physical and psychological harm” against children who lived in community houses.By this point, the fellowship was coming under pressure from all sides. In 2017, leaders had been forced to acknowledge at the church’s AGM that there were “serious allegations” against Stanton of financial, spiritual and sexual abuse. Later that year, the Apostolic Five stepped down, pending an independent investigation into their handling of abuse allegations. (In a recent statement, the Apostolic Five said they “continue to hold out an unreserved apology to anyone who has been affected by abuse and failings of any kind in the Jesus Fellowship”.) Meanwhile, membership had dwindled to fewer than 1,000 people and was ageing rapidly, which was hitting the group’s finances. As a senior leader told a new BBC documentary, Inside the Cult of the Jesus Army, there was a growing feeling that the fellowship was “too broken to fix”.On 26 May 2019, at the recommendation of the church’s leadership team, the fellowship’s members voted to revoke the church’s constitution: to shut the church down. The Jesus Fellowship Community Trust would be tasked with winding it up and moving ahead with a redress scheme.After years of fighting, this should have been a landmark moment for the survivors’ association. But Philippa remembers it differently: “There was never a point where we went: ‘Yay, they’re closing down!’ It was a big achievement, but it was a side-effect of the fact they were going to have to pay out to people who they’d abused. That’s not a happy thing.”The redress scheme was finally launched in September 2022. Former members could apply for compensation for emotional, physical or sexual abuse by submitting a statement via a solicitor. Kathleen Hallisey, who represented some of the claimants, believes the scheme would never have come about, nor had the reach it did, without the survivors’ association. Previous appeals to speak had come from the church itself, or police. This time, it came from fellow survivors. The redress scheme received applications from 601 people, almost three times the number of complaints received by Operation Lifeboat.Claimants could also apply for a “community adverse experiences” payment, which didn’t require a solicitor’s input. These payments were compensation for the group’s “systemic failings” – separating children from their parents, denying social interaction, treating women as subordinates – rather than specific acts of abuse. It was an acknowledgment that the fellowship environment was, in itself, harmful. (In UK law, there is no clear way to hold cults to account for their systems of control and exploitation. Hallisey, Stein and members of the survivors’ association are pushing for the most applicable crime,coercive control, to be extended to cover groups, rather than just intimate or family relationships.)The redress scheme’s final report, published in September 2024, was staggering. It found that there were 264 alleged abusers within the fellowship, of whom more than half were leaders. One in six children who lived in community was estimated to have been abused between 1969 and 2019. Over 30 allegations related to Stanton himself. The trustees wrote: “Harm and abuse were not limited to a handful of leaders, a particular period of time, or geographical locations. It was widespread and systematic.”Of applicants to the scheme, 96% received some form of redress. Yet for some, the process, which involved reliving their abuse in order to make statements, was bruising. “The scheme was horrific to go through,” Philippa said. “After all that work, when it came to it, it was very, very hard.” Payments ranged from £2,000 for corporal punishment to £50,000 for incidents of rape. Philippa received a total of £22,000. Despite the size of the fellowship’s assets, at the time of the report the redress scheme had paid out £7.7m, compared with more than £100m paid out by the Lambeth scheme, which received only twice as many applicants.Others felt that the structure of the scheme didn’t reflect the reality of their experience. Sasha Feaver-Roche knew Philippa as a child, and was part of the fellowship for decades, yet because she hadn’t lived in community for the required three months, she didn’t qualify for this adverse experience payment. This meant that she had to apply only for individual redress, and demonstrate that she had suffered abuse, rather than receiving an acknowledgment that daily life in the cult – where she was branded a “Jezebel”, told to submit to her husband, and singled out by Noel Stanton for being Black – was harmful in itself. It was “a bitter pill to swallow”, she said. “Because the fellowship’s control – that was the worst bit. That’s the bit I’m still trying to live with today.”The D3 bus from Northampton winds past fields of sunflowers and sandstone houses, down into Bugbrooke, past the chapel where the Jesus Fellowship began, past New Creation Hall, past the road to New Creation Farm and Shalom farmhouse, and on to Daventry, where Philippa lives now. “Sometimes it feels surreal, being back here,” she told me recently, as we sat in her living room. “There are lots of ghosts. But I realised I had been running away for a long time, and I wanted to be near my family again.”I first spoke to Philippa in 2022. The fellowship had closed, the redress scheme had just launched, and yet she still didn’t feel she’d entirely left the cult. “Living in it was like living under Big Brother,” she told me then. “I still don’t think I have completely uncoupled from that eye that was watching you all the time. And I don’t know whether I ever will.”Three years on, she no longer felt that way. “In the past few years, I feel I have properly mentally left,” she said. “I’ve made more progress in the past eight months than I have in the past decade.” Trauma therapy helped. Another factor was realising that she has been a good parent. “My sons can cry, or can say when something’s not right, and we can chat about it.” That knowledge has healed some of the pain she carried from childhood of being told not to ask for help from her parents, of being told that her parents were not her parents any more. Last month, along with other survivors, Philippa attended a screening in Sheffield of theBBC’s new documentary on the fellowship, which she participated in. “The feeling of relief was immense,” she said of seeing the story play out on screen. “I had been carrying that burden by myself for all that time.”These days, Philippa is a bubbly, friendly presence, fond of bright colours and quick to smile. Upstairs in her house, she showed me the craft room she set up earlier this year, and her artworks, made using pebbles found on the beach, pressed flowers, the foil from chocolate coins, the bells from Lindt bunnies. On an enormous canvas, the tail of a peacock was forming, each feather a recycled wrapper: Rowntree’s, Jack Wills, pain relief patches. “I take old things to make new things,” she said. “I suppose I have a knack for that.”Some of the fellowship’s congregations continue to operate as independent churches, and there are still those who look back on it fondly. On Facebook groups called “Jesus Army ‘The Good Times’” and “Jesus People Alumni”, former members swap stories and faded photos of group meals and worship sessions. Not long ago, I spoke with a member of one of these groups, Aidan. The fellowship had its flaws, he said – it was “too trusting”, and he took part in the redress scheme based on some of his own experiences – but he was saddened by the idea of it being remembered as wholly negative. “Living in community really broadened your horizons,” he said. “I feel massively enriched by the people that I met.” He pointed to those it had helped: “The people helped out of addiction, the lonely brought into the family.” Even fierce critics of the fellowship sometimes struck a wistful or ambivalent note when speaking about it. “As much as I hate the place, there’s that feeling of community that you miss,” said Feaver-Roche. “That feeling of belonging.”She and Philippa reconnected during the redress scheme, and now they live around the corner from one another. They often meet up for coffee and talk about the fellowship, or other aspects of their lives: “For me, it’s been really important to hang on to these friendships. They’re a reminder that what happened to us wasn’t normal,” Feaver-Roche said. When she sees ex-members, “We’ll make little inside jokes about The Handmaid’s Tale, because the language was so similar.”From Lagos to Winchester: how a divisive Nigerian pastor built a global followingRead moreOver the years, Philippa has returned again and again to that moment when she decided to testify on behalf of her friend. “I’m really proud of that 17-year-old self, who went to court and had the courage to tell the truth,” she said. Philippa still wonders where she found that conviction to stand up to the leadership, after years of indoctrination so deep it has taken a lifetime to undo.The answer, Stein suggested, lies in the kinds of reciprocal, human connections the cult did its best to smother, like the one Philippa had with Marie, or her dad, or her brother or, later, with other survivors. “Cults can have very powerful control, but they can’t turn people into robots,” Stein said. “We’re still human. And even in the worst of circumstances, we create these little niches of humanity.” In Philippa’s kitchen, a red and white sign hangs by the sink. “In this home,” it reads, “we are family.”* Name has been changedListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readReligionPsychologyNorthamptonChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We know this because she posted about it to her 1 million Instagram followers, because everyone saw her personalised shin pad adorned with her wedding photo, and because she joked last week that she still hadn’t got her husband, Scott, a card.But then Kelly has always had a rare gift for catching the eye.Her shirt-waving celebrationat Wembley remains the defining image of the Euro 2022 triumph. Her trademark headband renders her instantly recognisable in a squad full of above-average-height blond women. Her hop-skip penalty run-up is unique. In a profession where many are naturally wary of being seen to court attention, Kelly is luxuriantly comfortable with being the focus of your gaze. As her teammate Esme Morgan puts it: “She just doesn’t really care what people think.”England and Spain meet again but a lot has changed since 2023 World Cup finalRead moreBeing England’s unashamed icon and an effortless content generator comes with clear off-pitch benefits. Be real: who here can name the wedding date of any other Lioness? Who here can imitate a typical Lauren Hemp penalty run-up? How many Jess Park goal celebrations have you seen commemorated in a tattoo? But of course the benefits can be felt on the field too, and so far this month England have been merrily reaping them.There is a counterfactual history of England’s Euro 2025 to be written in which Kelly does not post herastonishing social media tiradeagainst Manchester City at the end of January. In which she does not get themove to Arsenalthat rescues her career, does not win back her England place, does not rescue thequarter-final against Swedenor score thewinning goal against Italy. And – quite frankly – it is a history in which England’s players are watching Sunday’s final from their sofas.Frozen out by Gareth Taylor at Manchester City, out of contract in the summer, handed one league start all season, Kelly was ready to walk away from the game. City were prepared to let her go on loan to Brighton. Kelly wanted to join Manchester United. City were unwilling to lose her to a rival. Result: deadlock. And with just hours remaining of the January transfer window, a deadlock Kelly realised she was going to have to break herself.“While I can’t control someone’s negative behaviour towards me, I can control how long I am prepared to tolerate it,” Kelly wrote in an Instagram post very clearly self-penned. “To be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental wellbeing. Our dreams can be crushed while we live in silence.”Kelly’s outspokenness was immediately rewarded with a last-gasp move to Arsenal. And yet to burn her bridges with City so publicly was a decision fraught with risk, but also a measure of her need to dictate terms rather than have them dictated to her, to act rather than let things drift, to determine her own fate. After the Italy game, someone asked Kelly who had made her the person she is today. “Myself,” she answered.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly scored England’s winner against Germany in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PABut of course this will surprise nobody familiar with Kelly’s game. Aged 20, she stunned Arsenal by leaving permanently for Everton, walking out on her first club and her home town in search of first-team football. In her first full season at Everton she played through an ankle injury as the club languished near the bottom of the WSL. It was, as she would later admit, “selfish because I should have let someone else play who was 100%. But unselfish because I needed to help the team.”It was telling, too, that when she was dropped by Sarina Wiegman for the February internationals, she told the media she would “fight to get my shirt back”. Nottheshirt.Myshirt. And even if Wiegman’s decision was quickly reversed after an injury to Beth Mead, there was a brutal clarity there, a simple task with a simple outcome. Problem: you’re not playing enough. Solution: start playing more. Bonus solution:win Champions League.Of course, before Sunday’s final there will be significant pressure on Wiegman to find a place for Kelly – and her revelatory Arsenal teammate Michelle Agyemang – in the starting XI. “Don’t fix what isn’t broken, it’s working,” the former Lioness Rachel Daly said on her podcast on Wednesday, a statement that raised the question: is it really working? But Daly did also make a good point about the value of players who can change a game late on, when legs are tiring and the stakes are at their terrifying highest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She grew up playing in the five-a-side cages of west London, a true street footballer. “She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her,” Morgan says.They call themselves the “finishers”,the “positive clique”, complete with finger-clicking celebration and even their own WhatsApp group.And whatever situation England find themselves in on Sunday, they will need Kelly, just as they will need Agyemang, Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton. It is why Wiegman spends so much time working with the fringe players, why the starters often make a point of staying out after training to support them while they do their extra fitness work.At the start of this year, you would have got pretty long odds on Kelly playing a starring role this summer. But of course Kelly has previous here too.Three years ago she missed almost an entire season with a cruciate ligament injury, and didn’t take the field again until April. We all know how that summer ended. Kelly knows better than most than it’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The former has recovered from a hamstring tear, sustained against New Zealand late last year, to become his side’s leading bowler this summer. He sits at the top of the series’ wicket-taking charts with 16 at an average of 24.75.Duckett and Crawley’s 166-run stand hurts India on England’s dominant dayRead moreAsked if he saw similarities with Stokes now and the bowler from a few years ago, when South Africawere ripped apartat Newlands in 2020 with three late match-winning wickets, Crawley replied: “There are so many similarities to that pace-wise.”.“He was bowling quickly back then and he’s got that pace back now. And the way he gets that away movement from the right-handers, that zip, which is as much as anyone in the world. He gets that bounce and he’s a proper wicket-taker, and he can make things happen. That was certainly the case when I first came into the side back then, and he seems to have got that back now, which is a phenomenal effort considering the injuries he’s had. And, well, he’s a little bit older now, so a phenomenal effort.”Crawley’s opening stand of 166 with Ben Duckett on Thursday came after the pair had been involved ina tetchy exchangewith the Indian fielders on the third evening at Lord’s, taking their time as Crawley faced one over before the close. India’s captain, Shubman Gill, questioned whether England’s behaviour had been “in the spirit of the game”.“I sit in my spot until the umpires go out, and I saw the umpires go out and I walked out. I wasn’t aware that we were 90 seconds late, but fair enough,” said Crawley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m just not at the level of those guys when they attack. It showed at the end when they went pretty hard up there.”While Onley continued to confound expectations, ghosts were laid by Pogacar, whoselast visit to La Loze in 2023when he uttered the infamous words “I’m gone, I’m dead” ended in a catastrophic defeat by Vingegaard. This time, it was the Slovenian that left the Dane behind, the Emirates XRG rider attacking in the final 500m to distance both Vingegaard and the inexhaustible Onley on the climb’s steepest grades.Quick GuideFinal mountain stage shortened after cattle disease outbreakShowFriday's Stage 19 of the Tour de France has been shortened after an outbreak of contagious nodular dermatitis in cattle near the Col des Saisies forced authorities to cull livestock and restrict access to the area, race organisers said on Thursday.The 129.9km stage from Albertville to La Plagne was due to include the ascent of the Col des Saisies, but the climb has now been scrapped to avoid the affected zone, ASO said in a statement.\"In light of the distress experienced by the affected farmers and in order to preserve the smooth running of the race, it has been decided, in agreement with the relevant authorities, to modify the route,\" ASO said.The ceremonial start will take place as planned in Albertville, followed by a 7km neutralised section before the official start an hour later than planned. Riders will rejoin the original course shortly before Beaufort, at the 52.4km mark of the initial route.As a result, the stage will now be reduced to 95km. The shortened stage still finishes in La Plagne and comes just two days before the Tour concludes in Paris on Sunday.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Vingegaard may still cling to the dream of an unlikely victory, but Pogacar now seems keen for it to end. “It’s not over yet and I will try my best tomorrow, the day after and the day after, to keep my lead,” he said, before adding: “I cannot wait that it’s all over.“This is the point where I ask myself: ‘Why am I still here?’ It’s so long these three weeks. You just count the kilometres to Paris, but I try to enjoy every day on the bike as much as I can. The fans really help. It’s still nice to ride, even in the third week, when you’re all tired and annoyed by everybody around you, and you just want to go home.”Quick GuideLizzie Deignan retiresShowLizzie Deignan has announced her immediate retirement from professional cycling after sharing news that she and husband, Phil, are expecting their third child. The 36-year-old former world champion had previously said 2025 would be her final season but has now called time on a career in which she recorded 43 professional wins, among them victories at Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders and the Women’s Tour. Deignan took the world title in 2015, a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2014 and Olympic silver at the London Games in 2012.Deignan took a career break in 2018 for the birth of her daughter, Orla, returning to win a second Women's Tour title in 2019 before her victories at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and La Course by Le Tour de France followed in 2020, and a brilliant solo win in the first Paris-Roubaix Femmes came in 2021. A second career break came in 2022 for the birth of her son, Shea.Deignan's last race was the Copenhagen Sprint last month, which came a couple of weeks after she competed in the Tour of Britain Women for the last time. Speaking before that race, Deignan said she was proud to have been part of an era of unprecedented growth in women's cycling. She said part of what had kept her racing on was the growth of new races that she wanted to be part of, having not had those opportunities earlier in her career.\"I think if I had retired any earlier than now I would have had regrets, definitely, sitting at home watching all these opportunities unfold,\" Deignan said. \"I can be really proud and pleased with the last five, six years of my career where I've got to feel truly like a professional, to be respected and to have opportunities equal to the men.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.O’Connor does not win often but when he does, it is on the biggest of stages. As the Australian, riding for Jayco–AlUla, ground his way towards the mist-shrouded finish line, the 29-year-old, winner of a similarly cold and damp Alpinestage to Tignes in 2021, let out an exultant cry.It was, as Vingegaard admitted later, a “brutal” stage. “Five hours in the saddle,” he said. “I’m not sure I’ve ever done such a hard stage in the Tour before.”View image in fullscreenBen O’Connor broke away to win Thursday’s stage.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersEven before the stage began, Pogacar and Visma-Lease a bike had been at odds after the defending champion collided with one of his rival’s team cars as he rode to the start in Vif. “We were going to the start line, cruising behind the car,” Pogacar said. “Maybe he wanted to check my brakes. I was not ready because I didn’t see any reason that he wanted to stop urgently, so I crashed into the car. But it’s OK.”Clearly the Slovenian suffered no ill effects. Whatever they throw him, he is just too strong for his rivals. With one more summit finish to come, on Friday at La Plagne, it would take an unprecedented collapse for him now to lose the race.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceTadej PogacarCyclingAustralia sportJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

The Sweden striker has not travelled with his teammates on a pre-season tour to Asia and is looking into his options.Isak has long been interested in joining Liverpool but the possibility of it happening this summer is remote. The striker has a contract until 2028 and the Premier League champions would need to raise funds through sales to afford a player valued at about £120m.Liverpool sign Hugo Ekitiké in £79m deal after fending off late Manchester United bidRead moreLiverpool signed another striker, Hugo Ekitiké, this week for £79m after concluding that Isak was out of reach. They may prioritise a centre-back over another forward. Newcastle had also been interested in Ekitiké but missed out after also failing to lure Liam Delap, who preferred to join Chelsea from Ipswich. Newcastle retain an interest in Yoane Wissa and have bid for the Brentford forward.Isakmissed a friendly at Celticlast Saturday and was left out of the 30-man squad that travelled to Asia because of what Newcastle described as a minor thigh injury. Eddie Howe’s side will play Arsenal in Singapore on Sunday and then face two fixtures in South Korea, against a K League XI and Tottenham.Howe said after the Celtic game of Isak’s absence: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”Newcastle have no desire to sell Isak as they prepare for a Champions League campaign. There has been an eagerness at the club to extend and improve Isak’s contract, after he scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League games to help the team finish fifth, but the 25-year-old has shown little enthusiasm for the idea.View image in fullscreenCristhian Mosquera, pictured in Arsenal kit for the first time, can play anywhere along the backline.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArsenalhave made the Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera their fifth signing of the summer, taking the club’s spending to close to £140m.

Horner had been in charge of Red Bull since 2005 but had come increasingly under pressure after thedeath of Red Bull’s co-founder Dietrich Mateschitzin 2022. Horner had been embroiled in a scandal involving accusations of inappropriate behaviour made against him by an employee, thoughhe was cleared by an investigation.Speaking before the Belgian Grand Prix, Verstappen revealed he had been told half a day in advance of Horner’s exit. “The last one and a half years have not gone how we would have liked and management decided they wanted to steer the ship in a different direction,” he said.“Management and, of course, the shareholders decided that they wanted a change. They run the team and I’m the driver so whatever they decide it’s fully in their right to do what they want.”His father, Jos, was a key figure in wanting Horner gone but Verstappen, who has won all four of his titles with Horner in charge, maintained he was still on friendly terms with his former boss. “The relationship between myself and Christian, that doesn’t change,” he said. “Of course he’s not here now and we’re doing a race again but it’s still like a second family to me.”Keeping Verstappen at Red Bull was likely to be one of the key reasons behind Horner’s dismissal, with the world champion known to havealready been involved in talks with Mercedes. Red Bull have been underperforming for 18 months and Verstappen was deeply unhappy having already conceded he was out of the title fight this season. However, he denied it would influence any decision about his future.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen (right) has won all his world titles under Christian Horner at Red Bull.Photograph: PA Wire/PA“No, it doesn’t, really,” he said. “I don’t think it will matter at all for my decision in the future. The last one and a half years have not been where we want to be. Now we try and be more competitive.”Horner was replaced by Laurent Mekies, the principal of their sister team, Racing Bulls, who will face the media for the first time on Friday.Lewis Hamilton, who joined F1 just two years after Horner took over at Red Bull, paid tribute to what he had achieved.“The team has been incredible, to see the progress,” he said. “I sat with Christian back in 2005. I remember sitting in his office, I was in Formula Three but looking to go into GP2 for its first year and I remember sitting with him.“I won’t say we hit it off from the get-go but to have seen his progression and his career, it was clearly remarkable what he did with the team, with a huge group of amazing people. And to really run an organisation that big and that well takes talent and skill, and that’s what he brought to the team.”Explore more on these topicsMax VerstappenRed BullFormula OneMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

It was almost inevitable that they would face each other once again. Two nations whose journeys seem intrinsically linked at this point; two nations whose rise has changed and disrupted the historic order of the women’s game.While England’s recent achievements may have come a few years earlier than Spain’s, the comparisons between the two are clear. While the Lionesses have more historic success – they reached the European Championship final in 1984 and 2009 and have been among the final four in their last six tournaments – their feats in the full-time era of the game are mirrored. They lifted their first major trophies within 12 months of each other –England in 2022,Spain in 2023– and over the last three years, both have proved they have the squad and resources that could maintain this success for years to come, despite growth in the sport elsewhere.Two years have passed since they last came head to head in a major tournament. The 2023 World Cup final was a historic moment for both nations with Spain eventually claiming the ultimate prize.La Rojawere the better team that day, despite the narrow scoreline. They dominated the midfield area and tactically outsmarted the Lionesses in Sydney, pouncing on their naivety pushing forward and being clinical when it mattered. Olga Carmona’s winner was a perfect example of the quality of their execution.View image in fullscreenOlga Carmona’s goal was the difference between the two sides in 2023.Photograph: Cameron Spencer/Getty ImagesWhen you dig into the stats, however, there was perhaps a little less between them than on first viewing. Spain controlled the ball and created more opportunities, but they registered only two more shots on target than their opponents. It was an illustration that, despite their different brands of football, there is little between them in the big moments.Neither are the same since they met that day in August 2023. Spanish football faced a reckoning in the wake of that final. The actions of the then president of the Spanish football federation (RFEF), Luis Rubiales – boththe kiss that he forced on Jenni Hermosoandhis reaction to the backlash– tarnished the celebrations and finally forced through the changes many of the players had been asking for for so long. That it took that incident to happen in front of the world before they were listened to remains a stain on RFEF. While much has improved, there is still a long way to go for the game to reach parity domestically.Under Montse Tomé,La Rojahave developed their technical style of play even further. In Aitana Bonmatí, Alexia Putellas and Patri Guijarro, they possess three of the best midfielders in world football, all capable of unlocking defences. But they have also developed different threats. The return of Esther González, coming in as the starting No 9, has allowed them to add a directness to their play that they did not previously possess. The quality of the long balls, either from the central defenders or predominantly Carmona at left-back, has added a new dimension to their game. The introduction of Clàudia Pina and the 18-year-old Vicky López, plus the constant success of the youth pathway, also demonstrates that there is a succession plan in place.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman embraces Lucy Bronze after England’s extra-time win over Italy.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockEngland have undergone a transition of their own, a regeneration of sorts, with several young players securing permanent spots in the senior squad. While many of Sarina Wiegman’s stalwarts from her four years at the helm remain – Leah Williamson, Georgia Stanway and Alessia Russo for example – new faces have come in and their strength in depth, particularly in creative areas, has continued to increase. Despite some inconsistent form, they have developed a more robust and adaptable style of play and, as seen so far this tournament, they can rely on the versatility of their players to come on and change a game. Michelle Agyemang’s rise through the ranks epitomises this. The 19-year-old received her first call up in April but has made her impact off the bench with three goals in four appearances.In their two meetings since August 2023, they have won one apiece. For England,February’s win at Wembleyin the Nations League will have filled them with confidence that they can find a gameplan to frustrate and beat Spain.La Roja’s victory in Juneproved that they equally have the tools to come out on top. Sunday’s game in Basel will be a fascinating tactical battle between two teams and two managers at the peak of their powers. It really is anyone’s guess who will be the one to take home the main prize.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She won the 2017 Euros with her homeland and led the Netherlands to the 2019 World Cup final, before taking charge of the Lionesses. On Thursday, Bullingham said the FA would not entertain any approaches for her services.“She has been incredible and her record of managing in five tournaments and reaching five finals is phenomenal,” he said at England’s hotel base in Zurich. “I don’t believe anyone has been anywhere near that in the past and I think it will be really hard to do that in the future.“Her connection with everyone is so special. Every single individual member of staff coming into this camp felt valued by her – everyone’s in it together. She’s really helped build a very, very strong culture, not just amongst players but the whole support team.”Asked how hard it would be to keep Wiegman, Bullingham replied: “Not hard at all. We are committed to her until 2027 and she is committed to us.” He said Wiegman was “not for sale” and, asked whether that was the case at any price, he replied: “No price at all. She’s just a very special coach. She’s performed so well at the highest level, keeping that calm composure, keeping the connection with the players and managing the games really well.View image in fullscreenSarina Wiegman poses with the trophy after England won the Women’s Euro 2022 final against Germany.Photograph: Leila Coker/AP“She is just a cool head in the way she transmits that on to the pitch. She looks like the coolest person in the stadium and I have no doubts that helps in critical moments … We are lucky to have her.”Bullingham was also asked whether Wiegman could be under consideration to succeed Thomas Tuchel in the men’s England job. “My answer is the same now as it was in 2023,” he said. “The starting point is it is almost disrespectful to assume the men’s job is more senior to the women’s. That is not the way we view it. I said two years ago Sarina could do ‘any job in football’. She is an amazing talent.”Bullingham was speaking for the first time since the England defender Jess Carter revealed she had received racist abuse on social media during Euro 2025. It is not the first time racism has been directed towards England players in relation to a major tournament, with Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka sent racial abuse in the wake of England’s Euro 2020 final loss against Italy.Bullingham appeared unhappy with a lack of progress from large social media companies in tackling the issue, saying: “We did think things would improve and we lobbied very hard together with Kick It Out and other representatives in football to make sure the Online [Safety] Act came through.“I think now it’s incumbent on Ofcom to make sure they really do bring those responsible for running social media platforms to account and I haven’t seen huge progress in the last couple of years.

There has been a lot of focus on taking down content and I think they could be better at taking down content but, more importantly, they could be much better at preventing it as well and then aiding prosecution when it happens.”Asked whether the FA would be prepared to boycott social media platforms if the abuse continued, Bullingham said: “We did that in the past; we had a day when we boycotted for a day. I think we’ll look at any tool within our disposal, to make a difference. I think what you’ve got now, that’s different to before, is you’ve got the Online Safety Act.

This stadium, which was packed to the rafters here, was a building site and on the field Wakefield were sleepwalking towards relegation.Embattled Salford players out to avoid tag of Super League’s worst ever teamRead moreBut in the end, the year they spent in the Championship in 2024 may prove to be the biggest blessing in disguise. It allowed the club to rebuild, overhaul their Belle Vue home and, with the backing of new owner Matt Ellis, emerge as a potential giant in the game again.Not since 1968 have Wakefield been champions of England. That wait for a league title may not end this year but the fact it is a possibility, given the way things were here as recently as two years ago, is credit to Ellis, the club’s head coach, Daryl Powell, and this talented Trinity squad.Here, in front of the biggest crowd this stadium has seen for more than a decade, Lino’s drop goal with the final kick of a pulsating contest proved to be the difference to see offLeeds Rhinos, who themselves could have moved level on points with second-placed Wigan had they emerged victorious.They had their chances but in the end Trinity held their nerve when it mattered most to move back into the top six. With a favourable run-in to the end of the regular season, it is now possible that Wakefield could be in the playoffs later this year for the first time since 2012.View image in fullscreenSam Lisone scores Leeds’ first try to level up the scores in the first half of their Super League game with Wakefield.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAAnd if Wakefield do make the top six, a rerun of this West Yorkshire rivalry would be a fitting end-of-season showdown. The scores were level for most of the evening, with the two sides unable to be split at half-time as Sam Lisone’s try for Leeds cancelled out Lachlan Walmsley’s fine effort for Trinity.That, coupled with two goals apiece from the boots of Max Jowitt and Jake Connor, made it 8-8 at the interval. And with defences firmly on top throughout, it felt as though the contest was destined to go down to the wire all evening long.Leeds will probably look back on this, and the way the final stages unfolded, as a missed opportunity. “I’m extremely proud of their effort,” their coach, Brad Arthur, said. “Their fight was strong but when you put that much effort in you really should come away with something.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leeds’ Brodie Croft came close to kicking the winning drop goal with a minute remaining, before Lino then went one better to spark rapturous scenes in this particular part of West Yorkshire.On this evidence, do not rule out more celebrations like these come the business end of the season, too.

Only five other women have played in five Rugby World Cups before. New Zealand’s Anna Richards and Fiao’o Fa’amausili, Scotland’s Donna Kennedy, Canada’s Gillian Florence and the USA’s Patty Jervey all starred in five tournaments during their careers.“More than experience, she understands the legacy of the Red Roses,” Mitchell said of Scarratt. “Along with that experience she brings leadership to younger players. She doesn’t necessarily need to be in the leadership group because she leads by her example. She is very calm. She wants to leave the Red Roses in a better place.”Zoe Aldcroft, who was named England captain in January, will lead the host nation’s squad of 14 backs and 18 forwards into the tournament, with England kicking off against the USA in Sunderland on 22 August.Quick GuideEngland squad for 2025 Women's Rugby World CupShowForwardsZoe Aldcroft (Gloucester-Hartpury, 63 caps)Lark Atkin-Davies (Bristol Bears, 66 caps)Sarah Bern (Bristol Bears, 71 caps)Hannah Botterman (Bristol Bears, 56 caps)Abi Burton (Trailfinders Women, 2 caps)May Campbell (Saracens, 3 caps)Mackenzie Carson (Gloucester-Hartpury, 21 caps)Kelsey Clifford (Saracens, 13 caps)Amy Cokayne (Sale Sharks, 83 caps)Maddie Feaunati (Exeter Chiefs, 15 caps)Rosie Galligan (Saracens, 24 caps)Lilli Ives Campion (Loughborough Lightning, 2 caps)Sadia Kabeya (Loughborough Lightning, 21 caps)Alex Matthews (Gloucester-Hartpury, 75 caps)Maud Muir (Gloucester-Hartpury, 40 caps)Marlie Packer (Saracens, 110 caps)Morwenna Talling (Sale Sharks, 22 caps)Abbie Ward (Bristol Bears, 74 caps)BacksHolly Aitchison (Sale Sharks, 40 caps)Jess Breach (Saracens, 45 caps)Abby Dow (Unattached, 52 caps)Zoe Harrison (Saracens, 57 caps)Tatyana Heard (Gloucester-Hartpury, 29 caps)*Natasha Hunt (Gloucester-Hartpury, 80 caps)Megan Jones (Trailfinders Women, 25 caps)Ellie Kildunne (Harlequins, 52 caps)Claudia Moloney-MacDonald (Exeter Chiefs, 35 caps)Lucy Packer (Harlequins, 31 caps)Helena Rowland (Loughborough Lightning, 39 caps)*Emily Scarratt (Loughborough Lightning, 118 caps)Jade Shekells (Gloucester-Hartpury, 2 caps)Emma Sing (Gloucester-Hartpury, 8 caps)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The Gloucester-Hartpury second-row, who led England to their sixth consecutiveSix Nations title in April, said: “To lead the team into a home Rugby World Cup is an incredible feeling. This group have a fantastic opportunity to inspire young boys and girls all over the country – it’s something we have spoken about as a collective and we’re relishing the chance to do so. Pulling on the white shirt is always a massive privilege and we can’t wait to do that, backed by our amazing home support.”Mitchell has not sprung any surprises with his squad and has mixed experience with new talent. There will be eight World Cup debutants, including Abi Burton who won her first England cap in March after recovering from a life-threatening illness and Emma Sing who started England’s grand slam winning game against France in April for the injured Ellie Kildunne.Kildunne, theWorld Rugby player of the year,is also included, along with Aldcroft’s predecessor as captain, Marlie Packer, and No 8 Alex Matthews.

The local weather forecasters are predicting rain and the Australian mood is also hardening before Saturday’s second Test. This is not an obvious moment for casual flights of fancy and the intensity of the approaching battle has duly been reflected in Andy Farrell’s no-nonsense team selection.With series victory potentially just 80 minutes away, Farrell has prioritised physicality and cohesion, to the point where jokes about renaming the side the Irish & British Lions are resurfacing. There would have been 10 Ireland players in this starting XVhad Garry Ringrose not withdrawnjust before the team announcement, with a couple more in reserve for good measure.Wallabies boosted by returning Rob Valetini and Will Skelton for second Lions TestRead moreThat was almost certainly the plan all along before Ringrose was ruled out of first Test consideration with delayed concussion. The Scotland pairing of Sione Tuipulotu and Huw Jones performed well in Brisbane, with Tuipulotu supplying a first-half try, but this time Bundee Aki has been handed the 12 jersey with Jones, at the 11th hour, named at outside-centre having initially been set for the chop.While Tuipulotu is said to be nursing a slightly tight hamstring, Farrell made clear he was leaning towards Aki regardless, despite the Scot’s obvious desire to play against Australia in the city of his birth. It also breaks up the established midfield connection with Scotland’s fly-half Finn Russell but Farrell has seen more than enough of Aki over the years to know what he can bring in terms of gainline presence in major contests. “I honestly believe this is one of the biggest, if not the biggest game, we have all been involved in,” Farrell said.If there is a sense of the head coach plumping for individuals in whom he has absolute faith under screeching pressure, the same is true in the front row, where the Leinster loosehead Andrew Porter has been promoted and Ellis Genge drops to the bench. The injury absence of Joe McCarthy has reunited Ollie Chessum with his England teammate Maro Itoje in the second row but the presence of James Ryan and Ronan Kelleher on the bench means Leinster still have nine representatives in the matchday 23.View image in fullscreenGarry Ringrose (right) in action against the First Nations and Pasifika XV. He has now withdrawn from the second Test because of a knock-on concussion effect from a previous game.Photograph: David Davies/PAThe Irish contingent is still not quite up there with the record-equalling 10 Welsh players who started the third Lions Test against the Wallabies in 2013, when the whole of Ireland was up in arms at the non-selection of their talisman, Brian O’Driscoll. Warren Gatland defended that choice on the straightforward basis that Jonathan Davies was in better form and Farrell, similarly, says this week’s calls are strictly on merit.Quick GuideAustralia v British & Irish Lions second Test lineupsShowMelbourne Cricket Ground, Saturday 26 July, 8pm AEST/11am BSTAustraliaWright; Jorgensen, Suaalii, Ikitau, Potter; Lynagh, Gordon; Slipper, Porecki, Alaalatoa, Frost, Skelton, Valetini, McReight, Wilson.ReplacementsPollard, Bell, Robertson, Williams, Gleeson, Tizzano, McDermott, Donaldson.British & Irish LionsKeenan; Freeman, Jones, Aki, Lowe; Russell, Gibson-Park; Porter, Sheehan, Furlong, Itoje, Chessum, Beirne, Curry, Conan.ReplacementsKelleher, Genge, Stuart, Ryan, Morgan, Mitchell, Farrell, Kinghorn.RefereeAndrea Piardi (It)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.He also knows exactly what to expect from his son Owen, back among the replacements on the strength of one and a half games on tour. Again it feels as if Farrell Sr is factoring in the scale of the occasion in the cavernous Melbourne Cricket Ground and is surrounding himself with reassuring familiarity. “We have put ourselves in a good position after the first Test but we know there will be a massive reaction from this Wallaby team,” the head coach said.In this instance that means disappointment for Ben Earl and Marcus Smith, both now outside the matchday squad, but it has at least answered the heartfelt prayers of the small Welsh media contingent on tour, who have been waiting for Jac Morgan to give them something to write home about.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe persevering flanker has deserved his inclusion and, alongside the fit-again Blair Kinghorn and Farrell Jr, the over-arching message is clear enough. Farrell Sr freely acknowledges the Lions will need to improve on their second half in Brisbane, notwithstanding how high the Wallabies raise the bar. “We know we will have to be a lot better than last week,” he said. “We thoroughly believe we’re way better than what we showed and we’ve got another chance to prove that.”While the return of Will Skelton and Rob Valetini to the Wallaby squad gives the hosts an extra physical dimension, Farrell believes his side’s destiny remains firmly in their own hands. “Will, with his size and strength, presents different challenges to your traditional lock. It’s obvious what they’re going to bring. But the focus will be on us. We don’t want to get too distracted by what they may or may not do.”There is no ducking the magnitude of the contest, with Rugby Australia hoping for a record-breaking attendance of about 90,000, but Farrell believes it will be the nuts and bolts of Test rugby, particularly with a slippery ball, that matter most. “Doing things properly is what we have talked about all week – and the expectation that has to happen the majority of the time. We are all human and realise it is not going to be perfect all of the time … but staying on it as much as we can will give us a better chance of getting what we want.“No other Lions have done back-to-back victories in tours of the same country.

The clash was hotly anticipated but proved to be not that much of a contest, with Raducanu comfortably clinching a 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the quarter-finals of the Citi Open in Washington.Speaking on Sky Sports, Raducanu said: “I thought it was going to be a really difficult match. Naomi’s won four slams, she’s been world No 1, won Masters [titles]. She’s so dangerous and on the hard courts I think she’s particularly comfortable. I knew I was going to have to play really well and manage my own service games, which I’m really proud of how I did.Venus Williams, 45, falls short in bid for first win streak since 2019Read more“I was making some inroads in her service games after I got used to it a little bit. I’m really pleased with how I handled the ball speed and the conditions here in DC.”The result means the 22-year-old will once again overtake Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter to become the top-ranked British player as she looks to secure a seeding for next month’s US Open. Raducanu ended Boulter’s two-year run at the top of the domestic standings in June but she then slipped back to 46 in the world afterlosing a close tussle with Aryna Sabalenkain the third round of Wimbledon.Her two victories here, though, could mean Raducanu returns to the top 40, and she will definitely pass Boulter following her opening-round defeat by Maria Sakkari. It will be the Greek that Raducanu plays next, and the Briton has not dropped a set against her in their three previous meetings.Raducanu was sharp from the start against Osaka, who continues to search for a way back to the top of the game after giving birth to daughter Shai two years ago. A double fault from the Japanese gave Raducanu the first break in the fifth game and the British player was rock solid on serve as she wrapped up the opening set. Raducanu is without a coach in Washington amid uncertainty over the future of her partnership with Mark Petchey and has only her hitting partner, Alexis Canter, in her corner, but there was no lack of direction in this performance.She was helped to another break at the start of the second set by more errors from Osaka, who created a first chance on the Raducanu serve at 1-2 but could not take it. Raducanu’s serve has improved markedly under Petchey and was her key weapon here as she moved through to a third quarter-final in Washington with strong hopes of going further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Carr was hand-picked by Donald Trump to lead the FCC.Paramount Global, which owns CBS, came under fire last week after the company decided to cancel The Late Show withStephen Colbert,just a few days afterits host criticized Paramount’ for settling with Trump. Colbert called the settlement “a big, fat bribe”.In response to news of the merger on Thursday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whohas called for an investigation into Paramount’s relationship with Trumpover the Skydance merger, wrote in a social media post: “Sure looks like they paidDonald Trump$36 MILLION for this merger. Bribery is illegal no matter who is president.”Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of a close Trump ally, tech billionaire and second richest man in the world Larry Ellison.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said Carr in a statement announcing the FCC’s approval. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.”The merger came after Skydance and its investment partner, RedBird Capital, assured the FCC of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints.But that committment to diversity appears to privilege conservative viewpoints. According to Carr, Skydance “has made written commitments” promising its news network will address conservative grievances and stop all efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.Skydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.The sole Democrat on the three-person FCC committee, commissioner Anna Gomez, called the merger a “deal” that was “linked” to Paramount’s $16m settlement with the Trump administration. She also decried the decision as a move that would “erode press freedom” by “imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment”.In his statement announcing the merger, Carr added: “Approving this transaction will unleash the investment of $1.5 billion into Paramount, bolstering all aspects of its operations, including broadcast.”That is precisely the same amount Paramount agreed to pay the creators of South Park earlier this week for global streaming rights over the next five years.The first episode of the satirical animated series,broadcast on Wednesdayand now streaming on the Paramount+ app, mocked Trump as a whiny, would-be autocrat with small genitaliain bed with Satan. It also featured thinly veiled criticism of the company for settling with Trump and canceling Colbert’s show.The new South Park episode ended by ridiculing reports that its new owners had agreed to give Trump $20m in public service announcements and advertising for free. The episode concluded witha mock public service announcement, ostensibly in favor of Trump, that pictured him naked with a miniature, talking penis. “Trump, his penis is teeny-tiny”, a narrator intones, “but his love for us is large”.Robert Mackey contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS newsMergers and acquisitionsParamount+Paramount PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

The most recent official estimates show the economy contracted in April and May.The latest figures showedunemployment nudged up to 4.7% in May, hitting the highest level in four years, while wage growth slowed for a third consecutive month, and employers cut back on hiring.However, inflation is running at 3.4%, above the Bank’s 2% target. Threadneedle Street has forecast that prices growth is unlikely to fall significantly until next year.According to James Smith, an economist at ING, the latest survey figures “perfectly encapsulate the headache the Bank of England faces right now”.The flash S&P Global PMI, which covers the services and manufacturing sectors, dropped from 52 to 51 in July. A figure above 50 indicates expansion.Most of the drop was blamed on the services sector, which fell from 52.8 to 51.2, while the manufacturing output index rose to 50.Smith said: “Higher payroll taxes and a chunky rise in the national living wage back in April are exerting more significant downward pressure on staffing numbers, according to the latest PMI.“But the PMI also suggests these policy changes are keeping upward pressure on prices. We’ve seen hints of this in the [inflation] data, principally in food, where inflation rates have picked up over and above what we’ve seen in the eurozone. Pressure on staffing costs also likely explains the stickiness in hospitality inflation through the spring.’skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also predicted that a recent increase in household savings would reverse and that the more benign outlook would encourage consumers to begin spending again.Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the survey showed the UK economy was struggling to expand as it moved into the second half of the year.“Output growth weakened to a pace indicative of the economy growing at a mere 0.1% quarterly rate, with risks tilted to the downside in the coming months,” he said.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorServices sectorJob lossesEconomic growth (GDP)Tax and spendingEconomicsTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

In astatementon X, the two former Labour MPs appealed described it as “a new kind of political party, one that belongs to you”.“The system is rigged when 4.5 million children live in poverty in the sixth-richest country in the world,” it said. “The system is rigged when giant corporations make a fortune from rising bills. The system is rigged when the government says there is no money for the poor, but billions for war. We cannot accept these injustices, and neither should you.”The posts contain a link to a Your party website, leading to a page for people to sign up. The website said: “Soon, we’ll host an inaugural founding conference so you can help shape how your party works, what it stands for, and how we organise to win.”Sultana said “Your party” was only a temporary name. After a politics website said that was its name, she replied on X: “It’s not called Your Party!”According to the website’s data privacy policy, it is managed by the Peace and Justice Project, an organisation Corbyn set up. The PJP currently manages the mailing list for the new party, but it is understood that the list will be merged with an earlier one launched by Sultana once the new party is formally constituted.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Corbyn said the founding conference would hopefully take place in mid-autumn but that a date had yet to be fixed.After some earlier apparent mix-ups between him and Sultana over the new party, Corbyn said they were working very well together and in regular contact.Calling the populism of Reform UK “a road to danger”, he said : “What we’re offering instead is to bring people together so we collectively face the issues of poverty, the issues about bad housing, the issues of underfunded education, so we face those issues together.”The announcement ends a period of uncertainty that began in early June when Sultana, who became the Labour MP for Coventry South in 2019 but lost the whip shortly after last year’s election,said she was quittingthe party to co-lead a new movement with Corbyn.It's time for a new kind of political party - one that belongs to you.Sign up athttps://t.co/4acVYPvSDi.pic.twitter.com/EkJtHM2n4K— Jeremy Corbyn (@jeremycorbyn)July 24, 2025This appeared to come as a surprise to Corbyn, the former Labour leader wholost the whipin 2020 but was re-elected last year as the MP for Islington North on an independent ticket. At the time of Sultana’s announcement, he had not committed to the idea of a new party, or agreed that the pair should be co-leaders.Sultana launcheda fundraising drive and supporter sign-up page under her own name later in June, when Corbyn said only that discussions were ongoing on what would happen next.He confirmedthat he and Sultana were in talks about a new party at the start of this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are caused by an economic system that protects the interests of corporations and billionaires.“It’s time for a new kind of political party. One that is rooted in our communities, trade unions and social movements. One that builds power in all regions and nations. One that belongs to you.”Polling has suggested that the new party could gain about 10% of the vote, damaging the electoral prospects ofLabourand the Greens.

Urging the Fed chair to stand closer to him, Trump alleged that the bill for the renovations would now cost $3.1bn.“It looks like it’s about $3.1bn – it went up a little bit or a lot,” said Trump. The usually unflappable Powell looked visibly irritated, closed his eyes and shook his head. “I am not aware of that,” said Powell.Handed a piece of paper by Trump, Powell scanned it and said the new figure included the cost of renovations for the Martin Building, a different Fed office that was renovated five years ago. “It’s not new,” said Powell.Asked by a reporter what he would do if a project manager went over budget, Trump said: “I’d fire him.“Look, I would love to see it completed,” Trump said. “I don’t want to put that in this category.”The president backed away from earlier statements in which he had suggested he would fire Powell, a suggestion that has rattled stock markets. Trump said: “To do that is a big move, and I just don’t think it’s necessary, and I believe he’s going to do the right thing.”The visit to the Fed comes less than a week before the central bank’s 19 policymakers gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting, where they are widely expected to leave the central bank’s benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range.Trump has demanded that the Fed lower rates by three percentage points. Trump has repeatedly demanded that Powell slash US interest rates and has frequently raised the possibility of firing him.Ahead of Trump’s visit, Fed staff escorted a small group of reporters around the construction sites. They wove around cement mixers and construction machines, and spoke over the sound of drills, banging and saws.Fed staff pointed out security features, including blast-resistant windows, that they said were a significant driver of costs, in addition to tariffs and escalations in material and labor costs.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS politicsWashington DCJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

All five men – Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart and Cal Foote – were found not guilty on all offences. As the judge read out each decision, the men shifted in their chairs, some rubbing their temples.The charges stemmed from an encounter in a London, Ontario, hotel room in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala celebrating the team’s world junior championship victory.There were audible gasps in the courtroom at the judge’s remarks, which came more than seven years after the woman first approached police alleging she had been sexually assaulted.“A fair trial is one where decisions are made based on the evidence and the law, not on stereotypes and assumptions, and where the trial process respects the security, equality and privacy rights of the victim as well as the accused persons,” said Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham in speaking to reporters outside the courthouse following the verdict.“We will carefully review justice Carroccia’s decision, and as this case is still within the appeal period, we have no further comments to make about the decision at this time,” she added.The case cast a long shadow over Canadian hockey, placing not only the players – most of whom went on to professional careers – under scrutiny, but also Hockey Canada, which later admitted it had maintained two secret funds to pay settlements in sexual assault claims.In her remarks on Thursday, Judge Carroccia pointed out inconsistencies in the accused’s testimony, including around how much she had to drink.Dozens of protesters gathered on Thursday morning in front of the courthouse holding signs saying they believed the accuser. Some expressed concerns there would not be “justice”.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Alex Formenton, Cal Foote, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube and Carter Hart as they arrived at court in London, Ontario.Photograph: Nicole Osborne/APThe men on trial were all members of Canada’s 2018 team at the world juniors tournament for under-20s, which took home the championship that year. Players selected to play for Canada at the world juniors are typically top of the crop and in many cases have already been drafted to play in the NHL.In early 2024, police charged each man with one count of sexual assault, and McLeod with being party to an offence for allegedly aiding the assaults, after an incident on 19 June 2018 in a hotel room in Ontario. All five men pleaded not guilty.The alleged offences took place after the woman, who was 20 at the time and is identified as “EM” in the case, reportedly met McLeod at a local bar, then had what she says was consensual sex in his hotel room – only for him to invite other players to join without her consent.Text messages shown to the court indicate McLeod asked a group chat of players if anyone wanted a “three-way” and gave out his room number.EM said she was intoxicated, naked and frightened when they entered, and prosecutors alleged that EM did not consent to various sexual acts that then occurred.Over nine days of testimony in early May, the woman – now 27 – said the sudden appearance of many large men surrounding her caused her to go on “auto-pilot” andtake on a “porn star” personaas a form of self-protection. Though she said she did not explicitly say “no” or resist the alleged assaults, nor was she physically forced to participate, she said she did not consent to any of it, that she was “surprised” when the men entered and that they should have known she was intimidated.“It felt as if my mind kind of floated to the top corner of the ceiling and I just started watching everything happen,” EM told the court. “I just didn’t feel like I had any control.”Prosecutors alleged that the acts constituted sexual assault, telling the court that McLeod, Hart and Dubé obtained oral sex from the woman, McLeod had sex with her a second time, Formenton did too, Dubé slapped her naked buttocks and Foote did the splits over her head causing his genitals to “graze” her face. EM also said in her testimony that the men placed a sheet on the floor and told her to masturbate while she was slapped and spat on.The 10 defence attorneys, two allocated to each of the men, alleged in cross-examination that EM was consenting the entire night, and even taunting the men for not all wanting to have intercourse – and that if she cried it was due to feeling rejected that not everyone seemingly wanted to participate.Hart, the only one of the five men to testify in court, said he asked EM for oral sex and that was she “super excited” to be in the room and “forward” with her offers for sex. One of McLeod’s lawyers, David Humphrey,said in cross-examinationthat EM demanded sex and suggested she said to them: “Come on, you’ve got a girl here. Someone have sex with me. You guys are pussies.”EM denied saying it or asking them to have sex with her. “That doesn’t even sound like how I would usually speak,” she told the court.A central feature of the trial was two “consent videos” that McLeod recorded on his phone an hour apart after the alleged assaults occurred. In the videos, EM says everything that took place was consensual.In court, however, she said the videos did not reflect how she was actually feeling at the time. Prosecutors argued that the videos, taken after the sexual activity had ended, do not prove consent at the time of an act.That difference of interpretation ignited conversations about the meaning of consent and how it is given under Canadian law. The Criminal Code says if an accused person does not take “reasonable steps” to obtain consent given the circumstances, then simply believing a complainant consented is not a valid defence. Whether the men took “reasonable steps” has been the central question of the case.The trial was also beset by a series of scandals. Police dropped their initial investigation, which began in June 2018, after seeing surveillance footage of EM walking steadily and the two “consent videos”, which made them suspect EM was not too drunk to consent, as she told the initial police investigation.In 2022, however, EM sued Hockey Canada for $3.55m (£2.5m). The organisation settled with her and launched its own internal investigation.A furore then erupted when, after a leak to the media, Hockey Canada admitted the existence of two secret funds to pay settlements for sexual assault claims.Police then reopened an investigation and charged the five men.But two separate jurieswere dismissedby Carroccia, the Ontario superior court judge overseeing the case – the first after a juror said a defence lawyer spoke to them at lunch; the second when they told Carroccia they felt two defence lawyers were mocking them in whispers. Carroccia then decided on a judge-only trial.As she concluded her ruling, Carroccia reiterated that the court’s task was not to determine whether something happened, but whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.“This is not about morality or optics,” she said. “It is about law.”In speaking to reporters following the verdict, Karen Bellehumeur, EM’s lawyer, said the outcome is “devastating” and that Canada’s justice system needs reforms to better protect survivors of sexual violence.“Her treatment during cross examination at times was insulting, unfair, mocking and disrespectful, none of which was necessary,” Bellehumeur said. “Yet she maintained her composure and kept her emotions in check, only to be criticized for not acting enough like a victim.”She said that EM is heartened by the support she has received by members of the public. Bellehumeur also emphasized that verdicts like this one can discourage survivors of sexual assault from coming forward, but urged them to not be hindered by Thursday’s decision and still speak up.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce hockeyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Using equivalent figures for soot, the risk rose by 13%.Soot and PM2.5 levels approached or exceeded these levels in 2023 at roadside locations in central London, Birmingham and Glasgow.UK air pollution falling but danger levels still breached too often, say scientistsRead moreThe most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease and in the UK about 982,000 people have the illness. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty concentrating and mood changes.Dr Haneen Khreis, the senior author of the study, said it provided “further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults”.She added: “Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.”Air pollution may cause dementia through causing inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress, which is a chemical process within the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins and DNA.The researchers acknowledged that the report was limited because the majority of studies analysed included participants who were white and living in high income countries. They said future studies on air pollution should include more participants from marginalised backgrounds.Dr Isolde Radford, senior policy manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “This rigorous review adds to mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution – from traffic fumes to wood burners – increases the risk of developing dementia.“Air pollution is one of the major modifiable risk factors for dementia – but it’s not something individuals can solve alone. That’s where government leadership is vital.“While the 10-year health plan acknowledges the health harms of air pollution, far more needs to be done to tackle this invisible threat.“Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling for a bold, cross-government approach to health prevention – one that brings together departments beyond health, including Defra, to take coordinated action on the drivers of dementia risk.”The report was published inThe Lancet Planetary Health.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionHealthPollutionDementiaAlzheimer'snewsShareReuse this content"

Now he’s taking it globalPresident’s opposition to offshore wind more than a decade ago now threatens a huge industry in the US and beyondOliver MilmanThu 24 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 05.01 EDTShareDonald Trump’s bitter dislike of renewable energy first erupted publicly 14 years ago in a seemingly trivial spat over wind turbines visible from his Scottish golf course. As Trump returns to Scotland this week, though, he is using the US presidency to squash clean power, with major ramifications for the climate crisis and America’s place in the world.Trump will visit his Turnberry and Aberdeenshire golf courses during the Scottish trip, the latter venue being the stage of a lengthy battle by the president to halt 11 nearby offshore wind turbines. From 2011, Trump, then a reality TV star and property mogul,arguedthe “ugly” turbines visible from the Menie golf course were “monstrosities” that would help sink Scotland’s tourism industry.Although Trumpfailedin hislegal attemptto halt the Scottish wind farm, an enduring scorn towards renewables appears to have been seeded that now has global consequences.As president, Trump has declared wind and solar projects unwelcome in the US, barring them from federal lands and signing a vast spending bill that demolishes support for a nascent industry that held the promise of revamping the American economy while cutting dangerous planet-heating pollution.“I don’t want windmills destroying our place,” Trump said shortly before signing the “big, beautiful” bill that is set to severely curtail new clean energy projects. “I don’t want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up half a mountain and they’re ugly as hell.”Ahead of his latest visit to Scotland, where he will meet with the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, Trump called for the UK, too, to ramp up oil drilling and to ditch wind. “They should get rid of the windmills and bring back the oil,” Trump said. “The windmills are really detrimental to the beauty of Scotland and every other place they go up.”The cost of one, albeit very powerful, man’s hostility will be steep. With the acquiescence of Republicans in Congress, hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment in clean energy and electric car facilities is set to be lost, with one union calling the legislation “the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country”.Americans’ household power billsare expected to surgeas the supply of cheap renewable energy falters, prompting utilities to turn to gas and coal that willemitan extra 7bn tonnes of carbon pollution by 2030. Scientistswarnthe world must rapidly eliminate emissions to avoid catastrophic climate impacts via heatwaves, flooding, drought and other unfolding maladies.This culmination of Trump’s animus towards renewables has stunned those in Scotland who tangled with him over the wind farm before he burst into politics. “At the time a lot of us thought the climate denial movement was on its deathbed,” said Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Scottish Greens. “Whether Donald Trump believes his lies or not, and I’m prepared to believe he’s stupid or he’s dishonest, he has damaged climate action around the world, including the US.“Green tech is a huge part of the future of the economy and the scale of investment by China in this is extraordinary,” Harvie added. “People will look back at this point as when the US gave up on the dominant energy technologies of the future and declined as a major power. Those in the US should recognize the incredible harm done to their national interest. For golf, of all things.”In 2012, Trumpappearedat a Scottish parliamentary committee and sparred with Harvie, who he lateraccusedof blasphemy. The hearing featured rhetoric from Trump that has now become familiar – that wind turbines are made in China, that they kill birds, are inefficient and are “so ugly, so noisy and so dangerous” that they will “lead to the almost total destruction of Scotland’s tourism industry” and cause the country to “go broke”.When pressed as to what evidence he had for such claims, Trump provided an answer that seemed to draw deep from his core psychology. “I am the evidence,” he said. “I am considered a world-class expert in tourism. When you ask, ‘Where is the expert and where is the evidence?’ I say: ‘I am the evidence.’”View image in fullscreenTrump at his Turnberry golf course on 2 May 2023.Photograph: Stuart Wallace/ShutterstockToday,more than halfof all Scotland’s electricity comes from wind, nearly 2 millionmoretourists visit the country than in 2011 and the country has not gone broke. Renewable energy in the US isn’t quite as dominant but has also grown quickly as costs have plummeted, with more than 90% of all capacity added to American gridslast year comingfrom wind, solar and batteries rather than fossil fuels.Despite this, Trump has only escalated his incendiary invective toward renewables,claimingoffshore wind turbines are “driving the whales crazy” – there is little evidence for this – and stating shortly after his inauguration in January that “we don’t want windmills in this country”.Federal approvals for wind and solar projects have seized up and, earlier this month, Republicans in Congress pushed through a reconciliation spending bill that effectively gutted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Joe Biden’s signature legislation that provided tax credits to boost renewable energy, battery and electric vehicle manufacturing and deployment in the US.A bar chart showing projected electric vehicle sales by 2035About three-quarters of the hundreds of billions of dollars in new clean energy investmenthas flowed to Republican-held districtssince the IRA. Two dozen concerned GOP lawmakers across the House of Representatives and US Senatewroteto colleaguespleading for the retention of the tax credits to avoid “sparking an energy crisis” that would kill off jobs and hike electricity bills.Ultimately, however, only one of these letter signatories, Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, voted against the “big, beautiful” bill. The Guardian contacted all of these lawmakers to ask why they voted for the legislation but only Andrew Garbarino, a New York representative, replied. “We didn’t get everything we wanted, but we got what we needed to make progress,” said Garbarino, who pointed out that the tax credits were in danger of ending immediately, rather than a phase-out that will see them mostly disappear by 2027.Trump hadintervenedin congressional negotiations to push for a swifter scrapping of the tax credits and secured more aid for fossil fuels in the form of a subsidy for steel-making coal. “The president was a big factor, he was talking to the leadership in the House and Senate on making changes,” said someone familiar with the discussions. “He’s been consistent on wind and now he’s bringing solar into the mix, which we didn’t see in his first term.”The fossil fuel industry maderecord donationsto Trump during his election campaign and the president has torn down pollution rules and opened up new areas to drilling since returning to the White House. Renewable projects, however, will face a blizzard of new paperwork for approvals under anew Trump edict.“The president was clear about ending what he called the green new scam,” said Tom Pyle, president of the free market AmericanEnergyAlliance. “There is a place for wind and solar but they don’t need all of this lavishness foisted upon them.”This approach is “utterly insane and destructive”,accordingto Elon Musk, formerly Trump’s adviser and favorite billionaire. “It gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future.” Trump previously criticized electric cars, too, but announced he was purchasing a Tesla after allying with Musk and held apromotional eventfor the car brand at the White House before a rift developed between the two.For Democrats who bet that spreading the benefits of the energy transition to rural, Republican areas would secure broad political support for renewables, the setback has been sobering. “It’s really bizarre, it’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen in politics,” said Gina McCarthy, who was Biden’s top climate adviser, on the Republicans voting for the clean energy rollback.“A lot of this is pure and simply what Trump wanted to do and it breaks my heart to see people who have done great work in the administration have to kowtow to someone like this president. Trump has been acting like a dictator since he came into office because Republicans allowed him that luxury.”Bar chart showing how One Big Beautiful Bill Act would slash new clean energy additions to the gridThe loss of new clean electricity capacity, at a time when demand for power in the US is increasing due to advances in artificial intelligence, is set to be significant. By 2035, the amount power added to the grid will be about 600GW less than it would have been without the bill, according toan estimate by Rhodium, which is equivalent to nearly half of all current installed electricity capacity in the US today.The contrast to China, the world’s largestemitterbut alreadybuildingmore wind and solar capacity than all other countries combined, is dizzying. By 2035, China is expected to add 4660GW of solar and 860GW of wind power,accordingto the International Energy Agency – about 15 times more than what the US is now forecast to install over this period. Last year, China hit its goal for half of new car sales to be electric, a decadeearlierthan planned.The divergent paths of the world’s two superpowers on energy is now stark – in May, Chinainstalledsolar panels at a rate of 100 every second. “China is running rings around us, it’s clear they will be the beneficiaries of all of this,” said McCarthy.A 15-year head start China had in the clean energy race will now extend out further, to the point that few senior Chinese officials now view the US as a competitor, according to Li Shuo, an expert in China’s climate policies at the Asia Society Policy Institute.“I don’t think US companies will ever be able to compete with Chinese counterparts in wind, solar, batteries, EVs – all the components of decarbonization,” said Li. “That dynamic is now here to stay. The last chance for the US to jump on the green bandwagon has left the station.”As he arrives in Scotland, it’s unlikely Trump will be troubled by this, nor any of theproteststhat usuallygreet himwhen he visits a country that he lauds for being the birthplace of his mother, Mary, a Gaelic speaker from the Isle of Lewis.Asked about Trump’s dislike of renewables, a White House spokesman said the president and those who voted for him “are not interested in advancing scam energy industries that embolden our adversaries, stifle domestic energy production, and raise prices for countless Americans”.The reconciliation bill is “a complete overhaul of the Biden administration’s slush fund for the green new deal lobby and will further unleash the might of America’s energy dominance while continuing to lower costs for millions of families”, he added.Harvie said it was hard to know exactly why Trump has maintained his dislike of clean energy because of his “irrational” demeanor but that his stance was opposed by most people in Scotland.“A large majority of people here have a very negative attitude towards him, because of climate change, his racism, his economic policies or just his grotesque personal manner,” he said. “I mean the list of reasons to have distaste for Donald Trump is far too long to complete.“I’m not sure he’s emotionally capable of admitting he’s wrong on anything but people in Scotland recognize he’s wrong. I hope a great many more people in the US come to recognize that, too.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpEnergyRenewable energyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It had been on a global list of 4,800 plants, animals and fungi species that have been lost to science.The rarity of the snake is a concern for scientists. Connor Blades, a project officer for the environment ministry, said: “If the threadsnake population is not very dense, I am worried about their ability to find mates, particularly if their habitat is under threat and being degraded.”Blades and Justin Springer, theCaribbeanprogramme officer at Re:wild, had been looking for the threadsnake and several other endemic reptiles for more than a year as part of a conservation project.During the survey in March, Springer said he jokingly told Blade: “I smell a threadsnake,” while turning over a rock trapped under a tree root. And there it was.“When you are so accustomed to looking for things and you don’t see them, you are shocked when you actually find it,” Springer said.View image in fullscreenSpringer and Blade were delighted to rediscover the creature.Photograph: Connor BladesBlades took the snake to the University of the West Indies where examination under a microscope revealed the pale orange lines running across its body and the scale on its nose that confirmed it was what they were looking for.Florida sheds 20 tons of invasive pythons in effort to curb its populationRead moreThe first sighting of the Barbados threadsnake was in 1889, and there have only been a handful of confirmed sightings since.The threadsnake reproduces sexually and the females lay only one egg at a time, unlike some other reptiles that can produce fertile eggs without mating.With 98% of the island’s forest having been cleared for agriculture since it was colonised more than 500 years ago, conservationists are concerned for the reptile’s extinction from habitat destruction and invasive species.“The threadsnake’s rediscovery is also a call to all of us as Barbadians that forests in Barbados are very special and need protection,” said Springer. “Not just for the threadsnake, but for other species as well.

It functions as a vital sign across the lifespan, providing crucial information that can be used to guide and monitor clinical treatment and symptom management and inform screening and preventive care.“Recognising the menstrual cycle as an essential health indicator will strengthen health services and impact research across disciplines. Importantly, this recognition will also improve the health of women throughout their lives.”Period-tracking devices have been in demand in recent years, but there are concerns over personal data and information being used by private companies. Public health bodies such as the NHS have beenurged to develop their own rival appsto protect data.NHS England has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsWomen's healthMenstruationEnglandHealthReproductionWomenMedical researchnewsShareReuse this content"

A friend who went to feed the cats and walked in on the police searching the house said there appeared to be a geiger counter – which measures radiation – on the table.Sorrell, a retired teacher, said: “At 80, to be treated like a dangerous terrorist is deeply shocking. I’ve been very traumatised by this. Every morning I wake up feeling sick, nauseous. [I have] had to take anti-sickness pills.“They’ve actually not taken anything that could be classed as illegal but it’s very confusing that they’re beginning to think anything connected to Palestine or support for Palestine is illegal in some way.”She said the arrests at the 12 July Defend Our Juries rally took place five minutes from the scheduled end of the one-hour demonstration, the timetable of which had been communicated to the police in advance.Sorrell was arrested with her friend Trisha Fine, 75, also from Wells and a retired teacher, who was held for the same period of time.The pair said they gave “no comment” interviews in which they were asked whether they knew that Palestine Action supported violence and whether they were individually prepared to use violence.Eleven other people were arrested at the Cardiff rally. Sorrell said officers broke into her house through the back door before replacing the lock. Neighbours told her that about 10 officers were present for approximately three hours and her friend who went to feed the cats said she saw them poking long cotton buds into Sorrell’s jars of dried goods.“Whenever I open a drawer or cupboard, I can see that they’ve been searched,” said Sorrell. “I’m not sure what they were looking for.”View image in fullscreenTrisha Fine.Photograph: Sam Frost/The GuardianThe women have been bailed until October. Their bail conditions prohibit contact with each other and spending any nights away from their homes. Fine said: “This restriction about staying at home is an issue because my husband is recovering from cancer treatment and we planned a couple of treats which we’ve already booked and paid for: a trip to Madrid in late August, and a trip driving around Europe for September. I can’t do those so that is pretty onerous. He’s had a tough time and he deserves a break.“And, well, am I a 75-year-old terrorist? I don’t think so. It’s completely out of order. You just wonder what the hell is happening with this country and this government.”She said that during her detention officers refused to let her have antibiotics she was taking for a serious gum infection and failed to call her husband to tell him about her arrest, despite having agreed to do so.Under the Terrorism Act the friends face a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. Sorrell said: “I just feel if I’m put in prison for this, and even if I die in prison for this, I can’t think of a better thing to die for really than for the justice of the people who’ve been persecuted now for almost my lifetime.”South Wales police did not directly address any of the matters raised.

I never thought something like this would happen to me.”Her lawyer, Malkhaz Salakia, said there was no evidence she had any intention of breaking the law, adding: “There were people who forced my client to commit this unknowingly.”It was reported that Culley concluded the submission to the court by saying “madloba” – “thank you”, in Georgian.“Bella will become a mother soon, she is expecting a boy,” Salakia told the court. “I want her to feel this motherhood in freedom. It’s a moment of her becoming a mother for the first time in her life – she turned 19 this June.“Since the crime committed is not connected to Georgia, and her family has been here – father before and now the mother is here – they are here to look after her, and there is no possibility of influencing the witnesses because they are police and officials, she can be assigned to visit the police department two times per month or every day.“However, the judge decides – she will fulfil her duty. It’s summer, and a pregnant woman needs special hygiene in the month of July – we are offering a plea agreement of 50,000 [Georgian lari; more than £13,500], which will be paid immediately and we ask her immediately to be set free.”View image in fullscreenBella Culley wasarrested at Tbilisi airportin May and appeared in court.Photograph: East2WestBut the judge decided no new evidence had been presented and, consequently, Culley would remain in detention until her trial began on 2 September unless a plea deal could be agreed beforehand.Culley exchanged regular looks and smiles with her mother, Lyanne Kennedy, during the 30-minute hearing and Kennedy became emotional after learning the sex of her unborn grandchild. “I’ll come and see you tomorrow, I love you,” she reportedly told her daughter.Georgian authorities said Culley, who is from Billingham on Teesside, faced up to 20 years in prison or a life sentence if found guilty. Local police said officers seized up to 12kg of marijuana and just over 2kg of hashish in a travel bag at Tbilisi international airport.Culley is the great-granddaughter of Frank Cook, a Labour MP who represented Stockton North for 27 years, rising to become a deputy speaker of the Commons. Cookdied in January 2012, aged 76.The Foreign Office has previously confirmed it was “supporting the family of a British woman who is detained in Georgia”. Cleveland police, on Teesside, confirmed an 18-year-old woman from Billingham had been arrested in Georgia on suspicion of drug offences and remained in custody.Explore more on these topicsGeorgiaDrugsThailandCounty DurhamNorth of EnglandEuropeCannabisnewsShareReuse this content"

She was also in the unit at Yeovil hospital at the time and the prosecution alleged she must have known the threat Gunter posed.After the killing, which took place in the early hours of 5 March last year,both parents left the unit for a cigaretteas nurses and medics tried to save Brendon. As well as the skull and neck injuries, he was badly bruised from head to toe and had broken legs, broken ankles and broken wrists.A child safeguarding practice review is examining whether further measures should have been put in place to protect Brendon from his father, who had a history of violence and was controlling of Staddon.It will also look at the actions of social services, who knew the couple’s issues and were considering whether to remove Brendon from them out of concern for his wellbeing.Gunter has not given any explanation for the killing but police believe a motive could have been the fear that Staddon might move to a mother and baby unit, where no accommodation would be available to him.Speaking after the verdicts on Thursday, DCI Nadine Partridge, of Avon and Somerset police, described Gunter as selfish and criticised him for laughing and joking in the dock during the trial at Bristol crown court. She said Staddon was very vulnerable and was closely controlled by Gunter.Partridge said that in her 22 years as a detective and child protection officer she had never seen the sort of injuries Brendon suffered. “It’s horrifying. It’s almost impossible to imagine anyone doing that to a precious two-week-old premature baby.”She said Gunter must have twisted and pulled Brendon’s limbs and may have held him by the legs and struck him against hard objects. “You don’t want to imagine what happened to him in those last moments,” she said.Partridge said it was hard to come to terms with the fact that the attack took place in a hospital. She said: “It’s difficult to explain how that happened. As part of the review we will look at if there were any opportunities for this to have been prevented.”Bristol crown court was told Gunter and Staddon were homeless and living in temporary accommodation in a former pub in Yeovil when she became pregnant.Gunter limited how much Staddon ate, smoked and socialised. He had been cautioned for the battery of a previous partner and was sometimes violent to Staddon.Social services were concerned about the couple’s ability to raise a child and in January 2024 told them they might take the baby into care when he was born. Social services staff noted that Gunter appeared more concerned about their housing situation than the possible loss of the child.Brendon was born at 33 weeks in February last year at Yeovil district hospital, weighing less than “a couple of bags of sugar”, the jury heard.While being looked after at the special care baby unit, Gunter repeatedly took Brendon out of an incubator despite staff telling him not to and on one occasion was suspected of removing a nasal tube.Staff reprimanded him several times for jiggling, poking and rubbing Brendon, and nurses twice put security officers on alert when Gunter became angry. He was seen as intimidating and unpredictable.At 4am on 5 March, two nurses were at their station on the unit when Staddon approached them and asked that Brendon be checked as he was cold. A nurse examined him and raised the alarm.Gunter and Staddon left at 4.40am to go outside for a cigarette. They did not return or ask how Brendon was. When police arrived, Gunter told police: “She’s my witness and I’m her witness.” As he was being led to a van, Gunter said to Staddon: “Promise me, stick together.”The jury previously found Staddon not guilty of murder and cleared Gunter of causing or allowing the death of a child on the direction of the trial judge, Mr Justice Swift. The defendants showed no emotion as the verdicts were returned.Brendon’s grandfather Simon Gunter said: “Brendon was born early and was so tiny, but so beautiful. He was just perfect. Despite his early arrival, he was a little fighter and proved his strength in the very short life he had.“As a family, we were so happy and excited. We had bought clothes, toys and supplies in preparation for his arrival and we all had exciting plans for the future.“But, we have been robbed of a life of memories of Brendon. We won’t get to see his first steps, hear his first words, take him on his first holiday and see him grow into a young boy then a man. We will never have those memories. They have been taken from us and he will never be replaced.“I hope Daniel gets what he deserves for what he did to Brendon but, whatever the outcome, it will never bring him back.“Today, some justice has been served, but we still have many unanswered questions.”A spokesperson for Somerset NHS foundation trust said: “This has been an incredibly distressing criminal case about the murder of a vulnerable two-week-old baby while he was being cared for in Yeovil district hospital. Our thoughts are with his wider family. We are part of the child safeguarding practice review, along with other agencies, that will thoroughly examine the circumstances around baby Brendon’s death. It is well under way and will be published in the autumn.”In May, the trustannounced the temporary closure of the special care baby unitafter the Care Quality Commission said paediatric care there required “significant improvement”.Gunter will be sentenced at a later date.Explore more on these topicsCrimeSomersetChild protectionEnglandNHSHospitalsnewsShareReuse this content"

My question is, ‘What are you guys going to do about it?’”Daniels continued by saying he believed Trump’s slate of tariffs would cost him supporters. “‘Wait a minute, the grocery bill is what? $180 more? I can’t get that car that we have to have unless I pay another $8,000. What? Who do I blame for that? Who do I see about that?’ One person.“At the end of the day it would be about just the price of eggs, did it go up or down, because that’s what he told me he was going to lower the price of eggs or my grocery bill,” Daniels continued, before describing the president as a “snake-oil salesman.”Daniels said he had been surprised by the pace of change since Trump took office again in January.“We’ve lost decency, we’ve lost civility, we’ve lost respect for the rule of law – lost it,” he said. “We have normalised verbal abuse on the internet. We’ve normalised bullying; much as the woke generation tried to, you know, change that, it’s back …“I mean, nobody has great things to say about politicians. They never have. Go back to Mark Twain. But ideally, we’re supposed to elect the best of us. Not the worst of us. He’s everything that’s wrong with not just America but with being a human being.”Daniels’s most recent projects were TV series American Rust andA Man in Full. He rose to fame with roles in Ragtime, Terms of Endearment and Heartburn, before finding international acclaim in The Purple Rose of Cairo in 1985.Other films include Something Wild, The Squid and the Whale, Speed, Dumb and Dumber and Steve Jobs. He plays Ronald Reagan opposite Jared Harris as Mikhail Gorbachev in a forthcoming take on the 1986 Reykjavik Summit.Explore more on these topicsFilmDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsPodcastsnewsShareReuse this content"

Both countries accused each other of opening fire first.At least 13 Thai civilians and one soldier were killed in artillery shelling by Cambodian forces, according to Thai authorities, while 14 soldiers and 32 other civilians were injured.Thailand’s health minister, Somsak Thepsuthin, said the Cambodian shelling included a strike on a hospital in Surin province, which he said should be considered a war crime.Those killed included an eight-year-old boy, according to the Thai military, which said people had been killed across three provinces. There was fighting at six locations, a spokesperson said.The Thai military said its air force had launched airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia.Cambodia has not said whether it has recorded any fatalities. The Cambodian defence ministry said Thai jets dropped two bombs on a road, condemning what it described as “reckless and brutal military aggression of the Kingdom of Thailand against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia”.People on both sides of the border were told to evacuate.

The Thai military said Cambodian troops had opened fire near the temple and deployed a surveillance drone before sending in troops with heavy weapons, including rocket launchers.Cambodia denied the claims. Its ministry of national defence said the Thai military launched the first armed assault.“Cambodian forces acted strictly within the bounds of self-defence, responding to an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops that violated our territorial integrity,” the ministry said in a statement.Map of the border between Thailand and CambodiaCambodia’s influential former premier Hun Sen, the father of the current prime minister, Hun Manet, said two Cambodian provinces had come under shelling from Thailand’s military.In a statement posted online, Hun Manet said: “Cambodia has always taken a stand to solve problems peacefully, but in this case we have no choice but to respond with armed forces against armed aggression.”The clashes are the latest in a history of conflict along Cambodia and Thailand’s 508-mile (817km) border, sections of which are subject to overlapping territorial claims due to disagreements about colonial-era maps.The last serious clashes occurred between 2008 and 2011, when fighting and artillery exchanges killed at least 34 people, wounded many more and displaced thousands.China was “deeply concerned” by Thursday’s clashes, its foreign ministry spokesperson, Guo Jiakun, said, adding that Beijing “has and will continue to in its own way do its best to promote peace and dialogue”.View image in fullscreenThai people flee clashes between Thai and Cambodian soldiers.Photograph: Sunny Chittawil/APThe Malaysian prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, whose country chairs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, called on Thailand and Cambodia to stand down.The most recent tensions began in May, when troops briefly exchanged fire in a contested area, killing a Cambodian soldier. This led toretaliatory measures by both sides.The crisis escalated further on Wednesday when five Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine, the second such incident in a week. Thailand responded by recalling its ambassador to Cambodia on Wednesday and saying it would expel Cambodia’s envoy in Bangkok.Thailand alleged the landmines had been placed in the area recently – claims that Cambodia denies.The leaked phone call that could ring the changes for one of Thailand’s most powerful dynastiesRead moreThe Thai government has ordered the closure of all border checkpoints under the jurisdiction of Thailand’s second army, the ruling Pheu Thai party said.“Tourists are strictly prohibited from entering these border areas,” it said.Many border checkpoints had already been closed by one side or the other or operated with restrictions.Thailand’s acting premier, Phumtham Wechayachai, said the situation at Thailand’s border was “delicate”. “We have to be careful,” he told reporters. “We will follow international law.”Nationalist passions on both sides have further inflamed the situation. Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, wassuspended from officeon 1 July after she was accused of possible ethics violations over her handling of the border dispute.She was strongly criticised in Thailand after a recording of her discussing the dispute with Hun Sen were leaked.

Bradley Geoghegan, who had gone on holiday with Slater, said Slater had video-called him after he left the apartment on the morning of 17 June last year.“I said, ‘put your maps on to see how far you were’,” Geoghegan toldPrestoncoroner’s court. “It was like a 14-hour walk or an hour drive. I said, ‘Get a taxi back’, then he just goes, ‘I will ring you back.’”The witness said he did not think his friend had any money on him, and taxis in Tenerife insisted on payment upfront before carrying a fare.Geoghegan said he did not believe Slater was fearful or under duress. “No. I think he probably got there and thought, ‘Why am I here?’, sobered up and decided to come back,” he said.Slater, from Oswaldtwistle,Lancashire, was holidaying on the Spanish island and had been to the NRG music festival with friends at the Papagayo Tenerife nightclub in the resort district of Playa de las Américas. He vanished the morning after going to the Airbnb and was reported missing on 18 June.Evidence heard during the inquest suggested he had left the holiday let, and after failing to get a bus or taxi, attempted to walk back to his own apartment and had fallen from a height into a ravine.Amass search was launchedbeforehis body was foundby a mountain rescue team from the Spanish civil guard, in a steep and inaccessible area near the village of Masca,on 15 July.View image in fullscreenJay Slater’s family left flowers by the site where his body was found, near the village of Masca on Tenerife.Photograph: Jesus Cabrera/ReutersSlater’s mother, Debbie Duncan, had asked for the inquest into his death to be resumed on Thursday after a number of witnesses failed to give evidence at the last hearing in May.On the night out he had received phone messages from friends telling him to go home as he was “off his head”. More messages from friends warned him about the “boiling” heat of the day, but activity data on his phone stopped at 8.51am, suggesting his phone battery had run out.The hearing in May had heard evidence from witnesses including a toxicology expert. The court was told analysis showed traces of drugs, including cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy, along with alcohol, were found in Slater’s body.The Home Office pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd said his postmortem examination gave Slater’s cause of death as head injuries. His body showed no evidence of restraint or assault, with the pattern of injuries consistent with a fall from a height.Explore more on these topicsLancashireSpainPrestonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács said on Thursday they had been banned because their “members repeatedly engage in antisemitic hate speech supporting terrorism and terrorist groups”.He said: “Hungary has zero tolerance for antisemitism in any form. Their planned performance posed a national security threat and, for this reason, the group has been formally banned from Hungary for three years. If they enter, expulsion will follow under international norms.”Responding in a post on X, the group said: “To the tens of thousands of fans who we were buzzing to see in person at Sziget, we’re sorry we won’t be with you. The authoritarian government of Viktor Orban say we ‘pose a national security threat.’ Which is fucking outrageous coming from a man who welcomed Netanyahu, a wanted war criminal, like a hero just a few weeks ago.“There is no legal basis for his actions, no member ofKneecaphas ever been convicted of any crime in any country. We stand against all hate crimes and Kneecap champions love and solidarity as well as calling out injustices where we see it. It’s clear this is political distraction and a further attempt to silence those who call out genocide against the Palestinian people.”Kneecap have had several shows cancelled in recent months, including atTRNSMT festival in Glasgowand at the Eden Project in Cornwall.The group – comprising Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh – were formed in Belfast and released their first single in 2017.Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, was recently charged with aterrorism offenceover allegations he displayed a flag in support of Hezbollah.In May, the Metropolitan police said the group were being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing them shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and “kill your local MP”.The group apologised to the families of murdered MPs and said they had “never supported” Hamas or Hezbollah, which are banned in the UK.They were also investigated over their set at Glastonbury festival in June, but last week Avon and Somerset police confirmed they would be takingno further action.Explore more on these topicsKneecapHungaryFestivalsEuropeFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

Its lack of easy answers feels exactly rightLucy ManganThu 24 Jul 2025 17.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 18.22 EDTShare“We pray for it every day, but it’s man’s will that gets done, not God’s.” Thus speaks a former nun, pretty much an emblematic character of a Jimmy McGovern drama, delivering an emblematic line. McGovern has always been a chronicler of pressing social issues, from police incompetence and corruption (Hillsborough) to government failures and cover-ups (Sunday, Reg), class struggle (Dockers), disability (Go Now),religious hypocrisy(Priest, Broken), violence (Anthony, Time) and the brokenness of systems supposedly set upto help our most vulnerable(Care).But whatever the issue under examination and – usually – excoriation, there is the profounder concern of how far from grace we have fallen. From there, McGovern asks: what would it take for us to rise again?His latest creation, Unforgivable, takes child sexual abuse as its subject. McGovern has brought together trusted members of, in effect, the repertory company he has gathered over the years – includingAnnas Frieland Maxwell Martin – to tell the story of an ordinary family trying to cope with the aftermath of a terrible act; the abuse of a young teenager, Tom (Austin Haynes), by his uncle Joe (Bobby Schofield, playing the character as unmonstrously as he is written, making his actions and the ramifications all the more awful for it).Tom is now getting into trouble at school and is virtually mute, answering only yes or no to direct questions, and Joe is about to be released from his short spell in prison. Tom’s mother – Joe’s sister – Anna(Friel, in an absolutely wonderful performance)is a mass of rage, despair and shock, with no time to process any of it as she fights to keep her job, her inevitably neglected other son out of trouble and Tom from descending further into mental ill health.Anna and Joe’s mother dies soon after the story begins and the first moral quandary arises – should he be allowed to attend her funeral? Would she – the only family member to visit him in prison – have wanted it? Their father, Brian (David Threlfall), forbids Joe to come. When Anna later bumps into Joe in the cemetery, in breach of his licence, she reports him to his parole officer, who redraws the boundaries of the exclusion zone rather than recall him to prison. What would you have done?View image in fullscreenBobby Schofield as Joe and Anna Maxwell Martin as Katherine in Unforgivable.Photograph: Kerry Spicer/BBC/LA ProductionsSmall questions pave the way for larger ones. Where do you stand on the fact that, as Anna points out in fury, Joe has had access to copious amounts of therapy in prison and now lives in a special halfway-house-cum-rehab-facility, run by a former nun, Katherine (Maxwell Martin), while Tom has had nothing? McGovern’s work is always grounded in detail, especially that relating to systemic inadequacies; we sit with Anna through the GP’s explanation that there is a 21-week waiting list for even “the worst” children to be seen. It takes a suicide attempt to get Tom even that far.When it emerges that Joe was abused at the same age as Tom it is not a plot twist designed to sway our sympathiesEventually, we move to the question inherent in the title: can Joe be forgiven? How much weight do we give his assertions of self-loathing? Should we feel touched by his apparent remorse? Should Anna? How much should Brian let love for his son govern his actions when the rest of his family has been devastated?‘There’s nothing here I did not see inside’ – a former HMP inmate on TimeRead moreWhen it emerges that Joe was abused at the same age as Tom, it is not a plot twist to sway our sympathies – McGovern is an unsentimental and unmanipulative writer – but to force us to think more deeply. Does it make him less culpable for his actions? Or more damnable, because he knew the effect one act can have on a life? His abuser also harmed others who did not perpetuate the cycle, so what do we do with that knowledge? Space is left for any conclusion. None of us knows God’s will, whether you believe in him or not.Unforgivable has none of the agitprop that can creep into McGovern’s always impassioned work and there are faultless performances throughout, including from Mark Womack, a sleeper agent of an actor who delivers invariably to mesmeric effect. It is an altogether richer, more subtle and more sophisticated creation than, say,Adolescence, to which it is likely to be compared; as such, it is unlikely to be adopted as a pseudo policy document by the government.More’s the pity. It has an immeasurable sorrow at its heart and offers no answers. It leaves you feeling that this is exactly as it should be; exactly as it must be.Unforgivable aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid ThrelfallAnna Maxwell MartinreviewsShareReuse this content"

With the death ofOzzy Osbourne,the genre lost its irrepressible everyman Prince of Darkness, and all the warmth, charm and folly that made him relatable to so many. But with this 35th anniversary tour for their Painkiller album, Judas Priest provide some therapy.For years, the band have used Black Sabbath’s War Pigs as a walk-on song and the moment the tape kicks in, an impassioned and cathartic mass singalong sweeps across the amphitheatre. Any sense that this might be a sombre do is squashed in seconds. “Hello, metal maniacs!” says singer Rob Halford, wearing a bedazzled leather trenchcoat and aviator sunglasses.View image in fullscreenDazzling … guitarist Richie Faulkner.Photograph: Cuffe & TaylorPriest are a one-off who helped define metal’s image as well as its sound, going all in on the most exaggerated parts – the denim, leather, studs and no shortage of demonic motifs – while retaining street cred for more than 50 years. With the anthemic recent song Gates of Hell, eternal damnation has never sounded so inviting. The Serpent and the King – another from last year’s Invincible Shield album – is also exhilarating: a full-on burst of thrash driven by Scott Travis’s impeccable double-bass drum style. On the likes of Hell Patrol, the septuagenarian Halford can still nail the inexplicable, guttural shrieks.Guitarist Richie Faulkner came close to death in 2021 after a severe aortic rupture on stage: he survived 10 hours of emergency open-heart surgery where parts of his chest were replaced with mechanical components. With gurns aplenty, Halford admires one of Faulkner’s dazzling lead breaks on One Shot at Glory, hovering his tattooed head around the fretboard.“It’s been tough, the last 24-hours, but he would want us to be together doing this, having a good time. We love you, Ozzy,” Halford says to huge cheers, introducing Giants in the Sky. This is their ode to rock’s fallen greats, as the faces of Lemmy, Chris Cornell, Christine McVie, and now Ozzy – among others – are flashed on screen to a soundtrack of hefty riffs. ThatJudas Priestare not only performing at an admirable level but still making stellar new music in their sixth decade, further cements their place alongside Sabbath on the Mount Rushmore of metal gods.Explore more on these topicsJudas PriestMetalOzzy Osbournelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

DreamWorks’s franchise hits its stride with this minor upgrade – a snappier, funnier and more relaxed movie than the original. It begins like a Bond or Bourne with a death-defying car chase around Cairo after the gang of criminal predators pull off yet another a splashy heist. Behind the wheel of the getaway car is ringleader Mr Wolf (voiced bySam Rockwell, and doing such a decent Clooney impersonation that George should shake him down for royalties).Actually, the chase is a flashback to five years ago. Right now, in the present, Mr Wolf, Mr Snake, Mr Shark and the gang have gone straight. But their fresh start as good guys is scuppered by a snow leopard and a frame-up for a series of daring heists involving a precious metal called MacGuffinite (a silly gag for film-buff adults). The best character from the first movie, super-villainous guinea pig Professor Marmalade (voiced by Richard Ayoade) is also back. Locked up in a maximum security prison, he’s prison fit and covered with tattoos, his newfound physical menace let down only slightly by a nasally whine.There’s more wit and energy this time around, and a genuinely sweet message about friendship. Even the fart joke (every kids’ movie must have at least one) was a cut above and had the adults giggling. That said, my reviewing buddy who rated theoriginal Bad Guys10 stars out of five in 2022 when she was five, was less enthusiastic this time around. “It was OK,” she muttered. So what do I know?The Bad Guys 2 is out on 25 July in the UK, on 1 August in the US, and 18 September in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation on TVComedy filmsCrime filmsFamily filmsSam RockwellRichard AyoadereviewsShareReuse this content"

This documentary chooses to be more of a mood pieceLucy ManganThu 24 Jul 2025 17.05 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 17.06 EDTShareMost of the six to 10-year-old girls gathered in the Hart Space dance studio in Southport, Merseyside, on 29 July last year for a Taylor Swift-themed workshop were making friendship bracelets (“It’s a very Swiftie thing to do,” says the older sister of one, who was watching them), when 17-year-old Axel Rudakubana burst in with a knife. His attack left two children dead at the scene and another died the next day from her injuries. Six other children, including the sister who was watching, and two adults were injured and taken to hospital.One Day in Southport focuses largely on what happened afterwards interspersed with the memories of the injured older girl and her family, because what happened next was the result of so many social, cultural and political issues that you could spend a lifetime unpacking them. This documentary does the best it can in an hour. It interviews people from different sides of the various debates, and shows social media posts and footage from the riots that sprang up around the country and caught the police and the establishment unawares. The prime minister was left floundering and unable to address the mixture of feelings and motivations behind them quickly or directly enough.The attacker – his name then kept from the public – was quickly arrested. The police held a press conference and described him as a 17-year-old from Lancashire and originally from Cardiff. The latter detail was included to attempt to tamp down the speculation already rife online and in the local area (arising because the one thing witnesses to the attack did know about the stranger was that he wasBlack) that he was an immigrant, which quickly became an illegal immigrant, which quickly became a Muslim illegal immigrant and ignited all sorts of rage. The usual suspects from the manosphere and others with their own agendas to push then stoked the fires, including Nigel Farage (“It shows how unhappy people are with the state of law and order in this country … Your children don’t matter to them, they don’t care”) and Tommy Robinson, the leader of the far-right anti-Islam English Defence League.The hour tracks the evolution of local grief and anger directed at a specific event into widespread violence and unrest. One of the many YouTubers and other people outside the mainstream media who recorded events is Wesley Winter. He began feeling at one with the righteous fury felt by others. By the time he was filming a few days later in Middlesbrough, he realised that the people walking along a residential street in a Muslim area of the town and smashing windows “was a very different crowd” and he became frightened that they might turn on him next. A call from his wife trapped in her car as people smashed the windows of vehicles around her led them to leave the area as quickly as possible. His naivete is astonishing, but more admirable than the craven avoidance of those supposedly charged with leading the nation in times of strife to address the difficult, sensitive issues with which the tinderbox had been – and remains – stuffed.Because what have we here? We have a section of the population, that’s suffering greatly under the cost of living crisis. This fact has receded from the headlines, but not from life – the housing crisis, the proliferating brutal effects of austerity that the current government seems to be doing nothing to alleviate, and much more. We have people who see the advent of more people to these isles as competition for increasingly scarce resources. Even the co-convener of Stand Up to Racism, Weyman Bennett, makes the point that “people are protesting against something that is really happening to them … they are rightfully angry” before explaining how this is leveraged and exploited by far-rightwingers (and whatever Reform are pretending to be) so that “they’re blaming the wrong people”.The absence of anyone in authority addressing this, instead of lauding the arrests and sentencing of rioters, was and remains conspicuous. Why not publicly delineate the difference between legitimate concerns and far-right agitation – bring the worried into your fold and denounce those burning mosques and terrifying the asylum seekers in besieged hotels? Because thereisa difference and it matters hugely.The documentary gives no facts or figures about immigration, costs or anything else apart from the number of arrests and the 1,000 years-plus total to which rioters were sentenced. It is essentially a mood piece, tracking the development of the hijacking of grief to violent ends and leaving us to draw our own conclusions about where, why and if we would have stepped back to say: “This has gone too far.”One Day in Southport is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSouthport attackCrimereviewsShareReuse this content"

We pay tribute ahead of his milestone birthdayAndrew ShentonThu 24 Jul 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareIn many ways Arvo Pärt and John Williams’s music couldn’t be further apart. One celebrates simplicity, purity, and draws much of its inspiration from sacred texts; the other captures strong emotions in sweeping orchestral scores. And yet the two men are today’s most performed contemporary composers. Bachtrack’s annual survey of classical music performed across the world placed Pärt second (John Williams is in the top spot) in2023and2024. In2022, Pärt was first, Williams second. This year, Pärt might return to No 1 as concert halls and festivals worldwide celebrate his 90th birthday, on 11 September.Unlike many of his contemporaries, Pärt has found a way to speak across boundaries of culture, creed and generation. In the world of contemporary classical music, where complexity and empty virtuosityoften dominate, Pärt stands apart. His music eschews spectacle in favour of silence, simplicity and spiritual depth. Pärt has outlasted political regimes, artistic fashions and shifting trends in composition, yet his work remains strikingly relevant. In a cultural moment saturated with information and spectacle, Pärt offers something almost universally appealing. As the commentator Alex Ross observed in a2002 New Yorker article, Pärt has “put his finger on something almost impossible to put into words, something to do with the power of music to obliterate the rigidities of space and time [and] silence the noise of self, binding the mind to an eternal present.”Pärt’s early career unfolded under Soviet rule, which shaped much of his emerging artistic trajectory. Trained at Tallinn Conservatory in Estonia, he began composing in a modernist idiom, experimenting with serialism and collage techniques in the 1960s – often to the dismay of Soviet authorities who sought artistic control over the creative process.Works such asNekrolog(1960), the first 12-tone piece written in Estonia, and the avant gardeCredo(1968), which juxtaposed Bach with a compendium of avant-garde techniques and incorporated overt Christian themes, drew the ire of censors. The banning of Credo marked a pivotal moment: Pärt fell into a period of near-total withdrawal from composition during which he immersed himself in Gregorian chant, Renaissance polyphony and early Orthodox music.View image in fullscreenAdam’s Passion, a music theatre piece by Arvo Pärt and Robert Wilson, in a staging in 2015 at the Noblessner Foundry in Tallinn, Estonia.Photograph: robertwilson.comAnd, out of this silence emerged a new voice – a radically simplified and spiritually charged idiom he calls tintinnabuli, derived from the Latin for “little bells”. This technique, first heard in the three-minute piano pieceFür Alina(1976), pairs a melodic voice (often stepwise and chant-like) with a harmonic voice that is limited to the notes of a tonic triad (the first, third and fifth notes of a major or minor scale). Pärt considers the two lines to be a single sound, as in the formula suggested by his wife, Nora: 1+1=1. The effect is ethereal and introspective, at once ancient and modern. Pärt’s tintinnabuli is not so much a system, but more of an attitude: a way of stripping music down to its essence in order to open a space for contemplation.In 1980, Pärt left Estonia with his family, first settling in Vienna and later in Berlin. Freed from the strictures of Soviet censorship, he began to compose larger and more overtly sacred works, often usingLatin or Church Slavonic texts. Major compositions such as Tabula Rasa (1977), Passio (1982), Te Deum (1984), and Miserere (1989) established him as a unique voice in late 20th-century music.These works exemplify how Pärt fused early sacred music traditions with his minimalist aesthetic to create a form of modern devotional music that speaks to both religious and secular audiences.For Pärt, faith is not a subject – it is the wellspring of his art. “Some 30 years ago,” he said in a 2007 speech as he accepted an honorary doctorate in theology from the University of Freiburg, “I was in my great desperation ready to ask anyone how a composer ought to write music. I met a street-sweeper who gave me a remarkable reply. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘the composer would probably need to love each and every sound.’ This was a turning point. This self-evident truth completely surprised my soul, which was thirsting for God. From then on, my musical thoughts began to move in an entirely new direction. Nothing was the same any more.”Though often described as a “holy minimalist” (a term Pärt does not like since he considers it meaningless),his work resists easy categorisation. Unlike the pulsating energy of American minimalists such as Steve Reich or Philip Glass, Pärt’s music seeks a state of prayerfulness. “I have discovered,” he once said, “that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a moment of silence, comforts me.”View image in fullscreenThe London Sinfonietta and Royal Academy of Music perform Pärt’s Homage to Anish Kapoor and his sculpture Marysas in 2003 at the Tate Modern, London.Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/PAThere are also secular works inspired by art and architecture. Silhouette (2009), for example, is a short dance-like piece for string orchestra and percussion based on the elegant structural design of the Eiffel Tower, and his quasi-piano concerto, Lamentate (2002) was commissioned by London’s Tate Modern and was inspired by the enormous sculptureMarsyas by Anish Kapoor.His influence extends far beyond classical music. Artists such as Björk and Radiohead have cited him as an inspiration. Film-makers such as Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Joss Whedon (Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015) have used his music to underscore moments of existential weight and grace. And, in recent years, cover versions of his music abound. The little piano piece Für Alina, for example, has spawned hundreds of covers from artists as diverse as jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, US ambient musicianRafael Anton Irisarri, and a YouTuber known as “euwbah”who improvises on the piece using a cross-platform microtonal seaboard patcher (a computer program that allows the use of a keyboard to generate microtonal pitches).Pärt has not composed much in the past decade or so because of his advanced age, but a late-night Prom on 31 July – billed as a birthday tribute – is an opportunity to catch the UK premiere of his most recent work, Für Jan van Eyck (commissioned in 2020 by the city of Ghent to celebrate the restoration of the famous Van Eyck altarpiece) for mixed choir and organ.The programme – performed by acclaimed Pärt interpreters Tõnu Kaljuste and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir – also complements his music with short choral works by composers he loves: Bach, Rachmaninov, fellow Estonian composer Veljo Tormis and the Ukrainian composer Galina Grigorjeva. The celebrations continue into the autumn where a series at the Barbican in London includes an interesting take on Pärt’s music in a concert on 26 November which is “refracted” through the lens of DJ Koreless and composers Sasha Scott and Oilver Coates, pointing again to the esteem for this music felt by other creators.Pärt with Pope Benedict XVI in 2011.Photograph: Vatican press officePärt’s popularity has not diluted the intensity of his vision. If anything, it underscores the hunger many feel for what his music offers: a refuge from noise, a space for reflection, a sonic form of grace. “The author John Updike once said that he tries to work with the same calmness like the craftsmen of the middle ages who decorated the hidden sides of the pews with their carvings, although no one would be able to see them. I try, as much as I can, to live by the same principle,” he said in a rareinterview in 2020.In an age of distraction and crisis, Pärt’s work invites listeners into an intimate encounter with stillness. It is not escapism, but focused attention – music that opens the soul to something beyond itself. In an age increasingly defined by noise, he offers us silence not as absence, but as invitation. At 90, his music still speaks – softly, clearly, and with unwavering grace, and is always worth a listen.Arvo Pärt at 90 is at thelate-night Prom on 31 July; Tabula Rasa is part of theProms@Bristol Beaconconcert on 23 August. The Barbican London’sArvo Pärt at 90 seriesruns from 3 October to 26 November.Andrew Shentonis a cultural critic and musician based in Boston, MA.

Composed in 1948, String Quartet No 1 belongs to what Ginastera called his period of “objective nationalism”, when, following the example of his teacher Aaron Copland, he incorporated the folk music of his native Argentina more or less unaltered into his own music; 10 years later, in the “subjective nationalism” of the second quartet, those colouristic elements have been absorbed into the energised textures of his works, which are organised using Schoenberg’s 12-note technique.View image in fullscreenGinastera: String Quartets by Miró QuartetAs theMiró Quartet’s performances of the first two quartets show, both are attractive works, full of vivid incident, which deserve to be included in recitals far more often than they are. But it’s the third quartet that’s the real discovery here. By the time it was composed in 1973, Ginastera was living in Europe (he would die in Geneva in 1983) and in what he described as his “neo-expressionism” phase. Taking its cue from Schoenberg’s second quartet, it adds a solo soprano to the lineup, for passionate, dramatic settings of texts by three 20th-century Spanish poets: Juan Ramón Jiménez, Federico García Lorca and Rafael Alberti. The recording places the soprano, Kiera Duffy, rather farther forward than ideal, but there’s no denying that the effect is totally compelling.Allow content provided by a third party?This article includes content hosted onembed.music.apple.com.

As a teenager he had played the organ at the Palace theatre, Watford, and in the 1960s studied at the Royal College of Music before becoming organ scholar at King’s College, Cambridge; he began his professional career as the keyboard player for the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.View image in fullscreenAndrew Davis: King of KingsIn the last two years of his life, Davis returned to the music that had been his first love by making orchestral versions of some ofJS Bach’s organ works. In 2023, he began to record a selection of his orchestrations with the BBC Philharmonic for Chandos, but when he died in April last year just four arrangements had been recorded, and Martyn Brabbins stepped in to complete the project with the orchestra the following September.The result is a sequence that begins with the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which Davis has orchestrated in a relatively restrained way, especially when compared with the spectacular version that Leopold Stokowski famously concocted for Walt Disney’s Fantasia, and it ends with the E flat St Anne Prelude and Fugue, while in between there is a series of chorale preludes, arranged like the bigger works in an unshowy but always thoroughly musical way: for instance, the Trio super Herr Jesu Christ, Dich zu Uns Wend becomes a busy instrumental movement that could have come out of the Brandenburg Concertos. The most interesting of the arrangements, though, is the one that Davis made a decade earlier than all the rest, of the great Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, whose more fastidious, almost pointillist orchestration recalls Webern’s famous version of the six-part ricercare from Bach’s Musical Offering.

Rush-released two days after its existence was announced, it had been trailed by the appearance of cryptic art installations at the rapper’s live shows – he’s still theoretically touring his last album, 2024’sChromakopia– and at One World Trade Center in New York, and by a flurry of online gossip: one US website was forced to retract and apologise for publishing a tracklisting, complete with guest appearance by Kendrick Lamar, that turned out to be fake.View image in fullscreenTyler the Creator: Don’t Tap the GlassDespite all this, Tyler Okonma seemed keen to deflate the kind of anticipation that arises when your last three albums have all been critically lauded, platinum-selling chart-toppersfull of big ideas. “Y’all better get them expectations and hopes down,” he posted on X, “this ain’t no concept nothing.” He then published an essay that read suspiciously like an explanation of the album’s concept, bemoaning the intrusion of cameraphones and social media on our ability to live in the moment: “Our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme.”So what is Don’t Tap the Glass? A proper follow-up to Chromakopia or an interstitial release? A random selection of songs with no overarching theme, or something made with more deliberate intent? The answer seems to be: all these things. It lasts less than half an hour, and is noticeably, if not entirely, lacking the soul-searching that helped define its predecessor. The lyrics tend to stick to braggadocio and reaffirmations of the nihilistic persona Tyler inhabited in the days when he was deemed such a threat to the country’s morals that anti-terrorism legistation was invoked toban him from the UK: the first, but far from last, mention of him not giving a fuck about anything arrives less than 30 seconds into the album. There are a lot of memorable one-liners, among which “I don’t trust white people with dreadlocks” and his dismissal of an ageing rival stand out: “49, still in the street / Your prostate exam in a week.”Tyler, the Creator: Stop Playing With Me – videoIt also eschews Chromakopia’s kaleidoscopic musical approach, its sudden leaps from Beach Boys harmony to Zamrock samples to guest spots from Lola Young and Lil Wayne. It’s still eclectic in its choice of source material – opener Big Poe samples Busta Rhymes and a2015 collaborative albummade by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Shye Ben Tzur and India’s Rajasthan Express – but ultimately feels more narrow and focused. Almost all of its 10 tracks seem fixated on the dancefloor. There are 808 beats, Kraftwerk-y electronics, a noticeable smattering of Zapp-like vocoder and electro, among other early 80s genres. Powered by a bassline that’s a dead ringer for that of Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall and decorated with washes of synthetic strings and a falsetto vocal, Ring Ring Ring feels like a lost Leroy Burgess boogie production from the same era. The huge, distorted breakbeat of Big Poe recalls the rhythms produced by the Bomb Squad in their prime, amplified by the stentorian, Chuck D-like tone of Pharrell Williams’s guest rap. Elsewhere, I’ll Take Care of You unexpectedly transforms from a beatless electronic ballad into something that – with its clattering rhythm and grimy sub-bass – most closely resembles old skool UK hardcore rave: in a neat bit of self-referentiality, the clattering rhythm is actually repurposed from the title track of Tyler’s 2015 albumCherry Bomb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The musical reference points are deployed with an evident love and understanding of the source material, never feeling like box-ticking or pastiche; the hooks work with enviable efficiency. It’s all funky enough that you imagine even the selfie-obsessed pocketing their phone and throwing themselves around if it came booming from some big speakers.But it’s also not the whole story. There are scattered moments when Don’t Tap the Glass feels of a piece with, or an addendum to, Chromakopia. In the middle of the album lurks the incongruous Mommanem, thick with the grunts and gasps and feral barks that were Chromakopia’s sonic signature. On the concluding Tell Me What It Is, Tyler suddenly drops the boasts and the IDGAF stuff in favour of precisely the heartsore self-examination that characterised his previous album, the sentiments amplified by the untutored frailty of his singing voice: “I’m feeling like a bum … is there a traffic to my soul? I need answers … Why can’t I find love?”It’s an odd way to end an album that seems largely about not overthinking things and simply giving yourself up to the moment, but, then, this is the man who once rapped “I’m a fucking walking paradox / No I’m not.” Fourteen years on,Tyler, the Creatorclearly still reserves the right to be contradictory. When the results are as good as Don’t Tap the Glass, who can blame him?This week Alexis listened toBlood Orange – The FieldNot a song of the summer in the accepted dancefloor banger sense, but The Field’s Durutti Column sample, skittering beats and ethereal vocals (by Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar) are the perfect soundtrack to a languid afternoon.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekTyler, the CreatorRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

The Artist was selected from ashortlist of six bookswhich also featuredConfessions by Catherine Airey,Saraswati by Gurnaik Johal,Ordinary Saints by Niamh Ní Mhaoileoin,Sunstruck by William Rayfet Hunter, andWhen the Cranes Fly South by Lisa Ridzén.The winner was chosen by a panel of booksellers informed by votes and feedback from more than 650 booksellers fromWaterstonesshops.Bea Carvalho, head of books at Waterstones, said Steeds’ novel “stood out for its atmospheric, sensory prose, and its headily evocative sense of time and place.“This is a gorgeously claustrophobic novel to be fully swept away by: The Artist has something for readers of all tastes and heralds the arrival of an exciting new voice. We can’t wait to see what Lucy Steeds does next.”Steeds, who is originally from north London, began writing the novel while living in France. Commenting on the inspiration behind the novel, she said she was “fascinated by the concept of art monsters.

His new book gets us rooting for two wealthy management consultants fresh out of Oxford, both of them men (assuming you haven’t already tuned out). I suspect his agent might have found it easier to pitch a novel about sex criminals, not least because Drayton and Mackenzie’s approach is so unfashionably traditionalist: it’s a chunky, warmly observed, 9/11-to-Covid saga that, while comic in tone and often extremely funny, doesn’t labour under any obligation to send up its protagonists, still less take them down.James Drayton, born to north London academics, is a socially awkward high achiever who privately measures himself against Christopher Columbus and Napoleon. Joining the McKinsey consultancy firm after coming top of his year in philosophy, politics and economics hasn’t eased the pressure he has always felt to “come up with something so brilliant it was irrefutable, like the obliterating ultra-white light of a nuclear bomb”.There’s pathos and laughter in the duo’s beer-and-Champions League blokeishness, a way to keep unvoiced feeling at bayThe key to his sense of destiny arrives in the unlikely shape of a slacking junior colleague, Roland Mackenzie, who graduated with a 2:2 in physics (for James, a shame akin to “admitting erectile dysfunction”). Mutual suspicion thaws when they’re tasked with restructuring an Aberdeen oil firm in possession of the patents for a pioneering underwater turbine – tempting James and Roland to poach their star engineer, quit McKinsey and go it alone in green energy.It’s a mark of Starritt’s confidence that the quest to harness tidal power – the book’s main business – gets going only 200 pages in. We feel in safe hands from the start, reassured that he knows the story’s every last turn (“In later years, when he was the subject of articles and interviews …” begins a line about James on the second page, his A-levels barely over). But we’re kept on our toes: while the narration hews to the point of view of the central duo, it fills in the period backdrop – bailouts, Brexit – by dipping unpredictably into the perspective of real-life figures such as the Italian politician and former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, seen delivering his famous 2012 speech vowing to save the euro “whatever it takes”. As James and Roland jet around the world for venture capital, Starritt grants hefty speaking parts to PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Elon Musk (is he allowed to do that?, I asked myself: always a sign of a writer up to something exciting).The plot is crammed with curveballs for the plucky entrepreneurs, whether it’s a shattered undersea cable, a coma caused by undiagnosed diabetes, or the dilemma that ensues when James and Roland fall for the same woman, having spent much of the novel joking uneasily about going to bed with each other. With a joyful knack for pithy analogy, the writing holds our attention as much as the events: the aforementioned relationship wrangle induces a “low eczemal itch of guilt” in the eventual girlfriend-stealer, while new parents drive home from the maternity ward feeling “like random civilians handed suits and guns and told to protect a miniature, defenceless president”.There’s pathos as well as laughter in the protagonists’ beer-and-Champions League blokeishness, a way to keep unvoiced feeling at bay. When Roland, nearly 30, wistfully recalls a teenage holiday fling, he thinks that “she was probably someone’s mum by now”, a line hinting at his deep-lying sense of stasis, even as the company’s ambition grows: not just electricity, but rocket fuel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the end, though, critique of disruptor-era genius is less important here than feeling and friendship; the winningly Edwardian, even Victorian, approach to storytelling extends right to the heart-swelling deathbed climax.

This well-crafted concert byEnsemble Intercontemporain, the orchestra Boulez founded in 1976, avoided the obvious hits while demonstrating just how different their music could be.Berio’s Sequenza V for solo trombone is one of 14 pieces he wrote to test the boundaries of particular instruments or vocal types. It was inspired byGrock, a Swiss-born clown and one-time neighbour of the composer, whose personality had fascinated him as a boy.Lucas Ounissi, ambling on in full circus slap and a lime-green wig, put his instrument through its paces. Juggling a handheld plunger mute, he rasped and farted away, frequently singing and playing at the same time. A virtuoso performance showed off the breadth of the composer’s imagination as well as his singular sense of humour.View image in fullscreenActed a good fight … Sarah Aristodou sings Berio’s Recital IPhotograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCThe more sober-minded Boulez was represented by his Dialogue de l’ombre double (Dialogue of the Double Shadow). Written to celebrate Berio’s 60th birthday, it pits an on-stage clarinettist against his pre-recorded doppelganger, the latter electronically manipulated in real time and piped into the auditorium through speakers. The versatileJérôme Comtehot-desked from one music stand to another, taking melismatic licks and frenetic outbursts in his stride. Rock-solid technique and calm deliberation brought clarity and purpose to Boulez’s intricate demands. The pre-record, meanwhile, bounced off the walls and ceiling of the Royal Albert Hall in a mesmerising wash of surround sound.The grand finale was Berio’s Recital I (For Cathy), a piece the composer wrote in 1972 for his former wife Cathy Berberian. The conceit is theatrical: an operatic diva shows up for a recital only to find her accompanist isn’t there. An ensemble of 17 takes up the cause, with the singer descending into madness as she tosses off scatter-gun quotes from vocal works of the past. Berberian’s visceral account, captured on record, was a tour de force. Sarah Aristidou certainly acted a good fight, with conductor Pierre Bleuse gamely adding his dramatic six penn’orth, but the spoken text was barely audible, rendering the work more gnomic than usual.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

The gay, gender-fluid rapper and reality TV star exhorts every kind of body to shake it and is unequivocal about her support for all marginalised people; her reputation led Beyoncé and Drake to sample her on some of their most successful tracks. “This album is for us,” she emphasises. “It is for people who are LGBTQ and who love God.”When the beat of a new song, Take My Hand, kicks into double time, just the way a sanctified rhythm section would in church, she brings gospel catharsis to queer people in the same southern state wherethe US supreme court recently upheld a ban on transgender youth healthcare, at a time when LGBTQ+ progress across the US is meeting with forceful religious pushback.The week after, Big Freedia logs on to our video call to talk gospel. “It’s already an ass revival when they come to a Big Freedia show,” she says, referring to the mass twerking her shows inspire. “And now they’re coming to a Big Freedia gospel revival.”View image in fullscreen‘There is no judgment’ … performing at Nashville Pride.Photograph: Tibrina Hobson/Getty ImagesIn one sense, it’s a superficial distinction. Back in the church choir of Big Freedia’s youth, she moved people to ecstatic dance: “We would have lots of clapping, stomping of the feet, choreographed dancing that we would do in our robes.” The young singer, who back then could hit soprano range, showed such dedication and promise that the choir’s director made her their assistant. By high school, Big Freedia was leading ensembles and envisioned that as her future. “I thought I was going to be a famous choir director and that I was gonna be singing with choirs all around the world.”Big Freedia says she grew up feeling welcomed by the working-class Black Baptist congregation that knew her as Freddie Ross Jr – so much so that she used its name as the title of her new album. “From the first time I walked in the doors, they put their arms around me and gave me the biggest hug,” she says. “And they knew I was a young gay boy. I was loud and proud, even as a kid. We didn’t have those moments of the pastor talking about: ‘God doesn’t love gay folks.’ God loved us all.”She was also becoming part of a circle of rappers that were making boastful, bass-heavy New Orleans club music a vehicle for their party-starting queer and gender-expansive personae. The bounce scene beckoned. Big Freedia received assurance from her mum and other church folk that pursuing it wouldn’t be sacrilegious, as long as she maintained her relationship with God – and she lets it be known, loudly and often, that she has. Before she took the stage at Pride, her team huddled and someone offered a prayer: “God give Freedia the supernatural strength, in the name of Jesus, from the top of her head to the soles of her feet.”‘This album is for the world’ … Big Freedia and Billy Porter performing Holy Shuffle at SummerStage in Brooklyn this month.Big Freedia certainly isn’t the first member of the LGBTQ+ community to contribute to the gospel canon. That lineage might be more widely acknowledged if generations of the music’s pioneers hadn’t been required to live closeted lives. “Once you start historicising, you figure out that so much of what is sung in churches was created by, and continues to be created by, queer folks,” says Ashon Crawley, a religious studies scholar and cultural critic who draws on insight he gained as a young, Black, queer Pentecostal church musician.In her youth, Big Freedia recorded with the New Orleans Gospel Soul Children choir, but she had never contemplated her own gospel project until a 2024 session yielded the spiritually ebullient dance track Celebration. “God put it on my heart that this is what I need to do,” she says. Big Freedia made clear to potential co-writers that she still wanted her audacious swagger and compassion to come through and that she wasn’t out to convert anyone. “I’m representing for the LGBTQ community,” she told them. “So when they come here, the door is bust wide open and there is no judgment and you have this moment to lose it in the spirit.”Parson James, a Nashville-based pop artist who is queer and biracial, helped her craft some of the hooks. He had dealt with the homophobia of his small-town South Carolina congregation by distancing himself from the church and its music, so he was wary of returning to gospel, but he put his trust in Big Freedia’s intentions. “Doing it with someone who’s so confident – you can’t tell her shit – it just was amazing.”‘The 21st century is queer. Accept it’: the Harlem Gospel Travelers on prejudice in the church – and singing for Joe BidenRead morePressing Onward has ample pop accessibility: over an 808 drum machine, Sunday Best blends hip-hop fashion flexes and brags about Black church finery. But the album is also lifted by unmistakable gospel elements: warm, reverberant eruptions of Hammond B3 organ; the taut, powerful unison of mass choir singing. Crawley sees Big Freedia’s reclamation of these traditions as potentially subversive. “It demonstrates to the church: your excluding of us doesn’t have to be the end of our story; we find community with one another in ways that you both taught us how to do and in ways you could not anticipate. So perhaps you should pay more attention to the very thing that you have excluded.”Big Freedia initially planned to release Pressing Onward in June’s Pride month, but in May her longtime partner, Devon Hurst, died unexpectedly of diabetes complications. She insisted on directing the choir at his funeral. The day before our interview, she closed on the house they had planned to buy together. “My whole life has just changed within this last month,” she says. “It has been an emotional rollercoaster, all the things that me and him had planned and the things we were doing and working on. And now I’m doing all these things by myself.”Even in her profound grief, she was willing to push the album release back only by a month. “I need it more than anybody,” she says. “And I know if I need it, there’s other people out there in the world that need it. There’s always someone who’s depressed or going through a hard time. There is always someone who’s fighting who they are, or fighting against a community of people that don’t accept who they are. This album is not just for me – it’s for the world.”Pressing Onward is released via Queen Diva Music on 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicRapNew OrleansLGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Some sought solace in sarcasm: “I think they nailed it. I’m always in the pub in the 1910s writing love letters to American girls with my big dirty fingernails. Finally I feel seen.”Last week came the twist:Epic, the Irish emigration museum in Dublin, revealed it had made the trailer and that the film, titled Dear Erin, did not exist. The trailer was a stunt to lampoon the stereotyping of Ireland in Hollywood romcoms such asWild Mountain Thyme, Irish Wish,Leap YearandPS I Love You.View image in fullscreenThe big reveal.Photograph: Epic“It was time to call it out,” the museum said in astatement. “We created a trailer for a film that we hope never gets made, and filled it with all of the tired, cliched portrayals of Irish people often seen in Hollywood movies.”Colonial-era stereotypes of the Irish as fist-fighting drunks or hopeless romantics persisted in contemporary films, warping perceptions of a complex, multilayered society, Aileesh Carew, the museum’s director and chief executive, said in an interview. “If you don’t know anyone fromIrelandthen these films may be your only reference point.”The trailer features the actor Peter Coonan sporting shamrocks on his lapel and surrounded by empty beer glasses as his voiceover reminisces about meeting Erin: “I have played that night over in my head more times than the Finnegans fought the O’Malleys.”The goal was to mimic a studio publicity campaign while cramming in every conceivable cliche, said Carew, adding: “Potatoes, we forgot the potatoes.”Hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok and LadBible, along with the response on Instagram, Reddit and other platforms, showed the campaign had hit a chord, said Carew.Before the reveal, some commenters guessed that the trailer was a spoof, while others begged that it be so. “Must be a joke here somewhere,” said one. “Sweet Jesus no please. This should be called Dear God No! not Dear Erin.”The Hollywood stereotypes dated from the 1930s when gangster films featured Irish characters who were menacing thugs or comic relief drunks, but invariably seedy, said Dr Sian Barber, a film studies lecturer at Queen’s University Belfast. “Irishness was something foreign but also comforting. It was not done with any malice but it quickly became embedded in Hollywood consciousness.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s playing to this tourist idea of what Ireland can offer – the landscape, the loveable rogue.”John Ford’s 1952 filmThe Quiet Manset a template of sorts by sending John Wayne’s character back to his homeland to find a wife, whom he ends up dragging through fields, but its rural setting reflected much of Irish life at that time, unlike more recent fare that suggests society still revolves around sheep, donkeys and Guinness.Irish critics howled – in mirth and agony – at the whimsy and dodgy accents in the likes ofWild Mountain Thyme, a 2020 romcom starring Jamie Dornan and Emily Blunt, andIrish Wish, a 2024 vehicle for Lindsay Lohan.The main problem was not inaccuracy but lack of context, said Paudie Holly, a storyteller at Dublin’sNational Leprechaun Museum. Folklore can and should be celebrated, and there was no reason to feel shame about Ireland’s rural past, but modern Ireland was different, he said. “It’s ridiculous to suggest our culture has been frozen in place for a hundred years.”Lance Daly, the Dublin-based director ofBlack 47, said Ireland had aggravated the phenomenon by luring foreign productions for the jobs they would bring rather than the stories they would tell. “What you have then is a director who is not Irish directing actors who are not Irish … We have a weird tolerance for it. We have to be careful that we’re not sponsoring foreign film-makers to make fools of us.”Explore more on these topicsIrelandMuseumsAdvertisingMarketing & PREuropenewsShareReuse this content"

You get to weigh up the caseFind out how to get a disagreement settled or become a jurorInterviews byGeorgina LawtonThu 24 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 10.44 EDTShareThe prosecution: PersephoneNice accommodation is a big part of a trip, and by cutting cornersCara actually costs us moneyMy girlfriend Cara and I have been together seven years, but we have only travelled together a handful of times as we are both homebodies. But earlier this year, we went on holiday to Greece to visit my family, and it quickly became clear that we aren’t travel-compatible.Cara tries to cut corners, but it can end up costing us money. First, she didn’t want to pay for hold luggage. We were going away for 12 days and she insisted on squeezing everything into her backpack. She squished all her clothes into these silly packing cubes and I thought: this is insanity. Some of it didn’t fit, so she made me pack it in my suitcase. And when we got to the airport, she was asked to pay extra as her backpack didn’t fit in the holder by the check-in desk. It was really embarrassing.If I had my way, I would just share one big case, but Cara is a bit of a control-freak and she likes her stuff to be separateWe are going away again next month, to Barcelona, and Cara has mentioned that she wants us to budget-pack again. I’d rather bring a bigger suitcase and just pay the extra. Last time, because she got charged we lost money that could have gone towards a meal out.If I had my way, I would just share one big case, but Cara is a bit of a control-freak and she likes her stuff to be separate. She is a tidy packer, whereas I am a bit more relaxed and just throw everything in, which she says stresses her out.Cara also prefers to stay at the cheapest places so we can save money for eating out and activities. In Greece we stayed with my family for one week, but we disagreed on which hotel to book for the rest of the trip. Cara wanted to stay in a tiny attic room and go to five star restaurants in the evening, but I wanted to splurge on a nice hotel after being with family.She said comfortable accommodation was unnecessarily flash. In the end I paid most of the hotel bill – I just wanted to relax. But when we go to Barcelona, I think Cara should plan ahead so we aren’t at loggerheads over packing and priorities.We don’t live together as we like our own space, so our finances are separate. But when we travel we both need to compromise.The defence: CaraI’m a budget babe and a foodie. I want to eat at nice places, not waste money on luggage fees and hotelsPersephone earns a bit more than me, so of course we have different travel styles. I love travelling with her but she is quite flash, whereas I’m a budget babe.When we went to Greece, she wanted to splash out on a really fancy hotel after staying with her family. I wasn’t against that of course, but I just couldn’t afford it. Luckily she paid, but I feel it’s being held against me now as we plan our Barcelona trip.I’m a food stylist and eating out is my passion. I want to eat at nice places as food is how you get to know a culture. I haven’t been to Spain before, so I have a list of places I want to try. But to prioritise nice food, I need to scrimp on accommodation. That makes perfect sense to me as I’m only there to sleep. The rest of the time I want to be out exploring and eating. Persephone isn’t a foodie, and disagrees.If she doesn’t want to end up paying for everything, Persephone needs to meet me in the middle with our accommodation optionsI also like to keep my packing light to save on ridiculous luggage fees. Because I got fined for having too heavy a backpack last trip, I am now being condemned as an irresponsible traveller. But that was the first time that happened. I paid the extra baggage fee myself, and have since bought holiday scales.I don’t want to share Persephone’s suitcase because she doesn’t pack properly and I find that stressful. I may put all my stuff in one backpack, but it is very well organised. Persephone’s packing style is hectic and she doesn’t have a separate laundry bag for her unclean clothes, she just throws them all in together. I don’t want dirty laundry touching my stuff, thanks very much.I don’t love budget travel but it’s a means to an end, and when you’re with someone who has more money you both have to compromise.Ultimately we prioritise different things when we are abroad. If she doesn’t want to end up paying for everything, Persephone needs to meet me in the middle with our accommodation options for Barcelona. She’s very generous but I’d prefer to split the cost of somewhere we both like.The jury of Guardian readersShould Cara splash more cash?If Cara wants to go hand luggage-only, that’s fine, but she needs to pack within her means and not cram her extras into Persephone’s luggage. More importantly, I think the couple need to find a better balance when travelling together – something that works for both of their comfort and budget levels.Shayane, 30Not guilty, but only just. How and what Cara packs is her own business – there is no reason for them both to do it the same way or share a case. On food and accommodation, they could both compromise and pay for what matters most to them: Persephone pays for the room, Cara pays for meals.Peter, 60Neither party is hugely in the wrong here (except the lack of laundry bag!). Surely the way to compromise is for Persephone to pay for baggage fees and the accommodation, and Cara to pay for the food.Alex, 37Cara ought to let herself be spoiled. Persephone clearly recognises that she is better off and does pay where helpful, and Cara is willing tofoot the bill when she makes a mistake, too. Persephone even seems open to paying for baggage if they share a huge suitcase.Mor, 21Persephone should be a bit more generous and pay for everything. If you’re in a couple it’s good to be relaxed about money and err on the side of generosity. It all comes out in the wash anyway.Anna, 45Now you be the judgeIn our online poll, tell us: who is in the right?The poll closes on Wednesday 30 July at 10am BSTLast week’s resultsWe asked ifMurad should use his flatmate’s spice rack17%said yes – Murad is guilty83%said no – Murad is innocentExplore more on these topicsRelationshipsYou be the judgeRomantic tripsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My feet felt like they had been put in a vice and squeezed. The gout was a bit of curveball but the hospital prescribed some stuff and it went away. Now I feel fine.”James’s progress along the coastlines of England, Wales and Scotland is being tracked by experts fromthe University of Exeter, who are keen to find out the effects of such an extreme challenge on an older person.View image in fullscreenJames being monitored by researchers at the University of Exeter.Photograph: Steve James/University of Exeter/PAHe set off from Topsham, on the south coast of Devon, in April and headed to Kent in south-east England. He then ran north to John o’Groats in north-eastScotlandand is on the Scottish west coast steadily working his way south.There is no set route. He has a plan but adapts and changes it. “If you’re in Devon and Cornwall andWales, there is a clearly defined coast path. In Scotland there’s virtually no coast path, so you’re carving out your own routes. I’ve been on the Isle of Mull, which was never in the original itinerary, but I hopped on and off and it worked.”The challenge is to do, on average, a marathon every day. Some days, depending on where the accommodation is, it might be a bit less; others a bit more, and he is not trying to clock good marathon times.View image in fullscreen‘I can keep going,’ says James, who is not following the type of diet an elite athlete might adopt.Photograph: Steve James/Exeter University/PA“I am not flat out every day. There’s a lot of walking involved, a bit of jogging, a bit of running – a real mix. And I’m stopping a couple of times each day just to sort of rest up, if you like, have a coffee, a cake or whatever, and then get going again.”“It’s all about routine,” said James, who is fromDevonand trained for his challenge on Dartmoor. “It’s all about getting up at the same time, leaving at the same time; it’s a bit like going to work. I love the physical challenge, the idea of stretching myself physically. I’m not especially talented at things – you wouldn’t want to play golf with me, you wouldn’t want me on your football team. But I can keep going.”He is not following the sort of diet an elite athlete might adopt. When the Guardian spoke to him, James had eaten cereal, a bacon baguette, cake and was planning fish and chips for dinner, washed down with a couple of pints.View image in fullscreenJames is raising money for Cancer Research UK and the Scouts.Photograph: Steve JamesThe Exeter researchers assessed James before his departure and he sends data daily for them to analyse. They are studying his calorie intake, oxygen levels and muscle measurements to examine the effect of the challenge. He has lost about 10kg but the team has seen no ill-effects to his health.Freyja Haigh, a nutritional physiology researcher at the University of Exeter, said: “Steve gives us a real insight into how this type of endurance impacts the body of an older person. We’re unsure at the moment if Steve’s weight loss is from fat or muscle mass.”James,who is raising money for Cancer Research UK and the Scouts,passes the time by listening to music and is also learning Cymraeg – Welsh. By the time he gets to Wales, he hopes to be able to order a pint in the language.He thinks the most difficult stretch physically will be the north coasts of Devon and Cornwall. “I’m kind of hoping by then my body’s completely acclimatised and I’ll be able to cope with that.”Explore more on these topicsMarathon runningMarathonDevonAgeingMedical researchRunningMen's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In one section of my first book,Corker: A Deeply Unserious Wine Book, I sought to address the single-biggest DM slide I get every summer: what wines to bring to a barbecue. And the reason this is my most common request is pretty simple: where I live, in London, being invited to a barbecue means you have a friend with a garden, whereas most of us are concertinaed into blocks of flats and house shares.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The prospect of spending a hot afternoon outdoors and with a glass of something delicious is far more delightful than the idea of spending it in my sweaty room surrounded by black clothing (an excellent heat-insulating technique, by the way), especially if it involves an actual garden and generous pals. That’s an occasion to which you want to bring a bottle of something good.In the book, I suggested a red Côtes du Rhône, and the thinking behind that is also simple: Côtes du Rhône is sublime when drunk slightly chilled (drag it out of the ice bucket 10 minutes before you want to pour), it pairs well with most things that you can chuck on a barbecue, and you can buy more than one bottle without completelyrinsing your bank account. See also: gamay, barbera, barbaresco, pinot noir, malbec and darker rosés.However, this year, I want to expand my horizons beyond the obvious pulls, not least because there’s a sincere satisfaction to be found in an unexpected but undeniably congruous wine and food pairing. So I asked a few friends in the know for their off-the-beaten-track recommendations.Aleesha Hansel, a wine writer and broadcaster, offers this advice: “Barbecues aren’t the place to bring out your grand crus or the weird-and-wonderfuls. Wine people will usually recommend a wine to go with the food, which is often a red with a bit of spice or savouriness, but I think matching with the vibes is the best way to go, andméthode cap classiquesparkling wines tick that box for me. Look for bottles that are a bit richer and rounder – they remind me of golden-hour sunlight with their ripe, stone fruit flavours.”I alsohadto ask the sovereign of the grill,Christian Stevenson, AKA DJ BBQ, for his pointers on what to drink, because, well, if anyone knows what to drink with a barbecue, it’s him. He is likewise anti-red: “Vinho verdes and albariños are my go-to wines in summer. Lamb shoulder, pork shoulder, ribs, fish tacos and coal-roasted veg all rock nicely with those bottles. I’ll dive into a chewy red when it’s winter, but right now it’s summer, and I’m standing around hot coals in the sun.” Sounds like the man has a garden, so I’ll wait for my invitation in the post.Four unexpected wines that work with a barbecueNatural Mystic Vinho Verde£9.95 The Wine Society, 11.5%.

The principal reason for this was the overcooked rice, which was my fault for three reasons: I was using a brand I have never used before and didn’t read the packet; I forgot to set the kitchen timer; and I ignored my instinct to tip it out (dog? Cake? Compost? Bin?) and start again. To my overcooked rice I added not-tasty tomatoes, tough minced parsley, extra-virgin olive oil, a bit too much vinegar, olives, capers and hard-boiled eggs; I also added an expensive tin of tuna, which did a brilliant job of making the whole thing taste better, although still not good. Everyone agreed that it was a depressing dinner, then we went out for ice-cream.The good thing about making a bad rice salad is the need to redeem and reassure myself that I am capable of making not only a good one, but a great one, though I do appreciate that today’s first paragraph might make you doubt this. A good rice salad begins with well-cooked long-grain rice and involves a good balance of four vegetable elements: raw (tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, celery, say), cooked (beans, courgettes, peas, sweetcorn), vegetables preserved in oil (peppers, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, aubergine), and pickled or salted vegetables (dill pickles, olives, capers, caper berries). There should also be some form of protein, whether that’s tuna, cheese, tofu, salami or wurstel; possibly involve (tender) herbs; be dressed with oil and a little vinegar; and always be finished with egg (slices, wedges or chopped – you decide).Just as important as the balance of ingredients is the balance of temperatures. Many people like their rice salad fridge-cold – in fact, another name for insalata di risoin Italy isriso freddo(cold rice). I prefer the rice, cooked vegetables and tomatoes to be at room temperature, and the raw and picked vegetable elements to be fridge-cold. Celery and dill pickles are particularly good chilled additions when added just before serving, then the room-temperature hard-boiled eggs can be arranged on top. A note about the herbs: I think the clean, slightly black pepper taste of parsley is great here (although taste if it has been sitting in the fridge for a while), along with a few aniseed fronds of dill, plus fresh marjoram, with its gentle pine taste and sweetness.My mother-in-law believes that a transparent bowl (plastic or glass) plays a key role in the flavour of rice salad, and I think I agree. Of course, the most important advice for rice salad is to make it in exactly the way you like it, and serve it at a temperature you like, and to ensure that there is plenty of ice-cream (cold but at scooping temperature) for afters.Rice salad with red peppers, celery, herbs and eggServes4Salt and black pepper300g long-grain riceExtra-virgin olive oilFinely grated zest of 1 lemonRed-wine or sherry vinegar(optional)1 very big handfulminced herbs(parsley, marjoram, chives, mint, dill)1350g jar preserved red peppers, drained and chopped into bits300g cooked green beans, chopped into short lengths145g (1 tin) tuna in olive oil(optional)2 celery sticks, strings pulled away and discarded, flesh finely dicedA few dill pickles,diced4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and each cut into 8 wedges or finely choppedBring a large pan of water to a boil and season with salt.

But just because we can, does it mean we should?Leah HarperThu 24 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTShareWhen Alan and his partner got together, they were “both in failing marriages”. “If location tracking had been an option for our ex-spouses in those days, things would have been rather different,” he says. Alan, from north Oxfordshire, is still a fan of location sharing, despite the fact it would have once thwarted his romantic indiscretions. “I’m sure we would have still ended up together, but navigating the clandestine meetings would have been trickier.”The ability to share your location on your mobile phone has become a common way to keep tabs on friends, family and romantic partners. For some, it has become the signifier of a serious relationship: last year,the New York Timescalled location sharing “the final frontier in digital expressions of coupledom” and likened it to the Instagram “hard launch” (effectively announcing that you’re in a relationship by posting a photo of your partner for the first time). Others location-share on a whim and find themselves able to track the whereabouts of people they haven’t seen in person for years.But while it may have become the norm in certain circles, many remain resistant to what can feel like yet more digital surveillance. Just because we have the ability to know where our loved ones are at all times, does that mean we should?I’ve never shared my location with anyone beyond time-limited sharing on WhatsApp – usually while attempting to meet someone in a vague location such as the park. But I agree to try it out with my partner for a week in order to gauge the appeal, or lack of. We’re often in different cities – but I feel I usually have a good idea of his whereabouts, and vice versa. I’m not expecting any surprises.View image in fullscreenComposite: Getty Images/Guardian DesignAfter consenting to mutual location sharing via the iPhone’s Find My app – while sitting in the same room – I notice that we also have the option to set up notifications. He’s keen to know that I’ve got home safely when we’re not together – and safety is certainly a big part of the appeal for many users – so I allow the app to alert him each time I reach my front door. In a disappointingly heteronormative and retrograde move, I’m more interested in knowing when he goes out –where’s he off to now?– and set up my own notifications accordingly.Apple’s Find My function launched in 2009 under the name Find My iPhone, using GPS technology to help users locate missing devices. Find My Friends was launched as a separate app in 2011, andreportedly marketed to anxious parentswho were keen to know the whereabouts of their children. Speaking topeople who habitually use location trackers, this still seems to be one of the primary uses of these kinds of apps, as is tracking the location of elderly parents; the emphasis with both is on safety. When it comes to friends and partners, however, motives are more varied, ranging from curiosity to coercion.The two Apple apps were merged in 2019, and simply called Find My. Google’s Find Hub, formerly known as Find My Device, performs a similar function on Android, while apps such as Life360 offer a “comprehensive solution for families with mixed device environments” – ie a blend of iPhones and Android phones. The official X account for Life360, incidentally, feels very much geared towards younger generations, with posts such as, “i love it when someone says they checked my location. like thx for checking on me” and “She follows you on Instagram and me on Life360 … we are not the same.”This makes sense: arecent Australian surveyfound that nearly one in five young people (18-24 years old) think it’s OK to track their partner whenever they want. Having grown up with the internet, gen Z are, generally,more comfortable sharing their data online; Snapchat, the social media platformnotoriously most popular with younger users, has long incorporated location sharing with itsSnap Mapsfeature.ButJoanna Harrison, a couple therapist and the author ofFive Arguments All Couples (Need to) Have, believes location sharing can threaten the “balance between independence and togetherness” that is important in all relationships, particularly romantic ones. “It would be a shame if these apps took away an opportunity to share the details of each other’s independent lives because they already knew them,” she says. “There’s also a part of me that feels that a bit of romance is lost when you know, to the second, where someone is. What about the satisfying feeling of longing to be met when you know someone is arriving, but you don’t quite know when?”For Alan, 75, it’s a practical measure: he and his partner mutually enabled location tracking on their phones many years ago. He says it’s useful for predicting when the other is on their way home – especially when working irregular hours, with lengthy commutes. Being able to follow each other’s journeys gives them peace of mind, and makes it easier to time the cooking of meals. “The other way we use it is if one of us spots that the other is in town,” he says. “We can ask them to pop into a shop to get something.”This is less useful for me, since my partner lives in Glasgow while I am regularly in London for work. Even so, it is interesting – concerning? – to notice how quickly Find My joins the roster of apps I open routinely, often on autopilot. Instagram, Gmail, Vinted, Weather, Find My. I start to understand why so many people describe it as comforting. I follow my partner’s little blue dot around a parkrun; I see him popping to the shops, to the dentist. I feel a pang of jealousy when he visits my favourite bakery without me – but if location tracking has replaced my doomscrolling, it does feel relatively less anxiety-ridden.View image in fullscreenPeace of mind … knowing where your partner is can be reassuring.Photograph: Antonio Guillem Fernández/AlamyOf course, that’s not the case for everyone. When I tell (broadly millennial) friends about my experiment, not one of them offers to share their location with me. In a way, I’m relieved: I can only imagine the fomo spawned by seeing people out, together, without me. I imagine that, if it was still enabled, the temptation to sneak a peek at an ex’s location would be tantamount to browsing their new partner’s Instagram profile: you’re only torturing yourself.The tech itself is not infallible. “My husband and I share our locations with each other,” says Emily, 33, from London, “and mostly it isn’t an issue – although he did once message me, panicking, when I was heavily pregnant and my location showed me being in a hospital.” She was, in fact, on a train, travellingpastthe hospital.Equally, my partner is usually notified that I am home when I am still almost five minutes’ walk away – close to being safely through my front door, yes, but no guarantee. Then again, the alternative is perhaps no more reliable: after a night out, a friend messages to check I got home safely, as isstandard procedureamong so many women. Yes, I reply, all good. But I’m in my PJs, in bed – and could easily have already been asleep.Some research suggeststhat online surveillance “could support intimacy in couples with limited interactions, due to geographical separation or psychological reasons” – although this was not limited to location tracking specifically. That said, the domestic abuse charity Refuge also reported that, in 2019,72% of women accessing its services said they had been subjected to technology-facilitated abuse. This was not limited to location tracking, however, and, as thedigital rights advocate Samantha Floreani points out, other research suggests that “the notion of careful surveillance can form intimacy in ways that complicates typical ideas of privacy”. Ona recent episode of the Modern Love podcast, the host, Anna Martin, likened being able to see someone’s location to having a superpower. “But like any superpower,” she said, “it must be used responsibly. And sometimes, that means just turning it off.”Nedra Glover Tawwab, a relationship therapist and the author of books includingSet Boundaries, Find Peace, shares her location with her husband. She often travels for work and “it gives me comfort knowing that he knows where I am, without us having to talk or text about it”, she says. “When I travel with friends, we often share our locations to ensure we remain connected when we separate.”I ask whether she believes location sharing is a sign of trust within relationships – or distrust. “If someone is constantly monitoring your every move, it constitutes a violation of your privacy, even if you share your location,” she says. It’s not so much the tech itself but how it is used that is the indicator of trust. “Checking to see if someone’s plane landed is different from calling them each time they leave the house to let them know you’re watching.”For Harrison, “the key is how it is agreed on in the first place”. If there’s an imbalance – one person uses it far more than the other, or “uses it to handle anxieties about where their partner is” – then this could foster distrust within couples.‘Every time I took a shower I thought: is he watching me?’ – the terrifying rise of secret camerasRead moreI come to view it like any voluntary compromise in privacy where trust plays a role: my partner knows my phone’s passcode, for example, but I’d still be miffed to find him riffling through my messages. Of course, plenty of people wouldn’t dream of sharing their location (or their passcode, for that matter). Various friends look at me in horror when I tell them that I’m trying it out and say that theycould never–despite not living particularly duplicitous lives.“My girlfriend and I decided to switch on Find My in case something happened to one of us on a night out when the other wasn’t there,” saysone Guardian reader, who wished to remain anonymous. “Neither of us uses it to keep tabs on each other, but I’ve found the idea of it slightly worrying, as I’m usually quite conservative about my digital privacy. I’ve felt worried that, if I were to suggest switching it off, my girlfriend might suspect I’m looking to cheat on her.”This, I suspect, may be one of the more common problems with location sharing. I’ve been wondering when – or if – my partner and I will renege on our own agreement. And, if we do, will I feel free from being surveilled – or will I miss the security of feeling that I am never truly alone?View image in fullscreenAnxiety-trigger … knowing where your partner is can provoke feelings from fomo to worry.Photograph: Caia Image/AlamyHe, it turns out, had assumed we would turn tracking off once the week was up; admittedly, he keeps forgetting it’s on, only being reminded when he receives a notification. This seems a risk for anyone who shares their location without setting up such alerts – although, personally, I’d rather not add to the near-constant stream of notifications already pinging away on my phone.“Having a challenging conversation about not wanting to share your location any more can seem like a blow to the relationship,” says Tawwab. “Whatever the reason, it can seem like a back-pedalling act.” She notes that declining to share with someone can risk leading them to think you have something to hide – but stresses that total privacy is your right. To this, I would add that no amount of tracking is likely to deter a deceitful partner; there’s always a way around it. “We operated fine in the world without sharing our locations,” says Tawwab. “So if not sharing is your preference, you don’t have to share, even if the other person chooses to share with you.”Harrison agrees that it’s not for everyone. “The key thing is to think about what it means to use the apps for each of you and to explore any anxieties, concerns and hopes for it. In a sense, this is a conversation any couple would benefit from having, whether or not they use the apps: how are we keeping in touch with each other when we are apart, and what are each of our expectations here?”Location sharing may have its benefits, but it is easy to see how something might be lost, too. When I message friends to ask if they got home OK, it’s also me letting them know that I had fun, that I hope to see them again soon, that I love them.“Clearly some people find location sharing convenient and helpful,” says Harrison. But, “it is a bit of a shame to miss out on the human connection of a message that says: ‘I’ll be home in an hour, on my way.’”Some people featured in this article responded to acommunity callout.

Is it possible? We asked expertsMadeleine AggelerThu 24 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 12.01 EDTShareOn 14 July, actor and singer Suki Waterhouse shareda tweetexplaining her recent absence from X: “‘suki you never tweet anymore’ have you ever considered I wore pants so tight 6 months ago it caused a hernia & I’ve been too scared to tell you.”She followed up withtwo pictures: one shows her wearing what are presumably the offending pants, and the other shows her in a hospital bed, hooked up to an IV. (There is also a vape resting on her hospital gown. That’s not relevant to this story, just a fun detail.)Like many rich texts, the post raises a lot of questions. Like: could I pull off leather pants? They let celebrities vape in the hospital? And most importantly: can tight pants really cause a hernia?We asked experts.What is a hernia?A hernia is a hole in the abdominal wall, explains Dr Yewande Alimi, a bariatric and minimally invasive surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University hospital. The hole results in “protrusion of tissue from the abdomen”, she says. “Commonly fat, or sometimes intestine.”These look like small bulges, and oftenappearin areas where the abdominal wall tends to be weaker: around the groin, the front midline of the abdomen, through the diaphragm, in the belly button or through a previous surgical incision.Hernias are “very, very common”, says Dr Marcoandrea Giorgi, an associate professor of surgery at Brown University and bariatric surgeon at Brown Surgical Associates.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Symptoms vary. Some hernias are visible – bulges around your trunk “where you shouldn’t have one”, as theCleveland Clinicputs it. They can appear during certain strenuous activities, like exercising or sneezing, and then retract at other times. They may be painful – a sharp pain or a dull ache – or they may not feel like anything at all. Other hernias are too deep to see from the outside, but you may feel an ache or pressure.Inguinal hernias, those that appear around the groin, are the most common – about 25% of men and 2% of women will develop these at some point in their lives, according to the USNational Library of Medicine. Giorgi estimates that he personally treats about 100 inguinal hernias a year.Hernias that only contain fat are often not very dangerous, says Alimi. But “when hernias contain intestines and are associated with pain, there is an increased chance that those intestines can get stuck, resulting in the need for an emergency operation”, she says.What are ingrown toenails, and how can I avoid them?Read moreWhat causes a hernia?Hernias can be present from birth – umbilical or belly button hernias, for example – or they can develop over time as the result of wear and tear on the abdominal wall. Incisional hernias, those that appear through a former surgical incision, occur in about 15% of patients following surgery. Weight gain, pregnancy, strenuous exercise and a chronic cough or constipation can all weaken the abdominal wall and lead to potential hernias, says Alimi.Children who are born prematurely or who have connective tissue disorders, cystic fibrosis, hip dysplasia or problems in their urinary or reproductive systems are more likely to be born with congenital hernias, according to theCleveland Clinic.Can you get a hernia from tight pants?“Absolutely not,” says Dr Charlotte Horne, a metabolic and abdominal wall reconstructive surgeon at the Mayo Clinic. Tight clothing “might put pressure on something that was already there, but the outside layer is not going to result in breaking down layers of your abdominal wall”.Giorgi says he has never heard of a hernia related to tight pants. The only way this might be possible, he says, is if the pants were so tight that they put significant pressure on the upper abdomen. “It’s like you have a balloon with some water in it – if you squeeze one part of the balloon, the other part will be under more pressure,” he says. But even then, the balloon will only pop if the plastic is already stretched too thin, he says. In other words, wearing tight pants would only exacerbate an existing hernia, putting pressure on it and possibly resulting in a bulge, but it would not create a new one.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But most hernias never go away, and experts recommend consulting with a doctor to figure out the best course of action.Five free, easy ways to fight chronic inflammationRead more“Some patients I counsel to wear a binder to prevent the hernia popping out all the time,” says Giorgi.For hernias that are painful or risk causing intestinal blockages, surgery is the usual course of action.“The goal of a hernia surgery is to restore the integrity of the abdominal wall, which means to close the hole,” says Horne. This is done by stitching the hole up or patching it closed with the help of mesh prosthetics. The complexity of the procedure depends on the severity of the hernia.“Some of them can be done as an outpatient procedure, but some require an inpatient stay,” says Horne.Although you can’t prevent congenital defects or surgical incision complications that may make you more susceptible to developing a hernia, you canreducethe strain on your abdominal wall by maintaining a healthy weight, eating high-fiber foods and being careful when lifting heavy objects.Horne says she also recommends that people who do a lot of heavy lifting wear supportive and compressive clothes to “hold things in”.So don’t throw out all your tight pants yet – unless you want tolook likeyou’regen Z.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ahead of the lunch crowd making forPapa’s Fish & Chipsrestaurant, I’m taking a seat in the pier’s ballroom to hear seaside historian Kathryn Ferry talk about her latest book,Twentieth Century Seaside Architecture.Ordering a pot of tea, I’m taken back to my student days. Back in the late 1990s, the ballroom hostedPier 39, a sticky-floored nightclub where getting your heels wedged in the planks after too many vodkas was considered par for the course. Following a shift waitressing at a nearby fish restaurant, our girl gang would douse our hair in Charlie Red body spray to mask the fug of haddock before dancing the night away where the Humber estuary meets the North Sea.Cleethorpes mapThe pier first opened on August bank holiday 1873 to a flock of locals and day-trippers, many of whom were taking some of the first train and ferry-service packages across the Humber from South Yorkshire and the Midlands. It’s not hard to imagine the giddy thrill of glimpsing this elegant pavilion structure for the very first time: it stretched 365 metres into the sea.I grew up in Grimsby, where Cleethorpes had long felt like a sandy wonderland, filled with bright lights and sugar highsFerry cites the pier as one of a trove of local architectural treasures: postwar buildings with funky rooflines, illuminations, shops fronted with Victorian cast-iron verandas … “enough surviving seaside things”, she tells the crowd, “to ensure Cleethorpes retains its very distinctive feel”.I grew up in Grimsby, just a couple of miles up the road. Cleethorpes had long felt like a sandy wonderland, filled with bright lights and sugar highs. During the pandemic, after 20 years living away, I came back to Cleethorpes from London and I now feel lucky to be raising a family in the sandy footsteps of my childhood. Summer feels magical – we are tourists at home. My nine-year-old and toddler both love splashing about in the free,open-air paddling pool, riding the dinkyCleethorpes Coast Light Railwayand cycling along Buck Beck – a long, calming coastal path where ice-cream at the family-runBrew Stopcafe is a rite of passage.

Science & Society Picture Library/Getty ImagesDuring my university and London years – roughly 2000 to 2020 – the resort’s cultural identity began to shift with the closure of iconic venues such as, in 2007, the Winter Gardens. An entertainment venue dating back to the 1930s, its stage was once graced by acts including Elton John, the Clash and Roxy Music, not to mention playing host to the feted “Bags Ball” weekly dance night. Also closed, after a 23-year run as one of the area’s leading theme parks, was Pleasure Island and its beloved Boomerang ride, which ceased functioning in 2016. And some of the area’s big-draw events – including the Radio 1 Roadshow, which made its last stop here in 1999 fronted by S Club 7 – were scratched from the listings. In the words of one local: “It felt like the fun police had come to town.”Now, building on events such as theSummer Steam festivaland theGreat Grub Fest, there’s a definite sense of cultural renaissance brewing. Cleethorpes seafront is in the process of a long-awaited£18.4m regeneration projectthat will focus on a reimagining of the Pier Gardens and the reintroduction of the old market place. With a potentialdirect train link from Cleethorpes to Londonin the offing, the resort is extending its bucket-and-spade appeal to a new generation.On 2August – with the stage still warm from sets by the Charlatans and Ash as part ofDocksFest– Cleethorpes’ Meridian showground is set to transform into an open-air celebration of cool and contemporary sounds covering jazz, funk and soul, as the area’s newest festival,Everybody Loves the Sunshine, lays down 10 hours of live music for just £10 a ticket. Together with Brighton-based record label Tru Thoughts, the festival is curated bythe Culture House, a local charity that has been instrumental in plugging the cultural gap across North East Lincolnshire, an area that can often feel on the fringes of the national arts and culture scene.The sandy dunes around the Humber Mouth Yacht Club are the perfect spot for big-sky sundowners and picnicsBeyond the music, nature abounds. AtMarine Embankment beach, bird lovers can spy curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers nesting in the saltmarshes (check tide times), while the sandy dunes around theHumber Mouth Yacht Club(about an hour’s walk from the Pier) are the perfect spot for big-sky sundowners and picnics.Steel & Soulruns a blissful drop-in morning yoga class on the beach here every other Sunday until the end of September (£10 a class).A must-visit at this end of the town is the Humberston Fitties, an otherworldly village of about 300 beach chalets that sprang up beside the sand dunes after the first world war. Many of these small dwellings, including artistSarah Palmer’s home(£80 a night for a two-night minimum stay, sleeps up to four), are available to rent and make a cosy weekend base.For a stylish home-from-home in the heart of Cleethorpes, check intoClovesB&B (from £95), tucked off the main promenade. Hosts Nick and Maria Ross serve up beautiful home-cooked breakfasts, and if you land on a Friday you can build a picnic hamper from their pop-up larder, which sells freshly baked sourdough and pastries, as well as fruit, veg, cheese, butter and juices, many of which are organic and locally produced. From Saturday to Tuesday, the Edwardian breakfast room then transforms into Cafe Cloves, an intimate dining spot serving a menu of five seasonal dishes. On our last visit, we shared tandoori king prawn skewers with a chopped spinach and red onion salad, cucumber raita and charred lime along with the signature Cloves fishcake – which I could happily eat every day.View image in fullscreenCloves B&B.Photograph: Katie BuffeyAnother great spot for lunch isNasturtium, where head chef Jack Phillips riffs on classics such as catch of the day with a smoked butter sauce, Japanese kosho and a tempura enoki (fried floured mushrooms). Phillips also channels his passion for Asian cooking through his popular pop-up food stallWakame Cleethorpes. Follow up lunch with a mooch down Sea View Street forboutique threadsand heavenlyplants and flowers, ending with a slice of lemon meringue pie atMarples.As for fish and chips – you’re spoilt for choice. An old-fashioned booth atSteel’s Cornerhouse Restaurantfor haddock, chips and a pot of tea with bread and butter always feels special. Or, if the weather’s fine, nothing beats walking along the beach with a Papa’s takeaway, eating a tray of chips drenched in vinegar, with the sand between your toes.“Cleethorpes feels like a sleeper, on the cusp of being awakened,” says Kathryn Ferry. Something tells me this resort is about to have its time in the sun again.Explore more on these topicsUnited Kingdom holidaysEngland holidaysBeach holidaysShort breaksFamily holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet not all is peaceful herePaul EvansThu 24 Jul 2025 00.30 EDTShareKomorebiis a Japanese noun for sunlight passing through tree leaves. It seems to mean more than the rays of light, the play of dappled shadow; more than the ephemeral quality of a green shade; it’s an aesthetic experience of sunlight interacting with foliage.Today is the hottest day of a heatwave. The air is stifling. Sunlight is burning. Under a canopy of leaves, a small wing lands on the table where I’m writing this in a notebook. How did it get here? The flickering hoverflies drone before they alight on lilies and dahlias in pots. A small fountain dribbles against ferns in the rocks. There is a dense canopy of Japanese maple, plum, fatsia and clematis.Komorebiis a green world within a green world.Its direct translation suggests the sunlight “leaks” or “escapes” from the leaves. All these chloroplasts in leaf cells, turning light into life. For many leaves, this heat must be hotter than their optimum temperature for photosynthesis, and those in the lower layers may benefit from light escaping from above; photosynthesis removes carbon dioxide and increases transpiration (water vapour) to produce cooling.Mine and other lives are grateful for this cool sanctuary. Butkomorebiis not such a still, peaceful world, as evidenced by this fallen wing. It’s likely that a wasp ambushed a hoverfly in the leaves overhanging the table. Starting with its head, the scimitar blades of the wasp’s jaws would have dismembered the hoverfly, discarding the legs and wings with surgical precision, the wasp returning to the nest to feed the chewed-up, protein-packed hoverfly to the larvae. What they are fed may determine their sex and caste – wasp destiny shaped by the beautifully banded bodies of hoverflies.This tiny wing is all that’s left of the aerial magic trick of motionlessness; it’s like a flake of celluloid film containing the places, lives and times composed of this green light of leaves. More importantly,komorebiis an experience life shares, a mood not described by just what it looks like or what it does. This heatwave is a sign of the coming climate; forkomorebi, we need more foliage on all ecological levels.Under the Changing Skies: The Best of the Guardian’s Country Diary, 2018-2024 is published by Guardian Faber; order atguardianbookshop.comand get a 15% discountExplore more on these topicsPlantsCountry diaryInsectsRural affairsJapanTrees and forestsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gardening is much more dangerous than quilting.”It is one aside among many during a discursive interview with the Guardian that includes his fears of fascism in America, why heterosexual men are a “bunch of assholes” and the time he sat withDonald Trumpat a gay wedding.‘You think God didn’t make gay men?’ Comedian Leslie Jones on religion, grief and getting famous at 47Read moreBut first there is quilting. Fierstein began about 20 years ago, inspired by craft shows on the HGTV channel that he fondly recalls as “hot glue heaven”, and made about a quilt a year. Then came theCovid-19 pandemic lockdownand, with “nobody else to talk to”, he turned to his sewing machine in earnest and found a new community in a local quilt shop. He is now up to about 80 or 90 quilts.“I started experimenting more and more and found that people like quilts a lot better than paintings,” Fierstein, 73, observes via Zoom from his home in Ridgefield, Connecticut. “If you give somebody a painting they have to hang it on the wall if you come over for dinner. But at least the dog can sleep on the quilt.”The fruit of his labour is his first exhibition of handmade quilts, You Made That? The Quilting Adventures of Harvey Fierstein, at theKeeler Tavern Museum & History Centerin Ridgefield from Friday to Sunday.Fierstein was one of the first out gay celebrities in the US and is best known for his Tony award-winning stage work on Hairspray, La Cage Aux Folles, Newsies, Kinky Boots andTorch Song Trilogyas well as various film roles. But quilting represents a return to his roots in the visual arts: he graduated from the High School of Art and Designand received a degree in painting from the Pratt Institute.“That’s what I was supposed to be doing,” he says. “This theatre thing is like a side gig: it’s what I do when I can’t get work as an artist. As a child I went to Disney studios and saw the artists working. That’s what I thought I was going to do and this whole writing thing was sort of a mistake.”Fierstein views the upcoming public display in a tiny museum in what he dubs “a small fictional town in Connecticut”as an opportunity to “figure out whether, besides keeping the dog warm, this is something that’s worth doing. It’s also very American as we try and cling to America as we’re being killed by that soulless piece of crap. We have to hang on.”View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein quilt.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistThis is a reference to thecurrent occupantof the White House. One of Fierstein’s deceptively beautiful quilts is a condemnation of fascism, featuring two black skeletons giving Nazi salutes above a kneeling figure in striped pyjamas, against a backdrop of yellow stars and pink triangles like those that Jews and gay people were forced to wear during the Holocaust.Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn, with acquaintances who had concentration camp tattoos on their arms, he developed a deep awareness of intolerance. “Antisemitism was something that I was used to but, having lived through the 60s with the civil rights struggle and then the 70s with the gay struggle, you keep thinking we’ve moved past this.“But it’s in us. Prejudice is somewhere in us. It’s built into us for safety. All animals see another of their kind and find safety in that and it’s something we have to fight. It’s always been an undercurrent. I wanted to make an expression of that.If you look at the quilt, I did the background, the Jewish stars and the pink triangles, in very pretty colours. It doesn’t announce itself in an ugly way.”Fierstein moves up a few gears as he contemplates the toxic stew of Trump’s America: draconian crackdowns on undocumented immigrants, rising antisemitism and political violence, a primal desire to revel in ignorance andturn back the clock.“There are people that actually think that what’s going on, arresting people and pulling them out of their jobs, is something good. I am shocked when I see people on television saying, ‘Well, he promised to clean up the swamp and that’s what he’s doing.’ It’s all so frightening if you have any idea of history.“This war against the left: I believe there’s something very dark there. I believe it’s people being too lazy to want to do the work. They love Donald Trump because he has no idea about anything. He’s your Uncle Paul who comes over for dinner and you just have to listen to him and bite your tongue because he knows absolutely nothing. That’s why these people love him; he’s an idiot; he’s just like them.”Fierstein wishes Trump supporters would come to their senses. “When people tell me they’re pro-Trump, I say, do you know him? Because I do. I’ve been to a gay wedding and sat with him at a table in a gay wedding. Have you? I’ve had business meetings with the man. Have you? I know him. I’m telling you, he’s nothing but a thief and a fraud.”View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein in 1977.Photograph: John Kisch Archive/Getty ImagesThe gay wedding in question was talent managerRichie Jackson’s marriageto theatre producer Jordan Roth in Manhattan in 2012. Roth’s father, Steven, was a friend of Trump. Fierstein recalls: “Donald was there looking absolutely miserable, didn’t even bring any of the 15 wives or girlfriends or underage children with him.“When they tell me they’re pro-him, I say, if you met him, you wouldn’t be. The ones who are so weak want to be hugged by somebody strong, just get into his circle and love that. It’s that papa thing. Hitler had it. All those guys have.”Fierstein made waves in March when he denouncedTrump’s takeoverof the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, which included a declared intention to ban drag shows. Fierstein noted this would mean La Cage aux Folles and many of his other shows could not be performed there.He says: “I love the Kennedy Center - I’ve performed there – but no, I won’t go near anything of Trump.He went to see Les Mis, saying this was his favorite musical, and didn’t know the difference between the hero and the villain.How stupid do you have to be to say this is my favorite musical? At least tell the truth.”Trump installed a loyalist, Ric Grenell, an out gay man, as president of the Kennedy Center. “He proudly says, ‘I am a gay, married man.’ Who got you those rights, you piece of shit, you lowlife little creep … Who got you the right to get married, you fuckface?”Fierstein sees LGBTQ+ rights under siege once more. On his first day back in office, Trumpsigned an executive ordermandating that federal agencies recognise only two sexes – male and female – based on biological classification at birth, rejecting gender identity as a separate concept. Another order was aimed at cutting federal support for gender-affirming care for minors.Again Fierstein does not mince words: “The president of the United States announces there are only two sexes in the world! Well, you better call that God you say you believe in because there’s hermaphrodites, there’s all sorts of things in the end, not just in human beings but in all species. How stupid can you be? Sit down before you make a statement like that and look it up.“On Facebook I put up a picture of a statue from ancient Rome of a hermaphrodite. What are you talking about, you asshole? They’ve been around forever. Homosexuals have been around forever. This is a natural part of who we are.View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein in 1982.Photograph: Joe McNally/Getty Images“But no, they have this Bible: he can sell them but he’s never read one. What’s your favorite quote of the Bible? ‘Oh, I love it all. I love it all. I read it every day.’ You don’t even read your own briefings every day. They had to simplify it for you, you piece of crap.”Fierstein is dismayed by the law firms and media companies bending the knee to Trump because of selfishness and desire to make more money. He unleashes his frustrations at one group in particular.“I am not an incredibly prejudiced person but, when it comes to heterosexual men, I don’t get them. They’re a bunch of assholes. There are so few heterosexual men that I know that I look up to. You can’t count on them for anything other than their own self-interest. There are some good ones – I mean, I’m not that prejudiced – but if we took all the heterosexual men out of Congress for two years and see what happens … or the ones whopretendto be heterosexual.”And does Fierstein expect to live to see America’s first out gay president? “I’m very old,” he muses.“I’ve lived through Ronald Reagannever saying the word Aids. When Obama first raised his hand, I didn’t think – so you never know. You live in hope.”You Made That?

Plus a letter byDr John HullThu 24 Jul 2025 12.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareYour editorial rightly argues that collective belonging is rooted not only in place but also in shared purpose, and the dignified structures of mutual support that have too often been dismantled (The Guardian view on strengthening social cohesion: we can learn from the working-class past, 17 July).Our work at theUniversity of the West of Englandengages directly with these concerns through research into how light industry – historically a binding force in working-class towns – might be reintegrated into the heart of our communities in a sustainable manner. The disappearance of production from everyday urban life has not simply meant the loss of jobs; it has also eroded identity, civic pride and interdependence.Industrial activity, once visible and valued, has been pushed out of sight, out of mind, and often out of reach. The result is a built environment that is increasingly monotone, functionally segregated and lacking the social and cultural layering that once reflected the richness of everyday life.Our New Industrial Urbanism project, which we are developing with colleagues in the university’s college of arts, technology and environment, explores how new forms of small-scale, clean and socially embedded production can return to the high street, the town edge or the repurposed civic building.We are working with communities to understand how productive infrastructure – combined with walkability, sustainability and shared space – can reknit the social and economic fabric of places hollowed out by the relocation of industry to faceless business parks on the urban fringe.What is needed is not nostalgia for the past, but a reimagining of how making, crafting and producing can be civic acts. Social cohesion is not built through consumption but through participation – through people shaping their environments and economies together.I applaud your focus on the importance of belonging. We must ensure that future towns do not just house people; they must empower them to make, contribute and connect.Dr Piers TaylorProfessor of knowledge exchange in architecture, University of the West of EnglandAs one of the recently appointed commissioners to the Independent Commission on Community and Cohesion, I read your editorial with interest. In my personal opinion, many of the answers to issues that are challenging for all communities – urban and rural, communities of interest and of place – are likely to be found in building trusted relationships, encouraging regular, honest communication and collaborative working.Effective partnerships between charities, community groups, voluntary associations and decision makers and funders are invaluable in supporting civic engagement.I would draw particular attention to the unique way in which the voluntary sector is regarded as a trusted partner inWales. The existence of the Third Sector Scheme, setting out key roles and responsibilities between the sector and Welsh government, is envied across the UK and farther afield. Both the organised and informal networks of charities and voluntary organisations have the opportunity to work alongside the public sector, influencing policy and practice.Sustainable engagement with the third sector is likely to support the development of better connected and more cohesive communities. Formal structures such as those in Wales can help achieve a renewed sense of common purpose.Ruth MarksFormer CEO, Wales Council for Voluntary ActionThank you for your editorial. You hail the reopening, post-refurbishment, of the Durham Miners’ Hall as a community hub and note that “cultivation of communal memory in post-industrial regions can play an important role in evoking a sense of solidarity and belonging”. Deep is my respect for these cultural memories of the industrial north-east. I am filled with similar pride reading about the role of cotton workers in the north-west during the cotton famine (1861-65).Some 70 years before the American civil war, the first ever petition advocating an end to slavery was delivered to parliament in 1788. A second in 1792 came with 20,000 signatures from the people ofManchester.Lancashire imported its raw cotton from the US southern states. Its mills employed 440,000 workers. From 1861, Abraham Lincoln’s north blockaded the cotton-exporting ports of the south. The cotton workers went, suddenly, from being the most prosperous workers in Britain to being unemployed.Despite hardships, their support for the north, and its struggle to end US slavery in the south, remained undimmed. These hopes were expressed in a letter to Lincoln, drafted after a meeting at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester in December 1862. Within three weeks, Lincoln replied expressing gratitude for the workers’ “Christian heroism” in accepting their suffering in solidarity with the southern slaves. Lincoln’s words are displayed on his statue in Lincoln Square, Manchester.Several of my ancestors worked in the mills. I swell with pride. If only these stories were better known.Dr John HullSheffieldHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

But, as you say in your editorial (21 July), it will mean that “making water companies value the public interest more highly, relative to private profit, will be an ongoing struggle”.There is a way, however, of ensuring that the public interest wins this struggle. Change the laws on corporate governance. Legally require water and other private companies to operate in the interests of the common good, and develop a regulatory system to ensure that this happens. This would make it easier to prosecute CEOs and other senior executives, should they fail to run their companies in the interests of the British people. In legislating this way, the government could take its lead from the German constitution, article 14, clause 2 of which states: “Property entails obligations. Its use shall also serve the public good.”In so doing, the government could take note of the fact that this is a legal cornerstone of Germany’s social market version of capitalism – one that for a long time has surpassed Britain’s in terms of its higher levels of prosperity, with far lower levels of inequality.Jeffrey HendersonLeedsI could accept a privatised water industry if I had a choice of provider. As a Severn Trent customer, the only way to change my water supplier is to move house. There is no incentive for Severn Trent to offer me the best service it can, as there is no penalty for not doing so. Pious statements about regulation are easily addressed by looking at the regulatory bonfire that occurs every time we elect a Tory government.I’ve been a Labour voter for 40-plus years, and was incensed enough to think about changing my vote over the benefit changes disaster, but now have a positive reason to consider a vote for the Green party – an unambiguous commitment to nationalisation. This is the only way of getting an accountable system.Peter BowdenBirminghamHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

All five men – Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart and Cal Foote – were found not guilty on all offences. As the judge read out each decision, the men shifted in their chairs, some rubbing their temples.The charges stemmed from an encounter in a London, Ontario, hotel room in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala celebrating the team’s world junior championship victory.There were audible gasps in the courtroom at the judge’s remarks, which came more than seven years after the woman first approached police alleging she had been sexually assaulted.“A fair trial is one where decisions are made based on the evidence and the law, not on stereotypes and assumptions, and where the trial process respects the security, equality and privacy rights of the victim as well as the accused persons,” said Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham in speaking to reporters outside the courthouse following the verdict.“We will carefully review justice Carroccia’s decision, and as this case is still within the appeal period, we have no further comments to make about the decision at this time,” she added.The case cast a long shadow over Canadian hockey, placing not only the players – most of whom went on to professional careers – under scrutiny, but also Hockey Canada, which later admitted it had maintained two secret funds to pay settlements in sexual assault claims.In her remarks on Thursday, Judge Carroccia pointed out inconsistencies in the accused’s testimony, including around how much she had to drink.Dozens of protesters gathered on Thursday morning in front of the courthouse holding signs saying they believed the accuser. Some expressed concerns there would not be “justice”.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Alex Formenton, Cal Foote, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube and Carter Hart as they arrived at court in London, Ontario.Photograph: Nicole Osborne/APThe men on trial were all members of Canada’s 2018 team at the world juniors tournament for under-20s, which took home the championship that year. Players selected to play for Canada at the world juniors are typically top of the crop and in many cases have already been drafted to play in the NHL.In early 2024, police charged each man with one count of sexual assault, and McLeod with being party to an offence for allegedly aiding the assaults, after an incident on 19 June 2018 in a hotel room in Ontario. All five men pleaded not guilty.The alleged offences took place after the woman, who was 20 at the time and is identified as “EM” in the case, reportedly met McLeod at a local bar, then had what she says was consensual sex in his hotel room – only for him to invite other players to join without her consent.Text messages shown to the court indicate McLeod asked a group chat of players if anyone wanted a “three-way” and gave out his room number.EM said she was intoxicated, naked and frightened when they entered, and prosecutors alleged that EM did not consent to various sexual acts that then occurred.Over nine days of testimony in early May, the woman – now 27 – said the sudden appearance of many large men surrounding her caused her to go on “auto-pilot” andtake on a “porn star” personaas a form of self-protection. Though she said she did not explicitly say “no” or resist the alleged assaults, nor was she physically forced to participate, she said she did not consent to any of it, that she was “surprised” when the men entered and that they should have known she was intimidated.“It felt as if my mind kind of floated to the top corner of the ceiling and I just started watching everything happen,” EM told the court. “I just didn’t feel like I had any control.”Prosecutors alleged that the acts constituted sexual assault, telling the court that McLeod, Hart and Dubé obtained oral sex from the woman, McLeod had sex with her a second time, Formenton did too, Dubé slapped her naked buttocks and Foote did the splits over her head causing his genitals to “graze” her face. EM also said in her testimony that the men placed a sheet on the floor and told her to masturbate while she was slapped and spat on.The 10 defence attorneys, two allocated to each of the men, alleged in cross-examination that EM was consenting the entire night, and even taunting the men for not all wanting to have intercourse – and that if she cried it was due to feeling rejected that not everyone seemingly wanted to participate.Hart, the only one of the five men to testify in court, said he asked EM for oral sex and that was she “super excited” to be in the room and “forward” with her offers for sex. One of McLeod’s lawyers, David Humphrey,said in cross-examinationthat EM demanded sex and suggested she said to them: “Come on, you’ve got a girl here. Someone have sex with me. You guys are pussies.”EM denied saying it or asking them to have sex with her. “That doesn’t even sound like how I would usually speak,” she told the court.A central feature of the trial was two “consent videos” that McLeod recorded on his phone an hour apart after the alleged assaults occurred. In the videos, EM says everything that took place was consensual.In court, however, she said the videos did not reflect how she was actually feeling at the time. Prosecutors argued that the videos, taken after the sexual activity had ended, do not prove consent at the time of an act.That difference of interpretation ignited conversations about the meaning of consent and how it is given under Canadian law. The Criminal Code says if an accused person does not take “reasonable steps” to obtain consent given the circumstances, then simply believing a complainant consented is not a valid defence. Whether the men took “reasonable steps” has been the central question of the case.The trial was also beset by a series of scandals. Police dropped their initial investigation, which began in June 2018, after seeing surveillance footage of EM walking steadily and the two “consent videos”, which made them suspect EM was not too drunk to consent, as she told the initial police investigation.In 2022, however, EM sued Hockey Canada for $3.55m (£2.5m). The organisation settled with her and launched its own internal investigation.A furore then erupted when, after a leak to the media, Hockey Canada admitted the existence of two secret funds to pay settlements for sexual assault claims.Police then reopened an investigation and charged the five men.But two separate jurieswere dismissedby Carroccia, the Ontario superior court judge overseeing the case – the first after a juror said a defence lawyer spoke to them at lunch; the second when they told Carroccia they felt two defence lawyers were mocking them in whispers. Carroccia then decided on a judge-only trial.As she concluded her ruling, Carroccia reiterated that the court’s task was not to determine whether something happened, but whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.“This is not about morality or optics,” she said. “It is about law.”In speaking to reporters following the verdict, Karen Bellehumeur, EM’s lawyer, said the outcome is “devastating” and that Canada’s justice system needs reforms to better protect survivors of sexual violence.“Her treatment during cross examination at times was insulting, unfair, mocking and disrespectful, none of which was necessary,” Bellehumeur said. “Yet she maintained her composure and kept her emotions in check, only to be criticized for not acting enough like a victim.”She said that EM is heartened by the support she has received by members of the public. Bellehumeur also emphasized that verdicts like this one can discourage survivors of sexual assault from coming forward, but urged them to not be hindered by Thursday’s decision and still speak up.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce hockeyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It had been on a global list of 4,800 plants, animals and fungi species that have been lost to science.The rarity of the snake is a concern for scientists. Connor Blades, a project officer for the environment ministry, said: “If the threadsnake population is not very dense, I am worried about their ability to find mates, particularly if their habitat is under threat and being degraded.”Blades and Justin Springer, theCaribbeanprogramme officer at Re:wild, had been looking for the threadsnake and several other endemic reptiles for more than a year as part of a conservation project.During the survey in March, Springer said he jokingly told Blade: “I smell a threadsnake,” while turning over a rock trapped under a tree root. And there it was.“When you are so accustomed to looking for things and you don’t see them, you are shocked when you actually find it,” Springer said.View image in fullscreenSpringer and Blade were delighted to rediscover the creature.Photograph: Connor BladesBlades took the snake to the University of the West Indies where examination under a microscope revealed the pale orange lines running across its body and the scale on its nose that confirmed it was what they were looking for.Florida sheds 20 tons of invasive pythons in effort to curb its populationRead moreThe first sighting of the Barbados threadsnake was in 1889, and there have only been a handful of confirmed sightings since.The threadsnake reproduces sexually and the females lay only one egg at a time, unlike some other reptiles that can produce fertile eggs without mating.With 98% of the island’s forest having been cleared for agriculture since it was colonised more than 500 years ago, conservationists are concerned for the reptile’s extinction from habitat destruction and invasive species.“The threadsnake’s rediscovery is also a call to all of us as Barbadians that forests in Barbados are very special and need protection,” said Springer. “Not just for the threadsnake, but for other species as well. For plants, animals and our heritage.”Explore more on these topicsSnakesAnimalsWildlifeCaribbeanBarbadosAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He had bandaged injuries on an elbow and wrist from an earlier road accident.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailOfficers said there were no signs of assault or theft in the room.Police lieutenant colonel Thanom Thongpaen, inquiry officer at Thalang district station, said: “I saw him lying there with a mobile phone resting on his chest. He was still on a call with someone.“The line hadn’t been disconnected and he had died like that. There were no signs of struggle or anything suspicious.“It appeared he had been on the call for about 12 hours. The phone screen had gone dark, but we could still see the call duration and confirm he was on a call.“We don’t know who he was talking to. I tried speaking into the phone, but there was no response. The line remained active, but there was no voice on the other end. The phone was locked, so we couldn’t examine it further.”There were no drugs or alcohol at the scene other than over-the-counter painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication, Thongpaen said – “about 10 pills in blister packs”.“The day before, he had a motorcycle accident and injured his elbow and wrist. He had asked the hotel maid to buy medicine for him from a pharmacy. He likely took the medication before he passed away.”Thongpaen said police “could not determine a clear cause of death”, with “no signs of foul play in this case”.According to officers, the man had been travelling alone, with security footage showing a friend dropping him off at the hotel in the early evening.“One of the hotel staff had a phone number for his friend, who had helped him check in, so the hotel contacted that friend to inform them of his death,” Thongpaen said. “His friends, who are also Australians living in the same neighbourhood, weren’t travelling with him but happened to meet up in Phuket.”The man’s relatives had informed authorities that they did not want an autopsy and “wished to bring his body home as soon as possible”, Thongpaen said.Police said the Australian embassy in Bangkok had been informed of the death.Guardian has contacted Dfat for comment.Explore more on these topicsThailandAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The opinion was hailed as a historic moment by Pacific island representatives, climate campaigners and legal academics. Vanuatu said it planned to push for a UN resolution to support its implementation.The ICJ’s ruling means Australia and other major polluters face a new era of climate reparations | Harj NarullaRead moreAustralia had joined other significant emitters, including the US and China, in arguing in submissions to the courtthat countries’ obligations were limited to complying with the 2015 Paris climate agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.The ICJ, represented by a panel of 15 judges, disagreed. It found all countries had binding obligations to act, not just under UN climate agreements, but under international human rights law, the law of the sea and customary international law. It said countries could be found liable if they failed to address fossil fuel production, consumption, subsidies and exploration licences.Sign up: Clear Air newsletterVanuatu’s climate change minister, Ralph Regenvanu, said it would give Pacific island nations “much greater leverage” at climate talks and in dealing with partner countries such as Australia. Hetold the ABC’s Radio Nationalit would take time to fully examine the 500-page opinion, but it suggested litigation was “definitely” an option.“According to the advisory the ICJ handed down today, Australia is committing internationally wrongful acts as it is sponsoring and subsidising fossil fuel production and excessive emissions,” Regenvanu said.“Australia is one of the major contributors to fossil fuel production. It’s the third largest exporter of fossil fuels in the world. It’s a major contributor to emissions … It needs to align itself with the advisory opinion and cease this conduct that is contributing to emissions and start making reparations.”Dean Bialek, an international lawyer and former lead climate negotiator for island nations, said the opinion was “unusually robust” and would have “hugely significant” ramifications for Australia.Bialek said the court’s confirmation of the primacy of the goal of limiting heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels meant Australia should be setting an emissions reduction target for 2035 in the “mid to high 70s” – that is, at least 75% below 2005 levels – when it made that decision later this year.He said the opinion made it “inescapable” that the Albanese government needed to include a “climate trigger” as it reformed national environment laws, and was a further demonstration that it needed to “intensify its diplomatic legwork” tohost the Cop31 UN climate summit in partnership with the Pacificnext year.Retta Berryman, a senior lawyer at Environmental Justice Australia, agreed the opinion would help measure whether the federal government’s upcoming climate commitments were ambitious enough, and said it was a “clear statement of the evolving legal standards around climate change”.“We are likely to continue to see significant climate litigation in Australia against governments and companies,” she said.Every MP should read the Torres Strait climate case judgment. Here's why | Clear AirRead moreAustralian National University associate professor Siobhan McDonnell, a lawyer and climate adviser to Vanuatu, said the opinion was “historic”, stating as it did that “all states have international human rights obligations, including the rights to ensure life, health and the rights to a clean and safe environment”.The Australian Greens leader, Larissa Waters, said the ruling made it clear that “every one of Labor’s new coal or gas approvals risks Australia being legally liable for the climate consequences”.“This should be a turning point. Fossil fuel profits cannot override a climate safe future,” she said.Wesley Morgan, a research associate with the Institute for Climate Risk & Response at the University of New South Wales, said Australia had dozens of coal and gas developments up for approval and the government must “heed the message from The Hague” when considering them. “The days of impunity for the fossil fuel industry are coming to an end,” he said.A federal government spokesperson said Australia was proud to have joined the Pacific in co-sponsoring this Vanuatu-led initiative, and recognised that climate change was “one of the greatest existential threats to all humanity and that it’s having a significant effect on our region”. They noted that the Coalition was debating scrapping its commitment to reaching net zero emissions by 2050, but Labor was committed to working with the Pacific to “strengthen global climate action”.“We will continue to turn around their decade of denial and delay on climate by embedding serious climate targets in law and making the changes necessary to achieve them,” the spokesperson said. “We will now carefully consider the court’s opinion.”Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisInternational court of justiceVanuatuAustralian politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

There is concern a potential 200% tariff could be planned for pharmaceuticals.On the US president’s so-called “Liberation Day”, Trump specifically cited Australia’s restrictions on beef imports upon announcing the tariff regime.Farrell has previously said the US tariffs on Australian goods were not the “act of a friend”.The multibillion-dollar Aukus pact is also under pressure after asnap administration reviewwas announced amid US demands for Australia to increase its defence spending.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian economyTrump tariffsAustralian politicsInternational tradenewsShareReuse this content"

The alleged offender was the partner of the woman running the service, located at a private home inNew South Wales.Police, the Department of Education and the Department of Communities and Justice investigated, but the woman told Guardian Australia that, without physical evidence, no charges were able to be laid and no action was taken against the man or the service, which is still operating.Victoria to establish state register of childcare workers within weeks, Jacinta Allan saysRead moreJennifer* said her daughter Ava* was two years old and attending a family daycare centre – a service run by an individual in their home, but which still receives the federal childcare subsidy – when she started talking about interactions with a man she didn’t know. Some were innocuous, others rang alarm bells.“It was sort of like, ‘Who is [this person]?’ It was just a bit off, it was just strange,” said Jennifer, who says she had no idea there was a man living at the home where the service operated.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailJennifer called the woman running the centre to ask her about it.“I, in good faith, rang [her] the next day, thinking that there would actually be an explanation for it all.”But Jennifer said the response from the woman about the man – who was the woman’s partner – was defensive and angry, something that raised “red flags” for Jennifer, so she un-enrolled Ava.In the months that followed, Jennifer said Ava’s behaviour changed. “She regressed in toilet training, she’d just become sort of more anxious than she’d ever been and getting scared all the time, like really bizarre stuff like screaming … which she’d never been before.”By this point nearly three years old, Ava then disclosed that the man had exposed himself to her and he had touched her private parts, Jennifer said. Ava’s disclosures came after seeing something that reminded her of the family daycare. She told her parents that some of the incidents occurred when she was in the daycare’s sleep room.Jennifer reported the alleged incidents to police, who investigated, taking a statement from Ava and from her parents. Ava had to undergo a medical assessment by a specialist doctor who deals with potential child victims of sexual abuse but there was no physical evidence of assault.The man was not charged with any offences against Ava.Jennifer said that before reporting to police, she consulted with friends in the police force, who told her that a conviction or even a charge against the man was very unlikely.“Basically, this has been everyone’s advice the whole time: you won’t get a conviction unless she’s got an STD, or there’s semen, or physical evidence. You won’t get a conviction. But if there’s a record of investigation, it might help someone in 20 years’ time, basically. That’s what it was for … in 20 years’ time, when people start reporting things … there’s something on record.”Jennifer praised the police and the Department of Communities and Justice, which served as a liaison with the family and organised support, including counselling, for them, but said the process was still incredibly distressing for Ava.“She knew what was going on. She’s a pretty smart chicken. Even though she was so young, she sort of knew … she remained upset and anxious for quite some time.”An assessment of Ava’s behaviour, from a new daycare service that Jennifer eventually enrolled Ava in, seen by Guardian Australia, said Ava “shows signs of anxiety” and an “ongoing difficulty to separate from parents” as well as “distress around sleeping”.The education department also conducted an investigation into the childcare service after the reports were made to police but, in a summary of its findings, seen by Guardian Australia, it wrote: “There was insufficient evidence to substantiate a breach of the National Law and Regulations. Insufficient evidence to determine [the man] posed a risk to children. No further action was taken by the department. The case was closed.”Jennifer says the department of education investigation left her with more questions. Had they looked into whether the man was present at the service when the children were there? Had they looked into whether the woman running the service left some children alone while she was getting the other children to sleep?“Why can’t they tell us these key points?” she says. “You don’t have confidence because they don’t give you answers.“The investigation… absolutely made me even more distrustful.”In response to general questions about its procedures, the NSW Early Childhood Education and Care Regulatory Authority said that if a police investigation does not result in charges, the authority still conducts its own investigation and has the power to take strong action.It said it had issued 211 prohibition notices to people working in early childhood education and care in NSW over the last four and a half years and had prosecuted 34 providers, nominated supervisors and individuals since 2021. None of the prosecutions were for incidents involving alleged sexual abuse.Family daycare centres provide care to more than 71,000 Australian children, including around 22,000 in NSW, making up 5.1% of all early childhood education and care services.The service Ava attended is still operating. Guardian Australia has not confirmed whether the man is still living at the premises.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionJennifer said that she was shocked to learn that family daycare centres have no regulatory obligation to inform parents of who lives at the home, although every member of a household where a family daycare operates must have a working with children check.She says she had no idea that the woman running the service had a partner living in the home.“It wasn’t until Ava came home and started talking about [him], and we’re like, ‘Who is [this person]?’”Jennifer would like to see this change, to make it mandatory for all family daycare centres to inform parents of who lives at or will be present while their children are in care.She would like to see reform to the way investigations into those working with children – or in close proximity to them – happen, so action can be taken against people who have had credible allegations made against them, even if the level of proof does not reach that required for a criminal conviction.“That’s a hard one because, you know, you don’t want innocent people to be punished,” she said. “[But] the level of evidence required for a conviction in court is so high; for beyond reasonable doubt. And when you’ve got no physical evidence and you’ve got the words of the two-year-olds, it’s not going to stand up in court.”But she says the Department of Communities and Justice, when it met with the family, had a more “child-centred” focus in talking about the case.“They came to the house and sat down with us and went through everything and they were amazing and they explained how even though there’s no evidence doesn’t mean that it didn’t occur. It was just more of an open finding.As a male kinder teacher I agree more needs to be done to protect children. But the solution is not to vilify people like me | David KellyRead more“They were more believing. And so I feel like there needs to be more of a child-centred approach … rather than a criminal approach.“I feel like whatever the DCJ were doing felt more holistic without outright coming out and saying like, yes, he’s guilty.”Jennifer suggested there could be a threshold of proof, lower than the criminal threshold, that allowed regulators to take actions or impose prohibitions, when there were credible allegations.“So maybe, I don’t know, [this man] shouldn’t be in the house when she’s operating her family daycare,” she suggests.The incident happened a number of years ago and Jennifer says Ava is, for the most part, doing well. She has friends, thrives at sport and in school, but “she has her moments, she’ll melt down and sometimes we’re like: is that part of it? Sometimes you wonder what part of the trauma carries through.”Jennifer and her partner debate what to tell Ava about it when she is older. “That’s a real struggle for us, how do we handle this in the future? Do you want to know this when you’re older? Do we have a duty to tell her? It’s a quagmire.”“For my partner and I, we think about it all the time. Occasionally we say to each other, ‘God, I was thinking about that today. Like, I can’t believe … I’ve been able to hold it together.’”*Names have been changed to protect privacyIn Australia, the crisis support serviceLifelineis 13 11 14.

The rules act as effective expiry dates on the powers and require parliament to reconsider their reach on a regular basis.Labor will also add sabotage, promotion of communal violence, attacks on the defence system and serious threats to Australia’s border security to the rules for compulsory questioning.Under the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act, intelligence operatives have powers to issue a questioning warrant requiring a person as young as 14 to give information or produce items that may assist in a serious investigation.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailIntroduced after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US, the powers have hardly been used since 2020, with just four warrants served on three people, in counter-terrorism and espionage cases.The human rights commissioner,Lorraine Finlay, said Asio should have the necessary powers to protect Australians but that the current compulsory questioning powers were extraordinary in their intrusions on a number of fundamental human rights “and were never intended to be permanent”.“The two bills introduced by the government propose to not only extend, and then repeal entirely, the existing sunset provision to make these compulsory questioning powers permanent, but also in some respects to expand the scope of the existing powers,” she said.Finlay said the commission would closely consider the proposed changes and engage with an inquiry expected to be run by parliament’s joint committee on intelligence and security.View image in fullscreenHome affairs minister Tony Burke.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPShe said any limitations on human rights must be necessary and proportionate, and come with “robust safeguards”.The Greens justice spokesperson,David Shoebridge, said the laws should be considered by a transparent and open inquiry, not run by the joint committee on intelligence and security, which is dominated by Labor and the Coalition.“Making permanent these oppressive Howard-era powers is already deeply troubling, but they are going even further and expanding when and how they can be used,” he said.“History shows that once governments get these intrusive powers they never want to let them go, and that is exactly what we see here with the sunset provisions now being stripped out.“Asio wants these powers and the major parties are falling over themselves to deliver them through a stitched-up secret parliamentary inquiry regardless of what the public thinks.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They will be temporarily extended, for 18 months, to allow parliament to consider the wider bill, which would make the powers permanent.Introducing the changes to parliament this week, Burke said Asio should retain the powers “to navigate an increasingly complex, challenging and changing security environment and deliver on its mission to protect the safety of Australia and Australians”.When the laws were introduced, the Howard government attorney general Daryl Williams described them as “extraordinary” and “a measure of last resort”.Explore more on these topicsAustralian security and counter-terrorismHuman rightsTony BurkeAustralian intelligence agenciesAustralian GreensAustralian politicsLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

But there are two sides to the coin, and the options we put forward will make a really significant difference to those who are doing it really tough and who we see coming through our doors every day,” Gaetani said.“What we are putting forward is budget neutral. We are simply asking those well off in the community to forgo in the vicinity of $3,000-3,500 a year to offset the cost of assisting those 3 million Australians who live under the poverty line.”Sign up: AU Breaking News emailBen Phillips, an associate professor at ANU who co-wrote the report with Richard Webster, said increasing the jobseeker benefit for singles and couples was a “no-brainer”.“People don’t talk about the age pension as a king’s ransom, and lifting jobseeker to 90% of that just takes it back to 1990s levels,” Phillips said, noting that it was in line with the recommendation by the government’s economic inclusion advisory committee.2:26What does it mean to be poor? The Australian government isn't sure – videoThe ANU sets the poverty line at $486 a week, or half the median household disposable income of after housing costs.In comparison, the full jobseeker rate for an individual is $390 a week, or about 75% of the $525 rate for a single age pensioner. Lifting it to 90% would involve a weekly rise of about $80.More than half of people on jobseeker or youth allowance are in households experiencing poverty, and the report noted that the balance between avoiding disincentives to work and providing an adequate safety net had become skewed too far in one direction.“The pendulum needs to swing back towards adequacy,” it said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In a diplomatic cable in June, the US said it opposed any steps that would unilaterally recognise a Palestinian state.Macron had been leaning towards recognising a Palestinian state for months as part of an attempt to keep the idea of a two-state solution alive, despite the pressure not to do so.French officials initially weighed up the move in advance of a UN conference, which France and Saudi Arabia had planned to co-host in June, to lay out the parameters for a route to a Palestinian state while ensuring Israel’s security.The conference was postponed under US pressure and after the 12-day Israel-Iran air war began, during which regional airspace was closed, making it hard for representatives of some Arab states to attend.It was rescheduled and downgraded to a ministerial event on 28 and 29 July, with a second event due to take place with heads of state and government on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in September.French officials had said in recent weeks that Macron remained resolved to recognise a Palestinian state and that he would decide the timing. France had weighed up when to make an announcement to try to ensure it would have a positive impact and could create momentum in the Middle East crisis.The decision to make the announcement before next week’s conference aimed to give the French team at the UN a framework to work with other countries who are also considering recognising a Palestinian state or still have misgivings over doing so.Diplomats say Macron has faced resistance from allies such as the UK and Canada over his push for the recognition of a Palestinian state. About 40 foreign ministers will be in New York next week.Thanking France, the Palestinian Authority’s vice-president,Hussein al-Sheikh, said on X that Macron’s decision reflected “France’s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s rights to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state”.While France would be the most significant European power to recognise a Palestinian state, others have hinted they could do the same.Britain’s prime minister Keir Starmer announced he would hold a call with counterparts in Germany and France on efforts to stop the fighting on Friday, adding that a ceasefire would “put us on a path to the recognition of a Palestinian state”.Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia all announced recognition in 2024 as Israel’s military campaign in Gaza continued.Spanish prime minister Pedro Sánchez, whose country already recognises Palestinian statehood, welcomed Macron’s announcement. Saudi Arabia hailed the announcement as “historic”.The Saudi foreign ministry said: “The kingdom praises this historic decision, which reaffirms the international community’s consensus on the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of an independent state.”The head of the main UN agency serving Palestinians said on Thursday that his frontline staff were fainting from hunger, as the number of people dying of starvation inGazacontinued to rise and hopes for a ceasefire faded as negotiations collapsed.With ReutersExplore more on these topicsFranceEmmanuel MacronEuropePalestinian territoriesUnited NationsIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

But the Hungarian government spokesperson Zoltán Kovács said on Thursday they had been banned because their “members repeatedly engage in antisemitic hate speech supporting terrorism and terrorist groups”.He said: “Hungary has zero tolerance for antisemitism in any form. Their planned performance posed a national security threat and, for this reason, the group has been formally banned from Hungary for three years. If they enter, expulsion will follow under international norms.”Responding in a post on X, the group said: “To the tens of thousands of fans who we were buzzing to see in person at Sziget, we’re sorry we won’t be with you. The authoritarian government of Viktor Orban say we ‘pose a national security threat.’ Which is fucking outrageous coming from a man who welcomed Netanyahu, a wanted war criminal, like a hero just a few weeks ago.“There is no legal basis for his actions, no member ofKneecaphas ever been convicted of any crime in any country. We stand against all hate crimes and Kneecap champions love and solidarity as well as calling out injustices where we see it. It’s clear this is political distraction and a further attempt to silence those who call out genocide against the Palestinian people.”Kneecap have had several shows cancelled in recent months, including atTRNSMT festival in Glasgowand at the Eden Project in Cornwall.The group – comprising Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, Naoise Ó Cairealláin, and JJ Ó Dochartaigh – were formed in Belfast and released their first single in 2017.Ó hAnnaidh, who performs under the name Mo Chara, was recently charged with aterrorism offenceover allegations he displayed a flag in support of Hezbollah.In May, the Metropolitan police said the group were being investigated by counter-terrorism police after videos emerged allegedly showing them shouting “up Hamas, up Hezbollah” and “kill your local MP”.The group apologised to the families of murdered MPs and said they had “never supported” Hamas or Hezbollah, which are banned in the UK.They were also investigated over their set at Glastonbury festival in June, but last week Avon and Somerset police confirmed they would be takingno further action.Explore more on these topicsKneecapHungaryFestivalsEuropeFreedom of speechnewsShareReuse this content"

An estimated 250 firefighters battled to contain blazes raging on multiple fronts.The government spokesperson, Konstantinos Letymbiotis, said the state “expresses its deep sorrow … over the unjust loss of two of our fellow citizens”, adding that what was happening on the island was unprecedented.After appeals for help from the Nicosia government, Greece, Egypt, Israel and the UK, which has an RAF base on the island, said on Thursday they would be weighing in with air support and firefighters, while the EU was sending in water-bombing planes.By midday, nearly 24 hours after it broke out, the infernos had consumed more than 40 square miles of territory, decimating prime agricultural land and dozens of homes in village communities outside Limassol on the Troodos range.Limassol fire aftermath footageFootage from the aftermath of fires in Limassol.Charalambos Theopemptou, the Green MP who chairs the Cypriot parliament’s environmental committee, spoke of a “tragic situation” with blazes fuelled by extreme high temperatures, gale-force winds and a severe drought.Temperatures nudging 44C were forecast to rise further on Friday as aweek-long heatwave intensified across southern Europe. “We haven’t seen such devastating fires since the Turkish invasion in 1974,” Theopemptou told the Guardian. “It’s tragic, people have died, 72 houses and 91 cars have been burned, it’s absolute chaos.”He said part of the reason for the destruction was that preventive measures had not been taken, including the implementation of a public warning system that an EU directive voted into law in 2022. “Illegal waste dumps haven’t been cleared, [inflammable] vegetation hasn’t been removed, basic infrastructure like big cement water tanks and hose pipe points aren’t in place, all of which has helped the fires spread,” he said.At least six separate wildfires were burning acrossTurkey, the Turkish agriculture and forestry minister, İbrahim Yumakli, said on Thursday, warning that strong winds and scorching heat were creating “extremely dangerous” conditions across the country.Ten firefighters were killed on Wednesday battling a fire in the western Eskişehir province, with 14 others injured. The fire subsequently spread to Afyonkarahisar, another central province, where several towns and villages were evacuated.Eskişehir fire footageFootage of fires raging in Eskişehir.The victims were caught when the flames suddenly changed direction, causing them to be “burned alive”, a local MP said. Turkey has been sweltering since Sunday in temperatures ranging between 6C and 12C above the seasonal norms.In the northwestern province of Bilecik, fires raged for a fourth consecutive day, as firefighters struggled to contain them. “They couldn’t intervene. There is no decent road, forests are thick and it’s rocky,” Cemil Karadag, a local resident, said.Karadag told Reuters the fire had “engulfed our village from two or three sides … The firefighters couldn’t intervene … It spread very quickly with the effect of the wind, but, thank God, the centre of our village wasn’t damaged that much.”A wildfire erupted in the Black Sea province of Sakarya, forcing the closure of a key motorway and the evacuation of several villages and small towns, and others in Karabuk, home of the Unesco world heritage site city of Safranbolu, and Manisa.Scientists have long warned that burning fossil fuels is making extreme weather events such as heatwaves more likely and more intense.Explore more on these topicsCyprusTurkeyEurope weatherWildfiresExtreme weatherClimate crisisExtreme heatnewsShareReuse this content"

There were no roads to the site and a rescue team numbering more than 100 people had to use heavy machinery to cut a path there.View image in fullscreenParts of the burning wreckage of the plane were discovered about 9 miles from Tynda airport.Photograph: APThere were 42 passengers, including five children, and six crew members on board.Investigators said they had opened a criminal case into the suspected violation of air traffic and air transport rules, resulting in the death of more than two people through negligence.Vasily Orlov, the regional governor, offered his condolences to the families of those who died and declared three days of mourning, ordering flags to be lowered to half mast.Malfunction and human error were being considered as causes of the crash, the country’s transport investigative committee said.The An-24 is a twin turboprop regional aircraft designed by the Soviet Union’s Antonov Design Bureau in the late 1950s. Known for its ruggedness and ability to operate from unpaved runways, it was widely used in remote regions of Russia and central Asia. The Angara plane that crashed was built in 1976.The crash on Thursday marks Russia’s first fatal passenger aviation incident since July 2021, when a Petropavlovsk‑Kamchatsky An‑26 went down near Palana, killing all 28 people onboard.Russia has seen a rise in non-fatal mechanical failures on passenger planes since the start of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, as western sanctions have damaged its aviation industry, with dozens of foreign jets seized and access to vital spare parts cut off.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if the steel tariff in the outline proposal remains, it means the EU will pay a far higher rate than the UK.British steel is subject to a 25% tariff and there has been no indication this will rise further. Instead, the rate is due to be reduced to zerounder the deal Keir Starmer struck in May. But, while much of the agreementcame into force at the end of last month, the steel exemption remains tangled up intalks over the origin of some materials.The EU’s 15% baseline rate for exports of all products to the US is also worse than the 10% agreed by Britain.China’s president, Xi Jinping, told a summit in Beijing on Thursday that Chinese and European leaders must “make correct strategic choices” in the trade war.“The challenges facing Europe at present do not come from China,” Xi said. “There are no fundamental conflicts of interest or geopolitical contradictions between China and the EU.”The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, told the same event that the EU would find it “very difficult to maintain its current level of openness” with China if Beijing maintained a massive trade surplus, which she blamed on “trade distortions” including state subsidies.She said the EU accounted for 14.5% of China’s exports including steel, yet took only 8% of EU exports. “These numbers speak to the scale of our relationship, but they also expose a growing imbalance. It is mostly due to an increasing number of trade distortions and market access barriers,” she said.While there was no formal agreement, progress seemed to have been made by the EU and China to unblock the supply of rare earths which has been holding up the car production industry.The German car industry group, the VDA, said in a statement that “production stoppages can no longer be ruled out” because of the shortage of the minerals including the magnets needed for the electronic opening and closing of car windows, boots and bonnets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Sources say Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, remains keen to seal a deal as soon as possible to provide stability to investors and manufacturers, particularly in the auto sector.“As we lose our major export market the European market is being flooded by the steel the US is no long absorbing,” Eurofer said after the first attempt at a deal with the US was blown up by Trump 10 days ago.It is possible that Merz, who has a direct line to the US president, may reach out to him, potentially during his scheduled trip to Scotland this weekend to visit his two golf courses.The European Central Bankkept interest rates unchanged on Thursdayas policymakers waited to see whether the eurozone would be hit by US tariffs.Explore more on these topicsTrump tariffsSteel industryTariffsEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The UN and aid groups blame Israel’s blockade of almost all aid into the territory for the lack of food.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreLazzarini said in a statement that a colleague in the territory had told him: “People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses.”He said Unrwa had the equivalent of 6,000 loaded trucks of food and medical supplies waiting in Jordan and Egypt and urged Israel to allow “humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza”.Reports of people fainting and dropping dead of hunger have emerged in recent days. Civil defence workers have released photographs of gaunt bodies with little more than skin covering their bones.Medical sources in Gaza said two more people had died of hunger on Thursday, both of whom had been ill and had not eaten for days.As international pressure mounted for a breakthrough to end nearly two years of devastating war,Emmanuel Macron announced France would recognise a Palestinian state at the UN general assembly in September.“True to its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognise the State of Palestine. I will make a formal announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September,” the French president wrote on X and Instagram.Earlier, Israel and the US announced they were recalling their negotiators from Doha, where peace talks were being held. The US envoy, Steve Witkoff, accused Hamas of not acting in good faith.“We have decided to bring our team home from Doha for consultations after the latest response from Hamas, which clearly shows a lack of desire to reach a ceasefire in Gaza,” he wrote on X.He said the US would consider “alternative options” to recover the hostages and “create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza” without elaborating on what those alternatives might be.Witkoff’s announcement came after Hamas sent its response on the latest ceasefire proposal to mediators. It was an abrupt about-face to the optimism earlier in the day, when the Associated Press reported an Israeli official saying the Hamas proposal was workable.Witkoff had also been scheduled to meet the top Israeli adviser, Ron Dermer, and the Qatari prime minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in Sardinia, which was regarded as a positive sign for the ceasefire talks. It was unclear if or when those meetings would still happen.Hamas’s proposal included requests on the number of prisoners exchanged, the agencies to be allowed to distribute aid in Gaza and a permanent end to the war rather than a ceasefire, Israeli media reported.The group’s demands came as global pressure mounted on Israel to stop fighting and a growing number of countries expressed horror at the scenes of starvation in the territory.A Palestinian official close to the talks told Reuters the Hamas response was “flexible, positive and took into consideration the growing suffering in Gaza and the need to stop the starvation”. A Hamas source said the proposal included a fresh roadmap for a prisoner exchange, which it told Reuters was a top priority for the group.chartThe Israeli Hostage Families Forum, representing the families of those held in Gaza, issued a statement of concern at the news that negotiators had been recalled and urged a ceasefire to be reached quickly.“Each day that passes endangers the hostages’ chances of recovery and risks losing the ability to locate the fallen or gain vital intelligence about them,” it said.The deal that was under consideration is expected to involve a 60-day ceasefire during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the bodies of 18 others in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Talks would be held during the ceasefire period to reach a lasting truce and aid supplies to the besieged strip would be increased.It has only been since the end of the war between Iran and Israel last month that the serious prospect of a ceasefire in Gaza has emerged. As negotiations continued, Israeli attacks increased. At least 89 people were killed in the last 24 hours as Israeli airstrikes pounded central Gaza, health authorities said.BBC, AFP and other news outlets warn journalists in Gaza at risk of starvationRead moreIsrael says the global media is exaggerating the scale of the hunger crisis, even though aid groups and pictures coming from Gaza show clear evidence of starvation and doctors who treat malnourished children say they are unable to get enough to eat themselves.Israel only lets a trickle of aid into Gaza, the vast majority of which is distributed by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a private US firm. GHF operates four food distribution points staffed by US mercenaries,a system which has been described as a death trap.More than 1,000 people seeking aid have been killed trying to access supplies in the nearly two months since GHF began operating in Gaza.Aid was formerly distributed through more than 400 distribution points under a UN-led system, but Israel has all but stopped UN aid into the territory since March. Israel accuses Hamas of stealing UN aid, a claim for which humanitarians say there is little evidence.Aid groups say GHF, which was meant to replace the UN, lacks the capacity to do so and that its militarised model violates key humanitarian principles.Restoring the UN aid system as a part of a ceasefire deal is a key Hamas demand. Israeli negotiators have softened their stance on the issue as pressure grows even within Israel to stop the starvation crisis, which the World Health Organization director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,described on Wednesday as man-made.Thousands of Israeli demonstrators carrying bags of flour and pictures of Palestinian children who died of starvation protested in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, calling for an end to the Gaza blockade.Hamas is also calling for a ceasefire deal to include a permanent end to the Gaza war, something that Israel has refused.A ceasefire deal is unpopular among the more extreme members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet and Israel has sought to keep open the possibility of restarting the war after the ceasefire period.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warGazaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsBenjamin NetanyahunewsShareReuse this content"

It’s also unclear what “alternative options” are under consideration.‘Hungry aid staff fainting’ as starvation spreads in Gaza and truce hopes fadeRead moreAccording to a Haaretzreport, Israeli sources described the teams’ recall as a coordinated move designed to pressure Hamas.Hamas said it was surprised by Witkoff’s remarks, adding that the group’s position had been welcomed by mediators and had opened the door to reaching a comprehensive agreement.“The movement affirms its keenness to continue negotiations and engage in them in a manner that helps overcome obstacles and leads to a permanent ceasefire agreement,” Hamas added in a statement early on Friday.The announcement comes as Gaza endures cataclysmic humanitarian conditions. Israeli forces have killed more than 1,000 desperate and hungry people in Gaza in recent weeks trying to fetch food accordingto the UN, with at least85 Palestinians killedon Sunday alone.The World Health Organization on Wednesdaydescribed the situationas “man-made mass starvation” caused by restrictions on aid deliveries.Witkoff added that it was “a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way” while insisting the US remains “resolute” in ending the bombardment of Gaza, though American officials have consistently attributed negotiation failures to the Palestinian side.The proposed deal under discussion would have established a 60-day ceasefire during which Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 others in staged phases. In exchange, Israel would free Palestinian prisoners, increase aid deliveries to Gaza, and both sides would enter negotiations for a permanent truce.The talks had been bogged down over whereIsraeli troops would redeploy after any ceasefire – specifically whether Israel would maintain control of the Netzarim and Philadelphi corridors – a sticking point that is proving insurmountable thus far. Israel also refuses to end the war until Hamas surrenders power and disarms, though Hamas hasindicated a willingnessto discuss stepping down from power under certain conditions.The Haaretz report suggested that other sticking points include the areas from which Israel would withdraw during a pause in fighting, and the identities of the prisoners who would be released.Thursday’s development comes in contrast with recent signs from the Trump administration, which had been optimistic about securing a breakthrough and had campaigned on ending foreign wars. A temporary ceasefire deal was last reached between Israel and Hamas in January, but collapsed after Israel launchedsurprise airstrikes in Marchthat killed more than 400 people.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warTrump administrationGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesIsraelUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

It took its inspiration from an idea shared by the US president, Donald Trump, in February, when he pledged to turn Gaza into the “riviera of the Middle East”.The text of the plan, which boasts of the economic benefits to Israel, said: “The right of the people of Israel to settle, develop and preserve this land is not just a historical right – it is a national and security obligation.”The plan, seen by the Guardian, would require Gaza’s existing population of about 2 million to be emptied out. Legal experts warn that forcible displacement on such a scale would be tantamount to ethnic cleansing.Michael Sfard, one of Israel’s leading human rights lawyers, said: “This is a plan for ethnic cleansing. Under international law, this would amount to a crime against humanity because deportation is a war crime when committed on a small scale and a crime against humanity when it is committed on a massive scale.”The plan was discussed on Tuesday in the Knesset during a conference called “The riviera in Gaza: from vision to reality”. Among the speakers was the minister of finance, Bezalel Smotrich, who is one of two Israeli ministers to have hadsanctions placed on them by the UKand other countries, and the settler activist Daniella Weiss. The conference drew criticism from other politicians, including Gilad Kariv, of the Democrats party, whoaccusedSmotrich of calling for war crimes to be committed.Weiss told the Guardian over the phone: “Gazans will not remain there. They will go to other countries. Supporters of Hamas we will fight. But those who want to live a normal life, they will have to leave Gaza because of the 7 October attack.” Palestinians would be relocated to Egypt and other unspecified “African countries”, she added.Weiss said she had a list of 1,000 Israeli families who had already signed up to live on land in Gaza once Palestinian residents were pushed out. “My plan is to make [Gaza] paradise, to make it Singapore,” she said.Weiss represents a small, butincreasingly influential group of radical settlerswithin Israel who seek to illegally occupy the Gaza Strip. Their calls to create Israeli settlements have grown stronger since the7 October 2023 Hamas-led attack, which killed about 1,200 people, and the Israeli war in Gaza, which has killed more than 60,000 so far.The war has levelled much of Gaza and destroyed basic civilian infrastructure. The riviera plan would build luxury resorts on the ruins of Gaza once Israel stopped bombing it.Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has denied any plans to resettle residents of Gaza, though his defence minister, Israel Katz, has suggested transferring residents to a “humanitarian city” in southern Gaza. Legal experts havecalled the plan a blueprint for crimes against humanityand the Israeli military itself pushed back on the idea, which it said would be a security nightmare.‘We faced hunger before, but never like this’: skeletal children fill hospital wards as starvation grips GazaRead moreTrump has also floated the idea of expelling the population of Gaza, suggesting at one point that neighbouring Jordan could take in those displaced. Trump suggested the US could assume control over Gaza to “develop” the strip – which drew the ire of human rights organisations around the world.While the conference was beng held, Gaza’s starvation crisis continued to worsen. At least113 people have died of hunger in Gaza, 45 of whom died in the last four days, health authorities said. Aid organisations have blamed Israel’s virtual blockade of aid into the strip for the growing levels of extreme hunger.Human rights experts said the suggestion of displacing Gaza’s residents inside and outside the territory should not be viewed in isolation. Rather, this was part and parcel of a displacement policy.“When an occupying power creates a coercive environment by, for instance, withholding food, and that coercive environment leaves no choice to the civilian population but to move, then this can amount to the war crime of forced displacement,” said Janina Dill, the co-director of the Oxford Institute for Ethics, Law and Armed Conflict.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

They are now facing the same dire circumstances as those they are covering.“Journalists endure many deprivations and hardships in war zones. We are deeply alarmed that the threat of starvation is now one of them. We once again urge the Israeli authorities to allow journalists in and out of Gaza. It is essential that adequate food supplies reach the people there.”News agencies have been pleading for months with Israeli authorities to allow journalists freer movement to and from Gaza, but those requests have become more desperate in recent weeks after concern over the physical condition of some of those who had been trying to cover the conflict.This week,AFP asked Israelto allow the immediate evacuation of its freelance contributors and their families from the strip. It followed its warning that those contributors were struggling to work because of the threat of starvation.View image in fullscreenAftermath of an Israeli strike on a tent housing journalists in Khan Younis, southern Gaza.Photograph: Hatem Khaled/ReutersFreelance journalists working for international outlets have warned that hunger and a lack of clean water were leading to illness and exhaustion.A group of journalists working at AFP said this week that “without immediate intervention, the last reporters in Gaza will die”.The Society of Journalists at AFP said: “We have lost journalists in conflicts: some have been injured; others taken prisoner. But none of us can ever remember seeing colleagues die of hunger.”A photographer working for AFP sent a message on social mediaat the weekend stating: “I no longer have the strength to work for the media.

He says that while there was 90% backing for the strike, it was on a turnout of just over 55% of members.Streeting says themove to strikeafter the offer of a 5.4% pay rise for 2025-26, was rushed into and is “bitterly disappointing” amid efforts to improve NHS services.“There was a deal here to be done,” he writes. “Instead, the BMA leadership’s decision to not even consider postponing these strikes will place an enormous burden on their colleagues, and hit the recovery we can all see our health service is making.“Not only that, it enormously undermines the entire trade union movement. No trade union in British history has seen its members receive a such a steep pay rise only to immediately respond with strikes – even when a majority of their members didn’t even vote to strike. This action is unprecedented, and it is unreasonable.”The BMA argues that resident doctors have seen their pay fall by a much greater amount in real terms since 2008-09 than the rest of the population.“Doctors are not worth less than they were 17 years ago, when austerity policies began driving wages down. We’re simply asking for that value to be restored,” it said.Streeting says resident doctors have privately contacted him to express their dismay at the decision to strike, saying they “feel the BMA’s leaders are out of lockstep with not just patients but most resident doctors themselves”.The health secretary urges doctors to defy their union and not join in the strike, which runs until 7am next Wednesday.“I am urging resident doctors to not follow the BMA leadership, who I do not believe are representing the best interests of their members, any further down this path as strikes begin on Friday at 7am,” he writes.The public have been urged to keep coming forward for NHS care during the strike, and NHSEnglandhas urged hospital chief executives to keep routine operations and appointments and only reschedule if there is a risk to patient safety.A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)blognoted that the NHS was “taking a different approach” after learning lessons from previous strikes, and would avoid cancelling planned appointments for illnesses such as cancer because this posed “a risk to patients too”.On Wednesday, the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges urged the BMA to suspend its guidance to resident doctors that they do not have to share their intentions to strike with their employers – as is their entitlement under employment law – to enable hospitals to better plan.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That’s going to strike most of the public that use the NHS as deeply unfair.”The DHSC said the BMA’s framing was “disingenuous”.“The average annual earnings per first year resident doctor last year was £43,275,” a spokesperson said. “That is significantly more, in a resident doctor’s first year, than the average full-time worker in this country earns.“Resident doctors in their second year earned an average of £52,300 last year and, at the top end of the scale, resident doctors in specialty training earned an average almost £75,000 – this is set to increase further with this year’s pay award.”Public support for the strikes has been waning. A YouGov poll showed that about half (52%) of people in the UK do not back them, broken down into 20% who are “somewhat opposed” and 32% who are “strongly opposed”.Explore more on these topicsDoctorsWes StreetingLabourNHSHospitalsHealth policyHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

This provides Scotland with a platform to make its voice heard on the issues that matter, including war and peace, justice and democracy.“As first minister it is my responsibility to advance our interests, raise global and humanitarian issues of significant importance, including the unimaginable suffering we are witnessing inGaza, and ensure Scotland’s voice is heard at the highest levels of government across the world.”Swinney is under increasing pressure from within his party to take a strong position on the crisis in Gaza.On Wednesday the former first minister Humza Yousaf and his wife, Nadia El-Nakla, shared on social media a plea to all governments to “force Israel to open the borders and allow aid to flow in”. They said El-Nakla’s cousin Sally and her four children were “being starved by Israel”.“Millions in Gaza are being deliberately starved while Israel withholds food mere kilometres away. Words are not enough,”the couple posted.El-Nakla, who is the convener of the SNP Friends of Palestine group, latertold the Timesthat Swinney’s meeting with Trump represented “a critical opportunity to raise, directly and unequivocally, the ongoing genocide in Gaza”.She added: “Time is not on the side of the people there. As I speak, my family – like millions of others – is starving. The first minister must demand that Trump use his influence to compel Israel to end the starvation and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people.”Swinney said the global attention the visit would receive gave Scotland an opportunity to promote its tourism sector and investment potential.He also expressed confidence that those demonstrating against Trump’s visit would “do Scotland proud” and conduct themselves peacefully and lawfully. Gatherings are planned by theStop Trump Coalitionin Aberdeen and Edinburgh on Saturday, with protests also expected closer to Turnberry in Ayrshire and Menie in Aberdeenshire.

Using equivalent figures for soot, the risk rose by 13%.Soot and PM2.5 levels approached or exceeded these levels in 2023 at roadside locations in central London, Birmingham and Glasgow.UK air pollution falling but danger levels still breached too often, say scientistsRead moreThe most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer’s disease and in the UK about 982,000 people have the illness. Symptoms include memory loss, difficulty concentrating and mood changes.Dr Haneen Khreis, the senior author of the study, said it provided “further evidence to support the observation that long-term exposure to outdoor air pollution is a risk factor for the onset of dementia in previously healthy adults”.She added: “Tackling air pollution can deliver long-term health, social, climate and economic benefits. It can reduce the immense burden on patients, families, and caregivers, while easing pressure on overstretched healthcare systems.”Air pollution may cause dementia through causing inflammation in the brain and oxidative stress, which is a chemical process within the body that can cause damage to cells, proteins and DNA.The researchers acknowledged that the report was limited because the majority of studies analysed included participants who were white and living in high income countries. They said future studies on air pollution should include more participants from marginalised backgrounds.Dr Isolde Radford, senior policy manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “This rigorous review adds to mounting evidence that exposure to air pollution – from traffic fumes to wood burners – increases the risk of developing dementia.“Air pollution is one of the major modifiable risk factors for dementia – but it’s not something individuals can solve alone. That’s where government leadership is vital.“While the 10-year health plan acknowledges the health harms of air pollution, far more needs to be done to tackle this invisible threat.“Alzheimer’s Research UK is calling for a bold, cross-government approach to health prevention – one that brings together departments beyond health, including Defra, to take coordinated action on the drivers of dementia risk.”The report was published inThe Lancet Planetary Health.Explore more on these topicsAir pollutionHealthPollutionDementiaAlzheimer'snewsShareReuse this content"

He said it was “the biggest step forward for a young person’s experience online since the internet was created”.What are the new UK online safety rules and how will age checks on adult content be enforced?Read moreHe added: “I want to apologise to any kid who’s over 13 who has not had any of these protections, to parents who have strived and failed to keep their kids free from all this content because we have let them down.”Kyle said it “cannot be allowed to happen again” that urgent safety measures made necessary by technological advances should take seven years to come into force. He said a whole generation of children had been exposed to “torrid toxic material” because of the failure of politicians.Kyle is under pressure to go further in clamping down on social media use by children, and his department has been looking at curfews and time limits to help prevent addiction. Beeban Kidron,a crossbench peer and prominent internet safety campaigner, urged Kyle on Thursday to update the Online Safety Act to include measures tackling disinformation and the addictive nature of social media platforms.Kyle told Mumsnet he was looking at things that could be done “very rapidly” and called for “a national conversation about what a healthy childhood looks like online”. “We do it offline all the time. Parents set curfews and diet and exercise as part of the language and the vocabulary within families. We haven’t had that national debate about what health looks like and a healthy childhood looks like online yet,” he said.Justine Roberts, the founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, said the legislation would help stop children being exposed todamaging and inappropriate content online. But she said it must “only be the beginning” of changes to online safeguards for children, with teenagers spending 35 hours a week on smartphones at a cost to their mental health.“Big tech platforms still expose too many children to harm through addictive algorithms, and parents are deeply worried about the effects of social media on the still-developing brains of their children. The government must go further and faster to protect kids,” she said.Thelegislation means thatillegal content must be removed from platforms, such as suicide forums, and age has to be verified before content can be supplied to children to limit it to those 13 and over. X announced on Thursday that it would introduce age checking measures to prevent under-18s from accessing adult content, including pornography.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But please don’t take the phones [away from us] because also, there’s a lot of benefits to it,” he said.Asked whether he could raise the digital age of consent to 16, Kyle said that would be an easy thing to do if he concluded it was right.“The question for me is, what age should children be allowed to be online and have access to social media, rather than the digital age of consent,” he said. “I can pass the law, as I have, that says that no child under 13 should have access to social media, if you are having it from 13 up it has to be age appropriate from 13 up. So no child under 18 should have access to porn for example. No child under 13 should have violent misogyny coming into their feed. I don’t think digital age of consent would deliver the step-change that people think it would.”Explore more on these topicsInternet safetyChildrenYoung peopleInternetDigital mediaSocial mediaPeter KylenewsShareReuse this content"

Anyone who works in security will also pick up on how they were standing. If you looked you could see they held their hands together to give a discreet thumbs up sign,” said the man, reluctant like so many other local people to go on the record, but who gave his name as “Steve Davis”.The only problem with this analysis was: it appeared to be entirely wrong.Essex police has “categorically” denied it bussed in antiracism protesters. The suggestion of state-sponsored “false flag” provocateurs – a frequent trope advanced on niche corners of social media at times of tensions on the streets – was also dismissed.The denials have often come too late to stop the conspiracies taking hold. They have been eagerly spread by the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, and also carried on the front page of the Daily Telegraph.Disinformation has been one of the most alarming characteristics of the violent protests in Epping, whose focus has been the use of the Bell hotel to house asylum seekers.Local people have continued to turn out for the protests, which were sparked after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault – but far-right activists have played a key role in promoting them online. Activists from groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present.View image in fullscreenThe Bell hotel in Epping, used to house asylum seekers, has been a focus for the protests.Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianOnline misinformation and disinformation originating on niche corners of X has been amplified – seemingly without attempt to corroborate whether it is true – by politicians such as Farage and commenters from the GB News channel.Video clips of Stand Up to Racism protesters being taken out of Epping last Thursday in police vans, after they were surrounded by groups of men who threw projectiles at them and the police, were quickly repurposed on social media – and presented as if they were images of protesters being transported from Epping station.In fact, as Essex police has confirmed, the Stand Up to Racism protesters had made their way on foot from the station earlier in the day, while police escorted them on foot to enable them to exercise a right to protest.By Friday, however, rightwing commenters such as the ex-GB News presenter Dan Wootton were also misrepresenting the footage. “They actually escorted people in police vans,” Wootton told the viewers of the online show he set up after leaving GB News.On Wednesday, Farage posted the same footage on X, saying: “This video proves [police] transported leftwing protesters to the Bell hotel in Epping” and calling for the resignation of the Essex police chief constable, Ben-Julian Harrington.The force issued a statement saying this was categorically untrue, while Harrington made pointed comments in a press conference where he urged commenters to be responsible for what they said online, adding that it had “real-world consequences”.Farage modulated his language after he was contacted on Wednesday, saying the police were “escorting and bussing masked thugs to and from the protest”, but his original tweet remains on X.Later on Thursday, and in a tweet shortly after 10pm on Wednesday, Farage went on GB News to say he had received a call from a police officer who was in charge of the operation to say he was wrong. “If I was slightly out on accuracy I apologise but I think the gist of what I was saying was right,” he said.By then, however, the misinformation had spread like wildfire and done “real damage”, according to Lewis Nielsen of Stand Up to Racism.“It is a complete lie to say, as Farage has claimed, that Stand Up to Racism protesters were ‘bussed in’. We are mobilising antiracists, trade unionists, campaigners and faith groups against the far right in Epping,” he said.Yet more conspiracies – some outlandish, others more minor but corrosive – continue to circulate. They include unsubstantiated accusations that asylum seekers staying at the hotel are routinely shoplifting in Epping.Other claims – accompanied by pictures of the Stand Up to Racism protest – include one that Epping police has been paying protesters £40 “for three hours” work. It was among conspiracy theories being disseminated in online spaces including the Epping Says No! Facebook group, which has more than 1,600 members. Its administrators include activists from the far-right Homeland party, Adam Clegg and Callum Barker.The claims of undercover police officers being among the antiracism protesters have been accompanied by clips and pictures zeroing in on pictures of some of those protesters.The claims were also denied by Essex police, which has been trying to combat what it calls “myths” in videos fronted by an assistant chief constable. The force specifically picked out the claim that there were “police decoys in the crowd encouraging violence”, rebutting it on its YouTube channel.Nielsen also denied the claim: “It is categorically false that the police are involved in Stand Up to Racism protests, or play any role in organising them. If anything our protests – like others – have faced police repression in recent years.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Carr was hand-picked by Donald Trump to lead the FCC.Paramount Global, which owns CBS, came under fire last week after the company decided to cancel The Late Show withStephen Colbert,just a few days afterits host criticized Paramount’ for settling with Trump. Colbert called the settlement “a big, fat bribe”.In response to news of the merger on Thursday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, whohas called for an investigation into Paramount’s relationship with Trumpover the Skydance merger, wrote in a social media post: “Sure looks like they paidDonald Trump$36 MILLION for this merger. Bribery is illegal no matter who is president.”Skydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of a close Trump ally, tech billionaire and second richest man in the world Larry Ellison.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said Carr in a statement announcing the FCC’s approval. “It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.”The merger came after Skydance and its investment partner, RedBird Capital, assured the FCC of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints.But that committment to diversity appears to privilege conservative viewpoints. According to Carr, Skydance “has made written commitments” promising its news network will address conservative grievances and stop all efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.Skydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.The sole Democrat on the three-person FCC committee, commissioner Anna Gomez, called the merger a “deal” that was “linked” to Paramount’s $16m settlement with the Trump administration. She also decried the decision as a move that would “erode press freedom” by “imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment”.In his statement announcing the merger, Carr added: “Approving this transaction will unleash the investment of $1.5 billion into Paramount, bolstering all aspects of its operations, including broadcast.”That is precisely the same amount Paramount agreed to pay the creators of South Park earlier this week for global streaming rights over the next five years.The first episode of the satirical animated series,broadcast on Wednesdayand now streaming on the Paramount+ app, mocked Trump as a whiny, would-be autocrat with small genitaliain bed with Satan. It also featured thinly veiled criticism of the company for settling with Trump and canceling Colbert’s show.The new South Park episode ended by ridiculing reports that its new owners had agreed to give Trump $20m in public service announcements and advertising for free. The episode concluded witha mock public service announcement, ostensibly in favor of Trump, that pictured him naked with a miniature, talking penis. “Trump, his penis is teeny-tiny”, a narrator intones, “but his love for us is large”.Robert Mackey contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsUS newsMergers and acquisitionsParamount+Paramount PicturesnewsShareReuse this content"

The order aims to “restore public order”, saying “endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe”, according to the order.The action comes as the homelessness crisis in the US has significantly worsened in recent years driven by a widespread shortage of affordable housing. Last year, a single-day count, which is a rough estimate, recorded more than 770,000 people experiencing homelessness across the country, the highest figure ever documented.Cities and states have adopted an increasingly punitive approach to homelessness, seeking to push people out of parks and city streets, even when there is no shelter available. The supreme court ruled last year that cities can impose fines and even jail time for unhoused people for sleeping outside after local governments argued some protections for unhoused people prevented them from taking action to reduce homelessness.Trump’s action seeks to move unhoused people to “long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment”, according to the order.Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, toldUSA Today,which first reported on the executive order, that the president was “delivering on his commitment to Make America Safe Again” and end homelessness.“By removing vagrant criminals from our streets and redirecting resources toward substance abuse programs, theTrump administrationwill ensure that Americans feel safe in their own communities and that individuals suffering from addiction or mental health struggles are able to get the help they need,” she said.The NationalHomelessnessLaw Center condemned the order, which it said “deprives people of their basic rights” and would ultimately worsen the problem.“Today’s executive orders, combined with Maga’s budget cuts for housing and healthcare, will increase the number of people forced to live in tents, in their cars, and on the streets. This order does nothing to lower the cost of housing or help people make ends meet,” said Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center.The president’s order comes after last year’s US supreme court ruling, which was one of the mostconsequential legal decisionson homelessness in decades in the US.That ruling held that it is not “cruel and unusual punishment” to criminalize camping when there is no shelter available. The case originated in Grants Pass, Oregon, a city that was defending its efforts to prosecute people for sleeping in public.San Francisco to ban RV living as mayor pledges street ‘cleanup’Read moreUnhoused people in the US have long faced crackdowns and sweeps, with policies and police practices that result in law enforcement harassment, tickets or jail time. But the ruling supercharged those kinds of aggressive responses, emboldening cities and states to punish encampment residents who have no other options for shelter.In areportlast month, the American Civil Liberties Union found that cities across the US have introduced more than 320 bills criminalizing unhoused people, the majority of which have passed. The crackdowns have taken place in Democratic- and Republican-run states alike.Advocates for unhoused people’s rights have long argued that criminalization only exacerbates the housing crisis, shuffling people in and out of jail or from one neighborhood to the next, as they lose their belongings and connections to providers, fall further into debt and wind up in increasingly unsafe conditions.During his campaign last year, Trump used dark rhetoric to talk about the humanitarian crisis, threatening to force people into “tent cities”, raising fears that some of the poorest, most vulnerable Americans could end up in remote locations in settings thatresemble concentration camps.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationHomelessnessUS domestic policyUS politicsHousingPovertySocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Urging the Fed chair to stand closer to him, Trump alleged that the bill for the renovations would now cost $3.1bn.“It looks like it’s about $3.1bn – it went up a little bit or a lot,” said Trump. The usually unflappable Powell looked visibly irritated, closed his eyes and shook his head. “I am not aware of that,” said Powell.Handed a piece of paper by Trump, Powell scanned it and said the new figure included the cost of renovations for the Martin Building, a different Fed office that was renovated five years ago. “It’s not new,” said Powell.Asked by a reporter what he would do if a project manager went over budget, Trump said: “I’d fire him.“Look, I would love to see it completed,” Trump said. “I don’t want to put that in this category.”The president backed away from earlier statements in which he had suggested he would fire Powell, a suggestion that has rattled stock markets. Trump said: “To do that is a big move, and I just don’t think it’s necessary, and I believe he’s going to do the right thing.”The visit to the Fed comes less than a week before the central bank’s 19 policymakers gather for a two-day rate-setting meeting, where they are widely expected to leave the central bank’s benchmark interest rate in the 4.25%-4.50% range.Trump has demanded that the Fed lower rates by three percentage points. Trump has repeatedly demanded that Powell slash US interest rates and has frequently raised the possibility of firing him.Ahead of Trump’s visit, Fed staff escorted a small group of reporters around the construction sites. They wove around cement mixers and construction machines, and spoke over the sound of drills, banging and saws.Fed staff pointed out security features, including blast-resistant windows, that they said were a significant driver of costs, in addition to tariffs and escalations in material and labor costs.Reuters contributed to this storyExplore more on these topicsFederal ReserveDonald TrumpUS politicsWashington DCJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

But for the hedge fund guys, they’re going to be paying up.”In the wake of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, corporations sawtheir tax rates fallfrom an average of 22% to 12.8% after the law went into effect.Under his first presidential term, average CEO pay rose from $13.1m in December 2016 to $15.5m in December 2020.

Murdoch walks tightrope in battle with TrumpCallum Jonesin New YorkLongstanding relationship between media mogul and US president is being tested amid Trump’s lawsuit over a WSJ story about his ties to EpsteinThu 24 Jul 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 07.01 EDTShareRupert Murdoch had made up his mind. “We want to make Trump a nonperson,” he assured one of his former executives in a 2021 email, two days after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.Over seven decades, Murdoch has sought to charm, challenge and change prime ministers and presidents as he built one of the world’s most powerful media empires. In this particular endeavor, however, he failed.Donald Trump, far from being made a nonperson, became the first defeated US president in 132 years to win back the White House. And from the Club World Cup final to the Oval Office, Murdoch has been seen by his side.Trump news at a glance: Trump sues Murdoch and WSJ for libel and slander over Epstein claimsRead moreAs the Wall Street Journal prepared to report that Trump provided a bawdy birthday letter to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein last week, the president appealed to Murdoch – chair emeritus of News Corporation, the newspaper’s owner – to kill the story, claiming it was false. The story ran.But the story did not receive the same treatment across Murdoch’s empire. TheFox Newsanchor Laura Ingraham went on air 15 minutes after the Journal published its story, and talked about Epstein. “We have new news coming on about this, as well, from the Wall Street Journal. A new report tonight – next,” she said, throwing to a commercial break. When The Ingraham Angle returned, the new news did not feature.Preston Padden, who worked at Fox in the 1990s, is the veteran media industry operator whom Murdoch told of his plan to make Trump a “nonperson” in 2021. He was not surprised to see how his former boss, and his array of outlets, handled this story.“You’ve got the Wall Street Journal, and you’ve got the cable news channel. And they represent two different sides of Rupert’s brain,” Padden said in an interview. “He is, in his heart, a serious newsman, and that’s the Wall Street Journal. He’s also a brilliant businessman, and that’s Fox News.”Murdoch’s businesses are divided between two companies: Fox Corporation, which houses Fox News and the Tubi streaming platform, and News Corp, home to newspapers including the Australian, the Sun, the Journal; the digital real estate network REA; and HarperCollins, the publishing giant.“There is a more of a focus on the business than the journalism at Fox, than seems to be the case at News Corp,” said Brian Wieser, an analyst and former banker. “It always appeared to me that business was first” for Murdoch, he added. “Influence was a means to an end.”News Corp’s Dow Jones division – where the Wall Street Journal sits – generated revenue of $575m in the first three months of the year. Fox Corp’s cable network programming arm, meanwhile – led by Fox News, and also including Fox Sports – generated $1.64bn over the same period.“Fox News is the primordial asset of the collection of assets,” said media analyst Claire Enders, who said the network “has drawn no attention to the matter, exactly as the president has wished”.Covering the Journal’s reporting on Trump and Epstein “would not be good for business” at Fox News, suggested Padden, who observed how the network previously endured a backlash from the president’s supporters when it strayed significantly from his narrative. “And so you can watch this debate,” he claimed. “Should we report the truth, and lose viewers, or should we report what our viewers want?”In 2023, Foxreached a $787.5m settlementwith Dominion Voting Systems over the voting equipment firm’s defamation lawsuit against the network over the false narrative that the 2020 election had been stolen from Trump.View image in fullscreenMedia mogul Rupert Murdoch looks on as Donald Trump speaks to members of the media as he signs proclamations, initiatives and appointments inside the Oval Office on 3 February 2025.Photograph: Craig Hudson/The Washington Post/Getty ImagesTrump, who has in recent days promoted Fox News segments on his Truth Social platform, seems perfectly happy with its output. But he promptly sued Murdoch, News Corp and the Journal reporters behind the story on his ties with Epstein, publicly goading Murdoch about the threat of testifying.Murdoch and Trump have engaged in a transactional relationship spanning decades, noted Enders. “There is also a very longstanding friendship between Trump and Mr Murdoch. And a symbiotic relationship with the cashflow machine,” she said. “They have fallen out before and made up quickly.”In December, Disney’s ABC agreed to pay $15m to a foundation and museum as part of a settlement in a defamation lawsuit filed by Trump. Earlier this month, Paramount reached a $16m settlement with the president over another lawsuit he filed over an interview with Kamala Harris, the Democrat candidate for president, by CBS News.Trump’s latest lawsuit raises the prospect of another prominent media organization – this time News Corp – potentially settling to avoid a lengthy legal battle. A Dow Jones spokesperson said: “We have full confidence in the rigor and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit.”“We do not anticipate any lasting repercussions from this unless the WSJ has in fact been hoaxed,” said Enders. “Otherwise, it will be shuffled away with a smaller settlement. That is how previous ginormous Trump lèse-majesté cases have been dealt with.”Fox News has covered the lawsuit sparingly in recent days, reporting on Trump’s initial filing on Friday, referencing the story briefly on Saturday, and then analyzing it in a segment on Sunday. The network declined to comment.Murdoch, 94, retired from management in 2023, when he handed over the reins at Fox Corp and News Corp to his son, Lachlan. At the time, however, he stressed he would remain “involved every day” in the businesses.“As long as he’s around, it’s his candy store,” said Padden.Explore more on these topicsMediaRupert MurdochDonald TrumpFox NewsTelevision industryanalysisShareReuse this content"

It is not the only carmaker struggling to tempt European customers, with total new car sales across the EU down by 7% in June.However, Tesla faces specific challenges. Musk, whose shares in the company have made him the world’s richest man, has contributed to the decline by backing Europe’s far-right political parties, and briefly allying himself with Donald Trump, who is deeply unpopular across the continent.The Tesla chief executive’salliance with Trump has since blown up spectacularly, while the company has come under pressure in the US from the president’s anti-EV policies.Sales across Europe – including the EU, UK, Norway and Switzerland – were down for the US carmaker by more than a fifth year on year in June, to 35,000.View image in fullscreenElon Musk at the White House in March. The volatility at Tesla has been partly attributed to his role in the Trump administration.Photograph: Carlos Barría/ReutersTesla shares fell by 8% at the start of trading on Wall Street on Thursday, after Musk said on Wednesday night that the electric car pioneer “probably could have a few rough quarters” ahead.Musk linked falling earnings to Trump slashing the incentives available for electric carmakers.The president’s tax and spending plans include a clampdown on sales of emissions credits by electric vehicle makers to more heavily polluting rivals, which had providedbillions of dollars of revenue for Tesla over several years.Trump’s attitude to Musk has been inconsistent. In a post on Thursday on his Truth Social platform, which is a competitor to Musk’s X, he denied that he was harming Tesla.“Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large scale subsidies he receives from the US Government. This is not so!” he wrote. “I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Operating income also fell to $900m, a 42% decrease since last year.TheUK has been a rare bright spot for Tesla in Europe, with sales down only 1.3% year on year in the first half of 2025, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the British industry’s lobby group. Yet the picture in the EU has been bleak: the ACEA data showed Tesla sales were down by 40% year on year in June in the EU, and 44% down in the first half of 2025.Across all European markets, Tesla’s share of sales has dropped from 2.4% in 2024 to 1.6% in 2025 – although it may regain some ground as sales of the refreshed Model Y pick up across the continent.Yet rather than improving the products bought by consumers, Musk is pinning much of his hopes on future earnings from driverless taxis run by artificial intelligence. The company haslaunched a pilot taxi programme in Austin, Texas, and Musk has repeatedly touted it as the company’s main opportunity.Matt Britzman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, an investment platform, said Tesla’s second-quarter numbers were “objectively poor”.“The typical playbook for the past few quarters has been declining fundamentals but enough AI hype to keep investors sleeping at night,” he said. “Tesla is in a very small cohort of companies with enough growth potential that investors are, for now at least, willing to look past weakening core financials.”Explore more on these topicsTeslaElon MuskEuropeElectric, hybrid and low-emission carsGreenhouse gas emissionsAutomotive industryMotoringnewsShareReuse this content"

Starting with the 2025–26 academic year, schools with more than $125m in athletic revenue are urged to increase their investment in non-revenue sports, while schools with $50m or more are required to maintain existing levels.The president’s order points to growing disparities fueled by state-level legislation, including the more than 30 states that have passed NIL laws, and warns that the resulting imbalance has created an “oligarchy” of wealthier programs that can simply outbid rivals for the best players. It also cites rising concerns that runaway NIL spending is draining resources from Olympic and educational sports that form the foundation of America’s athletic system.“Absent guardrails to stop the madness,” the order reads, “many college sports will soon cease to exist.”In addition to targeting NIL abuses, the executive order:Calls on the Department of Education, the FTC, and the Department of Justice to develop enforcement and regulatory plans within 30 daysDirects the Department of Labor and National Labor Relations Board to clarify the employment status of student-athletes in ways that prioritize educational benefitsInstructs federal agencies to use Title IX enforcement, funding decisions, and litigation strategy to protect the long-term viability of college athleticsEncourages collaboration with Congress and state governments to advance a national frameworkThe order highlights the outsized role that college athletics play in US Olympic success, noting that 75% of athletes on the 2024 Olympic team were current or former collegiate athletes, and argues that preserving a broad base of non-revenue sports is essential to maintaining America’s international dominance.While the order outlines sweeping federal priorities, it remains unclear how many of its provisions will be implemented in practice, particularly in the absence of new legislation. Still, the White House insists the move is necessary to restore fairness and stability to a system that it describes as “drifting toward professionalization”.“College sports are not, and should not be, professional sports,” the order declares. “A national solution is urgently needed before it’s too late.”Explore more on these topicsCollege sportsUS sportsCollege basketballCollege footballDonald TrumpShareReuse this content"

I’m just not at the level of those guys when they attack. It showed at the end when they went pretty hard up there.”While Onley continued to confound expectations, ghosts were laid by Pogacar, whoselast visit to La Loze in 2023when he uttered the infamous words “I’m gone, I’m dead” ended in a catastrophic defeat by Vingegaard. This time, it was the Slovenian that left the Dane behind, the Emirates XRG rider attacking in the final 500m to distance both Vingegaard and the inexhaustible Onley on the climb’s steepest grades.Quick GuideFinal mountain stage shortened after cattle disease outbreakShowFriday's Stage 19 of the Tour de France has been shortened after an outbreak of contagious nodular dermatitis in cattle near the Col des Saisies forced authorities to cull livestock and restrict access to the area, race organisers said on Thursday.The 129.9km stage from Albertville to La Plagne was due to include the ascent of the Col des Saisies, but the climb has now been scrapped to avoid the affected zone, ASO said in a statement.\"In light of the distress experienced by the affected farmers and in order to preserve the smooth running of the race, it has been decided, in agreement with the relevant authorities, to modify the route,\" ASO said.The ceremonial start will take place as planned in Albertville, followed by a 7km neutralised section before the official start an hour later than planned. Riders will rejoin the original course shortly before Beaufort, at the 52.4km mark of the initial route.As a result, the stage will now be reduced to 95km. The shortened stage still finishes in La Plagne and comes just two days before the Tour concludes in Paris on Sunday.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Vingegaard may still cling to the dream of an unlikely victory, but Pogacar now seems keen for it to end. “It’s not over yet and I will try my best tomorrow, the day after and the day after, to keep my lead,” he said, before adding: “I cannot wait that it’s all over.“This is the point where I ask myself: ‘Why am I still here?’ It’s so long these three weeks. You just count the kilometres to Paris, but I try to enjoy every day on the bike as much as I can. The fans really help. It’s still nice to ride, even in the third week, when you’re all tired and annoyed by everybody around you, and you just want to go home.”Quick GuideLizzie Deignan retiresShowLizzie Deignan has announced her immediate retirement from professional cycling after sharing news that she and husband, Phil, are expecting their third child. The 36-year-old former world champion had previously said 2025 would be her final season but has now called time on a career in which she recorded 43 professional wins, among them victories at Paris-Roubaix, Liège-Bastogne-Liège, Strade Bianche, the Tour of Flanders and the Women’s Tour. Deignan took the world title in 2015, a Commonwealth Games gold medal in 2014 and Olympic silver at the London Games in 2012.Deignan took a career break in 2018 for the birth of her daughter, Orla, returning to win a second Women's Tour title in 2019 before her victories at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and La Course by Le Tour de France followed in 2020, and a brilliant solo win in the first Paris-Roubaix Femmes came in 2021. A second career break came in 2022 for the birth of her son, Shea.Deignan's last race was the Copenhagen Sprint last month, which came a couple of weeks after she competed in the Tour of Britain Women for the last time. Speaking before that race, Deignan said she was proud to have been part of an era of unprecedented growth in women's cycling. She said part of what had kept her racing on was the growth of new races that she wanted to be part of, having not had those opportunities earlier in her career.\"I think if I had retired any earlier than now I would have had regrets, definitely, sitting at home watching all these opportunities unfold,\" Deignan said. \"I can be really proud and pleased with the last five, six years of my career where I've got to feel truly like a professional, to be respected and to have opportunities equal to the men.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.O’Connor does not win often but when he does, it is on the biggest of stages. As the Australian, riding for Jayco–AlUla, ground his way towards the mist-shrouded finish line, the 29-year-old, winner of a similarly cold and damp Alpinestage to Tignes in 2021, let out an exultant cry.It was, as Vingegaard admitted later, a “brutal” stage. “Five hours in the saddle,” he said. “I’m not sure I’ve ever done such a hard stage in the Tour before.”View image in fullscreenBen O’Connor broke away to win Thursday’s stage.Photograph: Benoît Tessier/ReutersEven before the stage began, Pogacar and Visma-Lease a bike had been at odds after the defending champion collided with one of his rival’s team cars as he rode to the start in Vif. “We were going to the start line, cruising behind the car,” Pogacar said. “Maybe he wanted to check my brakes. I was not ready because I didn’t see any reason that he wanted to stop urgently, so I crashed into the car. But it’s OK.”Clearly the Slovenian suffered no ill effects. Whatever they throw him, he is just too strong for his rivals. With one more summit finish to come, on Friday at La Plagne, it would take an unprecedented collapse for him now to lose the race.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tour de FranceTadej PogacarCyclingAustralia sportJonas VingegaardnewsShareReuse this content"

All five men – Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, Carter Hart and Cal Foote – were found not guilty on all offences. As the judge read out each decision, the men shifted in their chairs, some rubbing their temples.The charges stemmed from an encounter in a London, Ontario, hotel room in June 2018, following a Hockey Canada gala celebrating the team’s world junior championship victory.There were audible gasps in the courtroom at the judge’s remarks, which came more than seven years after the woman first approached police alleging she had been sexually assaulted.“A fair trial is one where decisions are made based on the evidence and the law, not on stereotypes and assumptions, and where the trial process respects the security, equality and privacy rights of the victim as well as the accused persons,” said Crown attorney Meaghan Cunningham in speaking to reporters outside the courthouse following the verdict.“We will carefully review justice Carroccia’s decision, and as this case is still within the appeal period, we have no further comments to make about the decision at this time,” she added.The case cast a long shadow over Canadian hockey, placing not only the players – most of whom went on to professional careers – under scrutiny, but also Hockey Canada, which later admitted it had maintained two secret funds to pay settlements in sexual assault claims.In her remarks on Thursday, Judge Carroccia pointed out inconsistencies in the accused’s testimony, including around how much she had to drink.Dozens of protesters gathered on Thursday morning in front of the courthouse holding signs saying they believed the accuser. Some expressed concerns there would not be “justice”.View image in fullscreenLeft to right: Alex Formenton, Cal Foote, Michael McLeod, Dillon Dube and Carter Hart as they arrived at court in London, Ontario.Photograph: Nicole Osborne/APThe men on trial were all members of Canada’s 2018 team at the world juniors tournament for under-20s, which took home the championship that year. Players selected to play for Canada at the world juniors are typically top of the crop and in many cases have already been drafted to play in the NHL.In early 2024, police charged each man with one count of sexual assault, and McLeod with being party to an offence for allegedly aiding the assaults, after an incident on 19 June 2018 in a hotel room in Ontario. All five men pleaded not guilty.The alleged offences took place after the woman, who was 20 at the time and is identified as “EM” in the case, reportedly met McLeod at a local bar, then had what she says was consensual sex in his hotel room – only for him to invite other players to join without her consent.Text messages shown to the court indicate McLeod asked a group chat of players if anyone wanted a “three-way” and gave out his room number.EM said she was intoxicated, naked and frightened when they entered, and prosecutors alleged that EM did not consent to various sexual acts that then occurred.Over nine days of testimony in early May, the woman – now 27 – said the sudden appearance of many large men surrounding her caused her to go on “auto-pilot” andtake on a “porn star” personaas a form of self-protection. Though she said she did not explicitly say “no” or resist the alleged assaults, nor was she physically forced to participate, she said she did not consent to any of it, that she was “surprised” when the men entered and that they should have known she was intimidated.“It felt as if my mind kind of floated to the top corner of the ceiling and I just started watching everything happen,” EM told the court. “I just didn’t feel like I had any control.”Prosecutors alleged that the acts constituted sexual assault, telling the court that McLeod, Hart and Dubé obtained oral sex from the woman, McLeod had sex with her a second time, Formenton did too, Dubé slapped her naked buttocks and Foote did the splits over her head causing his genitals to “graze” her face. EM also said in her testimony that the men placed a sheet on the floor and told her to masturbate while she was slapped and spat on.The 10 defence attorneys, two allocated to each of the men, alleged in cross-examination that EM was consenting the entire night, and even taunting the men for not all wanting to have intercourse – and that if she cried it was due to feeling rejected that not everyone seemingly wanted to participate.Hart, the only one of the five men to testify in court, said he asked EM for oral sex and that was she “super excited” to be in the room and “forward” with her offers for sex. One of McLeod’s lawyers, David Humphrey,said in cross-examinationthat EM demanded sex and suggested she said to them: “Come on, you’ve got a girl here. Someone have sex with me. You guys are pussies.”EM denied saying it or asking them to have sex with her. “That doesn’t even sound like how I would usually speak,” she told the court.A central feature of the trial was two “consent videos” that McLeod recorded on his phone an hour apart after the alleged assaults occurred. In the videos, EM says everything that took place was consensual.In court, however, she said the videos did not reflect how she was actually feeling at the time. Prosecutors argued that the videos, taken after the sexual activity had ended, do not prove consent at the time of an act.That difference of interpretation ignited conversations about the meaning of consent and how it is given under Canadian law. The Criminal Code says if an accused person does not take “reasonable steps” to obtain consent given the circumstances, then simply believing a complainant consented is not a valid defence. Whether the men took “reasonable steps” has been the central question of the case.The trial was also beset by a series of scandals. Police dropped their initial investigation, which began in June 2018, after seeing surveillance footage of EM walking steadily and the two “consent videos”, which made them suspect EM was not too drunk to consent, as she told the initial police investigation.In 2022, however, EM sued Hockey Canada for $3.55m (£2.5m). The organisation settled with her and launched its own internal investigation.A furore then erupted when, after a leak to the media, Hockey Canada admitted the existence of two secret funds to pay settlements for sexual assault claims.Police then reopened an investigation and charged the five men.But two separate jurieswere dismissedby Carroccia, the Ontario superior court judge overseeing the case – the first after a juror said a defence lawyer spoke to them at lunch; the second when they told Carroccia they felt two defence lawyers were mocking them in whispers. Carroccia then decided on a judge-only trial.As she concluded her ruling, Carroccia reiterated that the court’s task was not to determine whether something happened, but whether the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.“This is not about morality or optics,” she said. “It is about law.”In speaking to reporters following the verdict, Karen Bellehumeur, EM’s lawyer, said the outcome is “devastating” and that Canada’s justice system needs reforms to better protect survivors of sexual violence.“Her treatment during cross examination at times was insulting, unfair, mocking and disrespectful, none of which was necessary,” Bellehumeur said. “Yet she maintained her composure and kept her emotions in check, only to be criticized for not acting enough like a victim.”She said that EM is heartened by the support she has received by members of the public. Bellehumeur also emphasized that verdicts like this one can discourage survivors of sexual assault from coming forward, but urged them to not be hindered by Thursday’s decision and still speak up.Explore more on these topicsCanadaIce hockeyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The winner of the state tournament advances to the regionals, where it has a chance to move on to the Little League World Series.What makes the ejection and suspension noteworthy is that Little LeagueBaseballposts videos of bat-flip celebrations on social media that do not result in punishment.In fact, Marco has tossed his bat in celebration in prior tournament games without warnings or punishment, according to the court complaint.Explore more on these topicsBaseballNew JerseyShareReuse this content"

We know this because she posted about it to her 1 million Instagram followers, because everyone saw her personalised shin pad adorned with her wedding photo, and because she joked last week that she still hadn’t got her husband, Scott, a card.But then Kelly has always had a rare gift for catching the eye.Her shirt-waving celebrationat Wembley remains the defining image of the Euro 2022 triumph. Her trademark headband renders her instantly recognisable in a squad full of above-average-height blond women. Her hop-skip penalty run-up is unique. In a profession where many are naturally wary of being seen to court attention, Kelly is luxuriantly comfortable with being the focus of your gaze. As her teammate Esme Morgan puts it: “She just doesn’t really care what people think.”England and Spain meet again but a lot has changed since 2023 World Cup finalRead moreBeing England’s unashamed icon and an effortless content generator comes with clear off-pitch benefits. Be real: who here can name the wedding date of any other Lioness? Who here can imitate a typical Lauren Hemp penalty run-up? How many Jess Park goal celebrations have you seen commemorated in a tattoo? But of course the benefits can be felt on the field too, and so far this month England have been merrily reaping them.There is a counterfactual history of England’s Euro 2025 to be written in which Kelly does not post herastonishing social media tiradeagainst Manchester City at the end of January. In which she does not get themove to Arsenalthat rescues her career, does not win back her England place, does not rescue thequarter-final against Swedenor score thewinning goal against Italy. And – quite frankly – it is a history in which England’s players are watching Sunday’s final from their sofas.Frozen out by Gareth Taylor at Manchester City, out of contract in the summer, handed one league start all season, Kelly was ready to walk away from the game. City were prepared to let her go on loan to Brighton. Kelly wanted to join Manchester United. City were unwilling to lose her to a rival. Result: deadlock. And with just hours remaining of the January transfer window, a deadlock Kelly realised she was going to have to break herself.“While I can’t control someone’s negative behaviour towards me, I can control how long I am prepared to tolerate it,” Kelly wrote in an Instagram post very clearly self-penned. “To be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental wellbeing. Our dreams can be crushed while we live in silence.”Kelly’s outspokenness was immediately rewarded with a last-gasp move to Arsenal. And yet to burn her bridges with City so publicly was a decision fraught with risk, but also a measure of her need to dictate terms rather than have them dictated to her, to act rather than let things drift, to determine her own fate. After the Italy game, someone asked Kelly who had made her the person she is today. “Myself,” she answered.View image in fullscreenChloe Kelly scored England’s winner against Germany in the Euro 2022 final at Wembley.Photograph: Joe Giddens/PABut of course this will surprise nobody familiar with Kelly’s game. Aged 20, she stunned Arsenal by leaving permanently for Everton, walking out on her first club and her home town in search of first-team football. In her first full season at Everton she played through an ankle injury as the club languished near the bottom of the WSL. It was, as she would later admit, “selfish because I should have let someone else play who was 100%. But unselfish because I needed to help the team.”It was telling, too, that when she was dropped by Sarina Wiegman for the February internationals, she told the media she would “fight to get my shirt back”. Nottheshirt.Myshirt. And even if Wiegman’s decision was quickly reversed after an injury to Beth Mead, there was a brutal clarity there, a simple task with a simple outcome. Problem: you’re not playing enough. Solution: start playing more. Bonus solution:win Champions League.Of course, before Sunday’s final there will be significant pressure on Wiegman to find a place for Kelly – and her revelatory Arsenal teammate Michelle Agyemang – in the starting XI. “Don’t fix what isn’t broken, it’s working,” the former Lioness Rachel Daly said on her podcast on Wednesday, a statement that raised the question: is it really working? But Daly did also make a good point about the value of players who can change a game late on, when legs are tiring and the stakes are at their terrifying highest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She grew up playing in the five-a-side cages of west London, a true street footballer. “She seems to thrive on those moments when the team needs her,” Morgan says.They call themselves the “finishers”,the “positive clique”, complete with finger-clicking celebration and even their own WhatsApp group.And whatever situation England find themselves in on Sunday, they will need Kelly, just as they will need Agyemang, Aggie Beever-Jones, Grace Clinton. It is why Wiegman spends so much time working with the fringe players, why the starters often make a point of staying out after training to support them while they do their extra fitness work.At the start of this year, you would have got pretty long odds on Kelly playing a starring role this summer. But of course Kelly has previous here too.Three years ago she missed almost an entire season with a cruciate ligament injury, and didn’t take the field again until April. We all know how that summer ended. Kelly knows better than most than it’s not how you start. It’s how you finish.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’sEnglandat the Euros, but is it 2024 or 2025?WhenMichelle Agyemangdrove unerringly through the ball in the fifth minute of added time on Tuesday night, the mind flicked back to this time last year and Ollie Watkins burying a shot in similar fashion. His was alate winner against the Netherlandsin Dortmund, Agyemang’s acrucial equaliser against Italyin Geneva. But both were clutch finishes with seconds left on the clock from substitutes who had barely been on the field.Having a pair of dependable closers is not the only similarity between these two England teams and sometimes the parallels can be uncanny. On the surface level, there’s the fact both teams have reached a final against Spain while, by and large, playing miserably. England should have lostto Sweden in the quarter-finalsa week ago andto Switzerland at the same stage in 2024. They have managed only one dominant showing each, against the Netherlands, and arguably the men sustained that for only 45 minutes.England and Spain meet again but a lot has changed since 2023 World Cup finalRead moreThese performances have led to increasing scrutiny of the coaches. Sarina Wiegman (to be made a dame at the end of this tournament, if England win) and Sir Gareth Southgate (knighted after stepping downfrom the Three Lions last summer) have been questioned over their selections, formations, substitutions and, most of all, style of play. What can England expect when their teams take the field? The answer seems to be unclear and underwhelming.But England have also reached both finals. A never-say-die attitude has been cited as the key reason for the Lionesses enduring. In the words of Lucy Bronze: “I don’t think you’ll find a team in world football with more fight and more resilience than this England team.” To a lesser extent the same rationale was applied to the men’s side, thanks to the late goals not just from Watkins but from Jude Bellinghamagainst Slovakiaand Bukayo Sakaagainst Switzerland. This, we were told, showed the mindset of a team used to going deep in tournaments under Southgate.View image in fullscreenLike fellow Bayern Munich and England player Harry Kane, Georgia Stanway has had to recover from serious injury but has looked laboured in her on-field movement.Photograph: Michael Zemanek/ShutterstockWiegman, of course, is about to take a team to a fifth consecutive major championship final (two with the Netherlands, three with England, and a record in the women’s and men’s game). She describes a “proper England” mentality as being one that “supports each other” and “works really hard” and these values have been seen on the pitch amid all the errors and misses. They have also been embodied by key players, none more than Bronze, whose performances across the tournament have been outstanding and whose personal intervention against Sweden was defining, scoring the first goal in the comeback from 2-0 down and stopping a rotten run of penalties with a thumping effort in the shootout. An honourable mention should also go to the new first-choice goalkeeper, Hannah Hampton, who has made crucial saves at critical times, none more than her double stop to deny Italy a two-goal lead.Other key players have been less impressive. Georgia Stanway and Harry Kane are stars for Bayern Munich and England. Both had to recover from serious injury to make their European Championship but, while each has looked laboured in their on-field movement, they retained the trust of their coaches owing to their abiding quality. Equally there have been adaptations so as to platform more mercurial talents – for Lauren James in the women’s team read Phil Foden in the men’s – with mixed results.The list of comparisons gets longer the deeper you look (which team have played the most successful long balls in the tournament? It’s England, both times!), but there are also subtle differences that may prove key. For a start, Wiegman has retained more control than Southgate over her team and their approach. Southgate flipped from a 4-2-3-1 to 4-3-3 and three at the back before going back to the start for the final against Spain. Fluidity did not ensue. Wiegman, after attempting a variation in formation in the defeat against France in order to play James in her favoured position, returned to the familiar, shifting the Chelsea forward back to the right against the Netherlands and reverting to her favoured 4-3-3.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties. For more information see ourPrivacy Policy. We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionQuestions over style of play persist for both teams, with an emphasis on set pieces being perhaps the only identifiable feature shared by both sides. But whileWiegman’s Englandmay not have a clear style or identity in this tournament, they have a consistent tactical approach. They look to get the ball forward quickly (see above) and deliver early crosses. England have averaged the highest number of successful crosses in the tournament, at nine per game compared with second placed Spain’s 8.2. Perhaps as a result, they have also created the most big chances at the tournament, 27 to Spain’s 20 (all stats according to FotMob).A lot of those big chances have been missed, but at least they are being created, which is more than Southgate could say of his team a year ago. Such was the pressure on him in Germany that for many it was a given he would lose his job regardless of the outcome. Managing the Lionesses is not quite the impossible job just yet and, despite the criticisms, Wiegman has endured, she has not gone on the defensive, and her players continue to speak with confidence about their abilities.This can make a difference. As can one final small distinction: for all the relative success that England’s men have had this past decade, it’s the women who have won a trophy, this one, three years ago. This team know how to win. Despite the performances to date and the quality of their upcoming opponents, it would be foolish to rule them out.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025England women's football teamSarina WiegmanWomen's footballEnglandGareth SouthgatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The striker has a contract until 2028 and the Premier League champions would need to raise funds through sales to afford a player valued at about £120m.Liverpool sign Hugo Ekitiké in £79m deal after fending off late Manchester United bidRead moreLiverpool signed another striker, Hugo Ekitiké, this week for £79m after concluding that Isak was out of reach. They may prioritise a centre-back over another forward. Newcastle had also been interested in Ekitiké but missed out after also failing to lure Liam Delap, who preferred to join Chelsea from Ipswich. Newcastle retain an interest in Yoane Wissa and have bid for the Brentford forward.Isakmissed a friendly at Celticlast Saturday and was left out of the 30-man squad that travelled to Asia because of what Newcastle described as a minor thigh injury. Eddie Howe’s side will play Arsenal in Singapore on Sunday and then face two fixtures in South Korea, against a K League XI and Tottenham.Howe said after the Celtic game of Isak’s absence: “It was my decision. He travelled back to Glasgow with us but I decided to send him home due to the speculation around him. The last thing he wanted is to be sat in the stand watching, that wasn’t fair to him. But I’m confident he will be a Newcastle player come the end of the window.”Newcastle have no desire to sell Isak as they prepare for a Champions League campaign. There has been an eagerness at the club to extend and improve Isak’s contract, after he scored 23 goals in 34 Premier League games to help the team finish fifth, but the 25-year-old has shown little enthusiasm for the idea.View image in fullscreenCristhian Mosquera, pictured in Arsenal kit for the first time, can play anywhere along the backline.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArsenalhave made the Valencia defender Cristhian Mosquera their fifth signing of the summer, taking the club’s spending to close to £140m.

They woke on Thursday with their assignment crystal clear: outwit a seemingly invincible Spain if they are to cement their place in history and retain the European Championship title on Sunday.A thankless task? It has been billed that way but there were elements of encouragement during asapping, knife-edge semi-finalin Zurich that Spain could easily have lost. For the first time this summer they were taken to the wire and the thought occurred that, if a weakened Germany could run them to within an Aitana Bonmatí masterstroke of the full distance, the Lionesses’ haphazard winning machine stands a fighting chance of curtailing the favourites’ party.England’s Keira Walsh hopes Spain can enjoy a controversy-free final after Rubiales affairRead more“I feel like the hard work has paid off,” the Spain manager, Montse Tomé, said after they had edged through. They were tested to the limit by a Germany team that squeezed space and, when opportunities arose, flooded forward. The goalkeeper Cata Coll made a handful of decisive saves and England will spend the coming days poring over the ways in which she can be exposed further.They will certainly have noted how Germany, happy to give up possession in the first two-thirds of the pitch, caused intermittent havoc on the counter. Lauren Hemp may take particular interest in how Klara Bühl, whose blend of power and trickery deserved greater reward, exposed them repeatedly on Germany’s left side. Bühl was never afraid to let fly and worked numerous positions in which to do so, although her best chance came when Spain were caught cold by a long pass by the keeper Ann-Katrin Berger.Jule Brand, a sparkling presence on the other side, caused headaches of her own. If England can expose the Spain full-backs, Ona Batlle and Olga Carmona, there will be opportunities to make hay. The question is whether Sarina Wiegman would willingly encourage the kind of punchy, sometimes scrappy showing Germany produced to invite them on. Like Spain, the reigning European champions would rather have the ball: they have dominated it in all of their five games, comprehensively in most cases. Do England have it in them to set up for a smash and grab?Evidence that they may do presented itself in February, when Wiegman’s sidewon 1-0 at Wembleywith a triumph of guts over guile. They had 41% of possession but nicked the spoils through Jess Park and could consider the outcome deserved. Two-thirds of the starters from this week’s semi-finals also began that game; perhaps the concern is that, since then, England have neither looked similarly solid nor fluent enough to compensate.View image in fullscreenLinda Dallmann (left) and the Germany midfield put pressure on Spain during the semi-final.Photograph: Philipp Kresnik/SheKicks/SPP/ShutterstockSpain appear perfectly aware of that judging by Mariona Caldentey’s unprompted acknowledgment during the post-game melee in Zurich that England are yet to truly sparkle. It remains possible that they will not need to. Wiegman may also note the way Germany’s midfield of Elisa Senss, Sara Däbritz and Janina Minge set into their counterparts whenever danger threatened.Bonmatí was, bar a couple of silky incursions, restrained until her angled bolt from the blue; Alexia Putellas was uncharacteristically quiet and few of those little pockets, the half-gaps between the lines, in which Spain love to wreak chaos were made available. If Wiegman wants to take inspiration then the insertion of Grace Clinton, who shone in that Nations League triumph five months ago, alongside Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway could generate a similar energy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Balls down the centre-backs’ sides also caused occasional trouble on Wednesday night. But for all these shoots of encouragement, they will require a far more clinical edge than Germany proved capable of mustering.Perhaps, in such a delicate match-up, intangibles come into play. It was clear from the extent of Spain’s celebrations that debuting in a continental final, and a first win over Germany, meant the world. “An infinite joy,” Tomé said. A weight of expectation accompanies that opportunity to make the next step, especially when you have been heavily backed to cruise home. Failure stings, just as seven of Spain’s likely starting lineup will remember from Barcelona’s Women’sChampions League finalagainst Arsenal two months ago, when the English side played the upstart role to perfection.“This is not over yet,” Bonmatí said. England remain the team that have it all to do. Eyes may burn with the vision of decisively avenging thatWorld Cup final defeatin Sydney two years ago, but the bottom line is that they must improve significantly on that performance. Germany’s organised, aggressive and whip-smart offering may just have shown how to go about it.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Spain women's football teamEngland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its conclusions exemplify some of the bureaucratic and legal obstacles many employees face when attempting to report sexual assault in the workplace. These can include systemic ineffective reporting mechanisms and procedural complexities while individuals can experience retraumatization, minimization, subsequent poor workplace performance, and isolation. Although not stated in the report, the investigation shows how the club lacked an acceptedtrauma-informed responseto investigating or receiving complaints of sexual assault.Denver’s incoming NWSL expansion team has its name: Summit FCRead moreSan Diego Wave made theirNWSLdebut in 2022 with an all-star cast that included former US women’s national team head coach Jill Ellis as president, former England international Casey Stoney as coach, and star forward Alex Morgan on the field. Off the field, however, things were not so stellar.The investigation found that a senior Wave staff member reported to her manager in October 2023 that she had been “traumatized” by a male co-worker. She also stated at that time she did not want lawyers, San Diego Wave, or NWSL to pursue an investigation into any events that had been responsible for that trauma. During a subsequent meeting with a Wave human resources manager the woman did not identify the co-worker who allegedly assaulted her, did not reveal details of the alleged “traumatization”, and did not explicitly describe sexual assault or sexual misconduct.The woman who made the allegations was subsequently fired by San Diego Wave after her work performance declined and was told by the club to make a worker’s compensation claim when more details of the assault became known to the club after her departure. The Guardian understands the NWSL investigation was triggered after reports were received from San Diego Wave employees via an anonymous tip line – a response that is in line with league policy.The NWSL commissioned the investigation to determine whether a report of sexual assault was ignored by Wave management and whether any of the club’s potential inaction had broken theNWSL Policy to Prevent and Eliminate Workplace Discrimination, Harassment, and Bullying– not to investigate any actual claims themselves.According to the investigation, the Wave did not fail to respond to a report of a sexual assault but “the Wave could have done more to press the complainant for more information” on the circumstances behind it. It is understood that the investigators suggested to at least one of the women they interviewed to consider pursuing other avenues for their complaints if they were dissatisfied with the investigation’s conclusionsIn October 2024, almost six months after the completion of the investigation, five former San Diego Wave employees filed a lawsuit against both the NWSL and San Diego Wave. Later that month, “Jane Doe 2” joined the suit with allegations of sexual harassment by the same Wave staffer accused of sexual assault.That ongoing suit contains multiple allegations related to the historic working environment at San Diego Wave in addition to the sexual assault and sexual harassment claims. The plaintiffs include Brittany Alvarado, a former videographer for San Diego Wave, who made headlines in 2024 when she posted on social media that the “NWSL must take immediate action to remove Jill Ellis from both the San Diego Wave and the league entirely.” Ellis was Wave president at the time and had a hands-on role in managing the club. Ellis has since departed San Diego to take a senior roleat Fifa as its chief football officer. Ellis is not a defendant in the lawsuit but is referenced on multiple occasions within the filing. She has separately filed a defamation lawsuit against Alvarado for the social media post made in 2024.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The suit alleges that a co-worker invited Jane Doe 1, who had recently moved to San Diego to work for the Wave, for a night out in the city that led to “inappropriate activities including a game of ‘Sexy Jenga’ that led to him pressuring her into non-consensual sexual acts”. Jane Doe 1 alleges that later at her apartment, while she was drunk, she was pressured into “sexual activity that she explicitly stated she did not consent to” that resulted in “significant injury”.Jane Doe 1 describes a subsequent “hostile work environment” and criticism from her manager that ultimately led to her termination by Wave in late 2023. After her departure, Jane Doe 1 alleges she asked the club how to report an assault and was told to complete a workers’ compensation form.“Jane Doe 2” alleges she was sexually harassed by the same San Diego Wave employee. She worked part-time with shifts scheduled by the employee who sent her non-work related messages via Snapchat, according to the claim. Jane Doe 2 informed the employee she was not interested in him romantically but the messages became increasingly sexual in nature including an unsolicited image of his penis, according to the lawsuit. Jane Doe 2 claims she was then scheduled for fewer work shifts by the Wave employee to a point where she was not rehired by San Diego Wave because she had not met the minimum shift requirements set by the club. In July 2024, Jane Doe 2 met socially with a Wave employee who told her that her experience was not unique and encouraged her to speak with Wave. The employee accused of assault and harassment has since left the club.San Diego Wave gained new owners in 2024 and while some staff from the period described in the lawsuit have left the organization several remain. Ellis’ defamation lawsuit against Alvarado is set to be heard later this year.The NWSL did not respond to specific questions regarding the San Diego Wave investigation but a league spokesperson said in an emailed statement to the Guardian that: “The safety, health, and well-being of everyone associated with the NWSL is our highest priority. We take serious [sic] any and every report of potential misconduct, hire qualified independent investigators to review those allegations thoroughly, and act when allegations are supported by the facts uncovered. We will not comment specifically about an active legal matter.”That statement has been previously issued to other media organizations that have requested comment on the issue over the past year. Finn, Dixon, and Herling did not respond to a request for comment on the investigation.San Diego Wave did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Explore more on these topicsNWSLWomen's footballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sign up now!Will UnwinThu 24 Jul 2025 10.49 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 11.18 EDTShareFOREVER YOUNGIn the good old days when pitches consisted purely of mud, shorts were short and facial hair on footballers was ubiquitous, players had to eke out every single second of a career. Each new contract got thirtysomethings a step closer to becoming a pub landlord, every penny mattering in an era where players were not made for life. Medical support and fitness routines were not what they could have been; making it into your fifth decade as a professional was quite difficult with a barrelled chest and self-healing injuries. Often it was only the goalkeepers able to reach their 40s with the hope of carrying on, as John Burridge and Kevin Poole will tell you.Ashley Young, however, has no excuse. Not only is he an outfield player who has been making millions per season for around the past 20 years but he still wants to carry on playing the sport. Football Daily assumes he was probably able to put down the cash on the Dog and Partridge during his Watford days, where he made his professional debut in 2003, the week when Where Is The Love? by the Black Eyed Peas was top of the hit parade. Since then he has been managed by Sean Dyche but still loves football and wants to continue at Ipswich, where he’s signed a one-year deal, aged 40. “Ashley has had a fantastic career and his achievements speak for themselves,” parped head coach Kieran McKenna, 39. “He has maintained an extremely high level of professionalism and competitiveness throughout his career and he is still playing at a very good level. We feel his leadership and experience will be valuable to the group this season and he is very hungry to contribute on and off the pitch.”Portman Road is used to old-timers watching the sunset go down in East Anglia. John Wark finished his career at Ipswich at the end of his third spell with the club. The Escape to Victory star was 39 at the time but he looked roughly 25 years older than Young, who, rather sickeningly, does not seem to have aged at all since his teenage years, which might explain why he wants to continue being in the public eye. And who could forget Mick Burns’s appearances for the Tractor Boys at the ripe old age of 43 years 219 days, when playing against Gateshead in January 1952?Fellow wing wizard Stanley Matthews carried on until he was 50, having admittedly lost some of his best years to a world war, which might explain why he wanted to keep going. Young has also suffered, missing the odd month or two to knee, ankle and groin knack but the winger-turned-full-back has a dream to chase down and surpass his heroes Graham Alexander and Tony Ford. The duo spent the majority of their careers in the historic county of Lancashire, at Preston and Rochdale, rather than Manchester United and Everton. Alexander made 833 league appearances before calling time at 40, while Ford made 98 more, eventually hanging up his boots at 42. Young is currently on 563, so requires roughly another 10 seasons to catch them up and equal Matthews for the truest test of longevity. Then, hopefully, he can take over the running of legendary north London drinker The Faltering Full-back.QUOTE OF THE DAY“So for the girls, this time, as a friend and a fellow footballer, I want them to just go and enjoy this final – they play incredible football and they deserve to be there.

Nevertheless, there remain some simple, simplifying truths that, when delivered by someone with elite-level experience, must be taken seriously. So, when Graeme Souness reminds us that “the team that gets to the ball first wins”, we should pay just as much attention as when hearing about hybrid pressing, on-ball value and chance-creating actions.The players most obliged to reach that ball first are, like Souness, central midfielders. And, though there are operative off-pitch factors, the longstanding absence of players able to do that is a significant reason whyManchester Unitedhave been so poor for so long.Barcelona confirm Marcus Rashford loan from Manchester United with buy optionRead moreThis has not escaped the attention ofRuben Amorim. After last Saturday’s goalless draw with Leeds, he noted: “The gaps between our sectors was sometimes too big. We have a lack of pace, especially in the middle of the park and you can feel it is hard to win and bring the ball.”The problem, though, predates him by well over a decade – surprisingly so, given a relentlessly self-mythologising institution which has been home to some of the greatest midfields and midfielders. The Busby Babes featured a half-back line of Jackie Blanchflower, Duncan Edwards and Eddie Colman; the 60s side had Nobby Stiles, Paddy Crerand and Bobby Charlton; then, under Alex Ferguson, United moved seamlessly from Bryan Robson to Paul Ince to Roy Keane – who was partnered by Paul Scholes and flanked by David Beckham and Ryan Giggs, both comfortable playing inside.Things changed, though, after the 2005 takeover when, constrained by the Glazer family’s debt and interest, Ferguson focused on stopping and scoring goals. The side that won the league and Champions League in 2007-08 boasted an all-time defence and attack but the midfield, though more than useful, was a weakness – one exploited by Barcelona in two Champions League finals, their superiority in that area putting United’s back four under pressure while stifling their front three.Thereafter, Ferguson interpreted midfield in the most literal way possible: the middle of a field. Between signing Owen Hargreaves in 2007 and retiring in 2013, he signed only one player for the role, punting on Nick Powell – who could easily be categorised as a second striker. Instead, he accumulated wingers and strikers of different profiles able to turn tight games; in his final season, United won 16 league games by one goal.View image in fullscreenRoy Keane was a midfield powerhouse in the United tradition but they have lacked such a player ever since Alex Ferguson retired.Photograph: Rui Vieira/PAIn the 12 years that followed, United signed all manner of midfielders for all manner of amusing expense, namely: Marouane Fellaini, Ángel Di María, Daley Blind, Ander Herrera, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Morgan Schneiderlin, Paul Pogba, Nemanja Matic, Fred, Bruno Fernandes, Donny van de Beek, Christian Eriksen, Casemiro, Mason Mount and Manuel Ugarte, with Marcel Sabitzer and Sofyan Amrabat joining on loan. So far,only Fernandes could be said to have succeeded.Footballistically, to borrow Arsène Wenger’s phrase, midfield has been United’s biggest failing; even Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side, the best of the post-Fergie wilderness years, were counterattackers not dominators. Indeed, it was when he tried to convert them into a more proactive outfit that things went wrong because, in the aftermath of Euro 2020, his back four collapsed and he lacked the midfielders able to protect it – respectively, Matic and Pogba lacked the legs and inclination to get to the ball first. Had the money spent on Harry Maguire been used to get Declan Rice, things might have worked out differently, but in the event United’s defence was open and their attack starved, because they couldn’t dictate games by controlling the centre of the pitch.There are different ways of doing this. Pep Guardiola has deployed midfielders not just in midfield but also in defence and attack, while Jürgen Klopp used dominating athletes to run opponents off the pitch, with playmaking slack taken up by his full-backs. As soon as he tried something different, bringing in Thiago Alcântara, the balance departed.Nor has it fully returned,last season’s titlewas based largely on the form of Mohamed Salah; Liverpool’s 41 goals conceded is the most by a champion side since United in 2012-13. In Europe, meanwhile, their relative lack of box-to-box class was exploited by Paris Saint-Germain and, though they have reinforced expensively and impressively this summer, the lack of work done in this area – so far – offers the chasing pack a chance.United, though, cannot take such a risk. They began under Amorim as a team unable to create chances, their development into one unable to take chances a significant leap forward. As such, it makes sense that this summer’s priority was adding goals, but with that addressed by the acquisitions ofMatheus CunhaandBryan Mbeumo, midfield must become the priority.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the market is offering little, while his system, fielding two midfielders where the majority of opposing sides use three, leaves a difficult gap to bridge; one Ferguson had to combat first when English clubs returned to Europe, then again when his famous four were shut down by Bayern Munich in 2001, then again in 2007 when Milan’s narrow diamond proved a problem.The explosion in player athleticism means things have become harder since then. Though Amorim’s game model uses defenders, wing-backs and inside-forwards to create central overloads, it remains the case that he needs physical monstrosity in midfield – all the more so now he has decided that Fernandes, indefatigable but no one’s idea of a shuttler, is a No 8 not a No 10. Casemiro is no longer the man for this job, while Ugarte – a stop-gap whom PSG replaced with the infinitely superior João Neves – lacks authority, personality and quality.Should United purchase the right midfielder, they will be in better shape than if they do not but do find a centre-forward. Prime Ronaldo Nazário would struggle in a team unable to dominate possession, whereas Joshua Zirkzee, Rasmus Højlund and Chido Obi have shown potential and, with creative quality behind them in a team able to pin opponents back, they would have more scoring opportunities and the chance to grow into a role one of them might yet make theirs permanently – something beyond Ugarte and this version of Casemiro.Consequently, the centre of the pitch and the heart of the team must be Amorim’s only priority – United cannot afford to split their funds and wind up with someone not quite good enough in two positions. They must find the best, most suitable midfielder they can and only after that worry about what’s next because, though without the right centre-forward they will not be complete, without the right midfielder getting to the ball first, they simply cannot be good.Explore more on these topicsManchester UnitedRuben AmorimcommentShareReuse this content"

This stadium, which was packed to the rafters here, was a building site and on the field Wakefield were sleepwalking towards relegation.Embattled Salford players out to avoid tag of Super League’s worst ever teamRead moreBut in the end, the year they spent in the Championship in 2024 may prove to be the biggest blessing in disguise. It allowed the club to rebuild, overhaul their Belle Vue home and, with the backing of new owner Matt Ellis, emerge as a potential giant in the game again.Not since 1968 have Wakefield been champions of England. That wait for a league title may not end this year but the fact it is a possibility, given the way things were here as recently as two years ago, is credit to Ellis, the club’s head coach, Daryl Powell, and this talented Trinity squad.Here, in front of the biggest crowd this stadium has seen for more than a decade, Lino’s drop goal with the final kick of a pulsating contest proved to be the difference to see offLeeds Rhinos, who themselves could have moved level on points with second-placed Wigan had they emerged victorious.They had their chances but in the end Trinity held their nerve when it mattered most to move back into the top six. With a favourable run-in to the end of the regular season, it is now possible that Wakefield could be in the playoffs later this year for the first time since 2012.View image in fullscreenSam Lisone scores Leeds’ first try to level up the scores in the first half of their Super League game with Wakefield.Photograph: Richard Sellers/PAAnd if Wakefield do make the top six, a rerun of this West Yorkshire rivalry would be a fitting end-of-season showdown. The scores were level for most of the evening, with the two sides unable to be split at half-time as Sam Lisone’s try for Leeds cancelled out Lachlan Walmsley’s fine effort for Trinity.That, coupled with two goals apiece from the boots of Max Jowitt and Jake Connor, made it 8-8 at the interval. And with defences firmly on top throughout, it felt as though the contest was destined to go down to the wire all evening long.Leeds will probably look back on this, and the way the final stages unfolded, as a missed opportunity. “I’m extremely proud of their effort,” their coach, Brad Arthur, said. “Their fight was strong but when you put that much effort in you really should come away with something.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Leeds’ Brodie Croft came close to kicking the winning drop goal with a minute remaining, before Lino then went one better to spark rapturous scenes in this particular part of West Yorkshire.On this evidence, do not rule out more celebrations like these come the business end of the season, too.

The clash was hotly anticipated but proved to be not that much of a contest, with Raducanu comfortably clinching a 6-4, 6-2 victory to reach the quarter-finals of the Citi Open in Washington.Speaking on Sky Sports, Raducanu said: “I thought it was going to be a really difficult match. Naomi’s won four slams, she’s been world No 1, won Masters [titles]. She’s so dangerous and on the hard courts I think she’s particularly comfortable. I knew I was going to have to play really well and manage my own service games, which I’m really proud of how I did.Venus Williams, 45, falls short in bid for first win streak since 2019Read more“I was making some inroads in her service games after I got used to it a little bit. I’m really pleased with how I handled the ball speed and the conditions here in DC.”The result means the 22-year-old will once again overtake Sonay Kartal and Katie Boulter to become the top-ranked British player as she looks to secure a seeding for next month’s US Open. Raducanu ended Boulter’s two-year run at the top of the domestic standings in June but she then slipped back to 46 in the world afterlosing a close tussle with Aryna Sabalenkain the third round of Wimbledon.Her two victories here, though, could mean Raducanu returns to the top 40, and she will definitely pass Boulter following her opening-round defeat by Maria Sakkari. It will be the Greek that Raducanu plays next, and the Briton has not dropped a set against her in their three previous meetings.Raducanu was sharp from the start against Osaka, who continues to search for a way back to the top of the game after giving birth to daughter Shai two years ago. A double fault from the Japanese gave Raducanu the first break in the fifth game and the British player was rock solid on serve as she wrapped up the opening set. Raducanu is without a coach in Washington amid uncertainty over the future of her partnership with Mark Petchey and has only her hitting partner, Alexis Canter, in her corner, but there was no lack of direction in this performance.She was helped to another break at the start of the second set by more errors from Osaka, who created a first chance on the Raducanu serve at 1-2 but could not take it. Raducanu’s serve has improved markedly under Petchey and was her key weapon here as she moved through to a third quarter-final in Washington with strong hopes of going further.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He sits at the top of the series’ wicket-taking charts with 16 at an average of 24.75.Duckett and Crawley’s 166-run stand hurts India on England’s dominant dayRead moreAsked if he saw similarities with Stokes now and the bowler from a few years ago, when South Africawere ripped apartat Newlands in 2020 with three late match-winning wickets, Crawley replied: “There are so many similarities to that pace-wise.”.“He was bowling quickly back then and he’s got that pace back now. And the way he gets that away movement from the right-handers, that zip, which is as much as anyone in the world. He gets that bounce and he’s a proper wicket-taker, and he can make things happen. That was certainly the case when I first came into the side back then, and he seems to have got that back now, which is a phenomenal effort considering the injuries he’s had. And, well, he’s a little bit older now, so a phenomenal effort.”Crawley’s opening stand of 166 with Ben Duckett on Thursday came after the pair had been involved ina tetchy exchangewith the Indian fielders on the third evening at Lord’s, taking their time as Crawley faced one over before the close. India’s captain, Shubman Gill, questioned whether England’s behaviour had been “in the spirit of the game”.“I sit in my spot until the umpires go out, and I saw the umpires go out and I walked out. I wasn’t aware that we were 90 seconds late, but fair enough,” said Crawley.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The quarterback, in his first season with the Jets, sat on the grass for a few moments before getting up and limping to the sideline while helped by a trainer.Trump wants to force the Commanders to revert to a racist name. It’s unlikely he canRead moreCoach Aaron Glenn said the injury was to Fields’ right foot, but had no immediate information on the nature or severity.“I know it was a quick throw, so I’m assuming someone stepped on his toe,” Glenn said after the Jets’ second practice of training camp. “It had to be because of the nature of the call that we had as far as offensive play call. I want to look at the tape and be sure.”Fields spent a few minutes in the injury tent on the sideline as trainers examined him before a cart came out to transport him into the facility. Fields sat in the passenger seat next to the driver in the cart and then got up under his own power before stepping inside to be further evaluated.Glenn stopped the team period after Fields was hurt and the Jets ran special teams drills.“When anybody goes down, there’s a lump in my throat,” Glenn said. “Listen, I hate injuries for any player, but the thing is I want to make sure that I understand exactly what the injury is before I move forward on my thought process.”Fields signed a two-year, $40m contract as a free agent in March after playing last season in Pittsburgh and is expected to be New York’s starter this season. Veteran Tyrod Taylor, the team’s oldest player who turns 36 next month, is the backup and replaced Fields in team drills.“I think the most important part is, if anything does happen to Justin, I don’t think there’s any drop-off as far as what we want to do when it comes to play calls,” Glenn said. “Very similar when you talk about skill set, so that was like enticing for us. And then the leadership ability ... you could just tell the players really gravitate to him. When he says something, everybody really listens, even the coaching staff. He’s been around this league a long time. He knows what it takes to win, and he’s a really good person. So, we’re all excited to have that guy here.“Listen, Justin is who he is and if something happens to him, we’ve got Tyrod and we’re ready to go.”New York also has Adrian Martinez, the 2024 United Football League MVP, and rookie Brady Cook on its roster, but neither has thrown a pass in anNFLgame. Glenn noted that Martinez was in camp with the Lions in 2023, so he has some familiarity with the offense that the Jets are running with Tanner Engstrand, Detroit’s former passing game coordinator.But if Fields is sidelined for a significant amount of time, the Jets could be in the market for an experienced quarterback.The news of Fields’ injury sent Jets fans into a frenzy on social media, with many recalling how Aaron Rodgers’ torn achilles tendon in the team’s opening game in 2023 sunk their Super Bowl hopes and how Zach Wilson missed time early in the 2022 season with a knee injury.Glenn urged fans to remain calm because “I’ve been there and done that” – referring to how he adjusted to various injuries in Detroit last season as the Lions’ defensive coordinator – and it’s still early in training camp.“I understand how this league is and I understand how social media starts to take over and everybody starts to panic,” Glenn said. “The one thing I would say is, listen, we have a number of men in that locker room that want to win. And we have a number of men in the locker room that’s learning how to win and it’s my job to make sure that I push that over the edge. And that’s my plan.”Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Want to see it as yet another benchmark by which we can measure the US and Canada’s top professional league against Mexico’s? The current format, pitting a team of MLS stars against Liga MX’s own selection, will provide that (however flimsy the conclusions may be from MLS’s 3-1 win).Want it to be nothing more than a good time? The tenor of play, and that of the previous night’s very fun but very silly skills competition won by MLS, will do that. Sam Surridge’s first-half opener, the confirmation of which was somewhat hilariously delayed by a VAR check, came after an impressive display of speed and skill from LAFC’s Denis Bouanga, who picked the pocket of Necaxa’s Agustín Palavecino before bursting through on goal. The Philadelphia Union’s Tai Baribo finished off a well-worked second off a super through ball from Columbus’ Diego Rossi. All four of those involved in the goals are among the league’s best attacking stars, and they shone brightly.MLS commissioner defends ban on ‘political’ signage at games amid Ice crackdownRead moreLigaMX had a major asset ball out as well. Sixteen-year-old Gilberto Mora, who broke through impressively with Mexico during the Gold Cup and has done the same at club level with Tijuana, scored the league’s only goal of the night. Vancouver’s American standout Brian White bundled in MLS’s final goal, giving a boost to the league’s work improving the depth of the USMNT ahead of a huge World Cup year.Substitutions came with regularity, every 30 minutes or so. No heavy tackles were put in, no injuries were reported, both teams put forth effort in attack and a lively sold-out crowd seemed plenty entertained by the spectacle.If you see it as a total waste of time, though, there’s some reason for that too – and you’d have some famous company. The biggest star in the league said as much with his actions, as Lionel Messi skipped the three-day festivities in Austin, Texas entirely (along with Inter Miami team-mate Jordi Alba, who shared many of Messi’s best years at FC Barcelona). Both could be suspended for Inter Miami’s next match as a result of their absence, a crucial clash against top-of-the-table Cincinnati on Saturday.In one sense Messi’s no-show is a needlessly aloof move. The publicity demands on him would have been great, but they always are, and that hasn’t stopped him from continuing to be his famously reclusive self. Events like All-Star, as silly as they may seem to the rest of the world, are a fixture of American sports culture. It’s existed since the first year of the league and every other major US pro league has one. To effectively scoff at its existence is akin to protesting against the searing heat and bitter cold that accompany MLS’s season, or complaining about Boxing Day matches and the resulting holiday-period fixture congestion in England. The conditions may not be ideal, the timing may suck, but it’s part of the culture.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Michael Jordan played in 13 of them. LeBron James has started all 21 of the ones in which he appeared. Wayne Gretzky played in 18; Sidney Crosby just made his 10th. Shohei Ohtani has taken part in each of the last five All-Star games, even when his health has prevented him from taking part fully. It is not ridiculous for MLS to have an All-Star game, and it is similarly not beyond the pale to expect a player making over $20m per year with the implicit expectation of being the face of the league to take part.Or is it? Unlike those stars of past and present, neither Messi nor Alba made their names in a North American league. It’s not like either player is coasting on their names – both have been extremely impressive in MLS. In a way, Messi is showing the league a backhanded form of respect by saving himself for games that actually matter. Even MLS commissioner Don Garber admitted in a press conference before the game that All-Star, while useful to the league from a business standpoint, is not without its flaws for players.“This is first time we’ve had all of our CSOs [Chief Soccer Officers] here, all of our CBOs [Chief Business Officers] here, all of our owners here, it is an important mid season break for us,” Garber said, before pointing out that Messi has indeed played nine games in the past 35 days between the Club World Cup and MLS league play, with him going the full 90 minutes in every one. “Miami’s had a schedule that is unlike any other team. Most of our teams had a 10 day break. Miami hasn’t. We have to manage through that as a league. At the same time, we do have rules, and we have to manage through that as well.”The most aggressive set-piece team in the world plays in MinnesotaRead moreBy “manage through that,” Garber is hinting at a feeling he said explicitly later on in that press conference: It is time for MLS to re-think the foundations of its All-Star game. The commissioner revealed for the first time a specific per-game number of viewers the league draws for its game broadcasts on average: 120,000. That is not an impressive number, and it represents a near-50% increase on last year, according to Garber. Does continuing to hold an All-Star game as currently presented help boost that number as the league, like all leagues, deals with increasing fixture congestion? It’s unlikely.Garber said that the league was still focused on keeping the game competitive, and that changing it up could be as simple as finding a different type of opponent. In the past, the league has hosted games against famous clubs from around the world – and perhaps that could be a reality again.But this push for competitiveness comes as most US leagues are doing the exact opposite. The NBA abandoned the East-West format of old and the game itself seems less and less like real basketball each year. The NFL no longer holds a Pro Bowl at all (A sensible decision, all told, considering the violence inherent in modern American football). MLB is seemingly the only other major league to hold firm – its recent All-Star game was the most-watched amongUS sports, with viewership up 6% this year.“I love the All-Star game,” Garber said, “Most leagues probably do. But how do you get your players to love the All-Star game?”Judging from their comments throughout the week, most MLS players do. But that feeling may be declining, and perhaps it’s not as important any more anyway.Explore more on these topicsMLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The commissioner said that ensuring fan groups do not unveil displays that are political in nature is part of that goal.“We want to ensure that we’re having displays that are not going to incite anyone,” Garber said in part. “The best way to do that is to have the policy we have, which prohibits having political signage or anything to do with legislative acts on display in our stadiums.‘It’s offensive’: voices from Iran as fans face 2026 World Cup travel banRead more“I understand and sympathize with those that are impacted by this. I grew up in a very diverse environment. We are a very diverse league, but we have to be very thoughtful about how we engage in this situation.”MLS has said in the past that it estimates around 30% of its fans are Hispanic.As Ice raids have taken place in public places across the country, numerous MLS supporters’ groups have spoken out about how the current environment contributes to them feeling unsafe at MLS games. In May, Latino supporters of Nashville SC paused gameday activities due to Ice’s crackdown, tellingSixOneFive Soccerthat they feel “targeted”, andthe Athleticthat they feel “hunted” given the general environment in the state.In this past weekend’s LAFC v LA Galaxy match, LAFC supporters unveiled a tifo reading “Los Angeles unidos jamás será vencido” (“Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated”) afterIce raids in the California metropolisthat led to more than 2,700 arrests. As of mid-June,Ice data showsthere were more than 11,700 people in immigration detention who had been arrested despite having no track record of being charged with or convicted of a crime.LAFCissued a statementabout the Los Angeles raids, saying that “today, when so many in our city are feeling fear and uncertainty, LAFC stands shoulder to shoulder with all members of our community”. At time of writing, they remain the only MLS team to have made such a statement. The LA Galaxy banned fans responsible for displaying anti-Ice banners at a recent game, with other supporters boycotting the match against LAFC in protest.Anti-Ice banners have also been seen in Austin, the site of Wednesday’s All-Star game, Chicago and other markets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Friday social media and other internet platforms will be required to implement safety measures protecting children or face large fines.It is a significant test for the Online Safety Act, a landmark piece of legislation that covers the likes of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and Google. Here is a guide to thenew rules.What is happening on 25 July?Companies within the scope of the act must introduce safety measures to protect children from harmful content. This means all pornography sites must have in place rigorous age-checking procedures. Ofcom, the UK communications regulator and the act’s enforcer,found that8% of children aged eight to 14 had visited an online pornography site or app over a month-long period.Social media platforms and large search engines must also prevent children from accessing pornography and material that promotes or encourages suicide, self-harm and eating disorders. This has to be kept off children’s feeds entirely. Hundreds of companies are affected by the rules.Platforms will also have to suppress the spread of other forms of material potentially harmful to children including the promotion of dangerous stunts, encouraging the use of harmful substances and enabling bullying.What are the recommended safety measures?Measures under the codes include: algorithms that recommend content to users must filter out harmful material; all sites and apps must have procedures for taking down dangerous content quickly; and children must have a “straightforward” way to report concerns. Adherence is not mandatory if companies believe they have valid alternative measures to meet their child safety obligations.The “riskiest” services, which include big social media platforms, could be required to use “highly effective” age checks to identify under-18 users. If social media platforms that contain harmful content do not introduce age checks, they will need to ensure there is a “child appropriate” experience on the site.X has said if it is unable to determine whether a user is 18 or over, they will be defaulted into sensitive content settings and will not be able to view adult material. It is also introducing age estimation technology and ID checks to verify if users are under 18. Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, says it already has a multilayered approach to age checking. This includes its teen account feature – a default setting for anyone under 18 – that it says already provides an “age appropriate” experience for young users.Mark Jones, a partner at the law firm Payne Hicks Beach, said: “Ultimately it is going to be for Ofcom to decide whether these measures meet the requirements under the OSA [Online Safety Act] and, if not, to hold the companies to account.”The Molly Rose Foundation, a charity established by the family of the British teenager Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017 after viewing harmful content online, said the measures did not go far enough. It has called for additional changes such as blocking dangerous online challenges and requiring platforms to proactively search for, and take down, depressive and body image-related content.How would age verification work?Age assurance measures for pornography providers supported by Ofcom include: facial age estimation, which assesses a person’s likely age through a live photo or video; checking a person’s age via their credit card provider, bank or mobile phone network operator; photo ID matching, where a passport or similar ID is checked against a selfie; or a “digital identity wallet” that contains proof of age.Ria Moody, a lawyer at the law firm Linklaters, said: “Age assurance measures must be very accurate. Ofcom has said that self-declaration of age, or terms of service saying users must be over 18, are not highly effective measures and so platforms should not rely on these alone.”What does that mean in practice?Pornhub, the most-visited provider of online pornography to the UK, has said it will introduce “regulator approved age assurance methods” by Friday. It has yet to say what these methods will be. OnlyFans, another site which carries pornography, already uses facial age verification software. It does not store an image of the user’s face but estimates age using data taken from millions of other images. A company called Yoti provides that software and also does so for Instagram.Reddit started checking ages last week for its forums and threads which include mature content. It is using technology made by a company called Persona, which verifies age through an uploaded selfie or a photo of government ID. Reddit does not have access to the photos but stores the verification status to avoid users having to repeat the process too often.How accurate is facial age verification?Software allows a website or app to set a “challenge” age – such as 20 or 25 – to limit the number of underage people who slip through the net. When Yoti set a challenge age of 20, fewer than 1% of 13- to 17-year-olds were incorrectly let through.What other methods are there?An equally direct method is to require users to show a piece of formal identification such as a passport or a driving licence. Again, the ID details do not need to be stored and can be used solely to verify access.Will every site carrying pornography carry out the age checks?They should, but many smaller sites are expected to try ignoring the rule, fearing it will damage demand for their services. Industry insiders say that those ignoring the rules may wait to see how Ofcom responds to breaches before deciding how to act.How will the child protection measures be enforced?Ofcom can deploy a range of punishments under the act. Companies can be fined up to £18m or 10% of global turnover for breaches, or whichever is greater. In the case of Meta, such a fine would equate to $16bn. Sites or apps can also receive formal warnings. For extreme breaches, Ofcom can ask a court to prevent the site or app from being available in the UK.Senior managers at tech companies will also be criminally liable for repeated breaches of their duty of care to children and could face up to two years in jail if they ignore enforcement notices from Ofcom.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Some regard it as an existential threat to outlets reliant on search result traffic.AI summaries can give users all the information they seek without ever clicking through to the original source of the content. Meanwhile, search result links are pushed further down the page, lowering the number of users that find them.A new analysis by the Authoritas analytics company has found that a site previously ranked first in a search result could lose about 79% of its traffic for that query if results were delivered below an AI overview.The study also found that links to YouTube – owned by Google’s parent company Alphabet – were more prominent compared with the normal search result system. The research has been submitted as part of a legal complaint to the UK’s competition watchdog about the impact of Google AI Overviews.A Google spokesperson said in a statement the study was “inaccurate and based on flawed assumptions and analysis”, using outdated estimations and a set of searches that did not represent all the queries that would generate traffic for news websites.“People are gravitating to AI-powered experiences, and AI features in search enable people to ask even more questions, creating new opportunities for websites to be discovered,” the spokesperson said. “We continue to send billions of clicks to websites every day, and we have not seen dramatic drops in aggregate web traffic as is being suggested.”A second study also showed a big hit to referral traffic from Google AI Overviews. A month-long survey of almost 69,000 Google searches, run by the Pew Research Center, a US thinktank, found users only clicked a link under an AI summary once every 100 times.A Google spokesperson said that study also used “flawed methodology and skewed queryset that is not representative of search traffic”.Senior news executives say Google has repeatedly refused to share the data they need to calculate the impact of the use of AI summaries.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

The MailOnline executive Carly Steven said in May the site was experiencing a large drop in clicks from search results featuring an AI summary, with clickthrough rates dropping by 56.1% on the desktop site and 48.2% on mobiles.The legal complaint to the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority is a collaboration between the tech justice group Foxglove, the Independent Publishers Alliance and the Movement for an Open Web.Owen Meredith, the chief executive of the News Media Association, accused Google of trying to keep users “within its own walled garden, taking and monetising valuable content – including news – created by the hard work of others”.“The situation as it stands is entirely unsustainable and will ultimately result in the death of quality information online,” he said. “The Competition and Markets Authority has the toolkit to tackle these issues. It must do so urgently.”Rosa Curling, the director of Foxglove, said the new research demonstrated the “devastating impact that Google’s ‘AI overviews’ are already having on the UK’s independent news industry”.“It would be bad enough if Google were simply stealing journalists’ work and passing it off as their own,” she said. “But worse still, they are using this work to fuel their own tools and profits, while making it harder for media outlets to reach the readers they rely on to sustain their work.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Newspapers & magazinesNewspapersComputingNews agenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

He also offered tutorials in how to use the kits and built up a network of almost 700 connections. The fake websites supplied in the kits had features that allowed information such as login and bank details to be stored.It is estimated Holman received £300,000 from selling the kits between 2021 and 2023. The kits were distributed through the encrypted messaging service Telegram.Holman, who was studying electronic and computer engineering at the University ofKentin Canterbury, laundered the money he received through cryptocurrency wallets.The dedicated card and payment crime unit of the City of London police launched an investigation after receiving information from the intelligence firm WMC Global about the fraudulent kits being sold online.Holman was arrested in October 2023 and his university accommodation was searched and devices were seized. After the arrest he continued to use his Telegram channel to provide support to buyers of his kits. He was rearrested in May 2024.Detectives found the kits on Holman’s computer and his digital fingerprints linked to their creation. He distributed the kits across Europe and one was connected to a fraud of approximately €1m (£870,000).Holman pleaded guilty to seven charges, including making or supplying articles for use in fraud, encouraging or assisting the commission of an offence, and transferring, acquiring and possessing criminal property. He was sentenced to seven years at Southwark crown court.After the sentencing, DS Ben Hurley said Holman had enabled mass fraud on a global scale. “The fraud losses linked to Holman’s actions are in the millions. Furthermore, Holman himself profited massively from the sale of this software, with no thought for how it may cause harm to victims,” he said.Sarah Jennings, a specialist prosecutor for the Crown Prosecution Service, said she hoped the sentence sent a message to other fraudsters. “No matter how sophisticated your methods, you cannot hide behind online anonymity or encrypted platforms,” she said.The CPS said it would take Holman back to court to recover the money he had made from his crimes.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCrimeInternetEnglandKentnewsShareReuse this content"

Stew in your own “Situationship Mix”.As I write this, I’m listening to Spotify’s Daylist, a mix that refreshes every few hours based on my own listening habits. Today’s vibe is “funky beats roller skating tuesday early morning mix”. At 120bpm, the algorithm knows I need some energetic house to roll from my bed to my desk.The problem with this listening experience isn’t just the creepy AI-driven intimacy of it all, more that the same songs are recycled in a predictable loop. Spotify’s algorithm has anaesthetised me to artists I once enjoyed. Every time I hear the slippery psychedelic bass of Khruangbin slinking into one of my playlists, or flow in seamlessly from another artist’s radio, I violently hit skip.‘One minute it’s “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved’: can anyone escape Spotify?Read moreA decade ago, Spotify favouredhuman-curated playlistsmade by artists, celebrities and music aficionados. But in 2021 the streaming companypivoted towardsmachine learning, feeding “nearly half a trillion events” into computer models every day. Now, user data – chiefly our listening history, interactions with Spotify’s user interface and the time of day – is packaged into a mixtape for every micro-occasion.Advocates argue this is a chance todemocratise music promotion, neatly matching artists with their audiences. Critics suggest this ultra-subjective experience limits musical discovery to the already familiar – and the less it’s challenged, the more my music taste narrows. So as a test, I quit Spotify for a month, to bring some soul back into the way I find music.First, I consulted people who had never used streaming services, like my dad, who grew up in 1970s London in the heyday of punk and glam rock. Hunched in a booth in his local record shop, he would listen to a sample and take a punt on what vinyl to buy. Some albums apparently missed the mark, and others, like Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, transported him to a different universe. He insisted I start with my favourite artists and listen to every album front to back, as if reading a story.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningInspired, I bought a $30 record player in an op-shop and hunted for vinyls. Late to the record renaissance, it was slim pickings – Australian pub classics, Christian country or Christmas hits. But when a friend pointed out my new turntable was missing a needle, it became a dusty but decorative addition to my living room.My 20-year-old neighbour had another suggestion: a diamante-encrusted iPod, which she produced in a ziplock bag like a hallowed artefact. Found for $200 on Facebook Marketplace, plugging in wired earplugs and hitting shuffle was a nostalgic throwback. But this romance was short-lived: the iPod was incompatible with my Bluetooth speaker and demanded hours of admin to upload music.The biggest challenge came when driving my old silver Subaru, as I was stranded with only a single CD, a flimsy aux cord and my thoughts. Stuck with silence, I wondered what the new grinding noise was – until I discovered my local community broadcaster, Vox FM 106.9. More than5 million Australians listen to community radio every week, for 17 hours on average – and now, I can see why. The station prides itself on “real music” and even has the tagline “You never know what you like until you try it”.Just what I needed! And it’s true, I had forgotten how good it feels to wind down the windows and blast Push the Button by the Sugababes, and then to roll them up again when a classical German song, a mystery even to Shazam, comes on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Now music insiders say listeners should be warnedRead moreI contacted Justin Moon, who runs a popular underground radio station and record shop in Newcastle. He sources music from record fairs, friends and Bandcamp – distributing interesting sounds as a conduit, or Hermes figure, to lay (or lazy) people like me. Moon is noticing that his customers are searching for a more “active” listening experience. “It’s not this kind of passive wash-over-you rubbish that you make your two-minute noodles to and forget all about 10 seconds later,” he says.Music – like film, TV, and food – is now served to us effortlessly, instantly. But this has caused the way we consume music to be more siloed. Spending a month hunting for new music myself, rather than relying on an algorithm, made me feel more connected to my parents, friends, radio presenters and even complete strangers. Their recommendations – whether to my taste or not – came with a part of themselves, a memory or a shared interest.After my month’s Spotify hiatus, my algorithm hasn’t been cleansed. Over the course of writing this piece, my daylist has evolved into “french indietronica swimming pool tuesday afternoon”, whatever that means. There are two Khruangbin songs on there. It’s safe to say I would rather play roulette with the radio.Explore more on these topicsMusic streamingSpotifyDigital music and audioRadio industryPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fresh from intimidating ABC and CBS withmeritless lawsuits,Donald TrumpissuingRupert Murdoch and the Wall Street Journal reporters who broke thestoryof a lewd birthday message forJeffrey Epstein. But, unlike with the frivolous allegations against the big broadcasters, there’s clearly a fact of the matter here: an authentic letter either exists or it does not; and there is plenty to be revealed in the process of finding out. Trump’s time-proven move – whatever happens, just counter-attack – is likely to keep the very story he wants to kill alive. Meanwhile, the other elements of his playbook – deny, deflect, distract – only work if journalists and Democrats play along. They, not the seemingly all-important Trump base, are the actors to watch.We still debate whether Trumpism is a substantial ideology or not; what we are missing is that Trumpism, for sure, is a set of tactics for exploiting weaknesses in the US political, legal and media systems. Some of these tactics were inheritedfrom his mentor Roy Cohnand many are now being adopted by Trump’s followers – one must never admit guilt; one must always swing back; and one must reject, or ideally entirely bury, defeats (such as Trump’s case against Bob Woodward and Woodward’s publisher beingdismissedrecently).Trump worked to kill a story about his friendship with Epstein. Now we know why | Margaret SullivanRead moreBut there is also a less obvious element, and it has to do with managing political time (achallengefor all politicians, come to think of it). The point is not just seizing opportunities or exploiting opponents’ weaknesses in a timely manner; rather, it is about the art of speeding things up or slowing them down to one’s advantage. Think of how we appear to have become inured to Trump doing and saying things that would have ended previous presidencies (OK, previous presidents did not haveAI-generated imagesof themselves as kings or popes available, but still).One reason is this: an administration that faces one or two big scandals in a four-year period may well be damaged beyond repair; one that produces three very big scandals a day seems to have nothing to worry about since no one can keep up. It is difficult to stick with one story, as the newest outrage already appears so much bigger (theQatar plane scandalcan feel like it happened years ago). To be sure, not all scandals are consciously produced, but there is little doubt that Trump’s posting an AI-generated clip of Barack Obama being arrested in the White House and identifying Obama as a “ringleader” of election fraud are meant to distract – which is not to deny that they would justify impeachment.While the frequency of scandals is maximized to game the news cycle, the legal system is used to slow things down. Releasing the grand jury testimonies in the Epstein case will take time, if the request is not rejected altogether by courts (as hasalready happened in Florida). Even if they are released, they are unlikely to contain anything relevant about Trump. The calculation is that, a few weeks from now, the files will be forgotten.None of this is to suggest Trump is a master Machiavellian who can manipulate Americans (or even just his base) at will. His approach partly works because institutional and cultural contexts have changed: news cycles are shorter, as are attention spans. His behavior has become progressively normalized – and generalized: shamelessness once unique to him is now in the manual of required GOP conduct (just think of blatant lies about Medicaid). Most important, a free press sticking relentlessly with scandals and ignoring intimidation can no longer be taken for granted; broadcasters in particular have become vulnerable to parent companies putting profits before everything else. Democrats, understandably not wanting to look like they mainly focus on the sordid details of the Epstein story, are tempted to move on and deal with the vaunted “kitchen-table issues”. But it should give them pause that the story is apparently so scary for the other side that Republicans would rathershut down the Housethan deal with it in any shape or form.Trump cannot dispel the ghost of Jeffrey Epstein | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreAre they right to panic? For sure, Trump made a mistake with hissocial media posturging followers to move on, which was the equivalent of “don’t think of an elephant” (while also providing further evidence for theStreisand effect: censorship generates the very attention meant to be avoided). Trump lobbying Murdoch to kill the story will give pause to all still naive enough to think of Republicans as free speech defenders. By now, the fact that releasing only the grand jury testimony is relatively meaningless has sunk in and – never mind the base – what political scientists call “low-information voters” will be left with a lasting impression of a Trump-Epstein connection or at least a chaotic administration. In the lawsuit, Trump has to prove “actual malice” on the part of the newspaper – a difficult hurdle to jump. Unlike with the Russia investigation, Trump himself is the instigator of a lengthy process overshadowing his presidency; unlike with the many investigations between his presidential terms, when his lawyers outran the clock, time is not really on his side. In fact, he might be lucky if the case is dismissed on a technicality –he apparently failed to comply with a Florida lawthat requires giving defendants five days’ notice.Jan-Werner Müller is a Guardian US columnist and a professor of politics at Princeton UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsRupert MurdochWall Street JournalLaw (US)US press and publishingcommentShareReuse this content"

The case for genocide iscompelling, but some governments and members of the public resist acknowledging it. The reason lies in not only Israel’s history as a haven for the Jewish victims of genocide but also an unduly narrow understanding of the meaning of the term, by both the public and the international court of justice (ICJ).Israel benefits from a halo effect associated with the Holocaust. Because the state of Israel was founded in response to the Nazi genocide, it isharder to acceptthat the Israeli government in turn would commit genocide. One obviously does not preclude the other, but Israel benefits from the cognitive dissonance.One would have hoped that a history of genocidal victimhood would yield an appreciation for human rights standards that prohibit oppression, but some leaders seem to have drawn the opposite lesson. They interpret the vow “never again” to mean that anything goes in the name of preventing renewed persecution, even the commission of mass atrocities. Indeed, they weaponize the genocidal past to suppress criticism of their current atrocities.The Guardian view on starvation in Gaza: it will take more than words to halt Israel’s genocide | EditorialRead moreThat was the experience in Rwanda. The genocidal slaughter of some800,000Tutsis in 1994 was stopped by the Tutsi-led Rwanda Patriotic Front, an exile rebel group based in neighboring Uganda. Under the military leadership of Paul Kagame, who went on to become Rwanda’s long-serving president, the RPF executed some30,000Rwandans during and immediately after the genocide.Kagame’s government went on to repeatedlyinvadeneighboring Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire), ostensibly to chase remnants of the genocidal forces that had fled there but, these days, mainly tocapitalizeon Congo’s mineral wealth. An estimated6 millionCongolese have died from the violence and resulting humanitarian crises. Meanwhile, the Rwandan government imprisons critics on the spurious grounds that they are promoting a vaguely defined “genocide ideology”.The Israeli government has followed a similar logic, using increasingly brutal means to crush any perceived threat. Like Kagame, Benjamin Netanyahu and his predecessors have used ostensible self-defense as a pretext for a land grab. Israelisettlementshave gradually cannibalized large portions of the occupied West Bank, and the prime minister is now threatening toforcibly deport2 million Palestinians from Gaza. Meanwhile, the government and its partisans dismiss critics as “antisemitic”.Israel also benefits from a public misconception of what genocide is. TheGenocide Convention, which153states have embraced, prohibits various acts with the intent to destroy a specified group “in whole or in part” as such. The proscribed acts of greatest relevance to Gaza are “killing” or “deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part”.Both the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide were examples of genocide targeting a group “in whole”. After a certain point, the Nazis in Germany and the Hutu extremists in Rwanda tried to kill as many Jews or Tutsis as they could get their hands on. Genocide was the primary purpose.But what does it mean to target a group “in part”? That requirement might be met when the killing is not targeted at every member of a specified group but at enough to accomplish another goal. For example, in 2017 the Myanmar military executed some10,000Rohingya to send730,000Rohingya fleeing for their lives to Bangladesh. Genocide in that case was a means to the end of ethnic cleansing.That is a better way to understand what the Israeli government today is doing in Gaza. Although the Netanyahu government has displayed a shocking indifference to Palestinian civilian life there, it has not tried to kill all Palestinians. Rather, it has killed enough of them, and imposed conditions of starvation and deprivation that are sufficiently severe, to force them to flee, if things go according to plan. The far-right Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have openlyarticulatedthat goal, as hasNetanyahu.There is little doubt that Israel’s actions are sufficient to meet the requirements for genocidal conduct.More than 57,000Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Hamas’s attack of 7 October 2023. A November 2024 study found thatnearly 70%of those killed at the time had been women and children, and clearly many male victims were not combatants either. The number of civilians killed thus far exceeds the8,000killed by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica in 1995, which an international tribunal found to constitutegenocide.Although many of the dead in Gaza were not deliberately killed, their deaths were the product of Israel’sdisregardfor Palestinian civilian life – for example, by devastating Palestinian neighborhoods with enormous2,000-lb bombs, attacking military targets knowing that the civilian toll would bedisproportionately high, or repeatedlykillingstarving Palestinians as they seek food.Meanwhile, Israel has imposed a punishing siege on civilians in Gaza,blockingaccess to food and other necessities for lengthy periods. In addition, at least 70% of the buildings have beenleveled. It confines surviving Gazans to primitivecampsthat it regularlymovesorattacks. And it has destroyed the civilian institutions needed to sustain life in the territory, includinghospitals,schoolsreligious and culturalsites, and entireneighborhoods. These conditions are believed to have contributed toseveral timesthe official death toll in indirect deaths.When the ICJ considers the merits of South Africa’s genocide case against Israel, the key contested issue is likely to be whether Israel has taken these steps with the requisite genocidal intent – does it seek to eradicate Palestinian civilians in whole or in part as such? Some genocidal statements by senior Israeli officials have become notorious. Isaac Herzog, the Israeli president, said about Hamas’s 7 October 2023, attack that “this rhetoric about civilians not aware, not involved” is false because civilians “could have risen up” against Hamas (which is a brutal dictatorship). The former defense minister Yoav Gallant spoke of fighting “human animals” – not, as some claim, referring to only Hamas but in discussing the siege, which affects everyone in Gaza. Netanyahu himself invoked the biblical nation of Amalek, in which God is said to havedemandedthe killing of all “men and women, children and infants”.Yet other Israeli officials in their public utterances hew more closely to legal requirements to spare civilians. So the ICJ will likely also examine whether genocidal intent can be inferred from Israel’s conduct in Gaza. That is where the court’s conservative jurisprudence introduces a complication.In its 2015 decision in Croatia v Serbia, the court ruled that genocidal intent could be inferred from conduct if it “is theonlyinference that can reasonably be drawn from the acts in question”. Because the killing in that case was also committed with the aim of forced displacement, the court ruled it could not give rise to an inference of genocidal intent.As a former IDF soldier and historian of genocide, I was deeply disturbed by my recent visit to IsraelRead moreIgnoring the possibility of two parallel intents – one to commit genocide, another to advance ethnic cleansing – the court’s ruling suggests, anomalously, that the war crime of forced displacement could be adefenseto a charge of genocide. That makes no sense. The issue should be whether a charge is conclusively proved, not whether it is the only criminal activity under way.The ICJ will have a chance to correct its jurisprudence in the Gambia v Myanmar case about the Myanmar military’s attacks on the Rohingya, which should be decided before the Israel case. The court would be well advised to find that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya for the purpose of ethnically cleansing them – that forced mass deportation was a motive, not a defense, for genocide. That would lay the groundwork for a similar ruling against Israel.Why would the ICJ have adopted this rule in the first place? It never explained, so we can only speculate. But its rationale may have rested in part on the view that genocide should be about killing maximally – killing “in whole”, like the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide – rather than killing or creating deadly conditions “in part”, as a means to an end. But that’s not what the Genocide Convention says. And that is not how we should assess Israel’s conduct inGaza. That there is an illicit purpose to Israel’s unspeakable cruelty should not be a defense to the charge of genocide.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs. His book, Righting Wrongs: Three Decades on the Front Lines Battling Abusive Governments, was published byKnopfandAllen Lanein FebruaryThis article was amended on 24 July 2025. An earlier version said the Srebrenica genocide happened in 1994 instead of 1995.Explore more on these topicsGazaOpinionIsrael-Gaza warIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

It will need to do better than thisThu 24 Jul 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 20.33 EDTShareIt was meant to be a cosy conversation about cooking and new motherhood.But BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour took anunexpectedly bleak turnon Thursday morning, when the chef Yasmin Khanturned suddenly tearfulin the middle of promoting her new cookbook, saying she couldn’t talk about her own struggles to breastfeed without mentioning the mothers in Gaza unable to provide for their literally starving babies.It was a striking illustration of how far this medieval horror has broken through, bleeding across the everyday lives even of people who don’t usually follow politics. You don’t have to know anything about the Middle East to understand what those newspaper pictures of emaciated children, with their drawn little faces and heartbreakingly visible ribs, mean. This is what famine looks like, right downto the return of Bob Geldof, begging the world to act just as he did 40 years ago at Live Aid. Except this time it’s no natural disaster, but what the World Health Organization calls aman-made mass starvation: the chillingly avoidable consequence of an aid system forcing people to choose between risking their lives for a bag of flour, or dying for lack of one.View image in fullscreenThe Guardian’s front page, 24 July 2025.Photograph: GuardianMore than 1,000 people have beenkilled by Israeli forceswhile seeking food in Gaza since May,according to the UN. Médecins Sans Frontièressays even its staff, lucky enough still to be earning salaries, arenow going hungry: there’s almost nothing left to buy in the markets. The newswire Agence France-Presse spoke ofwatching helplesslyas its Palestinian freelancers, who have risked everything to get news out of Gaza when foreign journalists can’t get in, become too weak to work. Meanwhile, back in Britain, people who want to see arrests for war crimes read instead aboutclampdowns on pro-Palestine activists. That ministers have been quick to empathise with the frustrations of a very different crowdprotesting at the housingof asylum seekers in hotels merely adds salt to the wounds.Labour MPs are openly desperate now for their government to do something more than issue dramatically worded threats of future action that never quite materialises. Even cabinet ministers are publicly lobbying for the formal recognition of Palestinian statehood while (in the wordsof Wes Streeting,who could easily lose his marginal Ilford North seat over this war) there’s still a Palestine left.Recognition would be a largely symbolic act of solidarity, which in itself would do little to fill hungry bellies in Gaza. But ministers’ problem is that there seems increasingly little reason fornotdoing it now: the longstanding argument that this prize should be saved for the right moment, to help unlock progress towards a two-state solution, made more sense when the two-state dream wasn’t being actively crushed in front of us. But perhaps the real plea here is forKeir Starmerto recognise the country he actually leads.After the horrors of the 7 October 2023 massacre, there was broad acceptance that Israel could not be expected simply to sit back and do nothing. Even a year into what was by then a highly divisive war, YouGov found that more than half of Britons still felt Israel had been justified in going into Gaza. But critically,only 14% feltits use of force there was proportionate. Sympathy has drained away as Israel’s war of self-defence began to resemble first one of vengeance, and then something darker. In language no former Israeli prime minister uses lightly, Ehud Olmert has described a proposal to corral Palestinians into a settlement on the ruins of Rafah and prevent them leaving asin effect a “concentration camp”.More than half of Britonsnow favourfinancial sanctions like those slapped on prominent Russians over Ukraine, or suspending arms sales. These arguments are now mainstream, cross-party – the veteran Tory MPs Kit Malthouse and Edward Leighmade passionate casesin parliament this week for recognising Palestine – and driven not by the kind of creeping antisemitism Starmer was quite right to confront in his own party, but by what people see every morning, scrolling through their phones.British ministers are betting they won’t face justice for complicity over Gaza. It’s a big risk to take | Owen JonesRead moreDavid Lammy’s rhetoric is already about as strong as a foreign secretary’s can get – this week he condemned Israel’s“inhumane” and “dangerous”new aid system, and what he called“settler terrorism”in the West Bank – and many Labour MPs suspect he’d privately like to go further than the sanctions and restrictions on arms sales he listed. But Downing Street is said to be wary of getting ahead of Donald Trump at a crucial stage in ceasefire negotiations (with Israel’s parliament going into summer recess, relieving some pressure on the minority government of its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it’s hoped there is a window for a deal). Britain has always argued that our influence over Israel is best magnified by synchronising efforts with the US, and though the chaos of this White House makes that harder, Trump’s is still the only voice Netanyahu really hears.Yet while everyone prays for that ceasefire deal to be done, a dangerous gap is opening in Britain between parliament and people.A year into power, Starmer is increasingly adept at foreign policy, but much less so at handling the emotive domestic blowback from it. Without seeing the intelligence reports crossing the desk of the home secretary, Yvette Cooper,I wouldn’t second-guess herdecision to proscribe Palestine Actionas a terror group. Abreach of securityat RAF Brize Norton was never going to be taken lightly. But, inevitably, the process of police officers trying to figure out in real time what elderly vicars can or can’t now say in public about Palestine has caused its share of farce and fury. After a retired teacher was arrested for allegedly holding a sign featuring a Private Eye cartoonabout the proscription, West Yorkshire police issued an unusual statement saying they were sorry if he was “unhappy with the circumstances” of his arrest.As with this summer’s other prospective powder keg, the protests building up outside some asylum seeker accommodation, doubtless everyone is learning as they go. There is, however, only so much policing can do to resolve what are really political conflicts, born in both cases of frustration with what both sets of protesters (in their very different ways) see as political failure to act.To hold together all these volatile, mutually hostile parts of a fractured society through a hot and angry summer will be head-spinningly complicated, a daunting ask even for an experienced government. Yet that’s the nature of the job Starmer applied for last July. A year on, we must all hope he is equal to it.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

This government inherited a situation in which too many staff were burnt out, demoralised and simply done in.It’s why one of my first acts as health and social care secretary was to get round the table, end the last resident doctor strikes and provide above inflation pay rises for all NHS staff, including a 22.3% rise for resident doctors (plus another 5.4% this year) – the biggest pay hike across the whole public sector.Since then, I’ve worked closely with NHS staff to deliver record investment and much-needed reforms to the NHS. From getting waiting lists down to hiring 2,000 more GPs, from bringing in new tech and equipment to making staff’s lives easier, to starting the shift from sickness to prevention – we are making real progress.When the prime minister launched our10-year health planearlier this month, NHS staff celebrated it. I knew from the hundreds of staff that were part of our engagement process – from doctors to nurses, health visitors to consultants, porters to midwives – that they were hungry for change. But their optimism, energy and ambition showed just how much we will be able to achieve if we work together, and the exciting future we can build.That is why the decision by theBritish Medical Association’s resident doctors committeeto rush into completely unnecessary strikes is so bitterly disappointing. Not only have we started turning the NHS around, we did it hand-in-hand.The government proposed a range of measures to massively improve the working conditions doctors face – from tackling the costs of mandatory exams, to dealing with exhausting rotations that involve doctors pinging from hospital to hospital, to tackling bottlenecks by bringing in more specialist training places.There was a deal here to be done. Instead, the BMA leadership’s decision to not even consider postponing these strikes will place an enormous burden on their colleagues, and hit the recovery we can all see our health service is making. Not only that, it enormously undermines the entire trade union movement. No trade union in British history has seen its members receive such a steep pay rise only to immediately respond with strikes – even when a majority of their members didn’t even vote to strike. This action is unprecedented, and it is unreasonable.My focus now is on doing everything to minimise harm to patients.This government is doing all it can to minimise the impact on patients from this strike, including trying to keep as much scheduled care as we can on track, as well as urgent and emergency care.The BMA leadership would rather we just cancel those appointments because they don’t recognise that someone with cancer, for example, who has a scheduled operation could end up in a far worse place if surgery is postponed. It is not for them to determine whether they think the bar for patient pain is high enough. This government will prioritise patients and do everything we can to protect them.All the same, these actions won’t just cause disruption, anxiety and patient harm. They are likely to cost a huge amount of money, which the NHS simply can’t afford. Instead of working with us on their conditions to put money back into the pockets of resident doctors, the BMA committee put their fingers in their ears and rushed out to strike.I know from the many resident doctors who have reached out to me, and those I’ve met since I became health and social care secretary, that they feel the BMA’s leaders are out of step not just with patients, but most resident doctors themselves. It is hardly surprising a majority of resident doctors did not vote for this strike.So I am urging resident doctors to not follow the BMA leadership, who I do not believe are representing the best interests of their members, any further down this path as strikes begin on Friday at 7am.Wes Streeting is secretary of state for health and social careDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It’s also implied that such is the transformative power of that love, that most of their other problems (failed cupcake bakery, family farm being sold, gangrenous leg) fade into the background as a result.First jobs, first love and a serve of minimum chips  | Nova WeetmanRead moreThe happy ever after is given to us in a climactic and usually iconic scene that often involves running: Billy Crystal sprinting through the streets of New York to declare his love for Meg Ryan before the ball drops, Hugh Grant driving down one-way London streets to interrupt the press conference to declare his love for Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston inexplicably getting off the plane for David Schwimmer.These scenes have to be huge and dramatic because they have to make us believe that love has overcome all obstacles. It’s this certainty that makes romance narratives so compelling – in an uncertain hell-world, at least we can disappear into a make-believe universe where we know love will always triumph. In the real world, obviously love does exist – but we don’t get the comforting finality of the credits, which tell us that, for these characters, they will be happily in love forever. We get all the uncertainty of being a disgusting real person who needs antibiotics for their rotting leg wound and a prenup.All the best romantic comedies have a big happy ever after ending – which is why it was so annoying when the only thing left to write in my romcom was the climactic ending, and I got unceremoniously broken up with, out of the blue. There’s nothing like having your belongings put into storage, sleeping on your mum and dad’s couch and applying for one-bedroom apartments for you and your dog to really make you believe that not only is a happy ever after a myth but that love might actually be a lie.There’s a unique humiliation in jumping on a Zoom call with your publisher and explaining that you can’t meet your delivery deadline because you’re too heartbroken to write the scene that’s meant to encapsulate the feeling of being in love. There’s nothing like accidentally writing a happily ever after scene so unintentionally depressing that you briefly consider rewriting the rest of the novel to become a sad literary tale about Irish teens who never learned how to be happy and enjoy having emotionally ambiguous sex. It’s one thing to break my heart, but making me miss my deadlines is unforgivable.I didn’t like this limitation I’d discovered in myself – after all, an author’s job is to imagine things, so surely I could imagine the idea of being in love, even if I didn’t feel or believe in it any more.What Kept You? by Raaza Jamshed review – an extraordinary debut full of ritual and poetryRead moreLiterary fiction authors use their imagination to invent a world where it isn’t weird for university lecturers to date their students all the time! Sport memoir writers imagine a world where people care about cricket, and cookbook authors like to imagine that people read all the stuff before the recipe.Fantasy authors imagine things that don’t exist all the time too – dragons, magic, a world before the invention of toilets that doesn’t stink and suck – so surely I could use the awesome powers of my creativity to imagine two boys falling in love and having a climactic smooch? But unfortunately, I found myself stuck on the precipice of an imaginary happy ever after, bitterly wishing I’d written another book about old people solving quaint village murders instead.Ultimately what helped me write my happy ever after was the same delusion that helped me recover from heartbreak and go out and fall head over heels in love again: turning my rock-bottom breakup depression into a necessary part of the narrative. When I realised that you can’t get a happy ever after in a romance book without earning it first through trial and pain. You need to have your rock bottom scene for there to even be a romcom in the first place – Bridget Jones drunk and crashing out about being “old” and alone in her apartment – before she can have her big moment of snogging Mr Darcy in the street with no pants on.Instead of bashing my head against my final scene, I went back and rewrote the beginning of the book, where my character was sad and alone and hopeless – this time with added feeling. That made me remember what fuels our love of a happy ever after romance story – it’s the hope that this moment of sadness will one day end and everything will work out again.All I needed to do was remember that to write a good end to my book, only a little bit late. The gangrenous leg will heal. To justify that big climactic moment of happiness, we had to go through the sadness first – a good lesson for anyone writing a romance book, or recovering from a heartbreak.Patrick Lenton is a writer.

Set against tests and exams, it is seen as a luxury: in fact it is essentialThu 24 Jul 2025 09.15 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareThe greatest failing of Britain’s schools is to teach children to read, write and count, but not to speak. They teach what technology can increasingly do for them, but not what it cannot. A regular complaint of today’s employers is that applicants for jobslack social skillsor work ethic.Pupils are rarely taught how to present themselves, handle arguments or form human relationships. The most basic requirements for entering adulthood are ignored. The one task to which teaching is almost exclusively dedicated – examination – is an activity conducted in total silence. No grown-up job involves answering exam questions. Education only in the “three Rs” is akin to where medicine was in the days of bleeding and leeches.The teaching of oracy, or the use of speech, was launched about 10 years ago by progressive educationists in an attempt to make schooling more relevant. A few charities have promoted it, such as Voice 21 and Impetus, and a few schools promised to teach it. Then, in 2024, came an independent commission on oracy, chaired by Geoff Barton of the Association of School and College Leaders. It reported that the revolution was overdue. Although the national curriculum for England includes the teaching of spoken language as part of English programmes, it is rarely emphasised or made prominent. Speaking ability, group working and class debating should have the same status as reading, literacy and numeracy. Oracy should be “the fourth R”.Just before the commission, the then prime minister, Rishi Sunak, was still burbling about everyonedoing maths until they were 18, as if calculators did not exist. But Keir Starmer grabbed the moment. He declared oracy was “not just a skill for learning, it’s also a skill for life … for working out who you are, for overcoming shyness or disaffection, anxiety or doubt … for opening up to our friends and family.” The Labour leaderpromised thatteaching oracy would be a priority of a Labour government. He had got the point.Or apparently not. Starmer’s remark was one of his familiar off-the-cuff moments. He never repeated the pledge. When the government’s interim curriculum and assessment review was published in March, the word oracy was absent. Instead there was rather a traditional emphasis on imparted knowledge, what Dickens satirised in Hard Times as filling “little pitchers” to the brim. On speaking, it was silent.This week, Starmer was called to account. He received an open letter from oracy campaigners demanding he stick to his pledge. It was signed by former education secretaries Charles Clarke and Estelle Morris, writer Michael Rosen, political pundit Alastair Campbell and 56 otherchampions of the skillof speaking. The writers pleaded with Starmer: “In a world shaped by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, deepening social divides and persistent inequality, the skills of speaking, listening and communicating have never been more urgently needed.” Rosen, a professor of children’s literature, added that “the backbone of language is our talk. It’s the everyday way we make and change relationships, share the events of our lives, hear about other people’s lives.”Young members of my family recently returned from school in California, where the essence of the new education is focused on performing and learning in groups. The teacher’s role is not to lecture but to guide discussion. This is alreadybeing testedin British universities, such as Reading and Bath. I imagine it is anathema to Ofsted as it cannot be measured. When I suggested it, a teacher replied: “Oh, you just want all schools to be like The Apprentice.”The essence of oracy is helping pupils articulate their thoughts to others, to listen and reply with courtesy and intelligence. Pupils at Winchester College used to start each day with a topical class discussion. All schools should do that. The nearest most children might get to hearing a public debate is witnessing idiot shrieking at prime minister’s questions. When I watch the pupils leaving my local comprehensive, they don’t converse. They look at their phones or they shout. AsJonathan Haidt has written, this is seriously bad news.The resistance of Britain’s school system to change is near fanatical. It says in effect that if the three Rs were good enough for Queen Victoria, they must be good enough for children now. The system still loves maths – which is not needed by 95% of job-seekers – because it is easy to measure and for governments to boast about. Even literature is reduced to multiple-choice questions. Every classroom minute must become a statistic and a league table.Everything we now hear about the teenage young is causing alarm. Mental illnessis soaring. So are absenteeism and, worst of all, un-employability. The world of work is irrelevant. School teaching appears trapped in a professional archaism that forbids reform. Class instruction, academic bias, length of terms and exam obsession are immutable. Parents and even pupils responded to the recent curriculum review by pleading for subjects such as “financial education, careers knowledge, and politics and governance”. The pleas were ignored. There will be no GCSEs in the world outside the school gates.As for Starmer, he is more interested in getting 16-year-olds to vote for him than in giving them a modern education. If he was a true radical, he would honour his pledge and get them talking.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsEducationOpinionNational curriculumCurriculumsTeachingSchoolscommentShareReuse this content"

Because even during wartime, some red lines must not be crossedNataliya GumenyukA new law has caused uproar for a reason: it undermines the independence of anti-corruption bodies and is an affront to the peopleThu 24 Jul 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareFor quite some time, foreign colleagues have been asking me about Ukraine’s democracy during wartime. Often these questions assume that political freedoms vanish by default in a country at war. They ask whether protests or critiques of the government are even possible.Ukraine is a democracy at war – and democracy itself is an existential matter. It is precisely what the country is fighting for. My usual answer has been: “The people will know when it’s time to protest.” They will sense when too much power is being concentrated in security services, when parliament’s role is being bypassed, when the prime minister or members of parliament are no longer acting independently. Ukrainians, I would say, will know when red lines are crossed.This week, many decided that such a red line had been crossed.On Tuesday thousands of peoplegathered in Kyiv to protestand call on Volodymyr Zelenskyy to veto legislation they believe undermines the independence of two keyanti-corruption institutions: the national anti-corruption bureau of Ukraine (Nabu) and the specialised anti-corruption prosecutor’s office (Sapo).The protest was largely youthful – many would have been kids during the 2014Revolution of Dignity. Their chants included “Veto the law!” and “No to pressure on independent institutions”. Despite martial law, only two policemen were stationed nearby. The atmosphere was even cheerful. It was by far the largest protest since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022. Similar demonstrations took place in approximately 10 Ukrainian towns.And yet late that very night, Zelenskyy signed the bill into law.What shocked many was not just the content of the legislation but also the speed and manner in which it was pushed through: passed within a day, as an amendment hidden inside unrelated law enforcement reforms, and then signed and published almost immediately.Since the beginning of Russia’s invasion, Ukrainians have demonstrated an extraordinary level of unity and civic responsibility. Citizens also showed renewed faith in the institutions of the state – even those long viewed with suspicion. People were willing to look past imperfections, to suspend criticism, and to focus on survival and victory. That is why there has been no serious internal push for wartime elections, despite foreign commentary. Elections – expensive, risky and constitutionally prohibited during war – are widely understood by Ukrainians to be unfeasible under current conditions. But this is different.This law has become a litmus test of whether public trust in the government can be sustained. And more than that, whether the unwritten social contract – between citizens and the state – still holds.The law adopted by Ukraine’s parliament – formally known as draft law 12414 – includes sweeping changes that fundamentally alter the authority of Ukraine’s anti-corruption bodies. The prosecutor general now holds expanded powers over Nabu and Sapo – including control over investigations, case access and team composition, and the authority to shut down cases or transfer them to other law enforcement bodies.The vote took place just one day after the security service of Ukraine (SBU) conducted searches at Nabu’s offices, and Ukraine’s state bureau of investigation (SBI) filed criminal charges against three Nabu employees over car accidents that occurred in 2021 and 2023. These incidents raised eyebrows for their timing.According to Nabu, the new provisions “effectively destroy the independence of Sapo and place both Nabu and Sapounder the control of the prosecutor general”. The bureau reminded lawmakers that Ukraine’s anti-corruption infrastructure, built in partnership with international allies since 2015, was a key precondition for western financial and political support.As institutions, Nabu and Sapo are not without flaws. Government representatives – both formally and off the record – have raised concerns about politicised investigations, poor coordination with other law enforcement agencies and even alleged infiltration by individuals sympathetic to Russian interests. The quality of investigations has also been criticised. Some probes have dragged on for years without result. Others, including cases against prominent business figures or former officials, have been accused of selective prosecution. There are also persistent rumours that Nabu investigations havetouched individualsclose to Zelenskyy himself.What makes this even more complex is that these institutions are tied to Ukraine’s commitments for EU membership. And yet European integration – while deeply valued by Ukrainians – is no longer something the EU itself appears eager to actively advance. That makes it even easier for outside partners to use moments like this to distance themselves, to quietly say: “Maybe Ukraine isn’t ready after all.”Zelenskyy defends bill stripping anti-corruption bodies’ independence amid protestsRead moreBut the deeper issue is this: none of Ukraine’s law enforcement institutions are ideal – not during wartime, and arguably not before it. But Nabu and Sapo remain the most trusted parts of a law enforcement system long plagued by corruption and impunity. They were created not to be dismantled when they become inconvenient. The protesters are not defending a fantasy of flawless institutions but the principle that reform must not be replaced by control.Protests are likely to continue. The government will have to respond. Yes, there is war. But in a democracy there is a constitutional way forward: the law can be rescinded, amended, debated transparently. This cannot be fixed by one late-night briefing from the head of the security service or the newly appointed prosecutor general – nor by a photo opportunity where Zelenskyystands alongsidethe heads of all law enforcement bodies. It requires real, public consultation.The demonstrators in Kyiv this week are sending a message. If there were questions about what the limits of government power during war should be, they were answered on Tuesday.Nataliya Gumenyuk is a Ukrainian journalist and CEO of the Public Interest Journalism LabExplore more on these topicsUkraineOpinionVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

I don’t know and I’m not sure she does eitherThu 24 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 09.20 EDTShareIt hardly compares for importance with all the cruelties in Gaza or Sudan. But then little else does that at present. It caused barely a ripple on the parochial surface of British politics either. That’s hardly surprising at a time when Downing Street is warning about summer riots. Tellingly, the Daily Telegraph itself could only muster a single front-page paragraph on it on Wednesday, underneath Ozzy Osbourne’s death and the England women’s football extra-time squeaker.Yet Kemi Badenoch’s shadow cabinet reshuffle this week should not be totally dismissed. See it instead as an inadequate recognition of an indisputable problem for any contemporary centre-right party, as well as an incoherent attempt to address it. If the Conservative party is very lucky, the reshuffle could be the start of better times. But it is nowhere near that point today. Right now, the reshuffle counts as the merest glimmer amid the Tory gloom. But a glimmer all the same.The reshuffle’s headline event, in as much as there was one, is the return of James Cleverly to the Conservative frontbench. The official opposition party is, of course, a shadow of what it once was, withonly 120 MPs at the last count, and Cleverly is not quite the political heavyweight he pretends. Yet he came within a whisker of leading the party last October. He also has far more spirit and public recognition than most of his colleagues. He stands for a form of continuity conservatism with what remains of the party’s one nation instincts and pragmatic traditions that brought it such success for so long.He was also, until this week, his party’s most underutilised backbench asset, and potentially the biggest backbench threat to Badenoch’s rocky leadership. Unlike ex-ministers such as Rishi Sunak or Jeremy Hunt, Cleverly also still has a future. It made sense to have him back in the tent. From Badenoch’s perspective, because Cleverly, a seasoned operator, has repeatedly made effective backbench attacks on Labour which should be better made from the frontbench. From Cleverly’s, because he would once again be the most plausible candidate to stop the shadow justice secretary,Robert Jenrick, in the event of yet another Tory leadership contest.If Cleverly is to consolidate that position – which he must do to take momentum away from Jenrick’s efforts to steal Nigel Farage’s clothes – he will need to make an impact in his new role. It helps that housing, where he will now shadow Labour’s Angela Rayner, is an issue on which Cleverly touched – perhaps with private foreknowledge about the reshuffle – in hisIPPR speechthis month. He has strong instincts on housing. He is against nimbyism. He says the party should not be afraid of making the case for new housing to people who already have houses.This points to why Cleverly’s return is important more generally. Unlike Jenrick, he stands against cosying up to Reform UK. In June, speaking to the Conservative Environment Network shortly after Badenoch had ditched the party’s 2050 net zero target – a move widely seen as a bending of the knee to Farage –he insistedthat economic growth and “environmental obligations” must go hand-in-hand.View image in fullscreenKemi Badenoch and James Cleverly visit a housing development in Northwood, Middlesex, on 23 July.Photograph: Lucy North/PAAt the IPPR this month, his central argument was that the Tory party must stop apingReform UKby pretending there are easy answers to difficult problems. The party had to be honest about the need for, and the challenges of, delivery. The key lines in his lecture came at the end: “We don’t need a revolution,” said Cleverly. “We need a restoration – of competence, of delivery, and of trust.”Cleverly’s return therefore raises an important broader question for the Tory party. Is Badenoch’s decision to bring him into the shadow cabinet an attempt to pivot the Conservative party away from the populist right and towards the kind of more traditional centre-right stance that Cleverly embodies?In electoral terms, is it an attempt to move away from a concentration on working-class voters in the so-called red wall of Labour seats where Reform UK has established itself as the main contender? Or does it instead imply a renewed focus on more middle-class voters in the so-called former “blue wall” where Ed Davey’s Liberal Democrats have swept so many Tories aside?This is a big choice for theConservatives– there is none bigger, in fact – and it is therefore important not to oversimplify it. It is not a choice about returning to the past. It is one that involves making judgments about almost everything that the party thinks it stands for in a fast-changing world – including social order, economic prosperity, individual freedom, cultural traditions, competence, global standing and more. It is also a UK variation of a question that simultaneously faces all former centre-right parties in the established democracies, all of which confront similar sets of issues. Only this week, Japanese voters handed out a rare electoral rocking to the centre-right government of the prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba.Plenty of Conservatives have been grappling seriously with these questions. In ajoint projectearlier this year, the Bright Blue thinktank and Germany’s Konrad Adenauer Stiftung came up with a list of 10 priorities for the European centre right. These included an emphasis on shared national identity, simplified regulatory regimes, avoidance of zero-sum thinking, re-established competence, individual responsibility, shared values and customs, civility towards others, the state’s role as carer, support for families, and environmental conservation. None of these is doctrinaire or narrow.Wednesday briefing: ​The Conservative​s ​reshuffle​ in an attempt to ​stay ​relevant ​amid ​poor pollingRead moreUp to now, Badenoch has preferred to avoid such choices. She still seems to believe that moderation is not cool and therefore not effective. She prefers to fight on cultural issues rather than hard policy choices. She presents herself as the embodiment of contrarian cleverness, not as a strategist or problem solver who can run things well – the precise opposite of Cleverly’s own self-presentation. Shefocuses her disdainon white-collar workers in state institutions – a large group of voters the Conservatives have been steadily losing and which her approach does nothing to reverse. She goes out of her way topraise Donald Trump and JD Vance, both of whom are unpopular with UK voters. In reality, one of the smartest things she could do would be to become a Trump critic.If bringing Cleverly back is indeed meant as a pivot to the traditional centre right, then it is an extremely cunningly camouflaged one. Such a shift is not inherently impossible, and the Bright Blue-KAS report shows many ways in which it could be attempted. But it is exceptionally hard to believe in when the party is so battered by defeat and so frightened of Farage. With the Conservatives nowaveraging just 17%in the polls, there is a lot of ground to regain, but no sign under its current leader of any serious strategy for doing so.Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsConservativesOpinionKemi BadenochJames CleverlyHousingRobert JenrickNigel FarageReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Ben Healy’s dazzling Tour de France performances can help catalyse a revivalThu 24 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 13.00 EDTShareThe front pages in Ireland weresplashed with yellowlast week afterBen Healybecame thefirst Irish cyclist in 38 yearsto wear the yellow jersey in the Tour de France. While those who cycle sometimes make a point of separating its two forms – sport and transport – they are deeply interlinked, and bumpy streets on the island of Ireland have played a part in that.In 1888, John Boyd Dunlopdeveloped the pneumatic tyreto help his son cycle around Belfast more comfortably. The technology was first used for racing bicycles and then manufacturedin a factory in central Dublinbefore it was brought into widespread use.The combination of the pneumatic tyre and thesafety bicycleled to a boom in cycling. This new model was the iPhone of bicycles at the time, replacing earlier bikes including the penny farthing with its impractically large front wheel.Having played a crucial role in everything from grocery deliveries tothe 1916 Easter Risingthat put Ireland on the path to independence, bicycles have left their mark on Irish history. One of their most significant impacts has been an increase in social connectivity and less rural isolation.At its Museum of Country Life in County Mayo, the National Museum of Ireland features anexhibition on cyclingand its transformative effect on Irish life, outlining how, by the 1930s, “bicycles became the key mode of transport in every parish in Ireland, dramatically changing the social life of ordinary people”.A number of first-hand accounts are on display, including memories of cycling tens of miles to dance halls. Peggy McLoughlin recalled: “When the dance was over, we headed on our homeward journey on our less-than-roadworthy bicycles. Only a few of us possessed lights, the girls with flash lamps positioned themselves four abreast on the road in front, with the dark unlit beings cycling half hidden in between. At the back, you’d have your fingers crossed that you wouldn’t encounter any Garda.”View image in fullscreenJohn and Tom Doyle cycling on Main Street, Coolaney, County Sligo, in 1982.Photograph: National Museum of IrelandThe long distances people cycled on country roads 70 years ago put today’s cycling debates in perspective. Many claim that bicycles are not practical because of distance, even when the journeys made by car within most towns and cities are much shorter than those that many of our parents or grandparents cycled.But times changed. The Celtic Tiger years brought a different boom: car ownership and usage. By the time of the financial crash in 2008, the number of cars on Irish roads haddoubled in 16 years. The impact on cycling was stark. The number of secondary-school students travelling to school daily by bicycledeclined from a peak of50,648 in 1986 to 6,592 in 2011, a fall of 87%.In the late 1980s, more than 19,000 teenage girls cycled to school. That figure had fallen to only 529 in 2011. By the time the tiger was truly dead,five times as manysecondary-school girls drove themselves to school than cycled. SUVs, thehigh bonnetsof which are a deadly threat to children, have become more common than bicycles at school.But there has been a resurgence in cycling. When I started transporting my youngest child in a cargo bike in Dublin more than a decade ago, it would always turn heads. Now, cargo bikes – which can be seen as a type of indicator species – are not just a common sight in most of Dublin but are regularly spotted in Cork, Limerick and Galway too.On-street bike sharing, which improved public access and awareness of cycling in Dublin, has now spread to towns such as Athlone, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Kilkenny, Mullingar, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tullamore, Westport, Wexford and Wicklow.View image in fullscreenA bicycle rental station in Dublin.Photograph: Aidan Crawley/Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBefore Covid, cycling was already on a gradual rise in the capital, a trend that was boosted by quick-build cycle routes and the protection of some existing cycle lanes with plastic bollards, which received a mixed reception.After this, the latest census in early 2022 showed that despite a significant increase in working from home, all Irish cities recorded a rise in commuting by bike. In Dublin and its suburbs, the proportion of commuters who cycle to work or educationis now 8.3%.It has clearly helped that the last government – a centrist coalition that included the Green party – pumped€360m a yearinto walking and cycling infrastructure between 2020 and this year. The scale of this funding can be seen in context when compared with the UK, where the government allocated£300m for active travelin England in 2025 – spending less money in a country with a far higher population (57 million versus Ireland’s 5 million).But inflation means that €360m doesn’t go as far as it would have done in 2020. And there were other potholes along the way, including the challenge of ramping up projects and the teams to run them around the country, and what campaigners called out asquestionable metricsfor success.Five years on, a number of local authorities are starting to make substantial progress on joining cycle routes together into useful networks. And despite the baseless claims made by online commenters and sometimes by politicians that cycle lanes are empty or underused, there are promising signs that more people are cycling in areas where significant improvements have been made.However, theGreens lost all but oneof their seats in last year’s general election. With mostlyrural independentmembers of parliament replacing them in the governing coalition, will the momentum now be lost? Will funding already spent on planning projects be wasted?Attitudes to cycling are not as polarised inIrelandas in the UK or elsewhere, but opposition to changes on streets and roads, including bus priority and pedestrianisation, is loud. Dealing with objections is a huge part of the job that councils have.There’s a greater culture shock and backlash in some smaller towns, where little has changed in decades. Exaggerated claims about the alleged destruction of the fabric of towns and cities are routine.A recentexamination of entry pointsinto Dublin city centre found that just 6% of them gained notable cycling improvements in the past decade. People who cycle – and those who try it before giving up – often complain about cycle lanes that are too narrow and disconnected. Faster delivery and more focus are needed in many areas to join up routes.Ben Healy won’t be in the top spot when the Tourfinishes on the Champs-Élyséeson Sunday, but he has lit up the greatest bike race in the world with his energy and enthusiasm; something we would do well to carry over into everyday Irish cycling, to make it a truly mass-participation activity again.

As a barrister representing Solomon Islands in the case, I was in the courtroom to hear the judges reshape the global fight for climate justice.The world’s top court resoundingly rejected conservative arguments made by Australia and other high-emitting countries such as the United States, China and Saudi Arabia seeking to justify continued fossil fuel extraction. Instead, the court made a slew of progressive statements – ones that will have far-reaching implications.Under international law, countries are now bound to rapidly reduce their emissions below 1.5 degrees of warming. Failure to do so could result in developed countries like Australia having to pay monetary compensation to developing countries or being required to rebuild infrastructure and restore ecosystems damaged by climate change. This means we could be entering a new era of climate reparations.Nations who fail to curb fossil fuels could be ordered to pay reparations, top UN court rulesRead moreThis is a watershed moment in the global environmental movement. In a breakthrough for climate campaigners, the court specifically targeted the fossil fuel industry in its ruling and held that countries failing to take action to protect the environment from greenhouse gases – including from fossil fuel production, consumption, exploration licences or subsidies – may commit an “internationally wrongful act.” With today’s decision, that can now be punished under international law.So what implications does this have for Australia? Australia is looking tohost COP31 next yearand stands on the brink of releasing its updated 2035 emissions reduction target in coming months. As it does so, it may have to change its legislation and policies to rapidly curb the emissions of companies in its jurisdiction.First, the ruling puts pressure on the Albanese government to increase its ambitions for emissions reduction. The court made clear that countries must set goals under the Paris agreement which align with the 1.5C temperature target.Climate Action Trackerhas found that for Australia to carry its fair share of the global emissions reduction burden, it should reduce its emissions by 76% by 2035 against a 2005 baseline.This aligns with the upper range of possible targetsidentified by the Climate Change Authority, which has suggested an emissions target between 65% and 75% by 2035. In light of the ICJ decision, a failure to set a target close to 75% is likely to come under legal or political challenge by other countries and domestic campaigners.Second, to comply with its international obligations, Australia will have to curb its production and use of fossil fuels. Despite its tough talk on climate change, the Albanese governmenthas continued to approvecoal, oil and gas projects at an alarming rate. In recent months the government has approved the extension of Woodside’scontroversial North West Shelf development, a massive gas project which will operate to 2070 and emit an enormous87.9m tonnes of carbon dioxideequivalent each year.If Australia secures the hosting rights to COP31 it will come under intense pressure from its neighbours in the Pacific to live up to its rhetoric and rapidly transition away from fossil fuels.Third, and most importantly, today’s ruling means that Australia could pay climate reparations in the future. Developing countries may bring claims against Australia seeking damages. As a high-emitting developed country and one of the largest exporters of coal, oil and gas in the world, Australia has both the historical responsibility for climate change and the means to pay other nations for compensation and restitution.While the scale of any reparations will depend on the amount of damage suffered by the country bringing the claim, the breadth of climate change impacts mean that Australia and other countries could be faced with very high-value cases.Money is a strong motivator. The world court’s decision today means that the threat of reparations can now be used to compel action from the worst, most stubborn climate offenders – Australia included. That is transformative for climate lawyers, giving us a powerful tool to pressure governments and corporations to acknowledge the realities of our warming planet.But it is a victory for everyone – a clear statement that the status quo isn’t sufficient. We must act now to confront the climate crisis. And in a moment when hope feels hard to come by, that’s very good news indeed.Harj Narulla is a barrister and leading global expert on climate litigation at Doughty Street Chambers and the University of Oxford.

Now it’s time for them to speak frankly about dyingSarah MacdonaldThe generation who redefined what it means to be young can give their children a priceless gift – their clear wishes for end-of-life careWed 23 Jul 2025 21.16 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 21.39 EDTShareSitting looking over a sparkling river, my 92-year-old mother and I were chatting about little things. The lovely day, the need for a dry-cleaning drop and kookaburras. Then she pointed at a blond beach bend and said, “Scatter me there when I’m dead.” I responded, “It’s a beautiful spot, Mum – do you want some cake?”I was not being glib in this confronting conversation. It was afternoon teatime and this is how my family do chats; we go from cake to carking it. We combine the big, the small and the space beyond. Besides, I already knew that’s where she wanted to end up.We’ve always been a family who goes there. Including on the two big topics of life – sex and death. There was no big “sex talk” at adolescence. No sitting us down, squirming with embarrassment and launching into the whole “when a couple really love each other”. There was instead matter-of-fact information given in cake-sized chunks, questions answered in age-appropriate ways and increments of information that built up over the years.This is now how parents are advised to have the sex talk. Don’t make it a big deal, answer curiosity with candour and use concepts and language that are suited to that child’s level of intellectual development.And this is how I’d like to recommend we have the ageing and death talk.Introduced carefully, in small chunks, in age-appropriate ways. Avoiding these conversations won’t cause teen pregnancies and disease but it will lead to a great deal of stress, anguish and a complication of grief for families.The baby boomers redefined what it meant to be young. Their generation came of age at a time of endless possibilities, explored sex, drugs and rock’n’roll and got to tune in, drop out, then seize power. But while they have won a lot in the lottery of life, they won’t be able to defeat ageing and death.I’m hoping they can face the inevitable with the same passion to do things differently. The oldest boomers are in their late 70s. In 2032 it’s estimated62,000 of them in Australiawill turn 85. That’s five times more than turned that age last year.Fertility rates have fallenand life expectancy is rising. The opposite of the baby boom is the ageing, illness, dependency and death boom and our hospitals, our healthcare and our psyches are not prepared for it at all. It’s going to hurt.Boomers were perhaps the first generation to come up with birth plans for having babies. Now they need to start making aged care and death plans – and they need to start now.An initial chat could start at 70 with something like “when a couple really love each other and their kids they … reveal they have decided to downsize to a single-storey townhouse with no garden”.At 80 give your thoughts about whether you want to be force fed if you end up with dementia in an aged care home. At 85 the greatest gift you can give your child is a meaningful plan about what’s important in terms of care and interventions you would want in hospital.These conversations won’t jinx you, they won’t make you age faster – they will actually help your child age slower. Because the stress of having to push parents towards decisions and realities is psychologically bruising, and it ultimately often comes down to one son or daughter. And they’re struggling right now.She’s the middle-aged woman you may see crying in frustration at the counter in Centrelink. She’s the sixtysomething stressed at work because after a long day she’s still got go drop food, pick up washing and do shopping for her ninetysomething mum. He’s the guy who gets pushed out of a job because he missed two big meetings when his mum went back into hospital for the fifth time this year.I’ve been the primary carer for my mother and previously Mum and Dad for more than a decade. It’s demanding, stressful and requires endless diplomacy. It’s also emotionally exhausting. Eight years on from selling the family home I still wake up in a panic when it rains too much because I fear the roof will be leaking. But I’ve been lucky. I know what my parents wanted in life and death. We’d had the “death talk”. We’d also had the aged care facility talk many times.Some conversations are hard. But without them decisions will be made for you.And leaving things unsaid – and unfaced – is unfair.So, beautiful boomers. Sit down that child you once sat down for the sex talk. Take a deep breath. And tell them what you’re thinking about the unthinkable.Sarah Macdonald is a writer, broadcaster, an advocate for the sandwich generation and an ambassador for Violet organisationExplore more on these topicsDeath and dyingOpinionAgeingFamilyParents and parentingHealth (Australia news)Health (Society)Aged carecommentShareReuse this content"

That’s not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainableThu 24 Jul 2025 13.53 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareThis year’s global wealth report by the City bankUBSconfirms what is self-evident but rarely confronted: while riches are accumulating, their distribution remains starkly unbalanced. In the 56 countries and economic areas surveyed, the report says global personal wealth grew 4.6% in 2024. However, not all boats have been lifted by this tide. The gap is growing between those who hold assets and those who don’t.The figures are shocking: just 60m of the world’s adults – 1.6% of the population – have net personal wealth of $226tn, or 48.1% of all the world’s riches. At the other extreme, four in 10 adults – 1.57bn people – have only $2.7tn, or just 0.6% of all the world’s personal wealth. Economists nowarguethatinequalityis no longer a by-product of growth but a condition of it.In the US, soaringbondmarkets andtech stockshave benefited the ultra-rich and deepened inequality. Nine households, it wasreported, control 15% of wealth in Silicon Valley. By contrast, UBS says British median wealth rose while average wealth fell. This is a rare divergence, probably caused by prosperous households inLondontaking a hit from interest rate hikes as house prices dropped and debt costs rose. This wasn’t a sign of shared prosperity but of paper losses at the top, while ordinary workers held steady.Unlike wages,wealthreflects not just income but also access to assets, favourable institutional conditions – such as low interest rates – and public policies like low taxes and housing shortages. In other words, wealth depends on political choices in ways that income currently does not. It’s not just the inequality itself that is the issue but the erosion of mechanisms that once constrained it. As the report notes, wealth and income inequality are linked. But where wages have stagnated andcollective bargaininghas weakened, capital income – derived from profits, rents and interest – has been boosted by design.Productivity gains, once expected to feed through to broader living standards, now primarily serve to enhance returns to wealth.Taxes on wealth are necessary to make societies more equal. Unfairness is aiding far-right autocrats whose rise brings the risk of democraticcollapse. In July seven Nobel laureates issued apowerfulcall for a minimum tax on the ultra-rich.Brazil, Spain and South Africahave demanded a global tax on the super-rich, placing the issue on the G20 agenda. Pioneering work byeconomistssuch as Gabriel Zucman and Emmanuel Saez led to the French national assemblypassing a lawthis year for a 2% minimum tax on wealth over €100m. The legislation, regrettably, has notproceededpast the senate.Progressive taxation is necessary, but it doesn’t address a core problem in many economies: when capital income outpaces labour income, redistribution may ease the symptoms of neoliberalism, but it leaves the underlying condition untreated. High inequality suppresses consumption,deters investment and slows growth. The gap between rich and poor is not just unfair – it’s economically unsustainable. Without strong domestic demand, economies increasingly rely ondebt, speculation and asset bubblesto fuel growth.Changing this would take more than fiscal transfers. It would require policies that boost wages: full employment, stronger labour unions and public investment. Privateownershipitself may need to be reconceived – less perhaps in the sense of expropriation, and more in terms of widening access to productive assets and social wealth.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

After the death of her partner, she says: ‘I need it more than anybody’Thu 24 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareOn stage at Nashville Pride festival on a sweltering June afternoon, Big Freedia is her usual boisterously commanding self. She invites volunteers and the sign-language interpreter to join her and her dancers in getting down to bounce music, the relentlessly kinetic style of hip-hop for which she has become a figurehead in her nativeNew Orleans. Then she pauses for a brief heart-to-heart with the audience. “I don’t know if y’all know this, but I started in the church,” she says.Big Freedia’s forthcoming album, Pressing Onward, is a gospel record and she is keen to stress that she isn’t abandoning her core audience. The gay, gender-fluid rapper and reality TV star exhorts every kind of body to shake it and is unequivocal about her support for all marginalised people; her reputation led Beyoncé and Drake to sample her on some of their most successful tracks. “This album is for us,” she emphasises. “It is for people who are LGBTQ and who love God.”When the beat of a new song, Take My Hand, kicks into double time, just the way a sanctified rhythm section would in church, she brings gospel catharsis to queer people in the same southern state wherethe US supreme court recently upheld a ban on transgender youth healthcare, at a time when LGBTQ+ progress across the US is meeting with forceful religious pushback.The week after, Big Freedia logs on to our video call to talk gospel. “It’s already an ass revival when they come to a Big Freedia show,” she says, referring to the mass twerking her shows inspire. “And now they’re coming to a Big Freedia gospel revival.”View image in fullscreen‘There is no judgment’ … performing at Nashville Pride.Photograph: Tibrina Hobson/Getty ImagesIn one sense, it’s a superficial distinction. Back in the church choir of Big Freedia’s youth, she moved people to ecstatic dance: “We would have lots of clapping, stomping of the feet, choreographed dancing that we would do in our robes.” The young singer, who back then could hit soprano range, showed such dedication and promise that the choir’s director made her their assistant. By high school, Big Freedia was leading ensembles and envisioned that as her future. “I thought I was going to be a famous choir director and that I was gonna be singing with choirs all around the world.”Big Freedia says she grew up feeling welcomed by the working-class Black Baptist congregation that knew her as Freddie Ross Jr – so much so that she used its name as the title of her new album. “From the first time I walked in the doors, they put their arms around me and gave me the biggest hug,” she says. “And they knew I was a young gay boy. I was loud and proud, even as a kid. We didn’t have those moments of the pastor talking about: ‘God doesn’t love gay folks.’ God loved us all.”She was also becoming part of a circle of rappers that were making boastful, bass-heavy New Orleans club music a vehicle for their party-starting queer and gender-expansive personae. The bounce scene beckoned. Big Freedia received assurance from her mum and other church folk that pursuing it wouldn’t be sacrilegious, as long as she maintained her relationship with God – and she lets it be known, loudly and often, that she has. Before she took the stage at Pride, her team huddled and someone offered a prayer: “God give Freedia the supernatural strength, in the name of Jesus, from the top of her head to the soles of her feet.”‘This album is for the world’ … Big Freedia and Billy Porter performing Holy Shuffle at SummerStage in Brooklyn this month.Big Freedia certainly isn’t the first member of the LGBTQ+ community to contribute to the gospel canon. That lineage might be more widely acknowledged if generations of the music’s pioneers hadn’t been required to live closeted lives. “Once you start historicising, you figure out that so much of what is sung in churches was created by, and continues to be created by, queer folks,” says Ashon Crawley, a religious studies scholar and cultural critic who draws on insight he gained as a young, Black, queer Pentecostal church musician.In her youth, Big Freedia recorded with the New Orleans Gospel Soul Children choir, but she had never contemplated her own gospel project until a 2024 session yielded the spiritually ebullient dance track Celebration. “God put it on my heart that this is what I need to do,” she says. Big Freedia made clear to potential co-writers that she still wanted her audacious swagger and compassion to come through and that she wasn’t out to convert anyone. “I’m representing for the LGBTQ community,” she told them. “So when they come here, the door is bust wide open and there is no judgment and you have this moment to lose it in the spirit.”Parson James, a Nashville-based pop artist who is queer and biracial, helped her craft some of the hooks. He had dealt with the homophobia of his small-town South Carolina congregation by distancing himself from the church and its music, so he was wary of returning to gospel, but he put his trust in Big Freedia’s intentions. “Doing it with someone who’s so confident – you can’t tell her shit – it just was amazing.”‘The 21st century is queer. Accept it’: the Harlem Gospel Travelers on prejudice in the church – and singing for Joe BidenRead morePressing Onward has ample pop accessibility: over an 808 drum machine, Sunday Best blends hip-hop fashion flexes and brags about Black church finery. But the album is also lifted by unmistakable gospel elements: warm, reverberant eruptions of Hammond B3 organ; the taut, powerful unison of mass choir singing. Crawley sees Big Freedia’s reclamation of these traditions as potentially subversive. “It demonstrates to the church: your excluding of us doesn’t have to be the end of our story; we find community with one another in ways that you both taught us how to do and in ways you could not anticipate. So perhaps you should pay more attention to the very thing that you have excluded.”Big Freedia initially planned to release Pressing Onward in June’s Pride month, but in May her longtime partner, Devon Hurst, died unexpectedly of diabetes complications. She insisted on directing the choir at his funeral. The day before our interview, she closed on the house they had planned to buy together. “My whole life has just changed within this last month,” she says. “It has been an emotional rollercoaster, all the things that me and him had planned and the things we were doing and working on. And now I’m doing all these things by myself.”Even in her profound grief, she was willing to push the album release back only by a month. “I need it more than anybody,” she says. “And I know if I need it, there’s other people out there in the world that need it. There’s always someone who’s depressed or going through a hard time. There is always someone who’s fighting who they are, or fighting against a community of people that don’t accept who they are. This album is not just for me – it’s for the world.”Pressing Onward is released via Queen Diva Music on 8 AugustExplore more on these topicsMusicRapNew OrleansLGBTQ+ rightsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

We pay tribute ahead of his milestone birthdayAndrew ShentonThu 24 Jul 2025 09.58 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 15.37 EDTShareIn many ways Arvo Pärt and John Williams’s music couldn’t be further apart. One celebrates simplicity, purity, and draws much of its inspiration from sacred texts; the other captures strong emotions in sweeping orchestral scores. And yet the two men are today’s most performed contemporary composers. Bachtrack’s annual survey of classical music performed across the world placed Pärt second (John Williams is in the top spot) in2023and2024. In2022, Pärt was first, Williams second. This year, Pärt might return to No 1 as concert halls and festivals worldwide celebrate his 90th birthday, on 11 September.Unlike many of his contemporaries, Pärt has found a way to speak across boundaries of culture, creed and generation. In the world of contemporary classical music, where complexity and empty virtuosityoften dominate, Pärt stands apart. His music eschews spectacle in favour of silence, simplicity and spiritual depth. Pärt has outlasted political regimes, artistic fashions and shifting trends in composition, yet his work remains strikingly relevant. In a cultural moment saturated with information and spectacle, Pärt offers something almost universally appealing. As the commentator Alex Ross observed in a2002 New Yorker article, Pärt has “put his finger on something almost impossible to put into words, something to do with the power of music to obliterate the rigidities of space and time [and] silence the noise of self, binding the mind to an eternal present.”Pärt’s early career unfolded under Soviet rule, which shaped much of his emerging artistic trajectory. Trained at Tallinn Conservatory in Estonia, he began composing in a modernist idiom, experimenting with serialism and collage techniques in the 1960s – often to the dismay of Soviet authorities who sought artistic control over the creative process.Works such asNekrolog(1960), the first 12-tone piece written in Estonia, and the avant gardeCredo(1968), which juxtaposed Bach with a compendium of avant-garde techniques and incorporated overt Christian themes, drew the ire of censors. The banning of Credo marked a pivotal moment: Pärt fell into a period of near-total withdrawal from composition during which he immersed himself in Gregorian chant, Renaissance polyphony and early Orthodox music.View image in fullscreenAdam’s Passion, a music theatre piece by Arvo Pärt and Robert Wilson, in a staging in 2015 at the Noblessner Foundry in Tallinn, Estonia.Photograph: robertwilson.comAnd, out of this silence emerged a new voice – a radically simplified and spiritually charged idiom he calls tintinnabuli, derived from the Latin for “little bells”. This technique, first heard in the three-minute piano pieceFür Alina(1976), pairs a melodic voice (often stepwise and chant-like) with a harmonic voice that is limited to the notes of a tonic triad (the first, third and fifth notes of a major or minor scale). Pärt considers the two lines to be a single sound, as in the formula suggested by his wife, Nora: 1+1=1. The effect is ethereal and introspective, at once ancient and modern. Pärt’s tintinnabuli is not so much a system, but more of an attitude: a way of stripping music down to its essence in order to open a space for contemplation.In 1980, Pärt left Estonia with his family, first settling in Vienna and later in Berlin. Freed from the strictures of Soviet censorship, he began to compose larger and more overtly sacred works, often usingLatin or Church Slavonic texts. Major compositions such as Tabula Rasa (1977), Passio (1982), Te Deum (1984), and Miserere (1989) established him as a unique voice in late 20th-century music.These works exemplify how Pärt fused early sacred music traditions with his minimalist aesthetic to create a form of modern devotional music that speaks to both religious and secular audiences.For Pärt, faith is not a subject – it is the wellspring of his art. “Some 30 years ago,” he said in a 2007 speech as he accepted an honorary doctorate in theology from the University of Freiburg, “I was in my great desperation ready to ask anyone how a composer ought to write music. I met a street-sweeper who gave me a remarkable reply. ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘the composer would probably need to love each and every sound.’ This was a turning point. This self-evident truth completely surprised my soul, which was thirsting for God. From then on, my musical thoughts began to move in an entirely new direction. Nothing was the same any more.”Though often described as a “holy minimalist” (a term Pärt does not like since he considers it meaningless),his work resists easy categorisation. Unlike the pulsating energy of American minimalists such as Steve Reich or Philip Glass, Pärt’s music seeks a state of prayerfulness. “I have discovered,” he once said, “that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a moment of silence, comforts me.”View image in fullscreenThe London Sinfonietta and Royal Academy of Music perform Pärt’s Homage to Anish Kapoor and his sculpture Marysas in 2003 at the Tate Modern, London.Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/PAThere are also secular works inspired by art and architecture. Silhouette (2009), for example, is a short dance-like piece for string orchestra and percussion based on the elegant structural design of the Eiffel Tower, and his quasi-piano concerto, Lamentate (2002) was commissioned by London’s Tate Modern and was inspired by the enormous sculptureMarsyas by Anish Kapoor.His influence extends far beyond classical music. Artists such as Björk and Radiohead have cited him as an inspiration. Film-makers such as Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, 2007) and Joss Whedon (Avengers: Age of Ultron, 2015) have used his music to underscore moments of existential weight and grace. And, in recent years, cover versions of his music abound. The little piano piece Für Alina, for example, has spawned hundreds of covers from artists as diverse as jazz guitarist Pat Metheny, US ambient musicianRafael Anton Irisarri, and a YouTuber known as “euwbah”who improvises on the piece using a cross-platform microtonal seaboard patcher (a computer program that allows the use of a keyboard to generate microtonal pitches).Pärt has not composed much in the past decade or so because of his advanced age, but a late-night Prom on 31 July – billed as a birthday tribute – is an opportunity to catch the UK premiere of his most recent work, Für Jan van Eyck (commissioned in 2020 by the city of Ghent to celebrate the restoration of the famous Van Eyck altarpiece) for mixed choir and organ.The programme – performed by acclaimed Pärt interpreters Tõnu Kaljuste and the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir – also complements his music with short choral works by composers he loves: Bach, Rachmaninov, fellow Estonian composer Veljo Tormis and the Ukrainian composer Galina Grigorjeva. The celebrations continue into the autumn where a series at the Barbican in London includes an interesting take on Pärt’s music in a concert on 26 November which is “refracted” through the lens of DJ Koreless and composers Sasha Scott and Oilver Coates, pointing again to the esteem for this music felt by other creators.Pärt with Pope Benedict XVI in 2011.Photograph: Vatican press officePärt’s popularity has not diluted the intensity of his vision. If anything, it underscores the hunger many feel for what his music offers: a refuge from noise, a space for reflection, a sonic form of grace. “The author John Updike once said that he tries to work with the same calmness like the craftsmen of the middle ages who decorated the hidden sides of the pews with their carvings, although no one would be able to see them. I try, as much as I can, to live by the same principle,” he said in a rareinterview in 2020.In an age of distraction and crisis, Pärt’s work invites listeners into an intimate encounter with stillness. It is not escapism, but focused attention – music that opens the soul to something beyond itself. In an age increasingly defined by noise, he offers us silence not as absence, but as invitation. At 90, his music still speaks – softly, clearly, and with unwavering grace, and is always worth a listen.Arvo Pärt at 90 is at thelate-night Prom on 31 July; Tabula Rasa is part of theProms@Bristol Beaconconcert on 23 August. The Barbican London’sArvo Pärt at 90 seriesruns from 3 October to 26 November.Andrew Shentonis a cultural critic and musician based in Boston, MA.

Its lack of easy answers feels exactly rightLucy ManganThu 24 Jul 2025 17.45 EDTLast modified on Thu 24 Jul 2025 18.22 EDTShare“We pray for it every day, but it’s man’s will that gets done, not God’s.” Thus speaks a former nun, pretty much an emblematic character of a Jimmy McGovern drama, delivering an emblematic line. McGovern has always been a chronicler of pressing social issues, from police incompetence and corruption (Hillsborough) to government failures and cover-ups (Sunday, Reg), class struggle (Dockers), disability (Go Now),religious hypocrisy(Priest, Broken), violence (Anthony, Time) and the brokenness of systems supposedly set upto help our most vulnerable(Care).But whatever the issue under examination and – usually – excoriation, there is the profounder concern of how far from grace we have fallen. From there, McGovern asks: what would it take for us to rise again?His latest creation, Unforgivable, takes child sexual abuse as its subject. McGovern has brought together trusted members of, in effect, the repertory company he has gathered over the years – includingAnnas Frieland Maxwell Martin – to tell the story of an ordinary family trying to cope with the aftermath of a terrible act; the abuse of a young teenager, Tom (Austin Haynes), by his uncle Joe (Bobby Schofield, playing the character as unmonstrously as he is written, making his actions and the ramifications all the more awful for it).Tom is now getting into trouble at school and is virtually mute, answering only yes or no to direct questions, and Joe is about to be released from his short spell in prison. Tom’s mother – Joe’s sister – Anna(Friel, in an absolutely wonderful performance)is a mass of rage, despair and shock, with no time to process any of it as she fights to keep her job, her inevitably neglected other son out of trouble and Tom from descending further into mental ill health.Anna and Joe’s mother dies soon after the story begins and the first moral quandary arises – should he be allowed to attend her funeral? Would she – the only family member to visit him in prison – have wanted it? Their father, Brian (David Threlfall), forbids Joe to come. When Anna later bumps into Joe in the cemetery, in breach of his licence, she reports him to his parole officer, who redraws the boundaries of the exclusion zone rather than recall him to prison. What would you have done?View image in fullscreenBobby Schofield as Joe and Anna Maxwell Martin as Katherine in Unforgivable.Photograph: Kerry Spicer/BBC/LA ProductionsSmall questions pave the way for larger ones. Where do you stand on the fact that, as Anna points out in fury, Joe has had access to copious amounts of therapy in prison and now lives in a special halfway-house-cum-rehab-facility, run by a former nun, Katherine (Maxwell Martin), while Tom has had nothing? McGovern’s work is always grounded in detail, especially that relating to systemic inadequacies; we sit with Anna through the GP’s explanation that there is a 21-week waiting list for even “the worst” children to be seen. It takes a suicide attempt to get Tom even that far.When it emerges that Joe was abused at the same age as Tom it is not a plot twist designed to sway our sympathiesEventually, we move to the question inherent in the title: can Joe be forgiven? How much weight do we give his assertions of self-loathing? Should we feel touched by his apparent remorse? Should Anna? How much should Brian let love for his son govern his actions when the rest of his family has been devastated?‘There’s nothing here I did not see inside’ – a former HMP inmate on TimeRead moreWhen it emerges that Joe was abused at the same age as Tom, it is not a plot twist to sway our sympathies – McGovern is an unsentimental and unmanipulative writer – but to force us to think more deeply. Does it make him less culpable for his actions? Or more damnable, because he knew the effect one act can have on a life? His abuser also harmed others who did not perpetuate the cycle, so what do we do with that knowledge? Space is left for any conclusion. None of us knows God’s will, whether you believe in him or not.Unforgivable has none of the agitprop that can creep into McGovern’s always impassioned work and there are faultless performances throughout, including from Mark Womack, a sleeper agent of an actor who delivers invariably to mesmeric effect. It is an altogether richer, more subtle and more sophisticated creation than, say,Adolescence, to which it is likely to be compared; as such, it is unlikely to be adopted as a pseudo policy document by the government.More’s the pity. It has an immeasurable sorrow at its heart and offers no answers. It leaves you feeling that this is exactly as it should be; exactly as it must be.Unforgivable aired on BBC Two and is available on BBC iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewDavid ThrelfallAnna Maxwell MartinreviewsShareReuse this content"

Thanks to its decision topay Donald Trump $16m rather than fight a lawsuitthat many predicted it would win – a move that happened just as they needed federal approval of an $8bn merger – all hell has broken loose.Stephen Colbert (whose Late Show airs on Paramount-owned CBS) called the settlement a “big fat bribe”, precipitatingthe cancellation of his show. In response, Jon Stewart (whose Daily Show airs on Paramount-owned Comedy Central) aired a segment in which he and a gospel choir led the studio audience through a repeated chant of “fuck you” directed at his paymasters. And now, in what might just be the worst possible timing for both Paramount and Trump, South Park is back.Considering thatSouth Parkhas always been known for its unvarnished satire, and for an extraordinarily responsive production process that allows it to comment on events almost until the moment of broadcast, the first episode of its 27th season always had the potential to sting. And since that first episode – entitled Sermon on the ’Mount – is a scorching critique of both Paramount’s cowardice and Trump’s eagerness to ride roughshod over his own voters, sting it does. Trump himself is a character, as is his talking micropenis. Even for a show like South Park, which has often been defined by its anger, this may well go down as its most furious ever.The episode’s plot, such as it is, involves Cartman becoming distraught atTrump’s cancellation of funding for public broadcaster NPR, which he only listens to because he finds its wokeness hilarious. “The government can’t cancel a show,” he rails early on. “I mean, what show are they going to cancel next?”Very quickly answering its own question, we then meet South Park’s version ofDonald Trump. Presented – in terms of voice, behaviour and animation style – identically to Saddam Hussein in the South Park movie, the show’s Trump brashly parrots the phrase “Relax, guy” to anyone who takes issue with him, and is regularly seen in bed with Satan. He also keeps suing everybody, and removing his trousers to show off his tiny penis. In total, we see Trump’s penis five times throughout the episode. Once is photorealistic, but we’ll get to that.View image in fullscreen‘Scorching critique’ … South Park Sermon on the MountPhotograph: Comedy CentralTrump is there to try to placate the residents of South Park, who are angry that the person they voted for has become a self-interested dictator who probably appeared in the Epstein files. In perhaps the best joke of the episode, the town’s protests are covered by 60 Minutes (the show that caused Trump to sue Paramount), by hosts nervous that anything they say will spark more presidential lawsuits. “Oh boy, oh shit, oh God,” they keep mumbling, over an image of a ticking timebomb.Then Jesus (last meaningfully seen on the show doing cocaine with Santa back in 2019) speaks to the residents. Having returned to fulfil the president’s wishes to bring Christianity back to education, Jesus urges everyone not to upset Trump further. “You guys saw what happened to CBS,” he whispered. “You really want to end up like Colbert? Just shut up or we’re going to be cancelled. If someone has the power of the presidency, and also has the power to sue and take bribes, then he can do anything to anyone.”View image in fullscreen‘Just shut up or we’re going to be cancelled.’Photograph: Comedy CentralSpooked by the sermon, the South Park residents decide that the only way to survive is to pump out a stream of pro-Trump messaging. Thus, the final moments of the show are given over to a short film of a realistic deepfake Trump staggering through the desert as he removes his clothes. Collapsing on to the sand naked, Trump looks down at his penis, which (since it has eyes and a mouth) says, “I’m Donald J Trump and I approve this message.” A voiceover intones: “His penis is teeny tiny, but his love for us is large.” End of episode.In other words, Sermon on the ’Mount is a grand dare. If Trump could get $16m by suing Paramount over an editorially acceptable edit on a news programme, then it stands to reason that he will try to go after a cartoon that depicts him trying to insert his microscopic penis into Satan. And if he does sue, will Paramount risk destroying its already damaged reputation by capitulating yet again?There’s plenty of nuance to this battle, not least the fact that the programme’s creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, have just signed a $1.5bn contract with Paramount+, ensuring that it will exclusively stream South Park for the next five years, but the battle lines have been drawn. Paramount finds itself caught in yet another bind. If push comes to shove, who will it side with: a president who might block its $8bn merger out of spite, or its most aggressively provocative show? The way things are shaping up, this could be a hell of a season.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionSouth ParkDonald TrumpAnimation on TVUS televisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Feeling sad? Cry to your personalised “Depress Sesh Mix”. In a romantic crisis? Stew in your own “Situationship Mix”.As I write this, I’m listening to Spotify’s Daylist, a mix that refreshes every few hours based on my own listening habits. Today’s vibe is “funky beats roller skating tuesday early morning mix”. At 120bpm, the algorithm knows I need some energetic house to roll from my bed to my desk.The problem with this listening experience isn’t just the creepy AI-driven intimacy of it all, more that the same songs are recycled in a predictable loop. Spotify’s algorithm has anaesthetised me to artists I once enjoyed. Every time I hear the slippery psychedelic bass of Khruangbin slinking into one of my playlists, or flow in seamlessly from another artist’s radio, I violently hit skip.‘One minute it’s “would you like to listen to Galaxie 500?”, the next humanity’s enslaved’: can anyone escape Spotify?Read moreA decade ago, Spotify favouredhuman-curated playlistsmade by artists, celebrities and music aficionados. But in 2021 the streaming companypivoted towardsmachine learning, feeding “nearly half a trillion events” into computer models every day. Now, user data – chiefly our listening history, interactions with Spotify’s user interface and the time of day – is packaged into a mixtape for every micro-occasion.Advocates argue this is a chance todemocratise music promotion, neatly matching artists with their audiences. Critics suggest this ultra-subjective experience limits musical discovery to the already familiar – and the less it’s challenged, the more my music taste narrows. So as a test, I quit Spotify for a month, to bring some soul back into the way I find music.First, I consulted people who had never used streaming services, like my dad, who grew up in 1970s London in the heyday of punk and glam rock. Hunched in a booth in his local record shop, he would listen to a sample and take a punt on what vinyl to buy. Some albums apparently missed the mark, and others, like Pink Floyd’s Dark Side of the Moon, transported him to a different universe. He insisted I start with my favourite artists and listen to every album front to back, as if reading a story.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningInspired, I bought a $30 record player in an op-shop and hunted for vinyls. Late to the record renaissance, it was slim pickings – Australian pub classics, Christian country or Christmas hits. But when a friend pointed out my new turntable was missing a needle, it became a dusty but decorative addition to my living room.My 20-year-old neighbour had another suggestion: a diamante-encrusted iPod, which she produced in a ziplock bag like a hallowed artefact. Found for $200 on Facebook Marketplace, plugging in wired earplugs and hitting shuffle was a nostalgic throwback. But this romance was short-lived: the iPod was incompatible with my Bluetooth speaker and demanded hours of admin to upload music.The biggest challenge came when driving my old silver Subaru, as I was stranded with only a single CD, a flimsy aux cord and my thoughts. Stuck with silence, I wondered what the new grinding noise was – until I discovered my local community broadcaster, Vox FM 106.9. More than5 million Australians listen to community radio every week, for 17 hours on average – and now, I can see why. The station prides itself on “real music” and even has the tagline “You never know what you like until you try it”.Just what I needed! And it’s true, I had forgotten how good it feels to wind down the windows and blast Push the Button by the Sugababes, and then to roll them up again when a classical German song, a mystery even to Shazam, comes on.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He sources music from record fairs, friends and Bandcamp – distributing interesting sounds as a conduit, or Hermes figure, to lay (or lazy) people like me. Moon is noticing that his customers are searching for a more “active” listening experience. “It’s not this kind of passive wash-over-you rubbish that you make your two-minute noodles to and forget all about 10 seconds later,” he says.Music – like film, TV, and food – is now served to us effortlessly, instantly. But this has caused the way we consume music to be more siloed. Spending a month hunting for new music myself, rather than relying on an algorithm, made me feel more connected to my parents, friends, radio presenters and even complete strangers. Their recommendations – whether to my taste or not – came with a part of themselves, a memory or a shared interest.After my month’s Spotify hiatus, my algorithm hasn’t been cleansed. Over the course of writing this piece, my daylist has evolved into “french indietronica swimming pool tuesday afternoon”, whatever that means. There are two Khruangbin songs on there.

Team America: World Police (2004)Trey Parker’s extraordinary puppet comedymay find its spoof status in dispute – perhaps because it spoofs more than one thing at a time: it spoofs action adventures and superhero combos as well as satirising gung-ho American nationalism and exceptionalism. Team America epitomises the belief that the US can and should get involved all over the world by kicking the ass of foreign people. Does it deserve a place on a spoof list? Fuck yeah!19. High Anxiety (1977)View image in fullscreenHomage to Hitchcock … High Anxiety.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyPerhaps it is strange that a full-dress spoof of Alfred Hitchcock took so long to arrive – it could be that the master’s own playful and self-aware sense of humour preempted it. But here is Mel Brooks’s send-up of Hitchcock’s psychological suspense thrillers, with Brooks as Dr Richard Thorndyke, the psychoanalyst neurotically afflicted with a fear of heights who somehow always finds himself in dangerous situations in which he is going to fall to his death. A sturdily impassive supporting cast includes Cloris Leachman, Madeline Kahn and a cameo for Brooks’s co-writer Barry Levinson.18. OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies (2006)There have been so many spy spoofs and Bond send-up movies: Johnny English, Austin Powers and the first (non-canonical) Casino Royale from 1967 with David Niven as Bond. So, given that only one will have to stand for them all, here is Michel Hazanavicius’s very closely observed and very funny spy spoof, riffing on the Bondian French agent Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, created by French author Jean Bruce in the late 1940s – starring the excellent Jean Dujardin as the suavely handsome daredevil with a touch of Clouseau-esque incompetence.17. I’m Gonna Git You Sucka (1988)View image in fullscreenSelf-referential comedy … I’m Gonna Git You Sucka.Photograph: Everett Collection/AlamyIn what may come to be seen as the golden age of 80s spoofs, Keenen Ivory Wayans produced his blaxploitation spoof, with the pedantically overextended title signalling its status as self-referential comedy. Wayans casts plenty of genuine titans of the blaxploitation world, including Antonio Fargas, Jim Brown, Isaac Hayes and Bernie Casey – riffing knowingly on the fact that black sports stars often graduated to the movies, although OJ Simpson was to appear in quite another spoof: the Naked Gun series.16. Duplicate Sholay (2002)Kanti Shah’s spoof version of the revered Bollywood action-adventure Sholay from 1975 – widely regarded as one of the greatest Indian films of all time – was cheeky and, to some, even a bit sacrilegious. The film uses lookalike casting and madly inflates the already grandiose plot, which involved a retired cop hiring two criminals to bring down a ruthless kingpin. This parody version rounds up a whole crew of reprobates.15. Monty Python’s Life of Brian (1979)View image in fullscreenTruly a spoof? Monty Python’s Life of Brian.Photograph: Python/AllstarIn any discussion of spoofs, there will always be debate about whether a certain film really counts as a spoof. When Python’s Life of Brian first came out and was threatened with censorship by the religious right, the spoof argument was deployed in its defence – ie it’s not an offensive attack on Christianity, it’s a spoof of religious Hollywood epics. That’s sort of true: the movie, starring Graham Chapman as the dozy bloke Brian Cohen who is mistaken for the Messiah in the time of Christ, used the locations and sets of Franco Zeffirelli’s TV extravaganza Jesus of Nazareth, and its generic resemblance was part of what made it funny.14. Scary Movie (2000)View image in fullscreenA single absurdist meme … Scary Movie.Photograph: Moviestore Collection/AlamyThe Scary Movie franchise and the comparably self-aware if not out-and-out spoofy Scream series were a big part of the mainstream horror revival at the beginning of the 00s. Wayans, with his habitual pile-’em-high attitude to gags, gives us references to Friday the 13th, Halloween, I Know What You Did Last Summer and many more. He cheekily plays up the genre’s trope of attractive young teen victims somehow always put themselves in harm’s way, epitomised by the demon in the Ghostface mask standing between two road signs pointing helpfully in different directions, SAFETY and DEATH, boiling down the slasher plot form to a single absurdist meme.13. Dead Men Don’t Wear Plaid (1982)A connoisseur spoof of 1940s noir detective stories, starring Steve Martin as the tough private investigator, directed and co-written by Carl Reiner, shot in black-and-white by Michael Chapman (who also shot Raging Bull) and accessorised with a gorgeously authentic musical score by Miklós Rózsa and costumes by Edith Head. Martin’s character effectively speaks to the ghosts of the past as clips of old movies are intercut into the action, featuring the likes of Bogart, Cagney and Veronica Lake. Is that cheating in spoof terms? Maybe. But this is very well observed.12. Catholic High School Girls in Trouble from The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977)The porn spoof is a genre that is mostly under the radar and under the counter – the porn industry itself regularly produces porn-spoof versions of mainstream films (Shaving Ryan’s Privates, Everyone I Did Last Summer, For Your Thighs Only, etc), but that is a matter of porn spoofing the respectable films. For the other way around, there is possibly the (woefully unfunny) Carry On Emmannuelle, but more amusing and gleefully crass is the brief sketch in John Landis’s The Kentucky Fried Movie – a spoof of porn and a spoof of trailers. It’s a coming attraction taster for the shocking new adult film Catholic High School Girls In Trouble: “Never before has the beauty of the sexual act been so crassly exploited!”11. The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad! (1988)View image in fullscreenAbsurd comedy … the original Naked Gun.Photograph: United Archives/AlamyHere is the original sequel-spawning Naked Gun, imminently to be revived with Liam Neeson playing the tough, stern detective: a movie spun off from the original Police Squad! TV comedy, which spoofed 60s TV cop shows such as The FBI. In fact, the original spoof targets of Naked Gun are so dim and distant in the pop culture collective memory that Naked Gun has its own kind of originality.Leslie Nielsen(carrying on from his brow-furrowing turn in the classic Airplane!) once again sent up the boilerplate heroic persona that he used to portray quite seriously, playing Det Lt Frank Drebin, and that rich baritone voice was vital to the absurd comedy.10. Bugsy Malone (1976)Alan Parker’s Bugsy Malone was a movie-musical that spoofed the Prohibition-era Warner Bros gangster-crime genre by simply casting the film’s tough guys as children who hit each other with custard pies instead of shooting guns. However, Jodie Foster, appearing here in the same year as Taxi Driver, was so precocious that she was considered an honorary adult in an entirely different league from the innocent kids in the rest of the film. (The idea was not entirely original: the 1905 silent The Little Train Robbery spoofed The Great Train Robbery of 1903 by using children and a miniature railway set.)9. Clueless (1995)Amy Heckerling’s 90s masterpiece achieved a kind of double spoof: the story of high-school princess Cher, played by Alicia Silverstone, spoofed the form and content of teen movies by virtue of being elegantly modelled on a classic of English literature – Jane Austen’s Emma. (Gil Junger’s 10 Things I Hate About You did the same thing with Shakespeare’s The Taming of the Shrew.) But, by the same token, it also slyly spoofed the generic mannerisms of Austen, and did so with loving admiration.8. Black Dynamite (2009)View image in fullscreenUproarious bad taste … Black Dynamite.Photograph: Maximum Film/AlamyScott Sanders’s blaxploitation spoof boasts a stream of outrageous gags, uproarious bad taste and strict attention to detail. It stars his formidable co-writer, the martial arts action lead Michael Jai White as Black Dynamite, who swears to avenge his dead brother and takes aim at the complicit white establishment in Washington DC and the “Honky House”. Sanders lovingly reproduces the paradoxically old-fashioned imperatives of blaxploitation, masculinity and heroism, which were being affirmed at a time when the white American new wave was undermining them.7. Hellzapoppin’ (1941)This is a screwball self-aware comedy, a crazy madcap romp that its ever-increasing number of fans believe is touched by genius. Originally a Broadway show, it’s a spoof of Broadway romances such as Gold Diggers of Broadway and The Great Ziegfeld. But it’s also a spoof of cinema and of musical theatre as represented in cinema, and of showbiz generally: the forms, the conventions and the grammar of all these are lovingly foregrounded. Actors Ole Olsen and Chic Johnson (from the original show) play themselves in the midst of a chaotic swirl of misadventures concerning whether or not a certain stage show can work in the world of motion pictures.6. They Came Together (2014)David Wain is a film-maker who spoofed sex comedies in his Wet Hot American Summer of 2001. But this is surely his masterpiece: a devastatingly realistic, rigorously maintained spoof of a mainstream romantic comedy, played with absolute conviction by Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler, with the New York locations, cinematography, production design and supporting cast that would be in the real thing. Rudd and Poehler are the couple who come together in the big city (which is itself a character in the movie, as in any self-respecting romcom), and the film takes us through a complete story, while always making us aware that it isn’t a “real” romcom – the effect is fascinating, amusing … and even slightly scary.5. Blazing Saddles (1974)Mel Brooks’s outrageous spoof westernwas, in one respect, very unlike the classic westerns it was sending up: it had a black man in the leading role. Cleavon Little is the railway worker Bart, who is promoted to sheriff by corrupt and cynical forces who expect him to fail (and so Blazing Saddles is not unlike Brooks’s The Producers). But Bart finds himself teaming up with boozy gunfighter The Waco Kid, played by Gene Wilder, a tough guy who is, of course, on the point of redemption in the classic manner. There are some sophisticated fourth-wall-breaking gags and very unsophisticated farting jokes.4. Far From Heaven (2002)View image in fullscreenSpoof or homage? Far From Heaven.Photograph: Usa Films/Sportsphoto/AllstarDo spoof films have to generate comedy? And if their object is more serious, does that mean they need the posher title of homage? Todd Haynes’s romantic drama Far From Heaven is a spoof of Douglas Sirk pictures such as All That Heaven Allows and Imitation of Life: films about the passionate inner lives of women in 40s and 50s America. But Far From Heaven is much more explicit on the subject of race, racism and gay sexuality than Sirk could allow himself to be – Julianne Moore is superb as the prim and proper housewife whose husband (Dennis Quaid) has a secret gay existence, and she falls in love with a black man, played with Poitier-esque dignity by Dennis Haysbert.3. Young Frankenstein (1974)For some, this is Brooks’s greatest spoof, and possibly anyone’s greatest spoof: a lovingly detailed recreation in luminous black and white of James Whale’s original Boris Karloff-starring Frankenstein from 1931, pastiching the Gothic romance tradition of classic horror from the forested dark lands of central Europe and using some of the original film’s props. Cobbling together a recognisable human from disparate body parts – is that an allegory for spoof itself? Gene Wilder is the troubled neurophysiologist Dr Frederick Frankenstein, who realises that it is his terrible destiny to recreate the experiments of his disgraced grandfather Victor Frankenstein, creating a monster played by Peter Boyle.2. This Is Spın̈al Tap (1984)Rob Reiner’s brilliant comedy spoofed the vainglorious and Brit-heavy rockumentary genre like Zep’s The Song Remains the Same, but with superb incidental detail and observational flair that went beyond those films. Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer are Nigel Tufnel, David St Hubbins and Derek Smalls of the legendary but failing heavy rock colossus Spın̈al Tap, here shown on an ill-fated comeback tour. Tap more or less spearheaded mockumentary comedy, cringe comedy and embarrassment comedy – later revived by Ricky Gervais and Steve Carell.1. Airplane! (1980)View image in fullscreenPure spoof nirvana … Airplane!Photograph: Paramount/AllstarIt had to be. This is the highest plane (as it were) of pure spoof nirvana, marrying original gags to strictly observed satire and an unflinchingly deadpan delivery, symbolised by its most famous joke: “Surely you can’t be serious?” (You know the punchline, which brilliantly and economically enacts the repudiation of seriousness). The Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker masterpiece is a brilliant, vibrant parody of the airline disaster genre, spoofing the Airport movies generally and anticipating Robert Zemeckis’s later plane crash films like Cast Away and Flight. But it was in fact modelled with amazing closeness on one specific film: Zero Hour! from 1957 (by Arthur Hailey, who went on to write the Airport films), a melodrama that now cannot be watched except through a glaze of delirious disbelief. It was a masterstroke of Abrahams and the Zuckers to get veteran actorLeslie Nielsento play the heroic lead in exactly the same straight-faced, resonant way as he would have if he was in the original – and the same goes for troupers such as Robert Stack, Lloyd Bridges and Peter “Mission: Impossible” Graves. Genius.This article was amended on 24 July 2025 to remove a reference to Sanjay Dutt, who did not star in Sholay.Explore more on these topicsRankedSpinal TapThis Is Spinal TapAirplane!Mel BrooksLeslie NielsenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You spend years – sometimes even decades – curating a reputation as a happy go lucky, physically anonymous everyman. ThenMarvelcomes knocking, and you realise that you might have to share a scene with Chris Hemsworth, and next to him you’re going to look like a weedy twig-worm hybrid. The next thing you know, you’re all over the internet, greased up and flexing. Which is a very long way of saying: Borat’s got abs now.Sacha Baron Cohen isthis month’s Men’s Fitness magazine cover model. His pecs are popping. His biceps are bulging. His forearms look like a sack of live snakes. His pants are, conservatively, two and half inches lower than they really should be. His entire torso looks like it’s been rolled around in margarine. He is, to use his own words, “hard launching my mid-life crisis”.View image in fullscreenBorat’s got abs now … Sacha Baron Cohen on the August issue of Men’s Fitness.Photograph: Simon Needham/mensfitness.co.ukAnd this is all because of Marvel.Sacha Baron Cohenstars in the Disney+ TV show Ironheart as Mephisto. Which might be news to a lot of you, since Ironheart was released right at the moment that superhero fatigue hit such terminal velocity that president of Marvel Studios Kevin Feige essentially chose to promote the Fantastic Four movie by promising everyone that he wasn’t going to make as many TV shows any more. But, really, that’s beside the point.Because, of all the shredded topless comic actor torso reveals, the only one to go on to any substantial screen time was Chris Pratt. It has now been 12 years since hetook his top off for Instagramto show his transformation from “the schlubby one from Parks and Recreation” to “man with abdominal muscles”, and he has since been in six MCU films, a Christmas special and several other projects that relied on him looking ripped.Contrast that with Kumail Nanjiani, who went from a round-faced, Oscar-nominated writer in 2017 to looking like avacuum-sealed walnut bag in 2019. And this because he had been cast in The Eternals, in which he effectively had a bit part as one of about 300 new superheroes. Aside from a voice acting gig in one episode of What If…?, that has been the sum total of his MCU output.Which is still a ton compared to Sacha Baron Cohen, whose Mephisto appeared fully clothed in just one episode of a television show that has left no cultural footprint whatsoever. The point is that, while a Marvel gig might ostensibly be the impetus to start pumping iron, it isn’t necessarily the end goal. For all anyone knows, we may never see Mephisto again. But the image of Cohen clutching a pair of dumbbells while being covered in more goose fat than a cross-channel swimmer will live for ever.View image in fullscreenSacha Baron Cohen in Men’s Fitness.Photograph: Simon Needham/mensfitness.co.ukEspecially since his earlier career relied upon him showing off as much of his body as he could. Go back and look at photos of him in a mankini as Borat, and you’ll see what a change this is. That said, despite being leaner and better defined now, those pictures demonstrate that the most effective element in his transformation may well have been a comprehensive chest wax.Still, let’s allow him this moment. If nothing else, Cohen is being neatly self-deprecating about how he looks on Instagram, quipping: “Some celebs use Ozempic and some use private chefs, others use personal trainers. I did all three,” and “This is not AI. I really am egotistical enough to do this.” And if it means that he’s moving away from comedy – there’s no way that Borat can ever wear another mankini unless he’s going to aggressively rebrand himself as a thirsty divorcee – then so be it. Between Ironheart and last year’s Disclosure, it seems like that’s where he was headed anyway.Besides, this reveal puts Sacha Baron Cohen one step closer to the next chapter in the MCU playbook: complaining about how horrible it is to look like this. Chris Pratt did it, claiming that he had to drink so much water that his life became a“nightmare”. Kumail Nanjiani did it,making a colossal show of getting to eat some cakelike a normal person. And so it will inevitably be with Sacha Baron Cohen. That is, unless Mephisto becomes a central part of the MCU in the future. If that’s the case, the brand sponsorship with Veet must be just around the corner.Explore more on these topicsFilmSacha Baron CohenMarvelfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Gardening is much more dangerous than quilting.”It is one aside among many during a discursive interview with the Guardian that includes his fears of fascism in America, why heterosexual men are a “bunch of assholes” and the time he sat withDonald Trumpat a gay wedding.‘You think God didn’t make gay men?’ Comedian Leslie Jones on religion, grief and getting famous at 47Read moreBut first there is quilting. Fierstein began about 20 years ago, inspired by craft shows on the HGTV channel that he fondly recalls as “hot glue heaven”, and made about a quilt a year. Then came theCovid-19 pandemic lockdownand, with “nobody else to talk to”, he turned to his sewing machine in earnest and found a new community in a local quilt shop. He is now up to about 80 or 90 quilts.“I started experimenting more and more and found that people like quilts a lot better than paintings,” Fierstein, 73, observes via Zoom from his home in Ridgefield, Connecticut. “If you give somebody a painting they have to hang it on the wall if you come over for dinner. But at least the dog can sleep on the quilt.”The fruit of his labour is his first exhibition of handmade quilts, You Made That? The Quilting Adventures of Harvey Fierstein, at theKeeler Tavern Museum & History Centerin Ridgefield from Friday to Sunday.Fierstein was one of the first out gay celebrities in the US and is best known for his Tony award-winning stage work on Hairspray, La Cage Aux Folles, Newsies, Kinky Boots andTorch Song Trilogyas well as various film roles. But quilting represents a return to his roots in the visual arts: he graduated from the High School of Art and Designand received a degree in painting from the Pratt Institute.“That’s what I was supposed to be doing,” he says. “This theatre thing is like a side gig: it’s what I do when I can’t get work as an artist. As a child I went to Disney studios and saw the artists working. That’s what I thought I was going to do and this whole writing thing was sort of a mistake.”Fierstein views the upcoming public display in a tiny museum in what he dubs “a small fictional town in Connecticut”as an opportunity to “figure out whether, besides keeping the dog warm, this is something that’s worth doing. It’s also very American as we try and cling to America as we’re being killed by that soulless piece of crap. We have to hang on.”View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein quilt.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistThis is a reference to thecurrent occupantof the White House. One of Fierstein’s deceptively beautiful quilts is a condemnation of fascism, featuring two black skeletons giving Nazi salutes above a kneeling figure in striped pyjamas, against a backdrop of yellow stars and pink triangles like those that Jews and gay people were forced to wear during the Holocaust.Growing up Jewish in Brooklyn, with acquaintances who had concentration camp tattoos on their arms, he developed a deep awareness of intolerance. “Antisemitism was something that I was used to but, having lived through the 60s with the civil rights struggle and then the 70s with the gay struggle, you keep thinking we’ve moved past this.“But it’s in us. Prejudice is somewhere in us. It’s built into us for safety. All animals see another of their kind and find safety in that and it’s something we have to fight. It’s always been an undercurrent. I wanted to make an expression of that.If you look at the quilt, I did the background, the Jewish stars and the pink triangles, in very pretty colours. It doesn’t announce itself in an ugly way.”Fierstein moves up a few gears as he contemplates the toxic stew of Trump’s America: draconian crackdowns on undocumented immigrants, rising antisemitism and political violence, a primal desire to revel in ignorance andturn back the clock.“There are people that actually think that what’s going on, arresting people and pulling them out of their jobs, is something good. I am shocked when I see people on television saying, ‘Well, he promised to clean up the swamp and that’s what he’s doing.’ It’s all so frightening if you have any idea of history.“This war against the left: I believe there’s something very dark there. I believe it’s people being too lazy to want to do the work. They love Donald Trump because he has no idea about anything. He’s your Uncle Paul who comes over for dinner and you just have to listen to him and bite your tongue because he knows absolutely nothing. That’s why these people love him; he’s an idiot; he’s just like them.”Fierstein wishes Trump supporters would come to their senses. “When people tell me they’re pro-Trump, I say, do you know him? Because I do. I’ve been to a gay wedding and sat with him at a table in a gay wedding. Have you? I’ve had business meetings with the man. Have you? I know him. I’m telling you, he’s nothing but a thief and a fraud.”View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein in 1977.Photograph: John Kisch Archive/Getty ImagesThe gay wedding in question was talent managerRichie Jackson’s marriageto theatre producer Jordan Roth in Manhattan in 2012. Roth’s father, Steven, was a friend of Trump. Fierstein recalls: “Donald was there looking absolutely miserable, didn’t even bring any of the 15 wives or girlfriends or underage children with him.“When they tell me they’re pro-him, I say, if you met him, you wouldn’t be. The ones who are so weak want to be hugged by somebody strong, just get into his circle and love that. It’s that papa thing. Hitler had it. All those guys have.”Fierstein made waves in March when he denouncedTrump’s takeoverof the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, which included a declared intention to ban drag shows. Fierstein noted this would mean La Cage aux Folles and many of his other shows could not be performed there.He says: “I love the Kennedy Center - I’ve performed there – but no, I won’t go near anything of Trump.He went to see Les Mis, saying this was his favorite musical, and didn’t know the difference between the hero and the villain.How stupid do you have to be to say this is my favorite musical? At least tell the truth.”Trump installed a loyalist, Ric Grenell, an out gay man, as president of the Kennedy Center. “He proudly says, ‘I am a gay, married man.’ Who got you those rights, you piece of shit, you lowlife little creep … Who got you the right to get married, you fuckface?”Fierstein sees LGBTQ+ rights under siege once more. On his first day back in office, Trumpsigned an executive ordermandating that federal agencies recognise only two sexes – male and female – based on biological classification at birth, rejecting gender identity as a separate concept. Another order was aimed at cutting federal support for gender-affirming care for minors.Again Fierstein does not mince words: “The president of the United States announces there are only two sexes in the world! Well, you better call that God you say you believe in because there’s hermaphrodites, there’s all sorts of things in the end, not just in human beings but in all species. How stupid can you be? Sit down before you make a statement like that and look it up.“On Facebook I put up a picture of a statue from ancient Rome of a hermaphrodite. What are you talking about, you asshole? They’ve been around forever. Homosexuals have been around forever. This is a natural part of who we are.View image in fullscreenHarvey Fierstein in 1982.Photograph: Joe McNally/Getty Images“But no, they have this Bible: he can sell them but he’s never read one. What’s your favorite quote of the Bible? ‘Oh, I love it all. I love it all. I read it every day.’ You don’t even read your own briefings every day. They had to simplify it for you, you piece of crap.”Fierstein is dismayed by the law firms and media companies bending the knee to Trump because of selfishness and desire to make more money. He unleashes his frustrations at one group in particular.“I am not an incredibly prejudiced person but, when it comes to heterosexual men, I don’t get them. They’re a bunch of assholes. There are so few heterosexual men that I know that I look up to. You can’t count on them for anything other than their own self-interest. There are some good ones – I mean, I’m not that prejudiced – but if we took all the heterosexual men out of Congress for two years and see what happens … or the ones whopretendto be heterosexual.”And does Fierstein expect to live to see America’s first out gay president? “I’m very old,” he muses.“I’ve lived through Ronald Reagannever saying the word Aids. When Obama first raised his hand, I didn’t think – so you never know. You live in hope.”You Made That?

The Artist was selected from ashortlist of six bookswhich also featuredConfessions by Catherine Airey,Saraswati by Gurnaik Johal,Ordinary Saints by Niamh Ní Mhaoileoin,Sunstruck by William Rayfet Hunter, andWhen the Cranes Fly South by Lisa Ridzén.The winner was chosen by a panel of booksellers informed by votes and feedback from more than 650 booksellers fromWaterstonesshops.Bea Carvalho, head of books at Waterstones, said Steeds’ novel “stood out for its atmospheric, sensory prose, and its headily evocative sense of time and place.“This is a gorgeously claustrophobic novel to be fully swept away by: The Artist has something for readers of all tastes and heralds the arrival of an exciting new voice. We can’t wait to see what Lucy Steeds does next.”Steeds, who is originally from north London, began writing the novel while living in France. Commenting on the inspiration behind the novel, she said she was “fascinated by the concept of art monsters. These tyrannical figures who act abominably to the people around them in order to create great art.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Last week, his wife, Sky, denied rumors that he was in a coma, stating that his heart was “strong” after multiple operations.Instantly recognizable from his blonde horseshoe mustache and bandannas, Hogan was one of the most popular wrestling stars of the 1980s and considered one of the greatest of all time. Known for his ring theatrics and sizable physique–in his prime, Hogan clocked in at 6ft 7in and weighed 320lb (145kg) – he helped transform professional wrestling into home entertainment, primarily through his partnership with WorldwideWrestlingEntertainment (WWE) and the performance routine known as Hulkamania.The entertainment company confirmed Hogan’s death and mourned its former star in astatementon X: “WWE is saddened to learn WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan has passed away. One of pop culture’s most recognizable figures, Hogan helped WWE achieve global recognition in the 1980s. WWE extends its condolences to Hogan’s family, friends, and fans.”“The Hulkster” headlined WrestleMania, WWE’s signature event, eight times, including a seminal showdown in 1987 with his 520lb mentor Andre the Giant at Michigan’s Pontiac Silverdome, before a then record crowd of 93,173. Hogan won the WWE championship six times during his career.View image in fullscreenHulk Hogan in 2024.Photograph: Sarah Yenesel/EPAIn 1996, Hogan founded the New World Order (NWO) and became Hollywood Hulk Hogan. He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, only to have his status revoked after scandal following the release of a secret recording of a sexual encounter, during which Hogan made numerous racist comments. The 2010s blog Gawker first published the recording; Hogan subsequently sued the website, winning and forcing it out of business.Hogan was once again inducted in 2020, as he became a more prominent figure in Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement. He starred at the 2024 Republican national convention, ripping off his shirt, WWE-style, to reveal a Trump 2024 T-shirt.Ever the performer, Hoganmaintained a decades-long acting career, appearing in the 1982 film Rocky III as the character Thunderlips, as well as films such as No Holds Barred, Suburban Commando, Mr Nanny, Santa With Muscles and the 1994 syndicated series Thunder in Paradise. As one of the most recognizable figures of the 1980s – at his peak, he was the most requested celebrity for the Make-a-Wish foundation – Hogan appeared as himself in many shows and movies, including the A-Team, Baywatch, Gremlins 2: The New Batch, Spy Hard and Muppets From Space. He also lent his voice to episodes of Robot Chicken and American Dad!1:53Hulk Hogan, wrestling star and actor, dies aged 71 – video obituaryIn 1985, he co-hosted Saturday Night Live along with Mr T. The same year, he was the star of his own cartoon series on CBS, Hulk Hogan’s Rock ‘n’ Wrestling. Hogan parlayed his fame into reality television, starring on the VH1 reality show Hogan Knows Best along with his then wife Linda and his children Brooke and Nick, from 2005 until 2007.The Guardian has contacted Hogan’s representatives for comment.Tributes poured in on social media in the hours after his death, including from Maga political figures.“We lost a great friend today, the ‘Hulkster,’” Donald Trump, a longtime friend,postedon his official Truth Social account. “Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way – Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart. He gave an absolutely electric speech at the Republican National Convention, that was one of the highlights of the entire week. He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed!”JD Vance alsoposted a tribute on X: “Hulk Hogan was a great American icon. One of the first people I ever truly admired as a kid,” he wrote. “The last time I saw him we promised we’d get beers together next time we saw each other. The next time will have to be on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace.”“We all have fond memories of Hulk Hogan,”wroteMike Johnson, the Republican speaker of the House, on X, alongside two photos – one with Hogan, the other of Hogan arm-wrestling Trump. “From my childhood in the ‘80s, to campaigning with him last year, I always saw him as a giant in stature and in life. May he rest in peace.”Sylvester Stallone, Hogan’s co-star in Rocky III, saidvia Instagram: “I had the pleasure of meeting this brilliant personality and showman when he was 26 years old. He was absolutely wonderful and his amazing skill madeRockythree incredibly special. My heart breaks.”“I Am Absolutely Shocked To Hear About The Passing Of My Close Friend,” Hogan’s friend and fellow wrestling star Ric Flairpostedon X. “Hulk Has Been By My Side Since We Started In The Wrestling Business. An Incredible Athlete, Talent, Friend, And Father! Our Friendship Has Meant The World To Me.”And John Cena, who followed Hogan’s path from WWE star to Hollywood actor, simply posted a photo to hisInstagram accountof Hogan holding André the Giant’s head in one of their showdowns, appearing triumphant.Explore more on these topicsCultureUS televisionWrestling (Sport)Wrestling (Culture)TelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Musk and OpenAI have been at loggerheads since, with astring of legal claims on both sides. Musk has accused OpenAI of abandoning its original charitable mission by establishing a for-profit subsidiary, andin August 2024 launched legal actionagainst the company claiming he was manipulated into co-founding it, saying: “The perfidy and deceit is of Shakespearean proportions.” Musk subsequentlyattempted a takeover of the company in 2025; his $97.4bn bid for OpenAI was rebuffed, with Altman posting on social media: “no thank you but we will buy twitter for $9.74 billion if you want.”In April, OpenAI countersued Muskfor what it claimed were his “malicious campaigns” and “harassing legal claims”.Although plot details have not been confirmed, Guadagnino’s film is said to concentrate on the brief period of behind-the-scenes drama when Altmanwas fired and re-hired as OpenAI CEOwithin a matter of days in November 2024. The board had claimed Altman was not “consistently candid in his communications”, but Altman was reinstated after many of the company’s employees threatened to quit.Andrew Garfield, Monica Barbaro and Anora’s Yura Borisov havereportedly been cast in the film, though their roles have not been clarified. The writer has been confirmed as novelist Simon Rich,a former contributor to the Observerand writer ofRogen comedy An American Pickle. Guadagnino has just completed thriller After the Hunt, starring Julia Roberts, Ayo Edebiri and Garfield, which is due to receive its world premiere at the Venice film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmElon MuskLuca GuadagninoOpenAISam AltmanDrama filmsArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content"

My question is, ‘What are you guys going to do about it?’”Daniels continued by saying he believed Trump’s slate of tariffs would cost him supporters. “‘Wait a minute, the grocery bill is what? $180 more? I can’t get that car that we have to have unless I pay another $8,000. What? Who do I blame for that? Who do I see about that?’ One person.“At the end of the day it would be about just the price of eggs, did it go up or down, because that’s what he told me he was going to lower the price of eggs or my grocery bill,” Daniels continued, before describing the president as a “snake-oil salesman.”Daniels said he had been surprised by the pace of change since Trump took office again in January.“We’ve lost decency, we’ve lost civility, we’ve lost respect for the rule of law – lost it,” he said. “We have normalised verbal abuse on the internet. We’ve normalised bullying; much as the woke generation tried to, you know, change that, it’s back …“I mean, nobody has great things to say about politicians. They never have. Go back to Mark Twain. But ideally, we’re supposed to elect the best of us. Not the worst of us. He’s everything that’s wrong with not just America but with being a human being.”Daniels’s most recent projects were TV series American Rust andA Man in Full. He rose to fame with roles in Ragtime, Terms of Endearment and Heartburn, before finding international acclaim in The Purple Rose of Cairo in 1985.Other films include Something Wild, The Squid and the Whale, Speed, Dumb and Dumber and Steve Jobs. He plays Ronald Reagan opposite Jared Harris as Mikhail Gorbachev in a forthcoming take on the 1986 Reykjavik Summit.Explore more on these topicsFilmDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsPodcastsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is also an extended scene featuring ahyper-realistic, deepfake videoof Trump, completely naked, walking in a desert. There are repeated suggestions that Trump’s genitalia are small.The episode centers on the presence of Jesus in South Park’s schools, a story covered by a parody of 60 Minutes, in a clear satire of Paramount’s recent embroilment with Trump over the flagship CBS News show. The two hosts refer nervously to “the president, who is a great man” and who “is probably watching”.Cancelling Colbert, bribery, an $8bn deal: what’s going on at Paramount?Read moreWhen South Park’s parents protest to Trump that they don’t want Jesus in schools, and Trump threatens to sue them for $5bn, Jesus begs them to settle with the president. “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount,” Jesus says through gritted teeth.“You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount. You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys got to stop being stupid … He also has the power to sue and take bribes and he can do anything to anyone. It’s the fucking president, dude … South Park is over.”The townspeople eventually agree to pay Trump a much smaller $3.5m, but also must create “pro-Trump messaging” – leading to the aforementioned video of Trump wandering in a desert, stripping naked.On Wednesday, the companies South Park Digital Studios and Park County, which are run by South Park’s creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, announced a licensing deal withParamount+Global. The $1.5bn (£1.1bn) agreement confirms 50 new episodes on Comedy Central over five years, to exclusively stream on Paramount+ worldwide. The entire South Park library will also be made available on Paramount+ in the US.Dylan Byers, a senior correspondent at the media organization Puck,wrote on social mediaafter the episode’s release: “Hard to think of anything more defiant in media & entertainment recently than Trey Parker & Matt Stone going scorched earth on Paramount in a South Park season premiere on the heels of netting a $1.5 billion deal with the very same company.”This deal also comes after recent contentious disputes involving Paramount. Skydance, which is controlled by the son of Trump ally Larry Ellison, is vying to take over Paramount Global, as well as Park Country. (Early this month Parker and Stone criticised the merger for postponing the season 27 premiere,writing: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes, and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”)The merger, however, requires the approval from the Trump-controlled Federal Communications Commission. When Paramount controversiallysettled a lawsuit with Trumpfor $16m over allegations that CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, committed “election interference” in its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, some critics alleged another example of capitulation by media companies hoping to curry favor with the US president.Then three days after Colbert, a high-profile critic of Trump, branded the deal “a big fat bribe” on his late-night CBS show, Paramount and CBS announced it hadcancelledthe show.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I mean, what show are they going to cancel next?” he says.Trump’s character is also asked directly by Satan about the “Epstein list”, referring to the unreleased files held by the US government relating to the convicted pedophileJeffrey Epstein, who wasfriends with Trumpfor 15 years. A political firestorm has erupted since theTrump administration’s recent decision not to release any more documents.Satan asks Trump directly if he’s on the Epstein list. “It’s weird that whenever it comes up, you just tell everyone to relax,” Satan says.The Guardian has contacted Stone, Parker and the White House for comment.In a statement toVariety, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, lambasted the “Left” and criticised the show for its lack of “authentic or original content”.“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak,” the statement continued.Explore more on these topicsSouth ParkDonald TrumpParamount+Paramount PicturesAnimation on TVUS televisionTelevisionnewsShareReuse this content"

Six other children, including the sister who was watching, and two adults were injured and taken to hospital.One Day in Southport focuses largely on what happened afterwards interspersed with the memories of the injured older girl and her family, because what happened next was the result of so many social, cultural and political issues that you could spend a lifetime unpacking them.

It interviews people from different sides of the various debates, and shows social media posts and footage from the riots that sprang up around the country and caught the police and the establishment unawares. The prime minister was left floundering and unable to address the mixture of feelings and motivations behind them quickly or directly enough.The attacker – his name then kept from the public – was quickly arrested. The police held a press conference and described him as a 17-year-old from Lancashire and originally from Cardiff. The latter detail was included to attempt to tamp down the speculation already rife online and in the local area (arising because the one thing witnesses to the attack did know about the stranger was that he wasBlack) that he was an immigrant, which quickly became an illegal immigrant, which quickly became a Muslim illegal immigrant and ignited all sorts of rage. The usual suspects from the manosphere and others with their own agendas to push then stoked the fires, including Nigel Farage (“It shows how unhappy people are with the state of law and order in this country … Your children don’t matter to them, they don’t care”) and Tommy Robinson, the leader of the far-right anti-Islam English Defence League.The hour tracks the evolution of local grief and anger directed at a specific event into widespread violence and unrest. One of the many YouTubers and other people outside the mainstream media who recorded events is Wesley Winter. He began feeling at one with the righteous fury felt by others. By the time he was filming a few days later in Middlesbrough, he realised that the people walking along a residential street in a Muslim area of the town and smashing windows “was a very different crowd” and he became frightened that they might turn on him next. A call from his wife trapped in her car as people smashed the windows of vehicles around her led them to leave the area as quickly as possible. His naivete is astonishing, but more admirable than the craven avoidance of those supposedly charged with leading the nation in times of strife to address the difficult, sensitive issues with which the tinderbox had been – and remains – stuffed.Because what have we here? We have a section of the population, that’s suffering greatly under the cost of living crisis. This fact has receded from the headlines, but not from life – the housing crisis, the proliferating brutal effects of austerity that the current government seems to be doing nothing to alleviate, and much more. We have people who see the advent of more people to these isles as competition for increasingly scarce resources. Even the co-convener of Stand Up to Racism, Weyman Bennett, makes the point that “people are protesting against something that is really happening to them … they are rightfully angry” before explaining how this is leveraged and exploited by far-rightwingers (and whatever Reform are pretending to be) so that “they’re blaming the wrong people”.The absence of anyone in authority addressing this, instead of lauding the arrests and sentencing of rioters, was and remains conspicuous. Why not publicly delineate the difference between legitimate concerns and far-right agitation – bring the worried into your fold and denounce those burning mosques and terrifying the asylum seekers in besieged hotels? Because thereisa difference and it matters hugely.The documentary gives no facts or figures about immigration, costs or anything else apart from the number of arrests and the 1,000 years-plus total to which rioters were sentenced. It is essentially a mood piece, tracking the development of the hijacking of grief to violent ends and leaving us to draw our own conclusions about where, why and if we would have stepped back to say: “This has gone too far.”One Day in Southport is on Channel 4 now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSouthport attackCrimereviewsShareReuse this content"

When she is offered a job heading up a UN programme aimed at rehabilitating Islamic State brides, she jumps at the chance for change. Having published a paper on deradicalisation, Nadia feels she is more than qualified for the job. But when she arrives in Iraq, she realises she will need to overcome prejudice – her own and that of her co-workers – if she is to make any progress.Shortlisted for this year’s Women’s prize for fiction, Fundamentally is the smart and acerbic debut novel from Nussaibah Younis featuring a hilarious heroine who, noting the absence of burned-out cars and bullet holes at her destination, notes: “It’s not like I was expecting Stalingrad but Baghdad took the piss … Why was it so … nice?” Yet it also offers more serious commentary on the creaking bureaucracy of humanitarian missions that are meant to be about solving problems rather than creating them.Told in the first person, the book is read by Sarah Slimani whose pacing is on point. Her Nadia pinballs between brash, unfiltered confidence and crushing self-doubt. When she meets Sara, who left London to join IS at 15 and has been disowned by her parents, the two form an unsteady bond. Each must put aside their preconceptions about the other – Nadia initially sees Sara as an ungrateful refugee while Sara tells Nadia she is a “slag with a saviour complex” – though they soon discover they have more in common than they thought.Available via Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 9hr 41minFurther listeningThe House of DoorsTan Twan Eng, WF Howes, 11hr 15minThis reimagining of the writer W Somerset Maugham’s time in Malaysia is read by David Oakes and Louise Mai-Newberryskip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

His new book gets us rooting for two wealthy management consultants fresh out of Oxford, both of them men (assuming you haven’t already tuned out). I suspect his agent might have found it easier to pitch a novel about sex criminals, not least because Drayton and Mackenzie’s approach is so unfashionably traditionalist: it’s a chunky, warmly observed, 9/11-to-Covid saga that, while comic in tone and often extremely funny, doesn’t labour under any obligation to send up its protagonists, still less take them down.James Drayton, born to north London academics, is a socially awkward high achiever who privately measures himself against Christopher Columbus and Napoleon. Joining the McKinsey consultancy firm after coming top of his year in philosophy, politics and economics hasn’t eased the pressure he has always felt to “come up with something so brilliant it was irrefutable, like the obliterating ultra-white light of a nuclear bomb”.There’s pathos and laughter in the duo’s beer-and-Champions League blokeishness, a way to keep unvoiced feeling at bayThe key to his sense of destiny arrives in the unlikely shape of a slacking junior colleague, Roland Mackenzie, who graduated with a 2:2 in physics (for James, a shame akin to “admitting erectile dysfunction”). Mutual suspicion thaws when they’re tasked with restructuring an Aberdeen oil firm in possession of the patents for a pioneering underwater turbine – tempting James and Roland to poach their star engineer, quit McKinsey and go it alone in green energy.It’s a mark of Starritt’s confidence that the quest to harness tidal power – the book’s main business – gets going only 200 pages in. We feel in safe hands from the start, reassured that he knows the story’s every last turn (“In later years, when he was the subject of articles and interviews …” begins a line about James on the second page, his A-levels barely over). But we’re kept on our toes: while the narration hews to the point of view of the central duo, it fills in the period backdrop – bailouts, Brexit – by dipping unpredictably into the perspective of real-life figures such as the Italian politician and former president of the European Central Bank Mario Draghi, seen delivering his famous 2012 speech vowing to save the euro “whatever it takes”. As James and Roland jet around the world for venture capital, Starritt grants hefty speaking parts to PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel and Elon Musk (is he allowed to do that?, I asked myself: always a sign of a writer up to something exciting).The plot is crammed with curveballs for the plucky entrepreneurs, whether it’s a shattered undersea cable, a coma caused by undiagnosed diabetes, or the dilemma that ensues when James and Roland fall for the same woman, having spent much of the novel joking uneasily about going to bed with each other. With a joyful knack for pithy analogy, the writing holds our attention as much as the events: the aforementioned relationship wrangle induces a “low eczemal itch of guilt” in the eventual girlfriend-stealer, while new parents drive home from the maternity ward feeling “like random civilians handed suits and guns and told to protect a miniature, defenceless president”.There’s pathos as well as laughter in the protagonists’ beer-and-Champions League blokeishness, a way to keep unvoiced feeling at bay. When Roland, nearly 30, wistfully recalls a teenage holiday fling, he thinks that “she was probably someone’s mum by now”, a line hinting at his deep-lying sense of stasis, even as the company’s ambition grows: not just electricity, but rocket fuel.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the end, though, critique of disruptor-era genius is less important here than feeling and friendship; the winningly Edwardian, even Victorian, approach to storytelling extends right to the heart-swelling deathbed climax.

DreamWorks’s franchise hits its stride with this minor upgrade – a snappier, funnier and more relaxed movie than the original. It begins like a Bond or Bourne with a death-defying car chase around Cairo after the gang of criminal predators pull off yet another a splashy heist. Behind the wheel of the getaway car is ringleader Mr Wolf (voiced bySam Rockwell, and doing such a decent Clooney impersonation that George should shake him down for royalties).Actually, the chase is a flashback to five years ago. Right now, in the present, Mr Wolf, Mr Snake, Mr Shark and the gang have gone straight. But their fresh start as good guys is scuppered by a snow leopard and a frame-up for a series of daring heists involving a precious metal called MacGuffinite (a silly gag for film-buff adults). The best character from the first movie, super-villainous guinea pig Professor Marmalade (voiced by Richard Ayoade) is also back. Locked up in a maximum security prison, he’s prison fit and covered with tattoos, his newfound physical menace let down only slightly by a nasally whine.There’s more wit and energy this time around, and a genuinely sweet message about friendship. Even the fart joke (every kids’ movie must have at least one) was a cut above and had the adults giggling. That said, my reviewing buddy who rated theoriginal Bad Guys10 stars out of five in 2022 when she was five, was less enthusiastic this time around. “It was OK,” she muttered. So what do I know?The Bad Guys 2 is out on 25 July in the UK, on 1 August in the US, and 18 September in Australia.Explore more on these topicsFilmAnimation on TVComedy filmsCrime filmsFamily filmsSam RockwellRichard AyoadereviewsShareReuse this content"

With the death ofOzzy Osbourne,the genre lost its irrepressible everyman Prince of Darkness, and all the warmth, charm and folly that made him relatable to so many. But with this 35th anniversary tour for their Painkiller album, Judas Priest provide some therapy.For years, the band have used Black Sabbath’s War Pigs as a walk-on song and the moment the tape kicks in, an impassioned and cathartic mass singalong sweeps across the amphitheatre. Any sense that this might be a sombre do is squashed in seconds. “Hello, metal maniacs!” says singer Rob Halford, wearing a bedazzled leather trenchcoat and aviator sunglasses.View image in fullscreenDazzling … guitarist Richie Faulkner.Photograph: Cuffe & TaylorPriest are a one-off who helped define metal’s image as well as its sound, going all in on the most exaggerated parts – the denim, leather, studs and no shortage of demonic motifs – while retaining street cred for more than 50 years. With the anthemic recent song Gates of Hell, eternal damnation has never sounded so inviting. The Serpent and the King – another from last year’s Invincible Shield album – is also exhilarating: a full-on burst of thrash driven by Scott Travis’s impeccable double-bass drum style. On the likes of Hell Patrol, the septuagenarian Halford can still nail the inexplicable, guttural shrieks.Guitarist Richie Faulkner came close to death in 2021 after a severe aortic rupture on stage: he survived 10 hours of emergency open-heart surgery where parts of his chest were replaced with mechanical components. With gurns aplenty, Halford admires one of Faulkner’s dazzling lead breaks on One Shot at Glory, hovering his tattooed head around the fretboard.“It’s been tough, the last 24-hours, but he would want us to be together doing this, having a good time. We love you, Ozzy,” Halford says to huge cheers, introducing Giants in the Sky. This is their ode to rock’s fallen greats, as the faces of Lemmy, Chris Cornell, Christine McVie, and now Ozzy – among others – are flashed on screen to a soundtrack of hefty riffs. ThatJudas Priestare not only performing at an admirable level but still making stellar new music in their sixth decade, further cements their place alongside Sabbath on the Mount Rushmore of metal gods.Explore more on these topicsJudas PriestMetalOzzy Osbournelive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Rush-released two days after its existence was announced, it had been trailed by the appearance of cryptic art installations at the rapper’s live shows – he’s still theoretically touring his last album, 2024’sChromakopia– and at One World Trade Center in New York, and by a flurry of online gossip: one US website was forced to retract and apologise for publishing a tracklisting, complete with guest appearance by Kendrick Lamar, that turned out to be fake.View image in fullscreenTyler the Creator: Don’t Tap the GlassDespite all this, Tyler Okonma seemed keen to deflate the kind of anticipation that arises when your last three albums have all been critically lauded, platinum-selling chart-toppersfull of big ideas. “Y’all better get them expectations and hopes down,” he posted on X, “this ain’t no concept nothing.” He then published an essay that read suspiciously like an explanation of the album’s concept, bemoaning the intrusion of cameraphones and social media on our ability to live in the moment: “Our human spirit got killed because of the fear of being a meme.”So what is Don’t Tap the Glass? A proper follow-up to Chromakopia or an interstitial release? A random selection of songs with no overarching theme, or something made with more deliberate intent? The answer seems to be: all these things. It lasts less than half an hour, and is noticeably, if not entirely, lacking the soul-searching that helped define its predecessor. The lyrics tend to stick to braggadocio and reaffirmations of the nihilistic persona Tyler inhabited in the days when he was deemed such a threat to the country’s morals that anti-terrorism legistation was invoked toban him from the UK: the first, but far from last, mention of him not giving a fuck about anything arrives less than 30 seconds into the album. There are a lot of memorable one-liners, among which “I don’t trust white people with dreadlocks” and his dismissal of an ageing rival stand out: “49, still in the street / Your prostate exam in a week.”Tyler, the Creator: Stop Playing With Me – videoIt also eschews Chromakopia’s kaleidoscopic musical approach, its sudden leaps from Beach Boys harmony to Zamrock samples to guest spots from Lola Young and Lil Wayne. It’s still eclectic in its choice of source material – opener Big Poe samples Busta Rhymes and a2015 collaborative albummade by Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, Shye Ben Tzur and India’s Rajasthan Express – but ultimately feels more narrow and focused. Almost all of its 10 tracks seem fixated on the dancefloor. There are 808 beats, Kraftwerk-y electronics, a noticeable smattering of Zapp-like vocoder and electro, among other early 80s genres. Powered by a bassline that’s a dead ringer for that of Michael Jackson’s Off the Wall and decorated with washes of synthetic strings and a falsetto vocal, Ring Ring Ring feels like a lost Leroy Burgess boogie production from the same era. The huge, distorted breakbeat of Big Poe recalls the rhythms produced by the Bomb Squad in their prime, amplified by the stentorian, Chuck D-like tone of Pharrell Williams’s guest rap. Elsewhere, I’ll Take Care of You unexpectedly transforms from a beatless electronic ballad into something that – with its clattering rhythm and grimy sub-bass – most closely resembles old skool UK hardcore rave: in a neat bit of self-referentiality, the clattering rhythm is actually repurposed from the title track of Tyler’s 2015 albumCherry Bomb.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

The musical reference points are deployed with an evident love and understanding of the source material, never feeling like box-ticking or pastiche; the hooks work with enviable efficiency. It’s all funky enough that you imagine even the selfie-obsessed pocketing their phone and throwing themselves around if it came booming from some big speakers.But it’s also not the whole story. There are scattered moments when Don’t Tap the Glass feels of a piece with, or an addendum to, Chromakopia. In the middle of the album lurks the incongruous Mommanem, thick with the grunts and gasps and feral barks that were Chromakopia’s sonic signature. On the concluding Tell Me What It Is, Tyler suddenly drops the boasts and the IDGAF stuff in favour of precisely the heartsore self-examination that characterised his previous album, the sentiments amplified by the untutored frailty of his singing voice: “I’m feeling like a bum … is there a traffic to my soul? I need answers … Why can’t I find love?”It’s an odd way to end an album that seems largely about not overthinking things and simply giving yourself up to the moment, but, then, this is the man who once rapped “I’m a fucking walking paradox / No I’m not.” Fourteen years on,Tyler, the Creatorclearly still reserves the right to be contradictory. When the results are as good as Don’t Tap the Glass, who can blame him?This week Alexis listened toBlood Orange – The FieldNot a song of the summer in the accepted dancefloor banger sense, but The Field’s Durutti Column sample, skittering beats and ethereal vocals (by Caroline Polachek and Daniel Caesar) are the perfect soundtrack to a languid afternoon.Explore more on these topicsMusicAlexis Petridis's album of the weekTyler, the CreatorRapalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

This well-crafted concert byEnsemble Intercontemporain, the orchestra Boulez founded in 1976, avoided the obvious hits while demonstrating just how different their music could be.Berio’s Sequenza V for solo trombone is one of 14 pieces he wrote to test the boundaries of particular instruments or vocal types. It was inspired byGrock, a Swiss-born clown and one-time neighbour of the composer, whose personality had fascinated him as a boy.Lucas Ounissi, ambling on in full circus slap and a lime-green wig, put his instrument through its paces. Juggling a handheld plunger mute, he rasped and farted away, frequently singing and playing at the same time. A virtuoso performance showed off the breadth of the composer’s imagination as well as his singular sense of humour.View image in fullscreenActed a good fight … Sarah Aristodou sings Berio’s Recital IPhotograph: Chris Christodoulou/BBCThe more sober-minded Boulez was represented by his Dialogue de l’ombre double (Dialogue of the Double Shadow). Written to celebrate Berio’s 60th birthday, it pits an on-stage clarinettist against his pre-recorded doppelganger, the latter electronically manipulated in real time and piped into the auditorium through speakers. The versatileJérôme Comtehot-desked from one music stand to another, taking melismatic licks and frenetic outbursts in his stride. Rock-solid technique and calm deliberation brought clarity and purpose to Boulez’s intricate demands. The pre-record, meanwhile, bounced off the walls and ceiling of the Royal Albert Hall in a mesmerising wash of surround sound.The grand finale was Berio’s Recital I (For Cathy), a piece the composer wrote in 1972 for his former wife Cathy Berberian. The conceit is theatrical: an operatic diva shows up for a recital only to find her accompanist isn’t there. An ensemble of 17 takes up the cause, with the singer descending into madness as she tosses off scatter-gun quotes from vocal works of the past. Berberian’s visceral account, captured on record, was a tour de force. Sarah Aristidou certainly acted a good fight, with conductor Pierre Bleuse gamely adding his dramatic six penn’orth, but the spoken text was barely audible, rendering the work more gnomic than usual.Listen again on BBC Soundsuntil 12 October.

Ahead of the lunch crowd making forPapa’s Fish & Chipsrestaurant, I’m taking a seat in the pier’s ballroom to hear seaside historian Kathryn Ferry talk about her latest book,Twentieth Century Seaside Architecture.Ordering a pot of tea, I’m taken back to my student days. Back in the late 1990s, the ballroom hostedPier 39, a sticky-floored nightclub where getting your heels wedged in the planks after too many vodkas was considered par for the course. Following a shift waitressing at a nearby fish restaurant, our girl gang would douse our hair in Charlie Red body spray to mask the fug of haddock before dancing the night away where the Humber estuary meets the North Sea.Cleethorpes mapThe pier first opened on August bank holiday 1873 to a flock of locals and day-trippers, many of whom were taking some of the first train and ferry-service packages across the Humber from South Yorkshire and the Midlands. It’s not hard to imagine the giddy thrill of glimpsing this elegant pavilion structure for the very first time: it stretched 365 metres into the sea.I grew up in Grimsby, where Cleethorpes had long felt like a sandy wonderland, filled with bright lights and sugar highsFerry cites the pier as one of a trove of local architectural treasures: postwar buildings with funky rooflines, illuminations, shops fronted with Victorian cast-iron verandas … “enough surviving seaside things”, she tells the crowd, “to ensure Cleethorpes retains its very distinctive feel”.I grew up in Grimsby, just a couple of miles up the road. Cleethorpes had long felt like a sandy wonderland, filled with bright lights and sugar highs. During the pandemic, after 20 years living away, I came back to Cleethorpes from London and I now feel lucky to be raising a family in the sandy footsteps of my childhood. Summer feels magical – we are tourists at home. My nine-year-old and toddler both love splashing about in the free,open-air paddling pool, riding the dinkyCleethorpes Coast Light Railwayand cycling along Buck Beck – a long, calming coastal path where ice-cream at the family-runBrew Stopcafe is a rite of passage. In summer, you can rent the owners’ little beach hut and watch the world go by from your stripy deckchair.View image in fullscreenA pre-war ‘It’s quicker by rail’ poster.Photograph: Artwork by Andrew Johnson. Science & Society Picture Library/Getty ImagesDuring my university and London years – roughly 2000 to 2020 – the resort’s cultural identity began to shift with the closure of iconic venues such as, in 2007, the Winter Gardens. An entertainment venue dating back to the 1930s, its stage was once graced by acts including Elton John, the Clash and Roxy Music, not to mention playing host to the feted “Bags Ball” weekly dance night. Also closed, after a 23-year run as one of the area’s leading theme parks, was Pleasure Island and its beloved Boomerang ride, which ceased functioning in 2016. And some of the area’s big-draw events – including the Radio 1 Roadshow, which made its last stop here in 1999 fronted by S Club 7 – were scratched from the listings. In the words of one local: “It felt like the fun police had come to town.”Now, building on events such as theSummer Steam festivaland theGreat Grub Fest, there’s a definite sense of cultural renaissance brewing. Cleethorpes seafront is in the process of a long-awaited£18.4m regeneration projectthat will focus on a reimagining of the Pier Gardens and the reintroduction of the old market place. With a potentialdirect train link from Cleethorpes to Londonin the offing, the resort is extending its bucket-and-spade appeal to a new generation.On 2August – with the stage still warm from sets by the Charlatans and Ash as part ofDocksFest– Cleethorpes’ Meridian showground is set to transform into an open-air celebration of cool and contemporary sounds covering jazz, funk and soul, as the area’s newest festival,Everybody Loves the Sunshine, lays down 10 hours of live music for just £10 a ticket. Together with Brighton-based record label Tru Thoughts, the festival is curated bythe Culture House, a local charity that has been instrumental in plugging the cultural gap across North East Lincolnshire, an area that can often feel on the fringes of the national arts and culture scene.The sandy dunes around the Humber Mouth Yacht Club are the perfect spot for big-sky sundowners and picnicsBeyond the music, nature abounds. AtMarine Embankment beach, bird lovers can spy curlews, lapwings and oystercatchers nesting in the saltmarshes (check tide times), while the sandy dunes around theHumber Mouth Yacht Club(about an hour’s walk from the Pier) are the perfect spot for big-sky sundowners and picnics.Steel & Soulruns a blissful drop-in morning yoga class on the beach here every other Sunday until the end of September (£10 a class).A must-visit at this end of the town is the Humberston Fitties, an otherworldly village of about 300 beach chalets that sprang up beside the sand dunes after the first world war. Many of these small dwellings, including artistSarah Palmer’s home(£80 a night for a two-night minimum stay, sleeps up to four), are available to rent and make a cosy weekend base.For a stylish home-from-home in the heart of Cleethorpes, check intoClovesB&B (from £95), tucked off the main promenade. Hosts Nick and Maria Ross serve up beautiful home-cooked breakfasts, and if you land on a Friday you can build a picnic hamper from their pop-up larder, which sells freshly baked sourdough and pastries, as well as fruit, veg, cheese, butter and juices, many of which are organic and locally produced. From Saturday to Tuesday, the Edwardian breakfast room then transforms into Cafe Cloves, an intimate dining spot serving a menu of five seasonal dishes. On our last visit, we shared tandoori king prawn skewers with a chopped spinach and red onion salad, cucumber raita and charred lime along with the signature Cloves fishcake – which I could happily eat every day.View image in fullscreenCloves B&B.Photograph: Katie BuffeyAnother great spot for lunch isNasturtium, where head chef Jack Phillips riffs on classics such as catch of the day with a smoked butter sauce, Japanese kosho and a tempura enoki (fried floured mushrooms). Phillips also channels his passion for Asian cooking through his popular pop-up food stallWakame Cleethorpes. Follow up lunch with a mooch down Sea View Street forboutique threadsand heavenlyplants and flowers, ending with a slice of lemon meringue pie atMarples.As for fish and chips – you’re spoilt for choice. An old-fashioned booth atSteel’s Cornerhouse Restaurantfor haddock, chips and a pot of tea with bread and butter always feels special. Or, if the weather’s fine, nothing beats walking along the beach with a Papa’s takeaway, eating a tray of chips drenched in vinegar, with the sand between your toes.“Cleethorpes feels like a sleeper, on the cusp of being awakened,” says Kathryn Ferry.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.In one section of my first book,Corker: A Deeply Unserious Wine Book, I sought to address the single-biggest DM slide I get every summer: what wines to bring to a barbecue. And the reason this is my most common request is pretty simple: where I live, in London, being invited to a barbecue means you have a friend with a garden, whereas most of us are concertinaed into blocks of flats and house shares.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The prospect of spending a hot afternoon outdoors and with a glass of something delicious is far more delightful than the idea of spending it in my sweaty room surrounded by black clothing (an excellent heat-insulating technique, by the way), especially if it involves an actual garden and generous pals. That’s an occasion to which you want to bring a bottle of something good.In the book, I suggested a red Côtes du Rhône, and the thinking behind that is also simple: Côtes du Rhône is sublime when drunk slightly chilled (drag it out of the ice bucket 10 minutes before you want to pour), it pairs well with most things that you can chuck on a barbecue, and you can buy more than one bottle without completelyrinsing your bank account. See also: gamay, barbera, barbaresco, pinot noir, malbec and darker rosés.However, this year, I want to expand my horizons beyond the obvious pulls, not least because there’s a sincere satisfaction to be found in an unexpected but undeniably congruous wine and food pairing. So I asked a few friends in the know for their off-the-beaten-track recommendations.Aleesha Hansel, a wine writer and broadcaster, offers this advice: “Barbecues aren’t the place to bring out your grand crus or the weird-and-wonderfuls. Wine people will usually recommend a wine to go with the food, which is often a red with a bit of spice or savouriness, but I think matching with the vibes is the best way to go, andméthode cap classiquesparkling wines tick that box for me. Look for bottles that are a bit richer and rounder – they remind me of golden-hour sunlight with their ripe, stone fruit flavours.”I alsohadto ask the sovereign of the grill,Christian Stevenson, AKA DJ BBQ, for his pointers on what to drink, because, well, if anyone knows what to drink with a barbecue, it’s him. He is likewise anti-red: “Vinho verdes and albariños are my go-to wines in summer. Lamb shoulder, pork shoulder, ribs, fish tacos and coal-roasted veg all rock nicely with those bottles. I’ll dive into a chewy red when it’s winter, but right now it’s summer, and I’m standing around hot coals in the sun.” Sounds like the man has a garden, so I’ll wait for my invitation in the post.Four unexpected wines that work with a barbecueNatural Mystic Vinho Verde£9.95 The Wine Society, 11.5%. With a touch of alvarinho, this is crisp, bright and citrussy.Chapel Down English Rose£12.50 (on offer) Ocado, 12.5%.

The principal reason for this was the overcooked rice, which was my fault for three reasons: I was using a brand I have never used before and didn’t read the packet; I forgot to set the kitchen timer; and I ignored my instinct to tip it out (dog? Cake? Compost? Bin?) and start again. To my overcooked rice I added not-tasty tomatoes, tough minced parsley, extra-virgin olive oil, a bit too much vinegar, olives, capers and hard-boiled eggs; I also added an expensive tin of tuna, which did a brilliant job of making the whole thing taste better, although still not good. Everyone agreed that it was a depressing dinner, then we went out for ice-cream.The good thing about making a bad rice salad is the need to redeem and reassure myself that I am capable of making not only a good one, but a great one, though I do appreciate that today’s first paragraph might make you doubt this. A good rice salad begins with well-cooked long-grain rice and involves a good balance of four vegetable elements: raw (tomatoes, red pepper, cucumber, celery, say), cooked (beans, courgettes, peas, sweetcorn), vegetables preserved in oil (peppers, mushrooms, artichoke hearts, aubergine), and pickled or salted vegetables (dill pickles, olives, capers, caper berries). There should also be some form of protein, whether that’s tuna, cheese, tofu, salami or wurstel; possibly involve (tender) herbs; be dressed with oil and a little vinegar; and always be finished with egg (slices, wedges or chopped – you decide).Just as important as the balance of ingredients is the balance of temperatures. Many people like their rice salad fridge-cold – in fact, another name for insalata di risoin Italy isriso freddo(cold rice). I prefer the rice, cooked vegetables and tomatoes to be at room temperature, and the raw and picked vegetable elements to be fridge-cold. Celery and dill pickles are particularly good chilled additions when added just before serving, then the room-temperature hard-boiled eggs can be arranged on top. A note about the herbs: I think the clean, slightly black pepper taste of parsley is great here (although taste if it has been sitting in the fridge for a while), along with a few aniseed fronds of dill, plus fresh marjoram, with its gentle pine taste and sweetness.My mother-in-law believes that a transparent bowl (plastic or glass) plays a key role in the flavour of rice salad, and I think I agree. Of course, the most important advice for rice salad is to make it in exactly the way you like it, and serve it at a temperature you like, and to ensure that there is plenty of ice-cream (cold but at scooping temperature) for afters.Rice salad with red peppers, celery, herbs and eggServes4Salt and black pepper300g long-grain riceExtra-virgin olive oilFinely grated zest of 1 lemonRed-wine or sherry vinegar(optional)1 very big handfulminced herbs(parsley, marjoram, chives, mint, dill)1350g jar preserved red peppers, drained and chopped into bits300g cooked green beans, chopped into short lengths145g (1 tin) tuna in olive oil(optional)2 celery sticks, strings pulled away and discarded, flesh finely dicedA few dill pickles,diced4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and each cut into 8 wedges or finely choppedBring a large pan of water to a boil and season with salt.

Taste and adjust the seasoning. The salad can now sit until you are ready to eat, in or out of the fridge – you decide.Just before serving, add the celery and dill pickles, toss again, and top with the hard-boiled egg. Zigzag with little more olive oil and serve.Explore more on these topicsSaladA kitchen in RomeFoodItalian food and drinkRiceVegetablesrecipesShareReuse this content"
