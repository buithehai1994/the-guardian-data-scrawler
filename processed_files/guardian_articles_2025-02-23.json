According to ABC News, the agency was seeking additional guidance from the US justice department on next steps.“FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,” Patel’s message read. “The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures. When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”Patel’s missive came amidreports on Sundayindicated that he was expected to be named acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a domestic law enforcement agency that – like the FBI – sits within the Department of Justice.Separately, the US attorney John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of New York, also sent a message to his staff to hold off, according to the outlet.“Of course, a majority of our work is law enforcement sensitive (in addition to much classified work), so even assuming this is legitimate, we will need to be careful in how we respond to this inquiry. As noted, the deadline isn’t until 11.59pm on Monday, so we have plenty of time,” Durham wrote in his letter.And the Department of Defense reportedly told employees to pause responding to the OPM message.“The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,” the force’s undersecretary for personnel and readinesssaidin a message, CNN’s Natasha Bertrand reported on Sunday. “When and if required, the department will coordinate responses to the email you have received from OPM.”Trump’s national health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, however, evidently did not follow the leads of Patel, Durham and the defense department. He required that his staff comply with the OPM directive, according to a copy of an email reported on by Sam Stein of the Bulwark.“This is a legitimate email,” Kennedy’s agency said in an email to staffers. “Please read and respond per the instructions.”Musk, who has been tasked to ostensiblycut government costsduring Donald Trump’s second presidency, telegraphed the extraordinary request on his social media network on Saturday.“Consistent with [Trump’s] instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”Shortly afterwards, federal employees – including some judges, court staff and federal prison officials – received a three-line email with this instruction: “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.”The deadline to reply was listed as Monday at 11.59pm, although the email did not include Musk’s social media threat about those who fail to respond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In fire both new and career workers, the White House and Musk’s so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) have been telling agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force” and freeze trillions of dollars in federal grant funds.There is no official figure available for the total number of firings or layoffs so far, but the Associated Press has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside Washington. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.Musk on Fridaycelebratedhis new role at a gathering of conservatives by waving a giant chainsaw in the air. He called it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy” and said “waste is pretty much everywhere” in the federal government.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It came as a “grant” rather than as “debt” that had to be repaid.“I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later,” he said.Zelenskyy said any deal was contingent on the US administration providing security guarantees to stop Russia from violating any future ceasefire – something it has so far refused to do.Ukraine’s president also revealed the onerous financial terms which Washington is seeking to impose.For every $1 of any future military aid Kyiv has to pay back $2 – an interest rate, Zelenskyy noted, of 100%. The same conditions were not applied to Israel, the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia, he remarked, saying he had asked for an explanation but not received one.Zelenskyy insisted he wanted good, “friendly” relations with America – a “strategic partner” - and shrugged offTrump’s bruising description of him as a “dictator”for not holding elections during wartime. “Why should I be offended? A dictator would be offended by being called a dictator,” he said, pointing out he won the last 2019 election with 73% of the vote.He added that he wasready to quit as president if it meant “peace for Ukraine”or membership of Nato, something the US and some other Nato member states oppose. “I don’t plan to stay in power for decades. But we won’t let Putin stay in power over Ukrainian territories either,” he said. “It’s important what Ukrainians think of me,” he added.The press conference was held just hours afterRussia launched its biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones. At least four people were killed across the country. Kyiv echoed with the booms of anti-aircraft fire, as crews spent much of the night trying to shoot the drones down. Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said.Zelenskyy said the massive attack demonstrated it was not feasible to conduct a poll under severe wartime conditions. “How can we do this in Sumy? Are we supposed to send election observers to Pokrovsk?” he asked, referring to two Ukrainian cities on the frontline under constant bombardment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He pointed out that elections were illegal under martial law and that it would be impossible for soldiers standing in trenches to take part.On Saturday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump was “very confident” an agreement could be made to end the war as early as “this week”.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff hinted that a motivation for Washington to achieve a peace deal was to allow US companies to do business in Russia again.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersSteve Witkoff, one of Trump’s special envoys, hinted on Sunday in a separate interview with CBS News that a motivation for Washington for seeking a Ukraine peace deal was so that American companies would be able to do business again in Russia, which is under sanctions. “Obviously there would be an expectation that if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there. And I think that everybody would believe that that would be a positive, good thing to happen,” Witkoff told the Face The Nation programme.US and Russian negotiators are expected to have a second round of talks, followingtheir meeting last week in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.Zelenskyy said it was not possible to reach a meaningful peace deal without Ukraine’s involvement, or without the participation of the EU, the UK and other strategic partners. “It’s impossible to finish the war without one party, without Ukraine. Any bilateral US-Russia deal “would not have any success” or halt the war, he predicted.Zelenskyy conceded his armed forces would lose 20% of international military support, should the Trump administration stop all deliveries. He said Ukraine was still waiting on deliveries of weapons agreed at the Nato summit in Washington last summer, and need another 20 Patriot missile batteries – costing $30bn- to counter Russian air attacks.He said he welcomedthe role played by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump this week. “Of course the UK has to be at the table,” Zelenskyy said. He said he expected a European summit to take place after their US trips to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Look at the number of draws, people have said. Is this a wobble? The club have won one league title since 1990 so a few nerves ought to come as standard.And yet, at the home of the soon‑to‑be‑deposed champions, when Liverpool had to win the match to clamp one hand firmly on the Premier League trophy – to take advantage of Arsenal’sshock home defeatby West Ham on Saturday – there was only assurance; a never-in-doubt result.A bit of context. Liverpool had entered the Etihad Stadium on an unbeaten league run of 22 matches. They have lost just once in the competition all season and not at all on their travels. They are not really wobbling. Perhaps their rivals just want to cling to something.Liverpool in ‘good position’  after win at Manchester City, says Arne SlotRead moreThere was nothing for any of them here, certainly notManchester City, who went with the kind of meekness that has been associated with them too often during this deep winter of discontent. The race feels run, Liverpool 11 points clear of Arsenal. Arne Slot’s team have simply been remorseless.If one player symbolises the quality it isMohamed Salah. The right-sided attacker gave his latest virtuoso display, scoring the opening goal and setting up Dominik Szoboszlai for the second, the game done and dusted by half-time.Salah has 30 goals and 21 assists from 38 appearances in all competitions this season. Is there any doubt that the club must give Mo his dough to stop him leaving as a free agent?View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah, from a well-worked corner routine, scores Liverpool’s first goal at Manchester City.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APThe question for City had concerned whether a champion team had a haymaker left in them at the end of an era. They did not. After theChampions League drubbing at Real Madridlast Wednesday, this was another setback marked by the absence of surprise. “We’re gonna win the league,” the Liverpool fans chanted towards the end, no nerves from them now. Nobody felt ready to disagree.It was a showpiece where the tactical nuances were pronounced, Pep Guardiola reacting to the absence of Erling Haaland because of knee trouble by giving Phil Foden and Omar Marmoush central attacking roles. Slot did the same with Szoboszlai and Curtis Jones. It was a battle of the false 9s, albeit Marmoush is probably a purer version. It was 4-2-4 against 4-2-4, albeit the systems were not straightforward, partly because Rico Lewis stepped up and inside from right-back for City.The breakthrough goal was a tactical triumph for Slot. City had started brightly, Jérémy Doku showing his twinkle toes on the left wing, but they were undone by a corner routine that was straight from the Liverpool training ground.Alexis Mac Allister drove it in low for Szoboszlai, who had sprinted towards the near post, and he flicked it back for Salah, who had drifted into space close to the penalty spot. Szoboszlai’s first-time touch was deft; Salah’s first-time finish flew home with the aid of a deflection off Nathan Aké. Liverpool had won the corner after they brought a high press to rob Lewis.Salah was in highlights-reel mood. There was the moment in the first half when he blazed away from Aké and was stopped only by a decent block by Abdukodir Khusanov. There was another one when Salah released the overlapping Trent Alexander‑Arnold with a lovely pass; the City defenders had stood off him, afraid of what he might do.City tried to work their patterns and Marmoush had the ball in the net on the half-hour from a Foden pass only to be pulled up for offside. It was all too predictable from them and Liverpool were comfortable, Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk towers of strength at the back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Szoboszlai looked offside when Alexander-Arnold whipped a high ball up the inside right and so he stopped, briefly, but Salah, who was onside, most assuredly did not. He raced on to the pass and when he squared for Szoboszlai – active in the second phase – the midfielder flashed a low shot past Ederson.The City fans had wanted to make a couple of points with their pre-match tifos. “City won four in a row,” went the wording on one, even if they know there will be no fifth straight league title this season. “This means four,” read another. They have their history.

He seemed particularly keen to explain what he wanted from Marmoush in terms of pressing. The Liverpool players stuck to the plan. They have so much faith in it.They got runners in behind City’s high line after the break and only a tight offside decision from the video assistant referee denied Jones a goal for 3-0. The lines came out to show that Szoboszlai had moved too early on to a Ryan Gravenberch pass before teeing up the tap‑in. A little earlier, Khusanov had got back to tackle Luis Díaz, while the Liverpool winger would also work Ederson.For City, Marmoush drew a fine save out of Alisson but there was not much else. Liverpool might have scored again only for Khusanov to make a big block to thwart Szoboszlai. Who had played the pass? Salah, of course.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityLiverpoolMohamed Salahmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Platelets are cell-like fragments that circulate in the blood that help form blood clots to stop bleeding or help wounds heal.Archbishop Rino Fisichella, a senior Vatican official, told participants at a mass in St Peter’s Basilica on Sunday morning they should make their prayers for Francis “stronger and more intense”.In a message published in lieu of his weekly Sunday Angelus prayer, which he normally delivers from a window overlooking St Peter’s Square, Francis thanked medical staff.“I am confidently continuing my hospitalisation at the Gemelli hospital, carrying on with the necessary treatment – and rest is also part of the therapy!” he said.“I ask you to pray for me,” he concluded in the message that was written in “recent days”.In New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan admitted what church leaders in Rome were not saying publicly: that the Catholic faithful were united “at the bedside of a dying father”.“As our Holy Father Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health, and probably close to death,” Dolan said at St Patrick’s Cathedral, without saying if he had independent information about the pope’s condition.Francis, who has beenhead of the Catholic church since 2013, was initially admitted to the Gemelli – which has a special suite for popes – on 14 February with bronchitis.Doctors first diagnosed the complex viral, bacterial and fungal respiratory tract infection and then the onset of pneumonia in both lungs.They prescribed “absolute rest” and a combination of cortisone and antibiotics, along with supplemental oxygen when needed.In its evening update on Saturday, the Vatican said the pope had suffered a difficult day and his “condition continues to be critical, therefore … the pope is not out of danger”.Dr Sergio Alfieri, the head of medicine and surgery at Gemelli hospital, said: “He knows he’s in danger, and he told us to relay that.”“The pope gets worse,” Italy’s Corriere della Sera newspaper had said in its Sunday edition, while La Repubblica described it as the “darkest day” at the Vatican.Francis has said the papacy is a job for life, but has also left the door open to resigning like his predecessor. Thelate Benedict XVIbecamethe first pope to resign in almost 600 years, citing his advanced age and deteriorating strength.The Vatican hierarchy tried to tamp down speculation that the pope might decide to resign. There is no provision in canon law for what to do if a pope becomes incapacitated.Francis has said that he has written a letter of resignation that would be invoked if he were medically incapable of making such a decision.The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, gave a rare interview to Corriere della Sera to respond to rumours about a possible resignation after the Vatican issued an unusual and official denial of an Italian media report that said Parolin and the pope’s chief canonist had visited Francis in the hospital in secret.Given the canonical requirements to make a resignation legitimate, the implications of such a meeting were significant, but the Vatican denied that any such meeting occurred.Parolin said such speculation seemed “useless” when what really mattered was the health of the pope, his recovery and return to the Vatican.The 88-year-old pope has maintained a punishing work schedule, despite increasing health issues. Last September, he carried outa mammoth 12-day tour to the Asia Pacific, one of the few places in the world where the Catholic church is growing in terms of baptised faithful and religious vocations.Associated Press, AFP and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsPope FrancisVaticanCatholicismChristianityItalyEuropeThe papacynewsShareReuse this content"

Reynolds told the Guardian that sealing the deal was “a top priority” for him and that he was “not afraid to take the tough decisions needed”.“We’ve seen trade secretaries come and go, and while their efforts have been sincere, it’s no secret that British businesses have nothing to show for it in terms of a final product,” he said. “They need a trade deal they can actually use to cut costs, grow their business and expand in the massive Indian market. That’s what this government is going to get them.”During his visit to India, Reynolds and Goyal will visit BT India’s office in Gurugram. Poppy Gustafsson, the investment minister, is expected to hold business engagements in Mumbai and Bengaluru.Saif Malik, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, which has been operating in India for more than 160 years, said the opportunities of a trade deal for businesses were “significant”.“Whether it’s improved access to India’s growing consumer market, opportunities in manufacturing, infrastructure and innovation, or collaboration in financial and professional services, the relaunch of trade talks can unlock even greater trade, investment and prosperity across the UK-India corridor,” he said.The UK and India are the sixth and fifth largest global economies respectively, with a trade relationship worth £41bn. India is forecast to become the third-largest world economy by 2028.The country is a notoriously tough negotiator on trade, however. Narendra Modi’s government signed a £79bn agreement with the European Free Trade Association – a bloc made up of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein – in the spring, 16 years after talks began. Donald Trump said this month that Modi was a “much tougher” negotiator than him.Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both set Diwali deadlines to reach agreements but failed to get them over the line. Under Sunak, negotiators got close to finalising a deal but this was put on ice when the UK election was triggered.As part of the deal, the UK has asked for lower tariffs on goods such as cars and whisky, and increased access for British lawyers and financial services companies to the Indian market. In return, India has asked for faster and easier processing arrangements for its companies to send workers to the UK.One sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas have to pay national insurance despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.The Guardian revealed in the spring that India has also asked for an exemption from the UK’s planned carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) – a planned tax on the import of carbon-intensive goods such as steel, glass and fertiliser – on the basis that it is a developing country.Any decision to exempt India from a carbon tax would be controversial. The plans are designed to reduce emissions and support UK steel producers by levelling the playing field with countries that have a lower or no carbon levy.Ministers have recently touted a number of life sciences and tech companies that are increasing their exports to India. About £17bn goods and services were exported in total by UK businesses to the country in 12 months to September 2024.Among the British businesses exporting to India are Radio Design, which has its headquarters in Shipley, West Yorkshire, and has opened a manufacturing facility in India, and the tech company marcusevans group, which has established its global tech operations in Mumbai.ApplianSys, a tech company based in Coventry that offers internet-based education services, has developed a pilot to be used across almost 5,000 Indian schools.Reynolds said tech and life sciences were “two huge growth sectors for the UK” and that their exports into the Indian market “will amount to tens of millions of pounds for the UK economy”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaEconomic policySouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

He was a private person with the biggest of hearts, who wrote immensely moving, meaningful songs that will continue to find people for years to come.”It continued: “For now, we remember Bill’s legacy as the ‘man in the corner of the room at the piano’, who quietly wrote heartfelt songs that touched and connected with people around the world.”Cult singer-songwriter Bill Fay: ‘I didn’t leave the music business, the music business left me!’Read moreStarting his career in 1967, Fay’s self-titled debut in 1970 and its follow-up, Time of the Last Persecution (1971), had limited commercial success, but his work was rediscovered in the 1990s, when the albums were reissued, and he became a cult figure.Archival releases of demos, and recordings from 1978 to 1981 were released during the 2000s, before Fay released his first studio album in more than 40 years, Life Is People, in 2012 on Dead Oceans.Fay released two more albums: Who Is the Sender? (2015) and Countless Branches (2020).During his comeback, Fay was reluctant to play live. He made only one television appearance, on the BBC music show Later … With Jools Holland.The singer was credited by numerous artists as an influence. Artists including the War on Drugs, Wilco, Pavement and the Soft Cell singer Marc Almond covered his songs.A version of Fay’s song Be Not So Fearful, performed by AC Newman, featured in the US horror drama series The Walking Dead.Fay was born in London in September 1943 and went to college in Wales to study electronics, where he began to write songs on piano and harmonium.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicnewsShareReuse this content"

No clothes or belongings were discovered on the shoreline, and no car or bicycle was found nearby, despite it being a seven-mile hike to the nearest bus stop.A postmortem examination failed to find any DNA or fingerprint matches and two police appeals for information about the man were unsuccessful.Now, more than four months after the body was discovered in Claerwen Reservoir in Powys, Dyfed-Powys police have released an image of the wetsuit in the hope that someone can help them solve the mystery of his identity.Dyfed-Powys Police issued an appeal containing an image of the wetsuit.Photograph: Dyfed-Powys PoliceThe anonymous man was found on 18 October after a member of the public spotted his body in the water just before 8.30am. It is estimated his remains may have been decomposing in the water for up to 12 weeks.A postmortem examination confirmed that the body belonged to a man, aged between 30 and 60 years old, who was approximately 6ft tall.DI Angela Ponting said he was found wearing a “Zone 3 Agile wetsuit”. The size of the wetsuit is XL, indicating that the man was possibly between 6ft (183cm) to 6ft 5in (196cm) tall and weighed 202 to 220lbs (92-100kg), with a 44 to 48 inch chest.It is understood that the police spoke to Interpol to try to ascertain the man’s identity, as the remote reservoir can be popular with tourists.Ponting said: “We have carried out numerous enquiries, including checking missing people records with other forces and conducting forensic enquiries both locally and wider in conjunction with law enforcement partners.“Unfortunately, these have not led to the man being identified.“We are keeping an open mind into the circumstances and continue to work towards finding out who he was, any family and what happened to him.”She said police would like to hear from anyone who visited the Claerwen Reservoir or the surrounding area between the beginning of July 2024 and 18 October, and anyone who thinks the information issued by the police “could relate to a missing person in their own life”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if he was dumped why put him in a wetsuit?”Alan Austin, who chairs a local rambling group and regularly walks in the area, added that he has “never” seen anyone swimming in the “very cold” water of Claerwen Reservoir.“It can be extremely dangerous,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

A file will be prepared for the coroner.Hall’s car, a red Ford Focus, was found on Wednesday parked on the B6278, near remote moorland between Eggleston and Stanhope.A major police search was launched after Hall’s disappearance. Mountain rescue teams, with their specialist drones and sniffer dogs, had combed the Hamsterley Forest and the surrounding areas for a trace of Hall since she went missing.Digital intelligence officers also carried out extensive inquiries into Hall’s mobile phone, smartwatch and running apps.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Please plan journeys carefully and do not drive through flood water. It is often deeper than it looks and just 30cm of flowing water is enough to float your car.”The Met Office has also issued a series of less severe yellow warnings for wind and rain covering much of the UK including Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland, northern England, south-west England and the West Midlands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But now the question was what exactly it meant for the millions of Germans who were either racialised, like him, or who are migrants.Germany has voted. But what kind of government will it have?Read moreHe was among the many who had gathered outside the hull-shaped headquarters of the CDU to take in the results of the election. Unlike the party faithful who had neatly filed into the building earlier, David was not there to celebrate but part of a protest rally organised by an alliance of several civil society groups.“I’m here outside the CDU because it will be them who decide how much they give to the AfD – I’m here to hold them accountable,” he said.While Merz has ruled out any formal cooperation with the AfD,he leaned on the partyduring the campaign to support a non-binding resolution on border policy, marking a historic breach of a taboo.His willingness to do so, and the election result – in which the AfD nearly doubled its share of votes from 2021 – have added to concerns about the influence the far-right party could have in Germany’s parliament.Half of the country’s voters had chosen to cast their ballot for either the CDU/CSU bloc or the AfD, pointed out Gian Mecheril, 32. “That means that the coalition of fascists with the conservative party is possible,” he said. “It’s a danger.”View image in fullscreenGian Mecheril, 32.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianOn Sunday night Merz again insisted there was “no question” of entering into coalition with the far-right party. But for the millions of Germans who regard the AfD as an unprecedented threat, that is of little comfort, particularly after a campaign marked by political rhetoric against migrants, while issues such as country’s ailing economy, deteriorating infrastructure or housing crisis were seemingly ignored.“The campaign was just filled with racist diversions from the actual problems we face,” said Flo, 19. “I’m anxious about what comes next.”The result was a divisive election that had helped to legitimise the far right, said Ella, 30. “The CDU’s win comes on the shoulders of the AfD,” she said. “They worked with them, they normalised them.”Tens of thousands sought to fight back in recent weeks, taking to streets across Germany to protest against the far right and the AfD’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, as she backed the mass deportation of migrants and peddled a party whose ranks include members who have played down the horrors of the Holocaust and chapters that have been designated as “rightwing extremist” by security authorities.“I would say the AfD is the ridiculous monster our period needs to have,” said Willi Schultz, 32, in a reference to the oft-cited quote attributed to Antonio Gramsci: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”He contextualised the AfD support within the wider, global surge of backing for rightwing populists – a link reinforced during the election as Elon Musk used his influence to tout the AfD, describing it as the only party able to “save Germany”.The election had laid bare Germany’s fragmented political landscape, said Charlotte, 21. Merz could need one or two parties to form a coalition, probably the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens.“I don’t know what kind of coalition we’re going to have now, but I think it won’t be easy to make new laws and to keep politics going here in Germany,” Charlotte said. “I feel like we’ve forgotten how to speak with each other. We’re just more against each other rather than trying to understand each other’s position.”Conservatives win German election but far-right AfD doubles supportRead moreA case in point, she added, were the one in five voters who had cast their ballot for the far right. The AfD proved particularly strong among in the 25-34 age bracket, receiving 22% of the vote, ahead of the CDU/CSU at 18%, and the Greens and Die Linke at 16% each.“I wish it wasn’t like that, but there’s a big part of the people who think that they are not being seen by politicians right now. So they vote for the AfD.”It remained to be seen what that would now mean for the world’s third largest economic power and most populous EU country. Recent weeks have underscored the scope of the challenge asEuropegrapples with the breakdown of the transatlantic alliance under Donald Trump and looming threats to European security.“The campaign was very much about migration, not anything else, even though we have these big problems to face with Trump and Putin,” said Charlotte. “I wish that had received more attention.”For some, there was some solace to be taken from the late-campaign comeback of the far-left Die Linke, who drew more than 8% of the vote.“It’s like a win for all of us,” said Liv Michel, 25. “It’s a win for everybody who’s afraid right now because of the rightwing movement in Germany.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trump’s decision has plunged editors and reporters there into new depths of uncertainty and fear.mapMany of the journalists in exile take tremendous risks on both sides of the border. On one side, documenting atrocities committed by the military junta, which violently seized power in a February 2021 coup; on the other, living with the constant threat of detention and arrest, given that many live in Thailand without proper documentation.Now, financial stress and job cuts have been added to the list of occupational hazards.“We can say we have nothing now,” Su said. “As soon as I wake up, I have to think about money.”Operating on a shoestring budget that was entirely reliant on USAid funding, Su works with a network of journalists in Mae Sot and a small cohort of citizen journalists inside Myanmar that she has trained to covertly file.A journalist of 20 years, Su, who has the documentation needed to live in Thailand, is now using her own funds to pay the salaries of her team – albeit at 50% – and providing them with a small home and cheap meals.“They don’t have money, they don’t have magic,” she said, “But they have decided to help each other, like providing some rice or oil for their daily needs.”Among his whirlwind of foreign policy decisions, Trump has suspended billions of dollars in projects backed by USAid, including more than $268m in independent media support.Trump’s aid cuts will lead to a surge in propaganda and misinformation, say press freedom groupsRead moreAUSAid factsheet, accessed by the press freedom campaign group Reporters Without Borders (RSF) before being taken offline, showed that in 2023 the US agency funded training and support for 6,200 journalists, assisted 707 non-state news outlets and supported 279 civil-society organisations dedicated to strengthening independent media in more than 30 countries, from Iran to Russia and Myanmar.‘Like a dark night’Myanmar’s independent press council estimates about 200 journalists in exile have faced “sudden impact” from Trump’s decision.“Some of my colleagues are still reporting, even though they know they won’t receive payment,” said Harry, 29, a journalist who asked to be identified only by his nickname for safety reasons.Harry, another Mae Sot journalist-in-exile, was among 20 reporters that was told by their regional news organisation that they would not be paid this January, although that hasn’t stopped him from working.“Burma is a living hell right now, but nobody seems to care,” he said. “So we have to keep reporting about it.”Since the 2021 coup, Myanmar’s military junta haskilled more than 6,000 people, arbitrarily detained more than 20,000 and led to the internal displacement of 3.5 million people, according to Amnesty International.The military has carried out widespread and systematic attacks against the civilian population nationwide, bombing schools, hospitals, and religious buildings with total impunity, Amnesty says.For journalists like Harry, returning home means facing inevitable conscription into the junta army – the violations of which he has been working to expose.Yoon, 27, who was inspired to became a journalist after the military seized power, works for a different media outlet, but she doesn’t know for how long. When her company broke the news of the funding cuts, she said everyone fell silent.“It was like a dark night. No one was talking … The speaker froze too,” she said, “For this month, February, the company will give me my salary … but that’s not stable.”Media organisations have warned the funding freeze will be a blessing for autocratic governments, particularly in countries such as Myanmar that lack independent media without it.“Whatever the decision made in the White House, I think the regime and its associates are gleefully happy to have heard this news,” said Aung Zaw, founder and editor-in-chief of the Irrawaddy, a news website founded in 1990.US funding, via Internews, a media non-profit that works in more than 100 countries, had accounted for about 35% of the Irrawaddy’s budget.“The regime is so afraid of us because they know that information is very powerful and their propaganda machine doesn’t work,” he said, describing the impact of the cuts as “huge”.The Irrawaddy, like all the others, is now drawing up a contingency plan. “There are a lot of sad decisions I have to make”, Zaw said.A chilling effectAcross the region, Myanmar’s media has been the hardest hit – but it is not alone. InCambodia, a country that has all but shuttered a free and independent press in recent years, several organisations are also scrambling to fund their future.Chan Thul, a Cambodian journalist and co-founder of media startup Kiripost which was relying on a USAid grant to fund half of its operations, said at first they thought Trump might change his mind.“But as the days pass by, we have heard the news again and again. So we are kind of becoming more hopeless every day,” he said, adding they will find a way to survive.In Indonesia, Wahyu Dhyatmika, an investigative journalist and head of digital at Tempo, says the cuts will have a “chilling effect” across south-east Asia.“This is also unfortunate because in the region we see a growing trend to authoritarianism. So we see the need for stronger media, stronger journalism, and we need all the support we can get.”Back in Mae Sot, Su says despite the risks, she feels compelled to keep reporting what is happening on the ground in Myanmar.“If we stay in Thailand we cannot have sympathy or empathy for them,” she says, “We have to go to see their real situation … That’s why we write.”Explore more on these topicsMyanmarCambodiaAsia PacificDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was living abroad and communicated with his parents on Skype. During these calls, his mother would sometimes repeat herself, asking the same question just minutes later. “We didn’t think much of it, we assumed it was due to technical problems.” Then his father mentioned that there was something wrong with her memory. “Mum being only 63, I didn’t believe him.” But two years later, during a Christmas break abroad, when his mother went upstairs to use the toilet and couldn’t find her way back down, they knew there was something up.Shirley was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 67 by a GP using a cognitive test that includes drawing a clock with a certain time on a piece of paper. She received the diagnosis via a letter that consisted of only one line. “I look at that letter and I am appalled by it,” says Chris. “My mother never saw a neurologist. It was such a thin diagnosis. We thought this can’t be right, she’s too young.”Shirley is now 75 and living with advanced-stage Alzheimer’s, the most common form of dementia, which affects memory, language and behaviour. The gold standard for diagnosing Alzheimer’s involves cognitive tests plus either a brain scan or cerebrospinal fluid sampling that reveal abnormal levels of the proteins amyloid and tau. But testing for these biomarkers is costly, and until recently there has been little incentive to diagnose the disease due to the lack of effective medication. “Only about 2% of individuals in the UK are being diagnosed using these methods,” says David Thomas of Alzheimer’s Research UK.Very soon, it may be possible to determine whether someone has Alzheimer’s using a simple drop of blood. In recent years, blood tests have been developed that arejust as goodat detecting Alzheimer’s biomarkers as expensive brain scans and painful lumbar punctures, where cerebrospinal fluid is drawn from the base of the spine. “There is a lot of excitement in the field,” says Thomas. “Blood tests would be a huge benefit to clinical practice if we could use them as a standard.” They are cheap, scalable and equitable.Blood tests could provide results much faster and accelerate the introduction of new drugs that rely on early diagnosisDavid Thomas, Alzheimer’s Research UKLast month, the first patients received blood tests aspart of two trialsbacked by Alzheimer’s Research UK and Alzheimer’s Society aiming to introduce blood tests in the UK within five years. The ADAPT (Alzheimer’s disease anti-inflammatory prevention trial)study is assessing a protein called p-tau217, which is specific for Alzheimer’s disease. “The trial will provide evidence on how to deploy blood tests in clinical practice,” says Thomas. “Who do you test and when do you test them?”The need for simple diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease has become more pressing with the approval of the amyloid-lowering drugs lecanemab and donanemab, which have been shown to have a modest effect in early stages of the disease. The drugs have been licensed in Britain but are not currently funded by the NHS because the benefits are too small to justify the costs. Although they reduce levels of amyloidosis in the brain, their effect on cognition is marginal.Some researchers suspect that this is because patients are treated too late, years after amyloid begins to accumulate in the brain. Given earlier, before symptoms arise, the drugs could prevent the buildup of amyloid and delay the onset of disease. Whether this is true is still an open question. The results ofcontinuing clinical trialsare expectedin the next years.However, accurately diagnosing Alzheimer’s will be essential for eligibility for clinical trials, regardless of the drug. And this is where blood tests have a huge potential. “They could provide results much faster and accelerate the introduction of new drugs that rely on early diagnosis,” says Thomas. “The conversation around the blood biomarkers and new therapies are very interconnected.”But blood-based biomarkers are also leading to profound changes in the way we think about Alzheimer’s disease. Last year, controversy erupted among researchers after the US Alzheimer’s Association publishedguidelinesproposing that individuals with abnormal biomarkers should be given a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s even if they have no clinical symptoms. According to this “biological definition”, Alzheimer’s begins when amyloid first accumulates in the brain, which may be decades before symptoms arise. These amyloid-positive individuals are considered to be in a “preclinical” stage of the disease.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In their view, cognitively unimpaired individuals with abnormal biomarkers are considered “at risk” of developing the disease. “The vast majority of amyloid-positive individuals will never develop symptoms in their lifetime,” says Nicolas Villain, a neurology professor at Sorbonne University in Paris and an author of the critique. “Labelling people who will never have symptoms with Alzheimer’s is deleterious.”Identifying risk factors that allow for early intervention is common in other areas of medicine. Early detection and treatment of hypertension, for instance, helps prevent cardiovascular disease. In Alzheimer’s, however, the roles that amyloid and tau play in the progression of the disease have not been fully elucidated. The idea of Alzheimer’s being one single continuum, dependent only on amyloid and tau biomarkers, is overly simplistic,writes Maartje Schermer, professor in the philosophy of medicine at Erasmus University Rotterdam.Narrowing the scope of diagnosisto amyloid and tau alone risks missing factors that could play a previously unknown role.It’s just a first step, but this new Alzheimer’s drug could be a huge breakthrough | Jonathan SchottRead moreLabelling biomarker-positive individuals as “preclinical” or “at risk” may seem like no big deal. “But semantics matter,” says Villain. “The difference is more crucial than it might initially appear.” For one, a biological definition would lead to a fourfold increase in “patient” cases. Moreover, a biological definition of Alzheimer’s changes the meaning of the disease that exists in popular discourse. “The idea we have now is that Alzheimer’s is an irreversible and fatal disease,” says Timothy Daly, a bioethicist at the University of Bordeaux. “The biological entity without symptoms is almost banal: you have disease biomarkers, but you’re not guaranteed to develop dementia.” Using risk factors to define disease will create confusion among patients, physicians and public health experts, he says.“There is no justification to test asymptomatic people outside clinical trials at the moment,” says Jonathan Schott, chief medical officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK and neurology professor at University College London, who co-wrote the critique and is running the ADAPT study. He adds: “Though I fear that with the availability of blood tests, some people will be self-testing against medical advice.”For now, according to Schott, having a biomarker-positive test is better thought of as an indication of risk rather than proof of the disease. “The challenge will be to work out which of these biomarker-positive individuals are at imminent risk of developing symptoms within a few years and offering them treatment,” he says. “But a simple blood test at the moment is insufficient for that.”Explore more on these topicsScienceThe ObserverAlzheimer'sHealthDementiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

These are some of the remnants of precious things the artist Kenturah Davis has salvaged from what is left of her Altadena home.Nearby, there is virtually nothing left of her parents’ home of 40 years. Gone are her mother’s intricately stitched quilts and a trove of paintings and sketches Davis’s father made of Hollywood backlots during his decades of working on television and movie sets.In the face of such enormous personal loss, the artist and her parents are taking part in efforts to preserve the legacy of Altadena, recording their stories for an audio project organised by the Black Trustee Alliance in collaboration with FriezeArtFair. “The more I talk to people, the more important it feels to find ways to uplift and sustain the special quality that Altadena has,” Davis says. The artist grew up in the neighbourhood, moving back in 2022 to raise her son there. “It meant everything to give my child the same environment I had growing up,” she says.View image in fullscreenKenturah Davis in her studio.Photograph: Courtesy of the artistLand Memories, as the project is called, is intended as “an ode to Altadena”, says Diane Jean-Mary, the executive director of the Black Trustee Alliance. It will focus on the history of the town as a place where a diverse, creative community has blossomed since the 1960s and 70s when Black families, prevented from buying homes elsewhere in the state, put down roots in the town. As the artist Dominique Moody says in her recording for the archive, it “was one of the few places where African Americans could actually buy a home … These people were really visionaries and made Altadena this rich, vibrant place.”Black families have also been disproportionately affected by the deadly Eaton fire. But, as Jean-Mary points out, in California, no one is immune. “Everyone here is affected by some of the implications for climate change on the arts,” she adds. “And, inLos Angeles, arts and entertainment power the entire city. The cultural sectoristhe economy.”There is now a sense of urgency in protecting Altadena’s legacy – the question for many residents is whether to stay and rebuild the community or leave. Within days of the fire, one burned-out plot reportedlysold for $100,000 over the asking priceand concerns are growing that developers may move in quickly and price people out. “Oftentimes following these events, people move, and they move quickly,” says Christine Messineo, the director of Americas at Frieze, the celebrated contemporary art fair taking place in four cities worldwide each year. “How the neighbourhood might look in the coming months and years is unpredictable.”A collaborative spirit informs most of the community-based projects unfolding across Los Angeles as Frieze opens this week – many of them concerned with supporting those affected by the wildfires. Outside the entrance to the fair, Lauren Halsey has created an “art booth” in collaboration with her fellow Angeleno artist Alake Shilling and students from Bret Harte preparatory middle school in South Central Los Angeles and the Rosebud academy in Altadena, which is among several schools severely damaged or destroyed in the fires.The booth also flags Halsey’s non-profit organisation Summaeverythang, which provides free, organic produce to residents in her South Central neighbourhood. Next year, she aims to open a $3m community centre on her street designed by the Los Angeles architect Barbara Bestor. It will be “a safe haven, a paradise”, as Halsey calls it, for local students.Los Angeles’ artists are at the heart of several initiatives to aid the cultural recovery of the city. Three top museums – the Hammer Museum, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles – are establishing a joint acquisition fund of $75,000 to support local artists showing at Frieze. “It’s unprecedented for three museums in the same city to come together like this,” Messineo says. The initiative has been spearheaded by the local venture capital investor and collector Jarl Mohn.View image in fullscreenThe Getty Villa art museum is threatened by the Palisades fire on 7 January 2025.Photograph: David Swanson/AFP/Getty ImagesThis and the LA Arts Community Fire Relief Fund are testament to the “strikingly collaborative community” in Los Angeles, says Katherine E Fleming, the president and chief executive of the J Paul Getty Trust, which operates LA’s Getty Center and Getty Villa museums. The trust launched the emergency fund in the days after the fire to support artists and art workers who lost their homes and studios. With the help of donors including the Gagosian gallery, Frieze, East West Bank – which is headquartered in Pasadena – and some of Hollywood’s biggest names, including Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, that fund has reached $14m, surpassing its initial $12m target.The scale of devastation on artists’ lives and careers is still largely unknown. Many are simply trying to survive. The artist Christina Quarles, whose home burned down in Altadena, along with a second that she and her partner owned next door, says they are currently being turned down from every Airbnb they apply for. “I think the ones that are left are kind of shady and when they find out that we have a toddler, they reject us,” she says. Quarles has already had to postpone a major exhibition with her gallery Hauser & Wirth because of an earlier fire at her property last year. “It’s hard to think about working when we don’t know where we will be living next month,” she adds.View image in fullscreenLauren Halsey.Photograph: Eddie Salinas/Courtesy of the artist and David Kordansky GalleryThe Getty Villa, located in Pacific Palisades and where Frieze Los Angeles usually hosts its opening gala, narrowly avoided damage when flames crept up to just six feet from its walls. Staff battled the fire using handheld extinguishers. “I wasn’t fearful for our collection, but I was fearful for the people who were hellbent on remaining on site,” Fleming says. The Palisades fire ultimately spared the villa and its 44,000-item collection, though its grounds are charred.“It’s surreal how pristine the collections are. I went in the day after the worst of it, and you could run a white glove over the surfaces and nothing would have come off on it,” Fleming says. “But the gardens are in a pretty severe state. Until we know what the chemical composition of all the detritus is, we’re going to move cautiously.” She estimates the villa will remain shut for another two to three months.Far more pressing is the fate of the Getty Villa’s neighbours. “It is going to take several years for some version of the neighbourhood to come back, so we are figuring out what is an appropriate way of continuing without it feeling like it’s business as usual. On the other hand, the city needs support and life more than ever – it’s really a question of how we might offer our museum as a resource and space of refuge,” Fleming says.Frieze grappled with similar questions when deciding to go ahead with the fair. Messineo says the executive team “very much took cues” from their peers in Los Angeles. “There was a rallying cry across cultural institutions and organisations who said, ‘LA needs you.’ It felt more urgent to gather and galvanise and Frieze has always been a moment for that kind for gathering,” she says.A gathering point it may be, but in the lead-up to the fair some galleries voiced concerns that few collectors would be in the mood to buy. Faced with financial uncertainty and shipping issues, a handful of dealers pulled out ahead of the opening. Nonetheless, sales rolled in at a brisk pace during the first day, with dealers including Hauser & Wirth, David Kordansky and Mariane Ibrahim reporting to have sold out their booths. The London dealer Victoria Miro has given over her stand to a group of galleries that are selling works in aid of the LA Arts Community Fire Relief Fund; on Friday, it reported tens of thousands of dollars in sales.View image in fullscreenVictoria Miro’s Galleries Together booth at Frieze 2025 in Los Angeles.Photograph: Casey Kelbaugh/CKAThe wildfires have caused others to take drastic action with their business models. Two weeks after the disaster, the Los Angeles gallery Various Small Fires, which went 100% solar 10 years ago, announced it would not take part in any art fairs in 2025 in a bid to reduce its carbon footprint. “There has been too much talk and too little action in the art world. We’ve had a total disregard for our planet in building this ecosystem, and that must stop,” says the gallery’s founder, Esther Kim Varet, adding that the profitability of fairs is also an issue.Varet now intends to run as a Democrat in California’s 40th congressional district with the aim of unseating the Republican representative, Young Kim, in 2026. It is a “necessary move” in a “crucial moment in American history”, the dealer says.It is a critical moment for Los Angeles too. And, amid the mourning, there are pockets of hope. Quarles says the “optimistic part” of her can see a road ahead for Altadena where rebuilding on a mass scale could incorporate affordable housing, a commitment to diversity and equality, and, crucially, the ability to withstand more fires. “Because, of course, climate change means this is just going to keep happening,” she says.If there is one possible positive outcome, Quarles adds: “It’s for us to become an example for communities around the world in how to rebuild in a way that upholds the ethos of Altadena.”Explore more on these topicsLos AngelesArtCalifornia wildfiresWildfiresClimate crisisWest CoastCaliforniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ll leave it at that.Types of vibratorView image in fullscreenThe Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1.Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.BulletsSmall, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).WandsLarge vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.RabbitsThese vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation.The best bullet vibratorsBest bullet vibrator overall:We-Vibe Tango XView image in fullscreen£79 at We-Vibe£79 at AmazonThe original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.Why we love itIts Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which isexactlywhat tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.It’s a shame that …the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.Speeds:eightVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:two hoursCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbullet for innovation:Hot Octopuss AMOView image in fullscreen£49.95 at Hot Octopuss£49.95 at AmazonAnother tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler. Hot Octopuss is a skilled inventor: its suite of ingenious toys includesPulse – the world’s first “Guybrator”that can induce orgasms from a flaccid penis as well as an erect one, proving a boon for cancer survivors, disabled people and others with erectile difficulties.Why we love itAMO’s ingenuity is in the way it’s sculpted, with a pointy tip for pinpoint pleasure; a broader head on the opposite side for more diffuse vibrations; and a fin-like profile for nestling lengthways between labia. It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.It’s a shame that …the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.Speeds:sixVibe patterns:fivePower:rechargeableRun time:40 minutesCharge time:two to three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestsustainable bullet:Love Not War MayaView image in fullscreen£89.99 at Love Not War£89.99 at VeoIf you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink.Why we love itSeven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say, amini wandorG-spot probe. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.It’s a shame that …at £45 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible‘Expect to see snake-like peeling’: 19 self-care treats for the perfect pick-me-upRead moreBest softand sensual option:Smile Makers The FirefighterView image in fullscreen£44.95 at Boots£49.95 at Beauty BayBullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.Why we love itThe fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.It’s a shame that …it only comes in pink.The Surfer, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:twoPower:rechargeableRun time:three hoursCharge time:two to two-and-a-half hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbudget bullet:The Rocks OffRO-90View image in fullscreen£10.99 at Rocks Off£9.95 at AmazonRocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.Why we love itIt’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety insidethe smaller RO-80 model. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to developa truly accessible toy range, Quest. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.It’s a shame that …single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them. I also question how the shiny metallic finishes might stand up to long-term cleaning.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:1 x AAA batteryRun time:three hours 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsThe best rabbit vibratorsBest rabbit vibrator overall:Je Joue Hera FlexView image in fullscreen£87.20 at Je Joue£109 at SuperdrugThe Hera Flex is such a good problem-solver, it could probably win an algebra contest.Since everyone’s anatomy is different and distances between vaginas and clitorises vary, a frequent dilemma with rabbits is that once the shaft is inserted, the external stimulator doesn’t quite rest on the right spot. Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.Why we love itThis Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.It’s a shame that …there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWarranty:one yearBest for temperature titillation:Lovehoney Glow BunnyView image in fullscreen£79.99 at LovehoneyIf you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.Why we love itThe temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.It’s a shame that …the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:fourPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:100 daysBestfor air pulse stimulation:Womanizer Duo 2View image in fullscreen£189 at Womanizer£189 at BootsAdmittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.Why we love itThe firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preservedandyou don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.It’s a shame that …the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features.Speeds:14Vibe patterns:10Power:rechargeableRuntime:two hoursCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:five yearsBestfor an innovative shaft:Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1View image in fullscreen£58.95 at Satisfyer£39.97 at AmazonSatisfyer is known for two things.

Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling outvastmultitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.Why we love itIt sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.Why we love itI was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed bythe Yarrow: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean. It’s another winner that’ll give your knees the hippy shakes.It’s a shame that …the crevices around the clitoral stimulating nub need extra attention to keep clean and bacteria-free between uses.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRuntime:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestnewanimal:Snail Vibe CurveView image in fullscreen£119 at Sh!£119.99 at Love HoneyA new animal enters the scene, with an ingenious take on how to tackle those pesky rabbit problems. Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos onSnail Vibe’s websiteto see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile.It’s a shame that …the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.Speeds:five for each motorVibe patterns:five for each motorPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBest budget rabbit:BondaraScrewballMonAmourView image in fullscreen£45.99 at BondaraAn aesthetic homage to the popularLelo Soraya 2that costs a quarter of the price.

The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.It’s a shame that …Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work).

The mains-powered Doxy Die Cast is arguably as hard as you can go. It’s not for the faint of heart (or parts), but it’s so powerful that it can probably conjure up an orgasm through walls. And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.Why we love itDoxy makes arechargeable Die Cast(£164.99), and several superbsmaller, lighter cordless wands, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.It’s a shame that …at 690g, it’s heavy as hell.

In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.What Ididn’tdo was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail”, or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multi-functional/tech-enabled?What materials and textures feel inviting to me?A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, youalwaysreach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastlyenhanceshared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro; whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.Alix Fox is an award-winning writer and broadcaster specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture, with 20 years of experience in receiving dick pics sent not to titillate, but because the worried texter wants an informed opinion on a weird lump/rash/wart.

Thick black paint obscures how chipped and decrepit the wood underneath might be. Passing by, the best thing for it seems like the local tip. But along comes a young woman. She takes it and, with a healthy dose of sanding, stripping, wood-filling and revarnishing, turns what was a bit of street junk into a beautifully restored mid-century treasure. It’s sold on for a healthy profit.Welcome to the world of online furniture flipping – where interiors enthusiasts show how they have transformed pieces obtained for little or no money back to their original glory. Some are so good at it, they have quit their jobs to do it full-time.Of course, doing up old furniture is nothing new –some trace the hobby back as far as ancient Egypt, and 90s and 00s DIY shows were full of questionable “makeovers” of chests of drawers and wardrobes stripped and painted in garish colours. However, whatisnew is the booming business of building a social media following around it. On TikTok alone, a search for #furnitureflip pulls upnearly 800,000 posts, many with millions of views.Part of the reason behind this is the meditative nature of the content – it’s quite addictive to watch an electric sander smoothing out a sideboard or paint peeling off in satisfying curls to expose the grain of the wood underneath. There is also climate concern: according toa 2018/19 report by the North London Waste Authority, 22m pieces of furniture are discarded each year.Fewer than one in 10 peoplecurrently attempt to repair or restore broken furniture before chucking it out.So, how easy is it to restore and flip furniture? And how can you do it with unloved pieces found around the house or picked up secondhand? Here, the experts ofInstagramand TikTok reveal all.Erin Shuford,RefurbishedishView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenOne of Erin Shuford’s projectsThe videos that most fascinate Florida-based Erin Shuford’s 1.6 million followers on Instagram are the ones of her stripping paint. “It’s an absolutely miserable process,” she says, but “everyone loves to watch it.”A recent find was a blue mid-century modern sideboard with “Live, Love, Laugh” stencilled on it, for which she “way overpaid” $80 (£63) on Facebook Marketplace. To remove the sickly hue, she started by using a nontoxic paint and varnish stripper. Then, she peeled off the paint in clean strokes with a metal scraper. For the more stubborn bits of paint, she used acetone and a wire bristle brush. After that, the table was sanded, a wood stain applied and it was toned. Then she sold it for $525 (£415).Shuford is from a family of secondhand enthusiasts. “From my grandparents to my mom, we would pick stuff from the trash and make it better. We still do to this day,” she says. “Growing up, you don’t have to buy new. You can always find something at a thrift store or a charity shop.” There’s a sense of accomplishment, she says, in seeing “a piece that was slathered in paint now showing a beautiful wood grain, restored and ready to live another 50 years”.In 2021, after the birth of her first child, Shuford turned her hobby into something more. Back then, she had an administrative job in the construction industry. “I went back to work when my daughter was just a couple of months old and I was really struggling,” she says. So she looked for ways that she could work from home. After fixing up a couple of pieces and selling them for a profit, “I had a gut feeling that this is where I was supposed to be. So I quit my job on a whim.” She has learned everything she knows from “YouTube university”, but says the most important part is working out what customers actually want to buy. Her bestsellers are sideboards and nightstands, but she won’t touch china cabinets – “They are hard to work on, they are hard to transport, they are hard to store” – or dining sets, because the amount they sell for isn’t worth the time it takes to restore them.Shuford flips at least one piece of furniture a week, which she can sell for anything between $400 (£316) and $3,000 (£2,370). That $3,000 sale was a set of Broyhill Saga dressers bought for $250 (£198).She never dreamed that her account would become so popular but feels that if she can “help other people do what I’ve been fortunate enough to do with myself and my business, then I’m absolutely going to do it”.Faranne Iman,Furniture by FaraIman and a converted dresserIt was during lockdown in 2020 that Faranne Iman spotted a solid wood dresser sitting by the bins outside her neighbour’s home in St Louis, Missouri. She was too embarrassed to take it in the daylight – so she waited until dark and went back with a friend to collect it. She could tell the dresser was solid wood and in good condition, so all she had to do was clean it up. With a cheap paintbrush, she applied a new top coat of exterior paint (a rookie error: she now knows you should never use exterior paint on furniture).After listing the dresser on Facebook Marketplace, it sold for $400 (£316). “I was like, that was too easy,” she says.Since that first sale, Iman has built up more than460,000 followers on TikTok, supplementing the income from her government job to support her 13-year-old son. “When I first started, I was doing about 10 [flips] a month. But I wasn’t putting the right amount of time and quality into pieces,” she says. Now, she has scaled back to four or five, but the price point has gone up. Last week, she sold a sideboard, which she got free on Facebook Marketplace, for a profit of $500 (£395). The lime green item didn’t look like much to start with; scuffs, dents and a hacked paint job covered up its strong bones. Iman made the necessary repairs, before sanding and painting it. Then, to add extra height and give it a new look, she built a custom base. This cost about $40 (£32) but increased the sale value.She is careful while working. “I use respirators and protection whenever I can. The paints, the fumes, the sawdust … it’s a lot of chemicals.” Although it is freezing cold in Missouri right now, she does the bulk of her DIY-ing outside.‘It’s opened up windows and doors’“It’s therapy. It has been a great bonding experience for my son and me, and has allowed me flexibility to live a little bit differently” and with more financial freedom. For Iman, posting content online has “opened up windows or doors … everything!” She collaborates with brands for free paint and equipment, or is paid to test products. Alongside the money that she earns for the flips and viral videos, she sells ebooks that teach people how to get started with restorations, and receives commissions from her Amazon storefront.“This is clearly my thing,” she says. “When I go into the garage, I have a speaker out there and it’s just a space where I canbe.”Lilly Skjoldahl,The Furniture DrView image in fullscreenThe Furniture Dr with her burgundy behemothWhen Lilly Skjoldahl received a quote for a $10,000 (£7,900) dental bill in February 2022, she broke down in her car and cried. Then 25, she had been grinding her teeth at night, which had damaged her molars. She was in agony. But, as she had recently graduated in Florida and bought a house in Texas, there was no money left for treatment.In the car, she opened Facebook Marketplace, where she had been hunting for cheap furniture to fill her new house, and saw an opportunity. “That week, I picked up a nightstand, and ended up turning it into a liquor cabinet,” she says. “I bought it for around $60 (£47) and sold it for $200 (£158). After buying the supplies and everything, it was only a $20 [£16] profit.” But she enjoyed it so much that she started flipping furniture in the evenings after days working full-time in public health.“I’d come home from 5.30pm to 8pm and then work in the garage. I’d work Saturday, Sunday, all day – I sacrificed a lot.” After five months, however, she managed to pay off the dentist’s bill, just from furniture flipping.Skjoldahl collects mid-century modern furniture almost exclusively, which she finds in her remote area of Texas. “I don’t really have any competition,” she says. She sources it online, from estate sales and thrift stores, or left out in the street or in the rubbish.Recently, she restored “a freebie” she found on Facebook, a tall burgundy cabinet that she stripped, sanded, and stained sold for $500 (£395).Her top tip is to be careful when manoeuvring furniture: “Taking the drawers out before loading the dresser on to a van or into a trailer makes it significantly easier.” Like so much of the work, “it’s problem solving, just figuring out how to do things”.Lauren Dastrup,LaurenshandmadehomeView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenLauren Dastrup’s ingenious nightstandsThe secret of being a successful furniture flipper is looking beyond the superficial: whether chips in the veneer, missing hardware or a broken drawer – or past the dark, blurred photographs online. Others missed one of Lauren Dastrup’s favourite finds on Facebook Marketplace: a broken Jacobean-style dressing table that was probably built in the late 19th century, which cost her $20 (£16).Dastrup, who lives in Georgia, knew there was likely to be wood veneer under the black paint. She started by removing the damaged centre piece that connected the drawers, and turned them into nightstands. It took hours of chemical stripping to remove three layers of lead paint (“by far the most stubborn paint I have ever removed”) until she found the walnut underneath. She then sanded them down, used a gel stain to bring out the wood’s rich colour, sealed them for durability, and polished the original hardware. They sold in less than 24 hours for $500 (£395).View image in fullscreenA lifetime of DIY …Dastrup gravitates towards broken furniture, because “I just crave novelty a little bit. It gets my brain going and I really enjoy it. There’s a huge satisfaction for me. This was headed to the dump and now it can be used.”She tries to keep the antique pieces she buys as close to the original aesthetic as possible. “I’m sentimental,” she says. “I feel that if I have a piece of furniture that has had these handles for 100 years, I don’t want to take them away from it.”Growing up, both her parents were into DIY: “I watched them do it, so I never assumed I couldn’t.” Turning a profit wasn’t really the intention when Dastrup started selling her work, she says, but since inflation has risen in the US, she has realised it is a blessing to have the extra cash.She’s not surprised her DIY videos have taken off on social media, because she enjoys watching others flip furniture too. “It’s empowering,” she says. “It makes you think you can do things, especially when you see people who are like, ‘Hey, I’ve never done this thing before. Let’s try it.’ For me, that’s very enticing.”Danielle Bayliss,RediscoveredbydanielleView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenBayliss and her renovated deskDanielle Bayliss started restoring furniture full-time while she was on maternity leave with her second child. Although she was familiar with woodwork growing up – she remembers her dad making a wooden car and helping him to create a bird house – the first piece she worked on by herself was a dresser. It’s still in her daughter’s room today.She picks up pieces on Facebook Marketplace, eBay, Gumtree and at auction houses near the Staffordshire town of Lichfield, where she lives. “When you feel you’ve found a treasure, it is a really exciting moment,” she says.She recently bought a desk on Facebook Marketplace for £10. She recognised it as a popular mid-century brand of furniture called Stag, and knew it would turn a profit after she had stripped the paint and varnish. “I’ve never had paint peel off so satisfyingly. It revealed absolutely beautiful wood.” She cleaned off the residue using wire wool and white spirit, and used a hard wax finish to reveal and emphasise the wood grain underneath. It sold for £250.“It’s kind of horrifying how much gets thrown away,” Bayliss says of the culture that allows flippers like her to thrive. “It’s unbelievable really. And some of it is solid wood – you don’t get furniture like that any more. It’s got a long life left and it just doesn’t quite fit in fashion or style.“I have no doubt all these pieces that I’m stripping now will be painted again in 10 years’ time,” she says. “I think that’s probably what I love about upcycling – that a piece of furniture is not just finished and how it’s going to be for ever. It will change again.”Explore more on these topicsInteriorsDIYSocial mediaTikTokInstagramfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The message wasn’t from a friend. It was from an Australian couple, complete strangers. But social media knows me well because I felt something sharp and bright – joy and relief – for people I will never meet.It’s strange to feel deeply for someone you’ve never spoken to, whose life is about as geographically far from yours as possible. But I was thrilled to see this pregnancy announcement, shared with millions, from someone I only knew through a few carefully curated moments. As someone who is fundamentally nosy – I will never not notice a “baby on board” badge or make up backstories for strangers – social media has always offered an irresistible window into other people’s lives.Just before lockdown, I was housebound with an ankle so fat it looked like an inflated washing-up glove. (I’d fallen – sober, I should add – down every step of Oxford Circus station.) Immobile, bored and lonely, I’d downloaded TikTok. I was first drawn in by the dance videos, then utterly absorbed by more personal, raw content.Social media has always offered an irresistible window into other people’s livesWhat started as curiosity soon became an emotional investment. In five years of TikTok use I’ve witnessed a rise in creators documenting every intimate detail of their trying-to-conceive (TTC) journeys, the content now spilling over on to other platforms. My experience has moved from voyeurism, to research, to deeply personal connection.If you haven’t seen it, there’s a whole world of TTC influencers filming the kind of private experiences that once happened in low-lit bathrooms, whispered to partners in bed, or shared with close friends. Intimate moments are now monetisable and watched by massive audiences: pregnancy tests held up to the screen, fertility medication syringes clicked and pressed into stomachs, euphoric “live reaction” videos and heartbreaking silences.It’s a very modern phenomenon and one that feels especially timely considering the fertility rate in England and Wales has dropped to itslowest since records beganin 1938. For some reason, we all accepted that you shouldn’t talk about wanting children outside the closest circles, let alone discuss the emotional toll of trying to have them. Social media is breaking that, creating virtual communities with unprecedented levels of instant support.Two things happened back in 2020: TikTok pushed me into increasingly niche corners, from TTC to alternative birthing stories, and lockdown meant I had far more time to read all the articles I’d previously bookmarked. That’s how I discovered freebirthing, the term used to describe a pregnancy and birth without any medical interventions. No scans, no drugs, no healthcare professionals. I read the harrowing account of one mother who was certain she should avoid doctors even as she approached 45 weeks, only for her child to pass in utero. Her reflection on the influence of online groups haunted me.I was 28, vaguely thinking about starting a family someday, and freebirthing seemed so radical and challenging.I couldn’t stop asking myself: why would someone leave the safety net of medicine? What made that mother so certain, so trusting of these online voices? Those questions became the foundation of my debut novel.Back in 2020, my job involved running social media campaigns for a literacy charity. My research led me to private freebirthing groups, so my Facebook feed swung between virtual nursery rhyme events and graphic freebirth videos – blood, viscera and fragile life pulsing through bathtubs and mattresses. Once my algorithm learned I was interested, it pushed the content even more, across all social platforms.I was taken by the language used:ancestralbirths,sacredmothers, thedivinityof a fullyautonomousandwildpregnancy. My protagonist, Claire, emerged from this research but, unlike me, she had experienced medical trauma leading to deep mistrust of healthcare professionals, making freebirthing her chosen path. Through her story, I tried to approach the subject with curiosity rather than judgment.Dr Zeynep Gurtin, a medical sociologist at UCL who is setting up the largest international study in freebirthing, explains there are a “huge number of reasons” why someone freebirths. This includes cultural contexts of seeing physiological births at home, past successful intervention-free births, and a response to the NHS’s reportedinstitutional racismand bias. Gurtin says, “Medicalisation of pregnancy and birth necessitates viewing these events as pathologies, and it’s understandable that some people are now saying, ‘That doesn’t serve me, and it doesn’t respect my autonomy’.”In the years since I started my book,Baby Teeth,freebirthing is thought to have increased, though there are no definitive records. Dr Shree Datta, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Portland Hospital and NHS Homerton Trust, says, “It’s estimated that a very small proportion of births, likely less than 1%, occur outside a medical or midwifery setting, including freebirths.” She notes, “The NHS does not formally recommend freebirth, but we respect a woman’s right to make decisions about her birth.”Dr Ian Scudamore, vice-president for education of the Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists adds, “Giving birth without any professional support may put mother or baby at risk and this is important to be aware of when making this choice.” Dr Kim Thomas, CEO of the Birth Trauma Association, identifies two key factors driving the rise: “Difficult and distressing experiences giving birth in hospital, often as a result of poor medical care” and “the influence of social media and the rapid growth of anti-medical messaging.” She explains, “Some believe that with the right exercises and mindset, a birth can be entirely straightforward, even empowering.”Imogen, 34, reflects on how the desire to freebirth can play out in practice. She had a “wild” pregnancy (no scans, no blood tests, no midwife visits), joined an online community calledLive Wild Birth Free, and prepared to freebirth before requiring support after a four-day labour at 43 weeks. She describes her experience arriving in hospital: “The midwife who took over the next shift was so rude and condescending about our choices. Wild pregnancies and freebirth are completely legal and work for so many.” She says, “If I had my time again, I would do the same; the number of horror stories of friends and family I have since heard just makes me realise how broken the system is.”I watched women like Imogen carry and deliver their children, either at home or in medical settings, and I continued my writing, being sure always to approach freebirthing with an open mind. And then, something shifted. While editingBaby Teeth, my research bled into my reality. My husband and I started trying for a baby.The experiences I’d researched and written about – the yearning for a child, the agony of a period’s arrival, the extraordinary expense of pregnancy tests – became my reality. Unlike my protagonist Claire, whose journey was one of infertility, mine was marked by recurrent loss. I found myself in private miscarriage forums, in anonymous comment sections, sobbing while I typed, just as I imagined Claire would have. It was a strange experience: life following a fiction of my own creation.I felt nothing but gratitude to the creators who shared similar experiences of miscarriage in their videos, who gave voice to the grief that choked me. I felt seen and connected. I would never film myself in tears and upload it for anyone to see, but I understood why they did. It was about the world knowing the lost pregnancy had existed and been loved. At the time, few of my friends were TTC and (thankfully) none had experienced loss. The videos made me feel close to an undercurrent of human experience that is so often not discussed.I felt gratitude to the creators who shared similar experiences, who gave voice to the grief that choked meEventually, we got lucky. Our son was born at the end of 2022 and as I write this, another is due soon. Throughout the years, I haven’t been able to tear myself away from freebirthing videos. Just before my scheduled C-section, I followed as one woman kept her post-freebirth placenta attached to her body in a large tupperware, sprinkling herbs to help preserve it.No matter how different my own choices were when it came to my son’s birth, I was compelled to follow journeys, celebrate victories. I still scroll. I still follow the people whose stories have flickered across my phone screen for half a decade: the increasingly more public freebirthers and the mainstream TTCers.The TikTok notification I received – WE’RE PREGNANT – wasn’t just for me. It was for four million others, an audience the size of a city. The Australian couple, after years of unsuccessful IVF and one early loss, are expecting later this year. Fertility stories remind us that beneath the screens, we’re all searching for connection. In the noisy, often commodified world of social media, the content creates a space where the often-unspoken – whether it’s the journey to pregnancy, the pain of loss, or the desire for greater autonomy over birth – is given voice. And in those moments you stop for a second, and realise you feel less alone.Baby Teeth by Celia Silvani (Orion, £20) is out now.

In a way, of course, she’s all around. He has stayed on in the Washington DC condominium where she died (he lives there with his husband of 15 years, Joe Hamilton); her books and music – she loved country – are a constant reminder of the life they shared. But her absence is deeply felt nonetheless. “It was a huge loss. Sometimes, I turn to her work just to hear her voice again. I connect to the way her mind was working, and I kind of invent a conversation with her.” In truth, it’s a blessing that she was a writer. In 2005, at the mortuary to discuss her cremation, he heard the horrible word “cremains” for the first time. “In that moment, I had the insight that Andrea’s remains would really be her words. They live on as she doesn’t.”At first, admittedly, those words continued to be read only by a select few. At the best of times, Dworkin was a polarising figure, her uncompromising feminism despised by right and left alike (the right insisted she was a man-hater who believed all sex was rape; on the left, sex-positive feminists loathed her crusade against pornography). But slowly, this changed. “She joined several zones of conversation,” as Stoltenberg puts it. First, the scholars started working on her, devoting chapter after chapter to Dworkin in their academic books. Then, a new generation of feminists began rediscovering her. “I’ve subscribed to a service that tracks mention of Andrea, and I really shouldn’t spend so much time with it, because it giveth and it taketh away,” he says. “I mean, people still write the most vile stuff about her. But there’s also the most amazing engagement and rapture around her work, especially from younger women. Only yesterday, I came uponher entry in the Urban Dictionary…” With a smile, he reads it to me. It calls Dworkin “the most iconic radical feminist EVERERRR” and deploys several exclamation marks for emphasis.Her time, it seems, may have come at last. Next month, three of her books will be published as Penguin Modern Classics, a literary imprimatur that puts her in the company of Simone de Beauvoir and Virginia Woolf – and Stoltenberg, the keeper of her flame, could not be more delighted (not even Zoom can dim his radiance). “She had such a struggle getting published in life,” he says. “There were brave editors along the way, but there were also campaigns to destroy her reputation, especially around her position on pornography. It made her a pariah in the publishing industry here: that’s why several of her books were published in the UK first. So to have these new editions come out at the same time, and for them to be so beautifully packaged [their covers feature work by the American feminist artistJudy Chicago, who’s also enjoying something of a renaissance]… It feels like a vindication. It’s thrilling and emotional, and though she always anticipated that if she was ever going to be acknowledged, it would only be after she was gone, I wish she could have seen it for herself.”Right-Wing Women is predictive of how women flocked to the patriarchy in the form of TrumpWhen Dworkin died of heart disease at the age of just 58, feministGloria Steinemlikened her to an Old Testament prophet “raging in the hills”. Her friend, she said, often saw what was about to happen before others did – and it’s true that the titles Penguin has chosen to reissue do seem now to have been unnervingly prescient. If her first book,Woman Hating(1974), and the laterPornography: Men Possessing Women(1981), speak to a culture that has only grown the more violently misogynistic since they were published – their arguments have new urgency in a world of “incels” and 24/7 porn – thenRight-Wing Women(1983) has plenty to say inadvertently about the devotion of Donald Trump’s female supporters, even after allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him. “Right-Wing Womenis predictive of how women flocked to the patriarchy in the form of Trump, becoming his chief cheerleaders,” says Stoltenberg. “This a movement that’s devoted to defending the idea of real men – an idea which, as both Andrea and I have written, is a dangerous fiction.”View image in fullscreenJohn Stoltenberg at home in Washington with a portrait of himself and former partner Andrea Dworkin.Photograph: Shuran Huang/The GuardianDoes he think Dworkin’s jaw would be swinging in disbelief at the first flourishes of Trump’s second term, or would she have seen it all coming? “Oh, I think she would have believed it,” he says. “I often imagine what she might be saying or doing if she was here now, and I think she would have been very engaged; I don’t think she would have sat out his first term, and I don’t think she would be sitting out this one either.” The world looks very different to the way it did in 2005; George W Bush, abhorred by liberals at the time, has a whole new complexion thanks to Trump.But some things never change. “I was glad when Andrea was done with her pornography project. She worked from VHS tapes, magazines and books, and a lot of material accumulated in the house, to my discomfort. But she found the DNA of pornography, and though that DNA has since been replicated with new technologies and vast circulation, on to handheld screens and so on, the central core of how it works is no different. Her insight was into the acculturated male brain and body, and that hasn’t moved much. The power relationship between men and women hasn’t really shifted at all.”Stoltenberg, who is now 80, shared his life with Dworkin for 31 years. When they met, he was in his late 20s and a member of an experimental theatre company: they were introduced by its artistic director. (“Ha, there was a time when I thought I was in love with them both!” he says.) Things were certainly changing – it was 1974; hair was long and jeans flared – but he hadn’t yet come out, or not properly. “I’d told a few people I was homosexual – I think that was the word I used – but I hadn’t done a whole lot with it. I’d previously been married to a woman; I’d believed the relationship would straighten me out, and there was no one around to tell me that it wouldn’t.” With Dworkin, though, he could be “transparent”, in part because by this point she identified as a lesbian.Her work was hard on her. Most people shy away from looking at certain things. But she went in thereTheir first encounter was at a meeting of the Gay Academic Union in New York, but it was only later that they talked. “We were at an anti [Vietnam] war poetry reading in Greenwich Village; our mutual friend the artistic director was up on stage reading from [Chilean poet]Pablo Nerudawhen suddenly the poetry turned hateful towards women. I was uncomfortable, so I walked out, at which point I discovered that she’d walked out for the same reason. That was our first connection.” Things moved fast. It was April. By June, they’d decided to live together, a momentous decision for them both. “I was in transit a lot, because I lived on the Upper West Side, and she lived on the Lower East Side. But one day there was a party at my place: I seem to recall it was to mark the birthday of Elizabeth Cady Stanton [a leader of the US women’s rights movement in the 19th century]. I drank way too much. I went into my bedroom, where I pretty much passed out. She came to check on me, and in that inebriated moment, I realised I couldn’t live without her.” He shakes his head, mournfully. “In a way, it’s a sad story.”What was she like? In the media, Dworkin’s mushroomy tabards and denim dungarees combined with the reporting of her more extreme utterances to fix her in the public imagination as a half-crazed Valkyrie. But Stoltenberg insists the reality was very different: “She was nothing like that caricature, and she wasn’t like her podium personality either [at marches, she was known for her oratory]. In her private life, she was gentle and sweet and funny.”View image in fullscreenDworkin at the Edinburgh book festival in 2000.Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The GuardianWas he a feminist when they met? He thinks about this. “I’m racking my brain… But, no, I believe it was Andrea who introduced me to it. In particular, it was hearing her tell me of the abuse she’d received that was mind-blowing because it was completely outside my frame of reference [Dworkin had been molested by a stranger as a child; her first husband, a Dutchman whom she married while living in Amsterdam in the early 70s, was so violent, he would knock her unconscious]. I didn’t know anything about wife battery, and I didn’t know anything about rape, and when she told me, I realised I didn’t want to be any of those men.”What was their relationship like? “Well, we knew from the beginning we weren’t going to be monogamous,” he says. “But we did have a life together that was deeply sensual: it was physically affectionate, as well as intellectual. I mean, she died in my arms…” It all sounds terribly modern. Did they feel they were pioneers? “No, not really. We weren’t public about it. There was nothing about us that was trying to be instructive, and I also don’t want to leave out the fact that there was a lot of animosity towards us. When we lived in Northampton, Massachusetts, a city some people call the lesbian capital of the world, we would walk along the street holding hands, and women would hiss at us, and gay men would pass us and just…settletheir scorn on us.” Why? Were he and Dworkin supposed to have betrayed some kind of gay ideal? “I guess I don’t know. But there was a lot of imputation about it.”Living together worked well. They shared household tasks – he cleaned the fridge, she dealt with the cat litter – and their working hours were highly compatible (Stoltenberg began writing, too, and has since published several books about the politics of masculinity). “I wrote in the morning on several cups of coffee; she would start at midnight, working on till dawn.” His apartment – she moved in – was Dworkin’s first safe home, and she cherished it. “That with-floor walk-up [apartment] on the Lower East Side was pretty vulnerable, and in Europe she’d effectively been homeless.”Somewhere along the line, I developed a kind of muscle for sorting out what crap people said about herDid he worry about her safety? “Yes, especially when she travelled for speaking engagements. The world was hostile to her in a way that it wasn’t to me.” Did her activism take a toll on her health? The second-wavers who first inspired her –Shulamith Firestone,Kate Millett– seemed in the end to suffer for their feminism. “She didn’t experience problems with her mental health, but her work was hard on her. Most people shy away from looking at certain things, myself included. But she went in there.” When she finishedScapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women’s Liberation(2000), a book that dealt with the Holocaust – Dworkin was Jewish, and once said she would have been a rabbi had she been allowed – friends urged her for her own sake to stay away from atrocity in the future.He and Dworkin always said they would not marry unless one of them was terminally ill, or imprisoned for political activity. But in 1998, they did: as his wife, she would be covered by the health insurance that came with his then job. “We were on vacation in Florida; some friends had let us use their home. I was reading some tour literature, and I said: ‘Hey, look at this. The state of Florida has no waiting period on marriages. You can just walk into a justice of the peace and get married.’ We thought: why not? We didn’t tell anybody except immediate family. It was as unceremonial as it could be. The justice of the peace said: did you pick her up out in the parking lot?”By now, however, Dworkin’s health was beginning to fail. “She’d had several major surgeries, including bariatric and knee replacement. I was at the point where I was terrified that I couldn’t take care of her any longer. I think she had that fear, too. We didn’t discuss it, but I was her carer…” His voice tails off. Her death was both sudden, and expected. How did he feel about the public response to it? “I guess I was pleased. There was an outpouring, some very deep expressions of connection and gratitude for what her work had meant to women.”After so long, he was inured to any commentary that was less kind. “Somewhere along the line, I developed a kind of muscle for sorting out what crap people said about her. I learned to notice the way in which whatever they were saying revealed more about them than about Andrea. Anyone who engages with her work always reveals something of themselves.”For some, Stoltenberg is a controversial figure. He has said that Dworkin would have been a trans ally had she lived, while others – the feminist activist, Julie Bindel, who was a friend, is one – have accused him of misreading her work for his own ends in this regard. But we don’t discuss this today. How can anyone really know? As Steinem said after her death, even in life, she was “frequently misunderstood”; better to talk about the latest editions of her work, and whether they’ll bring her new readers. Will they? This is his hope. “Her history, her experiences, weren’t uncommon; they were, and are, more common than people will admit. But the way she universalised themwasuncommon. She looked at the world through the lens of her life without fear.”Woman Hating,PornographyandRight-Wing Womenare published by Penguin (£10.99).

My dog likes her. I’m not a particular believer in the idea that animals are great character judges but, in this case, me and the dog are aligned. I like Anderson too. She combines openness with a kind of vulnerability, and you warm to her immediately.Settled on a sofa in a small dressing room off a photography studio, she asks for a coffee and promptly spills it everywhere. “I strive for imperfection,” she jokes. “I strive for it, and I just hit it every time.” Cortado mopped, she takes a breath, before talking excitedly of a new phase in her eventful life. “A door opened, and I walked through,” she says. “It’s hard to believe.”Two years ago, Anderson had accepted that her time in the spotlight was pretty much done, and had decided to locate herself in and around her beachside home in Ladysmith, on Vancouver Island in Canada. Her focus, she decided, would be her garden and animals. Though she’d long been a celebrity – smashing into 90s public consciousness as aPlayboymodel and scarlet-swimsuitedBaywatchstar, becoming notorious as one half of a sex’n’drugs’n’rock’n’roll marriage to Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee, celebrated and disdained as a cartoon fantasy girl – she was no longer being offered any work she liked. She’d had a decade or so making money on international reality shows (India, Germany, Argentina, the UK); she’d made her mark as ananimal rights activist; but that, she thought, was that. She gave up on her last marriage, to her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst, and went back home.View image in fullscreenWith former husband Tommy Lee in 1995.Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage“I went home to my garden and made pickles and jams, I wrote a vegan cookbook, I did a vegan cooking show, and I was perfectly happy with that,” she says. “I spent some time for myself, stripping away this caricature that I created, because I’d started believing that it was true. You have to have self-acceptance, and I honestly believed it was over, that life. It was like a death, in a way. But it was the beginning.”The change began in 2022, when she played Roxie Hart inChicagoon Broadway, which she loved. “Doing it every night, the classic Fosse choreography,” she says. “I just realised you don’t know if you can do something unless you try. I’m not a dancer, I didn’t know I could sing. I didn’t know I could do any of it.” She brought out her autobiography in 2023, the same year as a Netflix documentaryPamela, A Love Story, which revealed Anderson as a sweet, gentle optimist and shifted people’s opinions of her (“I’m not a damsel in distress,” she says in it. “I put myself in crazy situations and I survived them”). But the real, life-changing breakthrough has come with the filmThe Last Showgirl.I have so much respect for the craft [of acting], and I’m just a sponge. I’m just aching to see what’s in meDirector Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis Ford, niece of Sophia) shot the whole movie in just 18 days, on dreamy 16mm film. It tells the story of the final days of the Razzle Dazzle, a long-running Vegas showgirl revue, all feathers and sparkly headdresses and mildly erotic dances, based on old Parisian Lido shows. Once the biggest pull on the Strip, times have changed, and the show is seen as dated and uncool, not funny or risque enough. It barely brings in an audience. The owners decide to close. Anderson plays Shelly, the longest-serving dancer, whose image is on the fading sign, who still believes in the glamour and the glitz, whose life is so wrapped around the Razzle Dazzle that she may well be lost without it.Though she very nearly wasn’t in the film at all. Her ex-agent passed on the part without showing it to her, but Coppola approached Anderson’s son Brandon, and he got the script to his mother.View image in fullscreenIn the heyday of Baywatch in 1992.Photograph: Allstar“It was the first time I read a great script with a really well-rounded role that I felt like I could tackle, as an actress,” she says. “So that was exciting to me.” Anderson had enormous empathy for Shelly’s “flawed but very human” character, and related to her story, not least because Shelly has a daughter, Hannah (Anderson has two adult sons, Brandon and Dylan). “Raising a child in this industry is never easy,” she says, “and there’s no perfect way to be a parent.” And Hannah and Shelly’s relationship is far from perfect.“No, it’s not, but Shelly thought she was doing what was best for her child,” says Anderson. “She also thought she was setting a good example, showing that you can follow your dreams, and we don’t have to play these roles that have been society’s roles for us. It’s always a fight, I think, for women. For some reason, we’re always explaining ourselves and our choices. I’m always explaining myself and my past.”There are meta-layers in the film, to do with casting and what we expect of women, especially desirable women as they age. Jamie Lee Curtis plays wise-cracking Annette, once a showgirl, now a hostess in a casino. (In one scene she dances on a low platform amid the slot machines, to Total Eclipse of the Heart; ignored by the punters, she has a strange lonely dignity.) Billie Lourd plays Hannah. Lourd, as daughter of Carrie Fisher, granddaughter of Debbie Reynolds, could bring in her experience of being the child in a family of performers.“Billie said making the film was like therapy for her,” says Anderson. “You can talk to your best friend, you can go to therapy, but doing an art project heals parts of you that you don’t even know are hurt, all these places that we lock away in ourselves. If you can unlock those things. And that’s what Shelly did for me. She’s unlocked parts of me that I locked away and I know I repressed in some way.”In the past, I felt I was the poster girl for causes and that was great, but in some cases, it didn’t really helpAnderson is good at revealing the complications and conflicts in Shelly. She’s a baby-voiced dreamer but also a tough worker, someone who genuinely believes in the beauty and worth of her vocation. “She believes in the fantasy of what she does, and I could relate to that. When I moved from Canada to the States, I had my fantasy of what a model was, and I wanted to do the best I could. But then I’d see somebody else in a photoshoot and go, “Oh, my God, nobody else is rolling around like me”. Shelly has dreamed this life for herself and made it work.”And now Anderson’s dreams are starting to play out in real life. “I’ve been able to realise a little bit of my potential, and that changes the conversation. Even in interviews, I feel like it’s apples and oranges. People, if they haven’t seen the film, ask me different questions than if they have seen it.”View image in fullscreenWith Vivienne Westwood at a Paris fashion week show in 2009.Photograph: Dominique Charriau/WireImageHer future projects include a remake ofThe Naked Gun, where she plays opposite Liam Neeson: “I’m a femme fatale. You can tell, because I wear a beret.” And she’s inRosebush Pruning, directed by Karim Aïnouz, about a dysfunctional family: “I leave my family to the wolves, but it all gets turned around on me real quick.” She loved working in a cast of “incredibly hot” actors – Callum Turner, Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Lukas Gage, Elena Anaya, Tracy Letts – and also relished playing a few years older than her real age (she’s 57).It seems like Anderson has found herself; at least, her working self, her artistic and intellectual side, the one that wants to confront the discipline and emotional excavation of acting. “I’ve always read [Richard] Boleslavsky,Acting:The First Six Lessons, on repeat, over and over. I finish it, I start it again. I get something out of it each time,” she says. “I wish there was an Actors Studio. I have a great acting teacher, Ivana Chubbuck, but I wish there was something comparable so I could work between projects. I have so much respect for the craft, and I’m just a sponge. I’m just aching to see what’s in me.”It’s like a flame has been lit inside you, I say.“I feel like I’ve finally been able to access part of what I’m capable of,” she says. “If I never do anything else, I have done something. I feel like this has really been the catalyst for the rest of my life.”She reaches down and pets my dog again. Anderson has many fans. How does she feel about answering some of their questions, I wonder?“Oh I’m excited,” she says. “This is my excited time.”The Last Showgirlopens in UK cinemas on FridayWatch a trailer for The Last Showgirl.Stella McCartneyDesignerWhat is something in this world that you love and needs saving?Oh … cinema? I watched this documentary,Room 666Room 999[two docs filmed 40 years apart about the future of cinema] about the great directors that go to Cannes. They’re talking about saving cinema and how some people think it’s over. I feel like small films are the answer, because they’re a director’s singular vision. Big studio pictures, there’s so many cooks in the kitchen that they lose their vision. I want to do a lot of independent cinema, work with directors who are artists. Of course, every actor wants to do this – but cinema is something I’d love to save.Liam NeesonActorHow does working in your garden inspire you in the same way a good script and director can?Everything seems to always go back to the garden for me, it is a good metaphor … There’s no easy way around it, there’s no shortcuts. You’ve got to nurture, and you’ve got to plant the seeds, and you’ve got to see it grow, and you see yourself grow, and you see what works, what doesn’t work. It’s a lifetime obsession. Love and work and creativity, and also having some faith that you don’t have to control it. You don’t have to observe it.Ruby WaxWriter and interviewerDo you miss your youngBaywatchbody?I still have my youngBaywatchbody! I was thinking that the other day.

What is the greatest piece of advice you’ve been given?The best piece of advice I’ve ever been given is to be yourself. I think that came from me. You know, you’re always trying to work out … what are my original thoughts? Who am I? How do I want to present myself to the world? I even tell my kids that. I say, “Tell me something that onlyyouthink.” Like: “Don’t think other people’s thoughts.” That’s important as an artist, but also as a person. Just to remind ourselves, because we’re inundated with so much information all the time, that we are not those thoughts, that we are not other people’s thoughts. It’s always going back to who you are and what your purpose is, and what your reason for being here is. We all have a reason for being here.Naomi KleinWriter and activistYou and I both live on theSalish Sea in British Columbia. It’s not exactly convenient. So I’m wondering, what does this ecosystem do for you?I live in a rainforest. What a dream. The bald eagles, the whales, the owls… it’s so rich with life, and I feel like the trees have known me since birth. I like walking on the beach where I walked as a young girl, and it has always inspired me. I lived other places, but going home was really important to me, because I wanted to rewrite my beginnings, almost. When I didBroadway, the only picture I had on my mirror was of me at four years old. I said, “She deserves it. I just need to get out of the way.” Every time I go home, I stick my feet in the water, in the Salish Sea. It’s home.Your sons come across as really nice young men. How did you balance parenthood with the ups and downs of fame?Karalee Clark, Calgary, AlbertaI took a lot of time off when my kids were young. I didn’t have a nanny. I really wanted to raise them myself, and in the crazy world that we were in, I didn’t want to take my eyes off of them. But I feel like there’s no perfect way to be a parent. In the movie, I did improv for a scene on the telephone, and I said, “We’re just doing the best we can with the tools that we have,” and I believe that. I always wanted my kids to be who they were, and to be these wild little spirits. As they got older, we were very open and honest with each other. And at some point, they just became … you never want to put that on your kids, but they became very protective of me. We have these businesses together now, but they have their own lives too. You want to do the best you can and be as honest as you can, but you’re not their friend, you’re their parent.Andreas KronthalerDesigner,Vivienne Westwood’s longterm partnerYou and Vivienne were so close. What drew you towards each other, and what did her friendship mean to you?She was very … she didn’t like a lot of people, but she loved me, which was really wonderful. We met when we were getting people to sign petitions to free Leonard Peltier, and we just got on so well. She was like, “I want you in all my campaigns.” And I met Juergen Teller and Andreas, and Vivienne and I would be in these little, tiny rooms dressing each other. And Andreas would always say, “You women are the hardest women to dress, but I love it.” The three of us were such a funny little crew, and we did a lot of photoshoots together, and spent a lot of time together. I just loved her, and her relationship with Andreas was very special. They were madly in love, and so kind and sweet to each other, and giggly and cute together. And they were … they’re like family. I see Andreas as much as possible. I’m wearing Vivienne Westwood right now. This is Vivienne Westwood.View image in fullscreenAt the Bafta film awards in London last week.Photograph: Joe Maher/GettyHow do you start loving how you look without makeup? I need to quit using eye makeup after nearly 40 years, and my smoky-eye look has been part of my identity for so long. Without it, I find it hard to love my looks.Freya Samstra, the NetherlandsWell, first of all, you just have to stop wearing makeup. It takes a while to get used to it, and then you go to the grocery store, little things … I know it sounds superficial, but for me it was really a freeing thing. You know, I love makeup, and now, if I’m doing a photoshoot or going to an event and I want to put a little bit of makeup on, it feels more special. It feels like, “I’m good enough the way that I am, and the rest is fun”, instead of making it so much a part of your identity. Everyone’s beauty journey is different, and no matter where you are in your beauty journey, no matter what you feel, sometimes it’s nice to take a step back and go, “OK, I’m good with this”. And then go again into something else. Maybe you’ll have a think about a lip or something else you get drawn to. But sometimes you have to take it back to go, “OK, the blank canvas,” and being OK with that.Alexandra PaulActorYou often brought your beautiful, playful dogStarto the set ofBaywatch. Do you have any dogs in your family at the moment?I do. I have three dogs, three big dogs. I have Zou Bisou Bisou, after the song, and I have Lucky and Lola, who are chocolate labs kind of monsters, and Zou-zou is a golden retriever-ish. I just let them out in the morning and they come back when they want. I have a big, fenced-in yard. I moved my parents on to my property last year, into their own little cabin. They’re getting older, they’re in their late seventies and I was planning on being in my garden, bringing my mum and dad closer so I can keep an eye on them. But then I started travelling, working so much. And they have to look after the dogs. They have three big dogs and a little tiny cat, and their cabin is very small, probably as big as this room. My mum just loves to care for them, so it really keeps her busy. Three big dogs. I don’t think I could even put three of them on the leash and walk them anywhere. They just need to be free.Yanis VaroufakisEconomist and politicianGreetings from Greece. I watchedThe Last Showgirland was moved by the immense power you projected from appearing wholly vulnerable. Do you intend to press that power into serving any new political project?We’re both friends of Julian Assange, and I met Yanis through Slavoj Žižek, a philosopher, who introduced us. It’s fun to have a conversation with these brains. Right now, I call myself a gentle activist, a romantic activist, in that I’m working on things behind the scenes, because I feel like I can be more effective that way. I’m always a part of the dream that we all share as people who care about love, empathy for other people and the planet. When I first met Julian Assange, I said, “How can I be more effective as an activist?” And he said, “Support other activists and the families of activists.” So that’s what I do. In the past, I felt I was the poster girl for causes and that was great, but in some cases, it didn’t really help. My image didn’t necessarily help. I only want to help, and so … I found my way.What makes you laugh? A proper full-on belly laugh.Jo Foggo, MerseysideMy dogs. I have the best time with my dogs, and they’re so funny. Anywhere I go, I try to find a park – like if I’m in New York I go to Central Park, because the dogs just make me laugh, and it’s the best way to start the day.Michael CeraActorIf you were able to magically chat and give advice to your 20-year-old self, what advice would you give?Hang in there. Hold your head high. Keep going. This too shall pass [laughs]. Keep trusting animals. They are on your side, unconditional love. I would say to my younger self, “Work. Keep on improving yourself. Work on your voice. Take dance classes, take acting classes.” Just keep on filling your pockets with skills that you never know if you’re going to use, but you can only be a more interesting and better person if you do that. Keep reading. Keep watching old movies.When you put on the red swimsuit for the first time, did you have an inkling of the power it held?Ayesha, WorthingNo, I had no idea. You don’t have any idea when you’re taking a job. You never know if it’s going to be like the No 1 show in the world. People sometimes ask me, “How come you made these amazing choices?” I was going to the beach. I had a job. I would have been at the beach anyway. It wasn’t like I was calculating my career. These are the things that were presented to me and that I did.Philip TreacyMillinerHow did the headdresses you wore in the movie make you feel?Well, they’re very heavy. You had to have a good straight back, and you have to have balance. I think the bigger the hat, the closer you are to God [laughs]. It was a spiritual moment. I love Philip Treacy. I haven’t seen him in a long time, but he used to put the funniest, greatest hats on me. He’s fantastic, he’s incredible. He’s a genius.View image in fullscreenPamela Anderson in The Last Showgirl.Photograph: Zoey Grossman/APThe costumes inThe Last Showgirlwere amazing.Well, they’re museum pieces, and they haven’t left the building in 30 years. We really had to shake the dust off those feathers. Some of them even had the names of the girls that wore them before. So you felt like there was magic in them, and that was part of the reason why you were able to stand in them, because a lot of women had worn them before you. They were such an honour to wear.Jeff KoonsArtistPamela, you’ve experienced so much in your life. When do you feel the most alive? And can you describe what that sensation feels like to you?Feeling most alive for me is living in the mystery of not knowing what’s next and having complete faith it’s going to be OK. It feels like you are jumping off a bridge and there’s nothing to grab you. And then something grabs you. I get chills thinking about it.When was the last time you felt it?I’m feeling it right now. I’m in the zone. I’m in the place where I don’t know what’s next … so you have to be willing to fail. And that’s a real vulnerable place. I feel like I only scratched the surface, and I’m a little nervous of what I have to give. I want to meet somebody, a director, do projects with somebody who can really find things in me that I don’t even know are there, but that are wanting to come out. I feel like there’s this little monster inside of me that just wants to get out. And that’ll make me feel free and alive. I feel I’m on the verge of that. I do feel very alive right now, but I also feel like it’s a very vulnerable, open, scary, interesting, exciting time.Kiernan ShipkaActorWhat’s something you’ve never done that you’d still love to do?I want to do a play. I want to be in the theatre. It scares the hell out of me, but it’s something I need to do. I am inching my way closer to the east coast and looking for a place in New York, because if I’m closer to Broadway – or maybe the West End, who knows? – maybe that would help. It would be great to do theatre again now.What was it like moving from Canada to California?Michaela, LondonWhen I moved to California, I’d never been on a plane before, and I was like, “I don’t know this place. Everyone’s going to have parrots on their shoulders.” I don’t know what I was thinking about America, but going there, I didn’t know what I was in for, and I was alone, and I’m painfully shy, but wanted to get that off of me. I needed to shed that person and step into something new.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Venetia Scott/The ObserverMikey MadisonActorDo you have a dream role you’d like to play?There’sThe Glass Menagerie, right? Amanda? I think that would be great. People don’t realise that when I was shootingPlayboycovers, I was at Samuel French [bookshop], reading Tennessee Williams and Eugene O’Neill and Sam Shepard, wondering, “How do I get from here to here?” Like, “Is that even a possibility?” I loved Barbara Loden and Ellen Burstyn and Elizabeth Hubert and Isabelle Huppert. Shirley MacLaine. Shirley MacLaine was the first actress I really fell in love with, the physical element of her. The comedy. She’s so funny and had that depth of talent.Daniel LismoreActivistIf you could share advice with the world, what would it be?I think the rebel move right now is to be kind and to be loving. If AI is listening to everything we’re doing, let’s fill it full of loving, communal thoughts as a community, and not follow the hurt. Everybody’s fighting an invisible battle, so we have to be kinder to each other, and to our fellow creatures, and the planet. The planet is stronger than we think, but we have to be more respectful.In a recent interview you mentionedCarl Jungand his books and visiting his home, which I found fascinating. How did you come across Jung and have you been through Jungian analysis?Sandra, Haverford, PennsylvaniaI remember being a teenager readingMemories, Dreams, ReflectionsandPsychology and Alchemyand Carl Jung’s shadow [theory] and all this stuff. And people were like, “Why are you reading that?” I don’t know. I’ve always been a searcher. I don’t know if I dreamed of being some kind of analyst, but I’ve definitely analysed myself a lot. And yes, I’ve had Jungian analysis. My first therapist I ever got was a Jungian analyst, I sought him out because I really resonated with that. One thing for me was, what is real? Dreams are reality, where do your dreams end and reality begins? I love that. Dreams are really important, and your unconscious.Do you have any regrets?Kevin,Wallasey, WirralNot necessarily regrets. At this point in my life, when I look back, I know I would have done things differently, but I needed the life experience to get me to this point to teach me that maybe those things could have been handled in a different way. In my personal life … I really didn’t recover from my first relationship, and I always kept on trying to fill a void that I didn’t need to. I was trying to create something for my children or for myself, some kind of place of safety. So those things, I guess. But other than that … I couldn’t have played the character of Shelly the way I did if I didn’t have the life I had. So I always think it was all worth it. It was a boot camp.Explore more on these topicsPamela AndersonYou ask the questionsTelevisionTheatreBroadwayBaywatchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After three years as head chef at cult London bakery the Dusty Knuckle, Rosina changed tack in 2021, showcasing her retro, comforting yet humble style of cooking at a pop-up, Let Me Fill You Up. “It was six courses and all about stuffed food,” she says. Dishes included cabbage rolls, stuffed chicken wings and jelly (“Ilovejelly”), with a burlesque show thrown in for good measure. A regular supper club, Come To My House I’ll Make You Fat, soon followed, and dinners at her London home have sold out ever since. “I’m still working hard, but now I can do whatever I want,” Rosina says. “And I like doing whatever I want.”View image in fullscreenParis Rosina with her Dinner Lady banner, handmade byAlice Gabb.Photograph: Perou/The ObserverSupper clubs are nothing new; chefs relishing independence and talented amateurs harnessing social media have been opening their homes to paying strangers since late 2008. “Coming from a non-professional kitchen background, I never imagined myself belonging in a restaurant,” saysAna Da Costa, whose Fat Tea supper club celebrating her Macanese heritage has led to restaurant pop-ups and events such as Meatopia. “Professional chefs often focus on the food itself, while amateur cooks like me bring a sense of warmth and familiarity.”James Ramsden rode the early supper club wave in 2010 with Secret Larder. This “led unintentionally to the last 10 years”, which meant opening restaurants including Pidgin in London (now closed). Since he moved to Yorkshire, Ramsden’s supper club – now calledThe Clock Barn– is back, and he has joined the growing number of chefs swapping professional kitchens for something more homely. “I love to cook but have zero desire to work day to day in a restaurant kitchen,” he says. “Now, once a month I do lunch and dinner for 20 people, which is nice and buzzy but seldom overwhelming.”Supper clubs scratch that professional and creative itch while offering greater autonomy over the food and working hours, and an element of certainty that a restaurant can’t. “There’s comfort in knowing how many people are coming to eat, that there’s one menu, and therefore how much money you’re going to take,” adds Ramdsen. But it’s not money that drives him: “If I crunch the numbers, it’s probably not worth doing, other than the fact I really enjoy it.”He’s not alone: last year also saw chefs Marc Johnston and Jonathan Mackle join forces for the rovingTumshie supper club in Glasgow; Rosina’s February supper clubs sold out fast and she has more planned for spring. “I just love hosting – everyone sitting in the kitchen with the music on and the candles lit,” she says. “As my friend always says, your food never tastes better than at your home.”Anna BerrillParis RosinaMeet the Miga familyMiga, arguably London’s standout opening in 2024, launched quietly in May, with an inconspicuous Instagram page (which currently has only three posts) to match its minimalist interiors. Its name means “flavourful house”, and its star dishes include ox bone broth; beef tartare with egg yolk and Korean pear; and braised short ribs, a delicately sweet stew with pears and carrots, alongside sticky rice and tangy, crunchy homemade kimchi.View image in fullscreenThe Miga team … from left, Eun Ah Ko, Hyun Sang Ko, Jae Hun Ko, Kyung Suk Lee and Jae Kyum Ko.Photograph: Pål HansenMiga is a family affair. Hyun Sang Ko moved to London in 1990, working in many of the city’s top Korean and Japanese restaurants. He runs the kitchen, with his three children front of house; their mother, Kyung Suk Lee, has another, very different Miga in south London, which launched in 2020. The latter, son Jae Ko says, is “neighbourhood auntie cooking”, with classic dishes such as bibimbap and Korean fried chicken.The Hackney restaurant has a more modern approach, and Jae’s pride in his father’s cooking is evident: “My dad is the best Korean chef in London, and arguably one of the best chefs in London. [Hackney] is where the competition is. I want to be among the best, because I know my dad can stand out.”Inspired by the Korean cultural wave, orhallyu, spearheaded by its pop music and cinema, Korean restaurants are opening at unprecedented rates. In the US, Hyun Sang says, Korean food is “better than in Korea. Here, I don’t think so.” He is helping to change that.Tomé Morrissy-SwanMigaRising star: Ash Valenzuela-HeegerView image in fullscreenErin and Ash Valenzuela-Heeger of Riverine Rabbit, Birmingham.Photograph: ZAMANIEGO STUDIOFrom the Test Kitchen, a World’s 50 Best regular in her native South Africa, to London’s three-Michelin-star the Ledbury, Ash Valenzuela-Heeger learned from the very best during her first 15 years in professional kitchens. “I endeavoured to push myself, moving around, becoming a better chef,” she says, and those formidable skills are paying dividends at Riverine Rabbit.Opened last January in the Birmingham suburb of Stirchley, and named after a native of South Africa’s Karoo desert, the 12-seat counter-dining venue was an instant hit. Valenzuela-Heeger cooks solo while her wife, Erin, handles front-of-house duties. Praise for the restaurant’s warmth (“We want it to feel like you’re being hosted at ours,” says Erin) and its small plates – such as crab muffin, brown butter hollandaise, pickled lemon and sea herbs; or bone-in skate with a yuzu buttermilk beurre blanc – soon reverberated beyond the West Midlands.There are themes to Valenzuela-Heeger’s food. She likes using seasonal game, and “cooking with fire is core”. Otherwise her dishes are a very now, very personal melding of hip, homely and high-end influences, embodied in eclectic snacks like wagyu biltong, boquerones and cheese on toast, or a fried chicken dish inspired by “throwing caviar on KFC tenders”.That individual approach extends to the Rabbit’s opening hours. Erin is a materials scientist by day; to allow the couple to spend weekends together, Riverine only opens Monday to Friday. “All our hospitality friends told us we were mad,” says Valenzuela-Heeger. “Straight away, Mondays were booking up as fast as Fridays.”Demand means Riverine could grow – extra staff, longer hours, more diners – but that is not on the agenda. For smaller independents, chasing every pound can be counterproductive: untenable at a personal leveland not always wise financially.“You’ve got to be tactical about when you’re open,” says Valenzuela-Heeger, whose recentMichelin Young Chef of 2025 awardwill only make reservations harder to get. And you need to be memorable. “We take care of you,” she continues. “We are like an oasis in a really busy world.”Tony NaylorRiverine RabbitWhen cakes meet chemistry – Dr Josh SmalleyIf you are aGreat British Bake Offfan, Josh Smalley may look familiar. A finalist in the TV competition in 2023, he hasn’t taken the customary post-show path. Instead, he runs an unusual cafe at the centre of the University of Leicester campus. Smalley – a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry – converted an old student hangout into a hub where he demonstrates his baking expertiseandhis knowledge of science.View image in fullscreenJosh Smalley in the Science Kitchen at the University of Leicester.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The ObserverHe teaches the principles of chemistry through practical cooking displays and shows how scientific laws underpin the creation of cooked dishes. One of Smalley’s lectures examines focaccia, in which enzymes break down complex sugars in the dough and drive the fermentation that creates the pockets of gas which give the Italian bread its cratered appearance. During the demonstration, sensors in the bread monitor the production of carbon dioxide. “It is a great way to visualise what is going on,” he says. Other demonstrations include the chemistry of caramel sauce, the science behind swiss roll and how to generate gingerbread in a lab.“There are all sorts of ways that science affects cooking,” says Smalley. “Take blueberry muffins: the sponge will come out red or pink if it is slightly acidic to begin with, but ends up more bluey-green if it is alkaline. People are absolutely fascinated by that sort of thing.”Smalley has taken his shows to the Cheltenham Science Festival and the Royal Institution in London. An April performance at the Edinburgh Science Festival promises a demonstration of Easter food – including, presumably, the chemistry of the hot cross bun.Robin McKieJosh SmalleyMaham Anjum, storytelling ceramicistMaham Anjum is a ceramics designer who researches global craft traditions and revives them for the modern age. “I live and breathe it,” she says from her home in London, where she’s surrounded by shelves full of ceramics from around the world.Inspired by the roadside potters near her grandmother’s house in Lahore, Anjum has worked closely with craftspeople in Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and India to create bespoke tableware for chefs including Jamie Oliver and Asma Khan, and ranges for companies such as Habitat and David Mellor.View image in fullscreenCeramicist Maham Anjum in her north London studio.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer“You need to be sensitive and respect the craft,” Anjum recalls of her work in Sri Lanka. “We enhanced their hand-making techniques and took time finding clays that could be thrown by the potter but were durable enough for the dishwasher.”She travelled between Sri Lanka and London four times each year for 13 years. “I would sit with the potters, throw with them, introduce them to the buyers.” The potters were paid 30% more than the local market would provide for their work – which was bought by Vivek Singh’s Cinnamon Club, among others.Storytelling is central to Anjum’s work with chefs, whether it’s creating a modernised version of thekulhar(chai cups) Asma Khan remembered from Kolkata, or her range for Vineet Bhatia that fused British and Indian pottery techniques to reflect his menu. Collaboration is also key. “Paula Wolfert, who wrote a book on clay-pot cooking, said: ‘The chef, the potter and the gourmand have been connected for thousands of years,’” Anjum says. “I do the same in a 21st-century context. It’s all teamwork.”Hayley MyersMaham AnjumDavid Carter, restaurateur of the momentLast year was a good one for David Carter. The restaurateur with the Midas touch opened Oma and Agora in London’s Borough Market to great acclaim (picking up a recent Michelin award for best opening, and a star), after being smitten by the Greek islands on a trip in 2022. “I was so inspired I went back six or seven times that year,” he recalls.The original concept was simply Oma (meaning “raw”), but the semi-industrial building was too big. “It would have been suicide to do just one restaurant,” says Carter. So downstairs became Agora, serving slow-grilled chicken thigh skewers and bowls of hummus and masabacha with hot crisps for scooping. “I was more confident about Agora; from a price perspective it’s accessible, but it’s also urban, filthy, and you can come in your pyjamas.”View image in fullscreenRestaurateur David Carter in Oma.Photograph: Amit Lennon/The ObserverUpstairs, Oma is more elegant, with raw sea bass and jalapeño aguachile, plus its much-lauded spanakopita gratin: “It’s more like the creamed spinach you’d get in a steakhouse but spiked with feta. It’s quite naughty.”Carter was “born a glutton”. He grew up in Barbados, baking cakes with his mum before he could walk. Although architecture was the plan (“I love how design makes people feel”), he landed a job at the Four Seasons in LA, before joining the Gordon Ramsay Group in London. But cooking over fire is in his veins, and Carter opened Smokestak, with its brisket buns and pork belly ribs, in 2016: “We were late to the barbecue party, but the food represents me and how I grew up.”Manteca, founded with chef Chris Leach, followed in 2019. Originally in Soho, now in Shoreditch, the restaurant quickly became a London must-visit, thanks to its smart take on Italian food. Silky pasta and nose-to-tail charcuterie showed Carter staying abreast of the curve – not that he believes in trends: “My guiding force is to create restaurants I want to eat in.”What’s next? “I’m attracted to homely concepts: comforting, warming, never stiff.” Does that mean there is a new restaurant in the pipeline? “It takes a year to get a restaurant off the ground, and the year after you get itchy feet,” he says. “Put it this way: we’re approaching a year since Oma opened.”Anna BerrillOmaAgoraJenny Lau’s communityJenny Lau has spent six years building a community through food, and her events have made connections well beyond her London home. She jokes it’s “for selfish reasons”: to create something she longed for. But for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who have benefited, she is a hero who has built kinship among diasporic communities.Born in London, Lau moved to Hong Kong with her family as a newborn, then back to the UK aged 11. “You never really think about your identity until you become framed as someone who doesn’t belong,” she says.View image in fullscreenLau studied classical music and is a writer and author – her first book,An A-Z of Chinese Food (Recipes Not Included)was published in January. In 2018 she visited the Hackney Chinese Community Centre in north London (now theESEA Community Centre) and started hosting potluck meals, where each guest brings a dish and stays for the feast. Now she cooks at the centre’s twice-weekly lunch club, which is open to all, and facilitates supper clubs that raise funds for the centre and other charities.Although the centre’s membership hails mostly from east and south-east Asian backgrounds, those who pass through its doors have roots across the world.Lau has helped change the centre’s fortunes. Last year, it moved to a bigger site, and since Jenny’s involvement, younger people have started coming to the centre – an intergenerational connection that benefits everyone.Emily Chung, a doctor, cookbook author and one half of theRangoon Sisters supper club, takes her children there so “they can be around older Asian uncles and aunties. I was fortunate to grow up around that, but they don’t have that so much now. Jenny has allowed so many of us to connect with our roots.”“Someone said my events are ‘for people like me, who feel they don’t belong, or feel safe and accepted in any space’,” Lau says. “That’s exactly what I’m trying to create, for the ‘unbelongers’ who feel a bit awkward and don’t fit in.”Melissa ThompsonJenny LauSam Grainger: the ideal modern chefWhen Sam Grainger opened Manchester’sMedlock Canteenlast year, he wanted its dishes – including a vast turkey schnitzel with salsa verde and a fried duck egg, and a deep-fried fruit pie and custard – to feel as generous as home cooking. “If you’re ordering a portion of mash,” says the 34-year-old, “it should sink you.”View image in fullscreenSam Grainger: ‘I’m bored of all that ego-cheffy stuff.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverTalented chefs rarely concern themselves with big portions, full bellies and offering clear value during a cost-of-living crisis. But Grainger, executive chef and co-owner at a growing portfolio of hip, friendly northern venues, has proven adept at reconciling his on-point modern cooking with that eagerness to please – and feed.Grainger made his name withBelzan, a small-plates restaurant in his native Liverpool – which, at first, “was all about me”. When it opened in 2017, Grainger refused to serve potato dishes. It felt too easy.Belzan remains cutting-edge. But Grainger has learned to edit his wilder creative urges and enthusiasm for new ingredients to create menus that take diners with him: “I’m bored of all that ego-cheffy stuff. The business has become more about people and enjoyment.”This ethos has seen him hit a hot streak with venues includingMadre, a Mexican restaurant collaboration with Breddos Tacos that has sites in Liverpool, Manchester and, soon, Leeds. This year, he will open Manchester bar Speed Limit and an east Asian-inspired restaurant at the city’s Treehouse Hotel.Grainger first cooked professionally in Sydney and Thailand, where food (“so spicy, so flavourful”) offered daily revelations. He likes similarly big flavours and dishes that encourage communal sharing. “I don’t want to sit in stuffy restaurants having 70 minuscule courses,” he says. Dinner should make people smile: “It’s a social thing. It’s about big, hearty stuff on the table you’re going to pass around and chat about. It’s about people.”Tony NaylorSam GraingerKaneda Pen, cooking between culturesRegulars to Soho may know that some of the most exciting recent restaurants began life at the Sun & 13 Cantons pub. At the moment, it’s Mamapen, where Kaneda Pen cooks Cambodian grills and curries, burgers with a Khmer accent and … tattie-mince noodles? It’s Pen’s favourite dish on the menu – comforting, warm, a big-hitter in savoury flavour. As with much of his food, it has its origins in the home kitchen. His Scottish girlfriend (a chef at neighbouring Mountain) was making mince and tatties. She grabbed some leftover gravy from the freezer, “but in that gravy was star anise, oyster sauce, soy sauce …” She put the gravy in the mince; they ate it with potatoes, but Pen kept thinking about noodles, turning it over in his mind, waiting for an opportunity to put it on the menu. When he did, it was an instant bestseller.View image in fullscreenKaneda Pen of Mamapen at the Sun and 13 Cantons in London.Photograph: Nic Crilly-Hargrave“We’ve achieved so much in such a short amount of time,” he says, looking around the dining room. In a different life, Pen used to drink in the Sun & 13 Cantons. Fifteen years ago, he was an executive in a media agency. He suffered burnout, got signed off for a few months and decided he had to reset, so he trained as a chef. He cut his teeth on the tempura section at Aqua Kyoto before cooking in a few places, most recently at live-fire outfitFrom the Ashes.The first iteration of Mamapen happened in 2020 at a pub in Hackney. Now eight months into his new home, Pen has a young, diverse team he’s proud to lead and tables are full every night, often with people experiencing Cambodian food for the first time. Mamapen has been called London’s only Cambodian restaurant – Pen is unsure of that, but it’s certainly one of a scant handful in the UK.“Sometimes we do get the authenticity police turning up,” Pen says, with a shrug, a sigh, a small smile. People who have been to Cambodia on holidays come in and ask for amok – but, he says, that fish curry is a royal dish. “My mum and my auntie never cooked that for us.”The people who ask for amok need to sit down with Pen and learn about him, he says: “My story is as much being British as Cambodian.” He was born in Cambodia, but moved to the UK in 1980 to escape the war. Mama Pen had five kids in tow, and the ingredients she was used to were “non-existent” in Britain at the time. Cooking between two cultures, she did her best. “We grew up having soy sauce in bolognese, stuff like that.” She’s still Pen’s number-one inspiration: it’s her spring-roll filling that tops the pork toast. “We always get the best food at home,” Pen says, adding that though he’s proud to be one of the first, perhaps that’s why there hasn’t been such a need for Cambodian restaurants. “Our mums are the best.”Holly O’NeillMamapenFood and drinkSea Sisters: British conservas“Sea Sisters isn’t tinned fish. It’s Britishconservas,” Charlotte Dawe says, speaking from the craft cannery she founded in west Dorset with her partner, ex-Trullo chef Angus Cowan. Conservas – high-quality preserved fish – had sustained and inspired the pair while they travelled in a van through Spain. “We became obsessed with trying the different cans,” Cowan says, “and thought it’d be cool to be the first producers in England.”View image in fullscreenCara Lennon, Angus Cowen, Charlotte Dawe, and Honor Smith-Wright of Dorset’s Sea Sisters.Photograph: Harry Borden/The ObserverThe first Covid lockdown was an opportunity to experiment in their small kitchen in east London. “There were lots of Post-it notes, and fish hanging everywhere,” says Cowan. Sea Sisters, named for their two young daughters, was launched the following year from a micro-cannery in Hackney Wick, before their relocation to the south-west: “To be closer to the fisheries and shorten the supply chain,” says Dawe.Two years on, they are bastions of sustainability. “We have a massive responsibility to talk about local species and their seasonality,” she says. Cowan continues: “We only use ethically sourced fish, such as mussels, which clean the water and encourage biodiversity, and Cornish hake that have had the chance to reproduce.” Beyond offering a quality delicacy, their mission is to educate people about the British fishing industry. “Ninety per cent of British fish is exported,” says Dawe. “For us, success is someone enjoying a locally landed species for the first time and talking about it. It’s a small shake-up, but we’re hoping for a ripple effect.”Hayley MyersSea SistersMeera Sodha’s mushroom shawarmaView image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s mushroom shawarma with sumac cucumbers.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian.

It’s simple: mix torn-up mushrooms and wedges of red onion with a paprika-spiked marinade. Bake, then serve with quick-pickled sumac cucumber, pitta, pickled chillies and – another swerve from tradition – vegan garlic mayo (the vegan part is optional). There are other versions of this dish, including one by Jamie Oliver, but Sodha’s is the shawarma I keep coming back to.Killian FoxMeera SodhaUrban wineries“There is no shortage of good wine,” Warwick Smith concedes. But by making his in – get this – Walthamstow, the Renegade Urban Winery founder sees an opportunity to educate and innovate.View image in fullscreenStacey Raath and Harry Appleyard of Northern Wine.Photograph: Sheenah Alcock/PRTypically marketed through a prism of vineyards, farming and terroir, Smith believes the detail of how wine is made is underappreciated. “My angle is to show why themakingmakes a difference,” he says, which includes inviting visitors to his winery and bar to explore its wine press, barrels and bottling-line apparatus.Renegade sources grapes from Britain and Europe, and gets creative with them. It has made a pinot noir by combining British, Italian and German grapes. It adds craft beer hops to its Bethnal Bubbles sparkling white. British wine is a blank slate, says Smith, so “let’s be innovators”.Across northern Europe, a small but growing band of urban wineries are working in various ways to produce distinctive wines in unexpected places: London’sBlackbookandLondon Cru;Chateau Amsterdam; Gothenburg’sWine Mechanics.Launched in 2022, Cumbria’s Northern Wine takes grapes from UK vineyards (saluting the logistics with a pinot noir called Roadworks on the M6) and creates limited-run wines so impressive they are served in Simon Rogan’s Michelin-starred restaurants.Northern’s approach is patient, fastidious and low-intervention. “Time is a great friend,” says co-owner Stacey Raath. Long lees-ageing allows English wines to develop real “textural, layered” complexity: “We stay steadfast until it’s ready.”Tony NaylorRenegade Urban WineryNorthern WineGod-tier fish and chipsFood is endlessly prey to fads and hype, and that makes a place like Drake’s in Knaresborough’s Silver Street all the more admirable. Restaurant manager Karen Rankine has worked at this fish and chip shop for almost 30 years, and its traditional methods endure. Fish is cooked to order in Yorkshire’s sacred beef dripping; batter is made each morning; mushy peas are steeped and cooked daily; tartare sauce is homemade. “It’s what we’ve always done,” says Rankine. The result is fish and chips of such vivid freshness and lip-smacking savoury depth that it really is a timeless classic.Tony NaylorDrake’sMauby: defying stereotypesA rich jerk chicken in a thick, spicy sauce, with perfectly crisp blackened skin.

Mauby draws influences from both, but defies national categorisation: it is a London restaurant. “It’s food we love to cook and eat with friends and family,” says Maynard. “When you’re passionate about food and enjoy cooking, you don’t need to conform to one set cuisine. We’ve been called a Caribbean restaurant, but we’re not strictly that. We’re trying to defy stereotypes.”The pair have run pop-ups in London since 2016, and transformed an old chippy into a warm, inviting room for their first restaurant. The menu is short, seasonal and affordable. “We try to offer a range, so that it can meet your budget,” says McCrindle. “It’s important for us that you enjoy every dish and feel welcomed in our space, whether that’s having the whole menu twice over, or a few cocktails and a couple of small plates in a nice setting.”ToméMorrissy-SwanMaubyJonah Schulz: makes beer, draws beerWhen brewer Jonah Schulz isn’t working his day job atThe Kernelin south London, he’s designing logos and labels for another terrific microbrewery –Newbarns in Leith, Edinburgh, launched by a pair of Kernel alumni in 2019. “They offhandedly asked me if I’d be interested in helping with their visual identity,” says Connecticut-born Schulz, who studied fine-art printmaking in New York, “and I very much was.”View image in fullscreenNewbarns Brewery cans by Jonah Schulz.Photograph: Michael Whitaker/The ObserverAs well as Newbarns’ logo, combining a barn roof with an ear of barley, he has created more than 90 designs for the company, mainly can labels. “For the most part they let me get on with it, which feels like a special relationship because some of it has frankly been quite odd.” Schulz points to a pale ale called I Have No Proof, for which he created an elaborate film noir-style poster featuring a detective and a crocodile. More often, his labels prioritise typography and strong blocks of colour, but they’re distinctive and beautifully conceived, standing out amid the riot of designs in your local craft beer shop.KillianFoxJonah SchulzGilda’s cinnamon morning bunsJon Warren is working out how many cinnamon buns leave the ovens at Gilda, his bakery near Bishopsbourne in Kent, each week.

They’re rolled in cinnamon sugar after baking for added textural interest, but absolutely not drizzled with syrup, to keep them on the right side of sweet. “It’s the simplicity of it,” says Warren. “We’re keeping it quite natural and not messing around.”How good are they? Good enough for one couple to request them as their wedding cake next summer.Kate GuestGildaCaro’s Cook RiteView image in fullscreenMost of us think of all-purpose seasoning as the dried stuff found in supermarkets. But Caroline Bucchan is making a zingy fresh version from her kitchen in Forest Hill, south-east London. Born in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Bucchan came to London in the 1990s to work as a nanny, bringing her mother’s recipe with her. She set up Caro’s Cook Rite in 2023 and started selling her all-purpose green seasoning at local food markets. The range now includes an extra-hot version, blends for fish (with lemon zest), chicken (with rosemary) and lamb (with mint), plus limited editions for seasonal specialities. “My mother used her seasoning on absolutely everything,” Bucchan says, “and that’s what my customers do, too. They use it for meat rubs and on couscous, salads and stews.”Lindsey McWhinnieCaro’s Cook RiteChoc ice v ice-cream sandwichView image in fullscreenVagabond’s vegan choc ices and Happy Endings’ ice-cream sandwichesThere is a curious pleasure, no doubt rooted in nostalgia, to buying ice-cream not in a tub, a cone or on a stick but wrapped in greaseproof paper and sandwiched between two thin slabs of biscuit, usually containing chocolate. The London-based company Happy Endings, founded by Aussie chef Terri Mercieca, has been selling terrific ice-cream sandwiches for the best part of a decade; they are stocked at shops and restaurants all over the capital, and a few beyond. “They’re fun to make,” says Mercieca. “They involve about 15 more steps than just pouring ice-cream into a tub, but people respond really well to them.” Their bestseller, she says, is The Malty One, which is “like a Hobnob smashed up with a Malteser but more fancy”.Similarly packaged, but more like choc ices than sandwiches, are the supremely delicious plant-based creations of Lucy Masters, who trades as Vagabond. Her inspiration came from four years spent in Los Angeles. “Anything was possible, like lavender caramel … and vegan ice-cream wasn’t really demarcated in the same way.” Returning to south London, she found local offerings “so boring” that she decided to make her own, first from home and now from a workspace in Brockley.She makes plant-based ice-cream because her daughter can’t eat dairy, and she wants to make ice-cream available to everybody: “Not good for vegans, just good ice-cream.” Her peanut butter and pretzel is a highlight, though I particularly enjoyed one with cherries that took Masters a long time to perfect – she ended up boiling the cherries for hours, until they turned into a “rich and delicious” syrup.“I love choc ices,” she says. “You pick it up, it’s a really nice object, you unwrap it, you see the chocolate but you don’t know what’s inside. And then you bite it, which is really fun. You get the crack of the chocolate. You can eat it on the go and it’s just slightly joyful.”Killian FoxHappy EndingsVagabondModern Jew-ish foodA new wave of chefs are exploring their Jewish identities by experimenting with flavours and culinary influences, and highlighting the adaptive nature of diasporas themselves. Reinterpretations of secular Ashkenazi cuisine in particular have been building in the US, with chefs such asJeremy Umansky(Larder Delicatessen & Bakery),Jeremy Salamon(Agi’s) andKatianna Hong(Yangban) leading the way.In the UK, Ollie Gratter of Wilde’s Deliand Ruben Dawnay of Ruben’s Reubens aren’t just replicating the “New York-style” food. They’re drilling down into their Ashkenazi culinary and cultural heritage and marrying traditional flavours and cooking techniques with global cuisines, food trends and local influences, producing dishes such as barbacoa on challah, Polish/Chinese burnt leek dumplings and furikake smoked lox.“It was a bit about heritage, a bit about my name, and exploring the foods that were all around me,” says Dawnay, who has homed in on pickling, curing and smoking techniques. He has also been led by flavours, beginning with the first reuben sandwich he ever ate, at Monty’s Deli. “The first time eating caraway seeds, I thought: ‘This is the coolest thing ever. I don’t know if I love them or hate them but they’re definitely present.’”For Gratter, it’s about allowing space for reinterpretation: “Breaking traditions is an important part of progress. Traditional ways have their place, but adaptation is also inherent to Jewish food, like any other diaspora. I want to use recognisably Jewish ingredients in new ways.”Adrienne Katz KennedyRuben’s ReubensWilde’s DeliPlacesLittle Piece of BahiaDuring lockdown,Camila Vargasreceived a call from her mother in Brazil, who was receiving treatment for cancer and didn’t have long to live. Her mother told her it was time for Vargas to continue the family legacy of cooking food from their state – Bahia, in north-eastern Brazil.View image in fullscreenCamila Vargas at her Little Piece of Bahia stall in east London.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer“I didn’t know how to cook,” says Vargas, “but she said, ‘You’re my daughter, you’re black, it’s ancestral food. The food’s inside you, it will come out.’ And it did. I couldn’t believe the success.”Bahian cuisine has its roots in Africa. Dishes are cooked in dendê, an unrefined palm oil. The ingredients aren’t hard to find, says Vargas – African shops stock many of them, including palm oil and black-eyed peas.Vargas has sold her version of Bahian and wider Brazilian cuisine at markets in Manchester and London for three years, and now has a permanent site at Arndale Market in Manchester. Star dishes include acarajé, a black-eyed pea fritter filled with a creamy shrimp, coconut milk and nut paste and smoked prawns; and moqueca de camarão, a spicy seafood stew laden with rust-red palm oil. Homesick Bahians come from across Europe, says Vargas, while locals have fallen in love. “They are resistant to it, something they’ve never seen before. But when they try it, they go crazy.”ToméMorrissy-SwanLittle Piece of BahiaMara’s Picklery, EdinburghThanks to Mara’s Picklery, burping ferments and briny provisions have arrived in Marchmont, Edinburgh, close to the leafy Meadows. With its custard-coloured frontage amid a sea of stone tenements, it appears playful, but the flavours served up are serious: think venison bresaola with persimmon carpaccio and chai-pickled grapes. At the helm are Eilish Leyland-Jones and Pragnesh Patel, who met at a vineyard in New Zealand in 2017.View image in fullscreenMara’s Picklery, Edinbugh.Photograph: PRSince opening in March 2024, they’ve been busy. “Our pickle plates have been flying,” says Leyland-Jones, “but we’re not just a shop selling jars of pickles, and we’re not just about pickle plates.” They are fiercely seasonal, she says. “We do quick pickles in the summer, but in the colder months we’re big on sweet and sour caraway cabbage, and we’re pickling romanesco as we’ve got extra.”Mama Patel’s chai, based on a family recipe from Gujarat, is an instant warmer-upper. Their bestseller is a simple cheese toastie elevated by pickled chilli jam with apple, and a zingy ginger switchel is a good idea whatever Edinburgh’s weather. The pickles may change with the seasons, but the customers are already on repeat.Caroline EdenMara’s PickleryDestination ThessalonikiOn the north-western corner of the Aegean, Thessaloniki was one of the most important cities of the Byzantine Empire, and centuries of occupation, trade and refuge have resulted in a heavy dose of Turkish, Arabic, Jewish and Baltic influence in everything from the architecture to a food scene unlike any other in Greece.“Food combinations are more daring than in other parts of the country,” says Thessalonian chef Vasilis Chamam, who fuses the city’s historic traditions with global flavours and cooking techniques. (With a flurry of interest in contemporary Greek food in the UK, chefs like Chamam and Diamantis Kalogiannidis – ex Da Terra, now in residency atPasero– are helming pop-ups in London, showcasing what makes Thessalonian cuisine so special.) Chamam has witnessed the city “going through a modernisation of its cuisine, with lots of chefs cooking food that’s looking at the city’s past”. To “taste the city’s traditions”, he recommends making a reservation at neighbourhood restaurantIliopetra.While you’ll see all the taverna classics in Thessaloniki, expect to see heartier food, much as you would in the north of Italy. Claypot cooking is a strength: meats simmered low and slow, the rich sauces finished with pasta such as hilopites or orzo. Spices are used in a way not seen elsewhere in the country: unusually, ginger is prevalent, especially in drinks, in hot salepi (made from orchid root) and lemonade from street carts; while tomato-based dishes might be laced with chilli, allspice and other aromatics.Frappe was invented in Thessaloniki, but the presence of Greece’s largest university means that as well as old-school kafeneons, there are plenty of hip coffee shops and bars within the 4th-century walls. And those with a sweet tooth should note that Thessaloniki is known for its bakeries. There’s trigona, a filo triangle filled with a thick sweet cream, and it’s thought that bougatsa, Greece’s famous pie, originated in the city.Bougatsa Giannisis one of the most popular bakers in town, with a super social scene of people sitting outside, chatting over the classic sweet custard pies, as well as less common savoury versions filled with slow-cooked meat or cheese. It doesn’t open until 8pm and goes through till 3pm – which tells you everything you need to know about this exciting, 24-hour food-obsessed city.Georgina HaydenVasilis ChamamBizarre restaurant names“It still astounds me that’s the name we went with,” says Alex Claridge of his Birmingham restaurant, Albatross Death Cult.Opening a second restaurant was, says Claridge, “financially, emotionally, creatively,an albatross around my neck” – hence thatRime of the Ancient Mariner-inspired moniker. The name generated publicity, but was primarily intended to attract inquisitive diners – people with “a sense of humour” who would “embrace the slightly avant garde” and dig the restaurant’shighly creative seafood tasting menu.View image in fullscreenDon’t Tell Dad restaurant.For such a creative industry, few restaurants boast interesting names. The current trend is prosaic: Café This, or Something Canteen. Briefly, Claridge toyed with calling his counter-dining restaurant Counter.Happily, like York’s Brancusi (Romanian sculptor), London’sSesta(a medieval wine vessel), the playfulDon’t Tell Dador the taqueria Homies On Donkeys, its name acolourful homageto the owners’ Tijuana roots, Claridge took a more entertaining route. As did chef Simon Bonwick, currently cooking upstairs at the Oarsman pub in Marlow under the nameTroublesome Lodger.Goodbye Horses is both an epic slice of 1980s synth-pop by Q Lazzarus and a London wine bar. The title was chosen, says co-founder Alex Young, for its “nostalgic, somehow warm” aura: “The way those words feel is the feeling we’re trying to create in the restaurant.”It is also “fun and mysterious” in not explaining what Goodbye Horsesdoes. Intrigue is attractive, agrees chef Josh Overington. The name of his Yorkshire restaurant,Mýse(old English, to eat at a table), is opaque until you dine there and see how its dishes draw on historical English recipes.Restaurants needn’t be “an open book”, says Overington. “I quite like not knowing what I’m getting into.”Tony NaylorAlbatross Death CultGoodbye HorsesChez Bruce: 30 years of stealth influence“Chefs feel the need to perform, to do something different,” says Matt Christmas. That pressure, explains Chez Bruce’s head chef, is why chefs might use bananas in a tarte tatin: “Think of all the fruit you’ve dismissed to arrive at banana. What are you doing? If you don’t need to, don’t piss about with it.”That guiding principle has, in the three decades since Chez Bruce opened, established the south London restaurant as a touchstone in British hospitality. Of course, it has evolved. Its food is less overtly French these days. It serves a miso-glazed aubergine starter. ButOFM readers who, in 2006, voted it their favourite restaurant, could still eat a three-course dinner of soup, chauteaubriand and creme brulee from its Michelin-starred menu. Consistency, says Christmas, is “a big draw”.View image in fullscreenBruce Poole, of Chez Bruce, photographed for Observer Food Monthly, March 2006.Photograph: John ReardonChristmas, head chef since 2005, and co-owner and chef Bruce Poole insist on traditional cooking methods (stocks are made from scratch, breads baked in-house), and on big, bold flavours that interact with confidence. No daft garnishes. No fussy over-elaboration. “I hate meek cooking,” says Christmas.Over the decades, numerous chefs have absorbed the Chez Bruce method. Joe Mercer-Nairne, chef and co-owner at London’sMedlar, loves their skilled process: “It’s hot pans. You cook. It’s old fashioned, quite labour intensive. But you get a better product.” Chef-restaurateur Gary Usher, founder ofElite Bistros, learned many crucial lessons in Bruce’s famous kitchen opposite Wandsworth Common. For example, highlight one primary flavour in soups and purees: “Parsley soup needs to taste of parsley. Seasononlyto enhance that flavour.”At times, Chez Bruce’s rigour and simplicity has looked anachronistic. But, in 2025, artisan skills and French brasserie cooking areen vogueagain. Christmas laughs: “We’re almost back in fashion.”Tony NaylorChez BruceLe Doyenné, Saint-Vrain, outside ParisThere’s been a trend in recent years for talented French chefs to escape the big city and set up restaurants with rooms and a plot of land where they grow their own veg and raise livestock. One outstanding example is Le Doyenné in Saint-Vrain, an hour’s drive south of Paris. In 2017, Australian chefs James Henry and Shaun Kelly (who worked together atAu Passage) took over a “complete ruin” of a mansion and spent five years turning it into the restaurant-guesthouse of their dreams.View image in fullscreenChefs Shaun Kelly and James Henry in Le Doyenné’s vegetable garden.Photograph: Evan SungFirst, they revived the orchard and one-hectare vegetable garden, then they created a dining room in the stables formerly used by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle. They opened in June 2022 and have attracted a devoted following for their inventive, hyper-seasonal menu – a highlight from my visit was a spectacular board of crudités with charcuterie from their own pigs. The location sets the project apart: “We’re fortunate to have found these ideal conditions so close to Paris,” Henry says. “From the moment you enter, you feel like you’re transported. The city falls away, even though you’re really on the doorstep.”Killian FoxLe DoyennéTake a bite out of the ’burbs“We have way more space than we could afford in town,” enthuses Jo Myers – who, with chef husband Stu, is poised to open the Swine Bistro in suburban Headingley, having previously run the Swine That Dines in Leeds city centre.Historically, high-quality restaurants wanted, if not needed, to be in city centres, for the footfall and visibility. Myers’s migration is – like Jöro’s relocation from central Sheffield to Oughtibridge, orPilgrim’s imminent relaunch in Liverpool suburb, Allerton – indicative of a new confidence that good food can thrive in the hinterlands.Anecdotally, the pandemic repopularised “staying local” – relaxed socialising in neighbourhood clusters of bars, bakeries and restaurants, without the hassle of going into a city centre. The trend was already visible in foodie hubs such as Altrincham, Pontcanna in Cardiff and Bishopthorpe Road in York, and as demand grows in affluent or fashionable suburbs, restaurants are meeting it.Sometimes that move is a personal choice. “We wanted to integrate into a community,” says chef Sandy Jarvis, co-founder of Bavette, in Horsforth, a northern suburb of Leeds. TheGood Food Guidenamed it2024’s best local restaurant, but its location has not stopped it attracting diners from the wider area. Indeed, Bavette is in such demand it retains two tables (only bookable directly, by regulars), to help maintain its neighbourhood feel.Technology helps. Social media allows restaurants to advertise their presence anywhere; and, says Myers, thinking of her own city breaks, exploring Britain’s suburbs is easy now, “with Google Maps telling you which bus to take, or Uber”. Foodies will hunt out good food, wherever it is.Tony NaylorThe Swine BistroBavetteGeo-Cafe, CavershamProspect Street, in Caversham, Reading, was a culinary wilderness when I was growing up nearby in the 1990s. Today, it is a pocket-sized but perfect go-to dining destination.Clay’s Kitchen & Bar, raved aboutby Grace Dent, is famous for its outstanding Hyderabadi-style dum biryani and chepala pulusu (monkfish curry), but it is the Geo-Cafe a few doors down, run by Georgia-born Keti Maglakelidze and her family, that has my heart. Maglakelidze is certain that locals stay loyal to her “because of the strong and friendly sense of community” that the cafe fosters – and because “people appreciate that we are the actual makers of most things we offer”.On the menu, the chicken and adjika (salty spice paste) wrap served with homemade tkemali plum sauce or walnutty, garlicky bazhe sauce sells best, Maglakelidze says, closely followed by the aubergine wrap, which is based on the classic Georgian mezze dish badrijani nigvzit, aubergine rolls stuffed with walnut paste.Caroline EdenGeo-CafeMediaA book of cult sandwichesView image in fullscreenAn illustration by Dave Bain fromCult Sandwiches.The high-end sandwich boom showsno sign of abating, but, as food writer David Paw makes clear in the introduction to his new bookCult Sandwiches, for the recipes that pass the test of time we must look past the latest clout-chasing viral sensation. His compendium of 100 all-time classic sandwiches from across the globe is an attempt to do just that. It is a beautifully designed tome featuring everything from seafood po’ boys (New Orleans) to mie goreng toasties (Sydney) to balik ekmek (Turkey). Paw acknowledges that his list, though carefully compiled, barely scratches the surface – and that even the definition of “sandwich” is up for grabs (is a burger a sandwich? And if not, why not?). Nonetheless, it’s a loving and energetic culinary world tour, celebrating a cult that’s only gaining followers.Max OleskerCult SandwichesThe Evin Prison Bakers’ ClubIranian activist Sepideh Gholian was arrested during a peaceful workers’ rights protest in 2018, aged 24, and has spent most of the past six and a half years in jail. First, she wrote and – with the help of journalist Maziar Bahari – published a prison diary. Now, by the same route, she has created the extraordinary, genre-defying book,The Evin Prison Bakers’ Club – Surviving Iran’s Most Notorious Prisons in 16 Recipes(published in the UK in April), which combines stories of life inside Iran’s brutal carceral system with baking recipes.The recipes – tres leches cake, finger-twist halva, date crumble – are integral to Gholian’s story. For her, and the women she befriended in custody, baking is a refuge from the horrors of prison and a way to remember those who died of neglect or were murdered by the authorities. The book is proof of Gholian’s triumphant resistance against a regime that wants her silenced, and a powerful message of hope for the future.Killian FoxThe Evin Prison Bakers’ ClubThe Ómós DigestView image in fullscreenChef Cúán Greene.Photograph: Ellius GraceEvery week for the past four years, the gifted young Irish chef Cúán Greene has been writing thoughtfully and honestly about the highs and lows of cooking for a living. One recent dispatch of his newsletter,Ómós Digest– Ómós isalso the name of his forthcoming restaurant, guesthouse and four-acre farm in County Laois – dealt with the impact of kitchen bullying; another considered the stigma of taking a career break, which Greene himself has been doing since leaving Dublin’s Bastible in 2020 (prior to that, he worked at Noma).The newsletter, which has more than 4,000 subscribers, also charts his culinary travels, celebrates Irish producers and invites fellow food experts to contribute guest posts. It’s rare to find a chef who can write with Greene’s acuity, and he tells me the newsletter will live on after his new venture – with sky-high ambitions, backed by Stripe co-founder John Collison – finally opens in June 2026.Killian FoxÓmós DigestExplore more on these topicsThe ObserverFoodFood and drinkFood and drink booksChefsRestaurantsShareReuse this content"

You’re sleep-deprived, you’re hormonal, you’re riding some serious emotional highs and lows, and embarking on probably the highest-stakes venture of your life.Everyone has their opinions, and pretty soon you do too. You urgently need advice, and there’s no shortage of it. Sure, lots of this advice is not only dogmatic but contradictory, and the algorithm floats all the most guilt-inducing content to the top. There’s little consensus (unless it’s that you’re definitely not doing enough tummy time).The group chat with other new mums can be a lifeline. It may be the blind leading the blind, but at least you’re all going through the same things together.Being a parent means you’re never quite your own person again – but that self-sacrifice can pull off a miracle | Justin TohRead moreExcept when you’re not. It’s a perilous journey out on to that limb, to say to a fellow mum that I’m struggling with this or I’m loving that. There’s payoff in the solidarity of the “me too”. But if you share something difficult and get a blank face in return – not their experience – you can feel cast down and even more isolated. If you share something positive and the experience is not shared,theycan easily be cast down or unsettled by it. Nobody’s fault; still, a minefield.How do you share somebody’s experience if you don’t, well, share their experience? The piece of advice that keeps recurring to me as I step gingerly through the minefield is this one: rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn. It’s from the Bible, the Apostle Paul’s letter to Christians in Rome, and it neatly sums up how to do life with people whose circumstances are sometimes much better and sometimes much harder than your own. When any one member of the group has something to celebrate, we all have something to celebrate. When any member is cast down, we’re all cast down.It sounds straightforward enough, but it takes quite a bit of emotional agility to do both at the same time – to celebrate people’s wins when you’re deep in the slog, or to enter into someone’s woes when things are going well for you.The art of celebration and the art of empathy – both crucial to the art of communityWhen it comes to motherhood, there’s been a huge swing in recent times towards the “mourn with those who mourn” side of the equation. There’s a whole genre of social media post that begins “What nobody tells you about having kids is …” followed by whatever is currently driving them crazy about their kids. But as parenthood loomed for me, it felt like all anyone tells you about having kids is the hard stuff: the loss of sleep, time, autonomy, even self. Practically every mummy blog for the last 20 years has gone into great detail about what a hard job this is.All this is a great advance on the conspiracy of silence that (to some extent) once existed – the sense that it would be betraying your kids and your sacred vocation as a mother to acknowledge that you don’t exactly love everything about it, all the time. The solidarity of mourning with those who mourn – venting with those who vent? – is hard-won, and cathartic. But have we lost the knack of the opposite – rejoicing with those who rejoice?(Just anecdotally here, I wonder if the pattern is reversed for men. The stereotype was once that guys chafed more at the constraints of family life. But while we waited for our munchkin to arrive, my husband had more than one male colleague tell him: don’t listen to the negativity; having kids is the best.)The golden rule of the parents’ group chat? No chit-chat | Natasha ShollRead moreJoy is definitely a word we associate with becoming parents. But there can be a strange iffiness about sharing the good stuff. Laments for lost sleep or lost sanity meet a sympathetic ear, but to enthuse about time with your baby can sound like bragging, or trigger an uneasy competitiveness. It’s basic politeness, of course, not to mention to other new parents that your baby is sleeping through the night. (And prudence, maybe; sleep deprivation makes us a bit murderous.) But why does it sometimes feel like it’s only acceptable to be open about what sucks?I flip back to that rejoice/mourn passage to find another key to navigating the minefield: love must be sincere, it says. Love, the simplest and the hardest thing in the world. If we’re genuinely – sincerely – seeking the good of the other person, then it becomes not only possible but intuitive to enter into their joy or pain, and to regulate our own decisions about what and how much to share. Love can rush in where the prudent fear to tread.It also makes space for our mistakes. Love covers over a multitude of sins: another nugget of wisdom, from elsewhere in the New Testament. You can forgive a lot from someone who you know wants only good things for you. To rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn is an art. The art of celebration and the art of empathy – both crucial to the art of community. It takes a village, they say. Even if that village is built on a minefield.Natasha Moore is a senior research fellow at the Centre for PublicChristianity(CPX)Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

Secondhand Trumpism will only alienate its voters furtherSun 23 Feb 2025 07.42 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 12.46 ESTShareWhat times these are. As Donald Trump’s sellout of Ukraine gains pace, there are reports that Keir Starmerwill flatter the presidentby inviting him to address parliament. Meanwhile, Trump’s British admirers continue to offer flimsy excuses and undimmed admiration. Before Trump paid tribute to Nigel Farage – a “great guy” – in his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) gathering in Washington, the MP for Clactonused his time at the same event to “hail” Trump’s “progress” with Vladimir Putin, and salute him as “simply the bravest man that I know”. By way of bathos, the dependably ridiculous Liz Trusshad by then tolda much smaller crowd that the country she ran for a month and a half is “failing”, and needs its own Trumpian insurgency.At the top of the party Truss so briefly led, Kemi Badenoch cannot resolve a familiar contradiction – between a dazzled liking of Trump’s ideology, and the political inconvenience of what it means in practice. Late last week, sheparroted the obligatory half-arsed rebuttalof Trump’s attack on the Ukrainian president. “President Zelenskyy is not a dictator,” she said, as if that were a revelation. But any observer of her recent engagements will know where her heart really lies.Badenoch epitomises the absurdity gripping a huge chunk of the British right, as it issues warnings about the collapse of western civilisation while cosying up to people hellbent on pulling the roof in on just about every basic tenet of liberal democracy, along with what remains of the transatlantic basis of international security. She and her allies’ understanding of such basic contradictions is about as thorough asher weekly preparation for prime minister’s questions, but that hardly diminishes her belief in a cultish, paranoid set of beliefs. So out it all comes, on a weekly basis.Last week, she found time in her diary for a turn at the annual conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship (ARC), an international initiative co-founded by that great modern sage Jordan Peterson. “Take a look at President Trump,”shetold her audience. “He’s shown that sometimes you need that first stint in government to spot the problems. But it’s the second time around when you really know how to fix them. And it starts by telling the truth.”This is Farage’s moment of reckoning: he can choose British voters – or Putin and Trump | Gaby HinsliffRead moreHer chosen verities were the same as ever: an insistence that an “intellectual elite” is in control of everything, along with warnings about “the poisoning of minds that is happening in higher education”, and “leftwing progressivism, whether it’s pronouns or DEI or climate activism”. At the same event,she was asked about Elon Muskand his so-called department of government efficiency. “I don’t even think Doge is radical enough,” she said.Who is this stuff for? If her aim is to stop theReform UKinsurgency, she is speaking in far too abstract and pointy-headed a vocabulary, a problem made worse by the lack of frontline Tory politicians who can compete with Farage’s regular-bloke affectations. But there is another consideration missing: the plain fact that being gleefully resident in a hard-right echo-chamber is guaranteed to further alienate millions of voters that the Tories have lost.As I read reports of Badenoch’s speech, I found myself thinking of Woking, the quiet corner of the Surrey commuter belt that is the epitome of a sea change that Badenoch – along with most of her party – has chosen to ignore. Last summer,the Liberal Democratstook the constituencyfrom the Conservatives on a19% swing. Some of that shift was down to the spectacularbankruptcy of the borough councilthanks to reckless decisions taken by a Tory administration. But the result was in keeping with a huge pile of Lib Dem gains that rippled through the home counties and beyond, yet received a lot less attention than the five seats won by Reform.They still readlike a litany of Tory woe: Guildford, Surrey Heath, Bicester and Woodstock,Horsham, Cotswolds South, Carshalton and Wallington, Tunbridge Wells – scores of Lib Dem gains, which came after a Tory collapse in local government.It was not hard to work out why. In many of them, a majority of voters had backed Remain in the 2016 referendum. The subsequent Tory embrace of hard Brexit left them reeling, and Boris Johnson’s amoral style of leadership only furthered their quiet despair. But there is something much deeper afoot in these places.These parts of England are assuredly modern, and oftenmore ethnically diverse than they used to be. They are often not quite as affluent as their reputation suggests, but still full of people who are mindful of the health of the economy. Those voters would be in the market for a centre-right party that emphasised the wonders of property ownership and low taxes, and pledged to back the interests of business. What they find repellent,in myexperience, is the Tory turn into fanaticism, and the sense that Farage – and now Trump – are pulling the strings. Needless to say, they do not get on their commuter trains every morning and chat animatedly about such hard-right talking-points as “cultural Marxism”, being trapped in15-minute cities, and the need to have more kids so as to preserve Judeo-Christian culture. In my experience, almost nobody in Britain does.As Badenoch blithely follows the bright light of hard-right politics, what is her offer to these voters? I know this much with certainty: that they do not look at the chaos and disorder gripping the US and Trump’s torching of international norms as something to emulate, but instead feel amounting anxiety. In the past, part of the genius of British Conservatism lay in the way it responded to times of such turbulence by offering the balm of tradition, and the idea that old institutions and conventions would endure. Now, Badenoch and her ilk seem to want to joyously throw us into the fire.Her choice of engagements is a small part of the same wretched picture. Last week,she did aninterview with Petersonin which she talked about the party that has gobbled up so many old Tory heartlands, and is now making a point of constantly attacking Trump. The Lib Dems, she said, have “silly and foolish” ideas. But other things she blurted out were much more revealing. “They don’t have much of an ideology other than being nice,” she went on, as if niceness was always to be avoided. “A typical Liberal Democrat will be somebody who is good at fixing their church roof. And, you know, the people in the community like them. They are like, ‘Fix the church roof, you should be a member of parliament.’”Didn’t those people used to beConservatives? If they have walked away, Badenoch’s accelerating turn into secondhand Trumpism is not going to pull them back. Large parts of what used to be called middle England, in fact, now surely look at the party that once confidently spoke for them and recoil: this is the Tory crisis that yet another leader shows no signs of understanding.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsKemi BadenochOpinionConservativesLiberal DemocratsReform UKNigel FarageDonald TrumpcommentShareReuse this content"

One of our senior diplomats once offered me an explanation of the allure: “The red carpet is laid out, the national anthems are played, all that stuff is very seductive.” This will be customarily accompanied by ritualistic words about the importance and invincibility of the “special relationship”.Number 10 lobbied hardto get Sir Keir Starmer across the Atlantic early in the second term of Donald Trump and, until recently, Downing Street people were telling themselves that an encounter between the two men needn’t be a disaster and might even turn out to be a success. In the weeks since Trump’s re-election as US president, UK policy might be summarised by the phrase “Don’t poke the beast”. Keep the temperature cool. Ignore provocations. Attempt to trade on British heritage – golf, the royal family – with which this US president has an affinity. Put David Lammy out there to suggest that there is lots to respect about the man whom the foreign secretary used to call a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Softly-softly was the doctrine and they thought it was bearing fruit.While a fusillade of blistering Trump attacks have been launched against other countries – among them places asvarious as Canada, Denmark, Mexicoand Panama– the UK has so far avoided being whacked. While trade threats have been made against China, the EU and America’s neighbours, ministers still hope the UK has a fair chance of dodgingthe tariffbullet. They were rather pleased with themselves at Number 10 when, a few weeks ago, the US president called Sir Keir “a very good person” who has done “a very good job thus far”. Perhaps, they told themselves in Downing Street, it was going to be OK.As a doctrine, ‘Don’t poke the beast’ only worked for as long as the beast chose not to bite off your leg regardlessNobody sentient in Number 10, the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Defence is relaxed now. Not after what has been unleashed over the past 10 days. As a doctrine, “Don’t poke the beast” only worked for so long as the beast chose not to bite off your leg regardless.Sir Keir, less than eight months into his term and still a relative novice in geopolitics, is flying to America this week with transatlantic relations smashed up like they have never been before. Although it is not his fault, the haunting thought for him is that the alliance forged during the Second World War is disintegrating on his watch. The first swing of the wrecking ball was Trump’s declaration that he had initiated land-for-peace negotiations with Vladimir Putin over the heads of Kyiv and the European members of Nato. That ambush has been followed by the US secretary of state meeting his Russian opposite numberin Saudi Arabiawith Ukraine uncordially uninvited to have any say about its fate.In a deeply disturbing speech to the Munich security conference, the vice-president,JD Vance, trolled Europeby questioning whether the continent’s values were worth defending, before holdinga taboo-busting meetingwith the leader of the far-right AfD on the eve of the German elections. We have since heard the US president falsely brand Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator” andbaselessly blameUkraine’s democratically elected leader for the war that has ravaged his country. No one should really need reminding that the conflict was started three years ago by thebarbaric Russian invasionintended to extinguish its smaller neighbour as an independent state. The span of the UK political spectrum has rejected the US president’s regurgitation of risible Kremlin propaganda, which attempts to shift culpability from the aggressor to the victim. Even Nigel Farage, usually an unashamed cheerleader and apologist for Trumpery,has had to sayhe can’t go along with that. Sir Keir wasquick to repudiatethe attack and call President Zelenskyy to express his support. Says one member of the cabinet: “Keir has been quite ballsy about that.”One question accompanying the prime minister across the Atlantic is how “ballsy” he is prepared to be when he is up close and personal with the US president. Should Trump repeat his smears aboutUkraine, the prime minister will have a choice to make. If he responds meekly or mutely, it will be at the great risk of looking pathetically pusillanimous. If he calls it out as a calumny, it will be at the serious peril of making himself the target of the fiery wrath of this thin-skinned and vindictive US president.That’s just one of the jeopardies of a visit pregnant with hazard. Another danger is that Sir Keir is greeted with a flat rebuff when he attempts to convince the American that Europe must have a role in negotiations and Ukraine has to be “kept in the fight” to strengthen the west’s hand with the Russians. Some in the UK government contend that the odds on making headway could be a bit better than they look. “A lot of commentary is jumping way ahead of itself,” says a senior figure closely involved in the preparations for the visit. “The Trump administration is still settling down. Even hard-declared positions change 24 hours later. There are multiple voices competing for Trump’s ear.”Number 10 has spent a lot of time wondering how to make the voice of the prime minister persuasive enough to influence US policy. Trying to talk up Sir Keiras a “bridge” between America and Europe sounds vainglorious. This US president doesn’t see a bridge without wanting to blow it up. European leaders baulk at the idea of the UK representing itself as an interlocutor, especially since we are no longer a member of the EU. There’s more sense in coordination with Emmanuel Macron, whosetrip to Washingtonwill precede Sir Keir’s, to marshal the argument that Europe can’t be excluded from decisions that critically effect the security of its own continent. Another task for the prime minister is to challenge the view, held by some in the Trump circle, that the US will profit from a deal with Putin because it will break the Russia-China alliance.I’m told that the prime minister will contend to the president that leaving Europe insecure will undermine the strategic position of the US because it will embolden aggressive moves by China and strengthen Beijing’s ties with Moscow, exactly the opposite of what Washington wants. Sir Keir will also make the case that Europe is now heeding Trump on taking more responsibility for its own security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Listening to Trump and his courtiers will be at least as important as speaking. Precisely what kind of deal do the Americans think they can land with the Kremlin? That would be worth knowing, even if the answer turns out to be a scary one. Forewarned is forearmed. The truth may very well be that members of the Trump regime haven’t settled upon or don’t agree among themselves about their desired endpoint.Diplomats reckon that there is one approach with the greatest potential to have traction on this occupant of the Oval Office. That is to appeal to his ego and self-interest with the warning that a dirty carve-up of Ukraine on the Kremlin’s terms will project Putin as the apex predator and leave the US president looking like a weak dupe. Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador to the US, suggests: “If I were Starmer, I would say to Trump that this is your chance for your place in history, the man who brought peace and ended this war. But it has to be a fair deal. If it’s a bad deal, you are not going to get that praise, you are going to get a load of criticism and that will be your record in the history books.”Vanity is one of the more reliable traits ofDonald Trump. Leaning into his narcissism may be undignified, but it may also be essential if Sir Keir is to come home from Washington with anything that he can call a success.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

When will wrinkles, bad teeth and big pores be back in fashion?Emma BeddingtonCelebrities are now injecting salmon sperm into their faces, while gen Z buys into ‘prejuvenation’. But I’m hopeful the tide may soon turnSun 23 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTShareTotally neutral question, no right or wrong answer: how do you feel about salmon sperm?It’s not a Nordic culinary microtrend or a sex thing, but a beauty treatment, in which “Polydeoxyribonucleotides (PDRN) derived from purified fragments of DNA extracted from yes, ‘salmon sperm’” areinjected into your face. It does seem to work:proper researchhas found PDRN has wound-repairing properties in hard-to-treat contexts such as diabetic ulcers and deep burns. Good news (unless you’re a male salmon). But what is it doing in healthy faces?I learned about salmon sperm in aSunday Times articleon the “skincare secrets” of “26 tastemakers”, which I read, increasingly aghast. It was a litany of lasers, microneedling, injectables and proprietary treatments with silly names that left me shouting crossly at my laptop: “But what does itdo?” The only treatment I related to at all was Marina Abramović recounting how a friend of her mother’s put hot mashed potato on her face to temporarily erase wrinkles; Abramović herself uses “thermage radiofrequency”. No wonder a salmon sperm practitionersays it’s “an exciting time in the aesthetic industry.”Some contributors were celebs, regularly running the unforgiving gauntlet of high-definition television, and the rest were at least very interested, if not professionally involved, in beauty, so they probably aren’t typical. And there’s a certain honesty to it, at least. No one is making out their dewy glow is “just good genes” and “loads of water”. But I also think this newfound willingness to talk about “tweakments” (a jaunty portmanteau that makes me queasy) is a product of them being absolutely everywhere.Because they are everywhere, for everyone. According to researchers at University College London, the UK injectables market will be worth£11.7bn by next year, with Botox and fillers available anywhere from Harley Street to high-street hairdressers. Writing in Grazia last week, the Guardian beauty columnist Sali Hughes described how “women in teaching, policing and the civil service” ask her advice on where to get “good injections”. In the US, Botox use by 20- to 29-year-olds hasincreased 28% since 2010, with gen Z buying into“prejuvenation”(another awful portmanteau), fuelled by the poreless perfection offered by filters, staring at themselves on pandemic screens andsocial media skinfluencers(argh).I shouldn’t be surprised –actual children are buying expensive anti-ageing potionsand fretting about their nonexistent crow’s feet now. But still, this dramatic normalisation of invasive beauty procedures is unnerving.For one thing, tweakments are so expensive! It’s none of my business how people spend their money – my disposable income is dedicated to becoming the Joe Exotic of decorative poultry – but will we end up with an attractiveness inequality gap? Or will the democratisation of HD face mean almost everyone will be smoothly immobile soon? I suspect there will always be better and worse tweakments: that UCL research also points out how alarmingly unregulated the industry is.It’s also uncomfortable feeling so out of step. My only foray into tweakment territory is getting my brows, lost to alopecia, tattooed back on (which demonstrates how central frowning is to my character, so Botox is out). It’s not that I’m smugly delighted with my 50-year-old face: the baleful crone in my new passport photo appears, inexplicably, to have a single black eye (actually just a dark circle), adding to the “pensioner arrested after brawl outside bookies” vibe. It would be nice to feel better about my neck, but not nice enough to actually do anything painful and expensive about it.I suppose we tweakment holdouts will have to wait, and hope, for the tide to turn. As Ozempic andshiny veneersmay make thinness and Hollywood teeth look boring and basic, perhaps perfect faces will fall from fashion? I mention the veneers, because when I was watching the Bridget Jones movie, I become fascinated by Chiwetel Ejiofor’s teeth. They’re absolutely lovely, yes, but sort of … normal? One lower one peeps out from slightly behind the others. It only added to his charm. Hugh Grant’s 64-year-old face looked charismatically crumpled too. Maybe when everyone has been homogenised to a glazed sheen of perfection, sagging, bumps, gaping pores and rough patches will be the height of desirability. At that point, I’ll be ready for my closeup.Emma Beddington is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsCosmetic surgeryOpinionBeautycommentShareReuse this content"

The coalition led by the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), born in hope, has fallen apart, thanks in no small measure to the continual attempts atsabotage by the Free Democratic party(FDP), its most junior member. That last successful effort resulted in the dissolution of the government.Yet the other two coalition parties are also culpable – the Greens, who failed to articulate a compelling enough vision for a future with clean energy, and the SPD itself, whose vote has tumbled by 10% and whose leader,Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, has mostly been as invisible as his predecessor,Angela Merkel, was imposing.Having lived and worked in Germany for 10 years, I have long understood Merkel’s tenure as an aberration in national politics. For all her flaws, she took a step of rare and historic bravery, welcoming a million Syrian immigrants as they fled a dictatorship that was bombing their schools and hospitals. Yet this move was one from which her own party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), now cannot distance itself quickly enough. It is striking that, when Bashar al-Assad was overthrown late last year, the first instinct of Germany’s newspapers and politicians was not to celebrate Merkel’s role in saving Syrian lives. Instead, it was to try to work out how quickly all thoseSyrians could now go home.The poll-leading CDU, meanwhile, has generally responded to the country’s greatest challenges with pettiness or spite. Kai Wegner, when elected mayor of a capital city staggering beneath the weight of overpriced housing, chose not to pick a fight with property developers but to fuel a pointless culture war, pledgingnever to use gender-neutral languagewhen in office.Even though the country is facinga severe shortage of migrant workers, the CDU’s leader, Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting, seems to take every available opportunity to alienate the same people he is trying to attract to his nation. Infamously, in September 2023, he remarked that an area of Berlin with a large migrant population“was not Germany”. This was, even for him, a low point.The rhetoric of the AfD has been shamefully and enthusiastically adopted by their supposedly more enlightened peersIf there is room for optimism, we can find it in Die Linke, which hassurged in the pollsthanks to a campaign that has focusedon citizens’ everyday difficulties. While the Greens and the CDU have mostly settled for positive yet vague slogans, and the far right has gone forthe tone of returning emperors, the far left Die Linke has taken the most trouble to actually ask people about their household bills and to suggest taxes on wealth. This novel conceptcould see them win enough votes to return to the Bundestag.But the campaign has been dominated bythe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose rhetoric has been shamefully and enthusiastically adopted by their supposedly more enlightened peers, and whose ascent has been accompanied byan explosion of violence. In late 2023, senior party members were caught plotting theviolent deportation of millions of people: not only migrants, refugees and asylum seekers but anyone they did not consider to be sufficiently German, including German citizens born in Germany.Fearing a public backlash, these politicians and their wealthy backers were so secretive that they communicated with each other only by letter. They need not have been so worried. Though their poll numbers dipped a little in the aftermath,they now stand at about 20%, as the second most popular party, withthose plans for mass violence against migrants– euphemistically dubbed “remigration” – at the centre of their campaign.Yet the far right’s xenophobia is not at the fringes of German society: it can be found in voices at its very centre. The loudest such voice is Merz. After two fatal attacks by migrants on their fellow citizens – the first by an “anti-Islam activist” who drove a car into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing five, and the second a knife attack by a former Afghan asylum seeker in Aschaffenburg, killing two – Merz seized his moment. Instead of calling for the enforcement of existing and entirely adequate migration policies, he did something that no German political party had done since the 1930s: he formed an alliance on a crucial vote with the far right, in order to push through a migration bill that was contrary to EU law. His efforts failed, butthe damage was done. Merz, meanwhile, has only escalated his rhetoric, making thebaseless claimthat every day in Germany asylum seekers are perpetrating gang rapes. With language like this, a coalition with the AfD is not as far away as pundits think or hope it is – just look at all the seeminglyeternal norms that have been undonein no time at all. The cracks are swiftly spreading throughout the German iceberg.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For allthe hundreds of thousandswho have admirably taken to German streets ordebating chambersto protest against the dangers of authoritarian rule, there are far too many who have remained silent, whether at their dinner tables, in their workplaces or their group chats.Recently I spoke to Jennifer Kamau, who works forInternational Women’s Space, a Berlin-based NGO that protects the rights of migrants and refugees. She sounded so worried that days later I was still pondering her words: in particular, the loathing of migrants and refugees she sees across the political spectrum, even in some traditionally progressive spaces.“We don’t even know who to work with,” Kamau said. “Everybody that I am with is feeling afraid. There is a certain energy that you feel when you enter a train, even in Berlin… You see the hostility.” If there is not a concerted effortto present a positive vision of immigration, she fears the very worst. “The atmosphere is so pregnant with arrogance and hate,” she said. “This hate is too big.

Part of her care, and our joy as owners, was the monthly application of spot-on worm and flea treatment. With veterinary medicine on my mind as a career, I relished the theatre of vets-at-home. We bought doses over the counter, scheduling the dog’s treatment on the calendar like a five-a-side.We applied these drugs to our dog because every other owner did. Because it was encouraged, because it was easy, because it felt right.New research confirms the use of such veterinary drugs as an unmanned checkpoint in the landscape of environmental contamination. Put simply, caring for our dog was polluting the natural world. Astudy from the University of Sussexreveals songbirds as the latest victims. Blue tits and great tits are two of many birds that line their nests with animal fur. Every sampled nest contained fipronil and 89% contained imidacloprid and permethrin – three insecticides so potent they have been banned for agricultural use in the UK and EU, but can be bought by anyone for use on pets.In the study, nest mortality correlated with drug concentration. Eggs never hatched; chicks expired after hatching – at a time whenalmost half of all UK bird species are in a state of serious decline. “The simplest explanation is that eggs and chicks are getting a sufficient dose of pesticide from the nest lining to kill. There’s enough medication in the environment to pollute every single blue and great tit nest,” says Prof Dave Goulson, a co-author of the study.Bird nest pollution mirrors the state of our rivers. Studies by Dr Rosemary Perkins found fipronil persists in99% of samples taken from 20 English rivers, with imidacloprid found in 66% of samples. My dog was one of the approximately 17.5 million cats and dogs in the UK – about80% of the total of 22 million– that get regular over-the-counter worm and flea treatment, whether suffering from an infestation or not. One flea treatment of a medium-sized dog contains enough pesticide to kill 60 million bees. Will it take the silence of vanishing biodiversity for us to hear nature’s cry?Goulson is one of many scientists warning of collateral damage from veterinary drugs, but a regulatory blind spot has kept the environmental repercussions largely hidden – hushed like an interruption. Pet medications aren’t subject to the same risk assessments as they are for use on livestock. When flea treatments entered the market in the 1990s, their environmental impact was assumed trivial.I sense the veterinary profession has been caught off-guard by this ethical battle of balancing pet health with environmental responsibility. “It’s a real dilemma,” says Dr Sean McCormack, a small animal vet and conservationist. “As a vet, you’ve taken an oath to ‘protect and enhance animal welfare’. But you’re contaminating nature – how did we miss this?”Pets aren’t the only source. A recent study shows that handwashing by owners in the weeks after spot-on treatmentis also a major contributor. And McCormack describes the down-the-drain pathway of fipronil administered in “insane quantities” across equestrian facilities to protect hooves and fetlocks against feather mites. Horses return to muddy fields, and fipronil leaches into water and soil, fast and unseen. Vets find themselves in a tough position. They are constrained by the absence of viable alternatives, the expectations of millions of pet owners trying to do the right thing, and the biological phenomenon of the flea.Flea infestations can be fatal, and effective flea treatments must eliminate more than 90% of fleas in the environment. Otherwise, their staggering reproductive rate –a flea can lay 50 eggs a day– makes control nigh impossible. Fleas spend most of their life cycle away from their host, making eradication even more challenging.As for alternatives, flea collars and oral tablets generally contain many of the same harmful chemicals as spot-on treatments. Alternative chemical treatments are either potent toxins or essential oils with no proven efficacy.There is a serious economic argument to lessen animal medication overall.“We could probably remove 80-90% of any of these chemicals with immediate effect,” says Goulson, who also rightly challenges ourbewildering, increasing obsessionwith pets.Reducing pet medication could structure a case-by-case approach. “Most practices are improving – tailoring application schedules to suit the individual pet and owner’s lifestyle,” says McCormack. If the dog is allergic to fleas, they should be prescribed monthly treatment. But treatment shouldn’t be preventive. You wouldn’t treat an empty scalp for head lice, and the same goes for fleas: if there is no infestation, keep a lid on it.We should also welcome recommendations to bond with our pets through husbandry, attentiveness on walks and home hygiene. Regular grooming can detect parasites early, allowing for reactive treatment. Washing pet bedding in hot water every few weeks and vacuuming sleeping areas help eliminate flea eggs and larvae that live there.And if your pet does require treatment? “Please don’t let them enter watercoursesat all,” McCormack implores, citing further work from Goulson’s lab that observed lethal doses of medication washing off dogs28 days after application. How does that measure up to brand advice on the back of the packet? Most recommend a mere “48 to 72 hours” of water abstinence after treatment. Pharmaceutical companies place poison in the palm of our hands.Vets urged to cut back on flea treatments amid UK biodiversity fearsRead moreVeterinary surgeon Dr Claire Whittle works with farmers to treat livestock strategically, and argues that spring is the perfect time to broach the conversation about using less medication with your vet. And countryside management like rotational grazing and taller grassescan be as effectiveat reducing parasite exposure as some pesticides. Native species such as sainfoin and chicory not only pose a structural challenge for parasites, but they contain natural insecticides. “Diversifying plants could be better for animal health as well as wildlife health. Medication should not be the first line of defence,” says Whittle.Looking ahead,parasites are evolving with worsening climate breakdown, spreading new disease risks. But on the brighter side, some countries are improving regulation. Ireland is making flea and worm treatmentsprescription only, offering a valuable case study for future policy changes in the UK. Could this spur urgent cooperation between industry regulators, theVeterinary Medicines Directorate, pharmaceutical companies and the pet-owning public?Protecting our pets should never come at the cost of protecting nature. And I worry this uniquely human business of eliminating parasites, mixed with private sector procrastination to find and fund regulated, alternative veterinary medication, risks us morphing into the most hedonistic parasite of all. But parasites have little to gain from killing their host. They must keep them alive, in symbiosis. There is power for change, in our poisonous hands.Sophie Pavelle is a writer and science communicatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Because now the foolish wokerati have been schooled beyond Johnson’s wettest dreams. It’s theTrump-Putin-bin Salman party!Anadjudicated sex offenderandconvicted fraudster, and a man whosanctioned a chemical warfare hit, killing aBritish citizen on British soil, have met at the luxury Saudia Arabian hotel of another man, who,according to the US, reportedly approved the murderand subsequent dismemberment of a journalist, to discuss the similarly brutal dismemberment of Ukraine, without consulting either Ukraine itself or the countries most directly affected by the legitimisation of Putin’s territorial anxieties. Don’t worry, Poland! Stable genius Trump has got this covered, so break out the bone saws, pop the cork on the novichok andgrab the girls by the pussy! There are 1970s Italian slasher films with less gruesome plotlines. Well said, Boris Johnson! That’s certainly stuck it to the wokerati!If only Johnson, and Trump’s other cheerleaders in the rightwing press and on the right of the house, could be brave enough to call out Trump for what he is. If only Johnson had the moral courage ofEd Davey from the Liberal Democrats.In what newly warped reality does that sentence even exist? But, on balance, the whitewashing of the deaths of tens of thousands of Ukrainians is a small price to pay for the delight Trump has bought to the smiling faces of people who hate the transgender community, wild swimming enthusiasts andGuardianreaders. Sniffingmineral rightsin the air, like the smell of napalm in the morning, Trump has grabbed Ukraine by the pussy and he ain’t gonna let go. Trump is, unequivocally, the worst thing to happen to human civilisation since Hitler. And Ricky Gervais’sAfter Life.European politicians more rational and less self-serving than Johnson are trying to formulate the correct response to Trump’s rapid and reckless redrawing of the postwar world disorder in his own, and Russia’s, interests. The correct response is to shit your pants. On Tuesday, Trump evenblamed Ukraine itselffor being invaded, which is a bit like blaming E Jean Carroll herself for beingsexually abused in a department store changing room. Couldn’t she have cut a pre-emptive deal before things escalated? Victims! Always blaming someone else. But Trump has put the idea that the invasion of Ukraine is Ukraine’s fault out there now, on the world stage, amplified by his collaborators in the tech bro media, and it will gradually calcify into one of those persistentalternative facts. By Wednesday he’d called Zelenskyy a dictator (and a mediocre comedian, which in my opinion is even worse).Think what Hitler could have achieved if he’d had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposalAnd it’s that kind of reshaping of reality that needs a coherent European response. Recently, the US vice-president, JD Vance, who has the exact same face-beard as the main male oppressor in the TV adaptation ofThe Handmaid’s Tale, came and told the Munich security conference that Scotland hadmade it illegal to pray silently in your own home. Many things are illegal in Scotland. Fruit, for example, and cushions, which are deemed too soft by the Scottish Cushion Committee. But not silent private prayer. Largely ignoring dead-in-the-water Ukraine, Vance also told Europe we had some kind ofmoral duty to allow unchecked, factually inaccurate bullshitto clog our infosphere via Trump’s tech bro acolytes’ social media platforms, his inflammatory comments about illegal Scottish prayer in the same speech proving exactly why such regulation is required. And I think he knows this.Predictably, Vancewas one of the three main early investors in Rumble, the social media site for all the people whose conspiratorial untruths and borderline criminality make them too toxic for other social media sites – Russell Brand, Alex Jones and Darth Vader etc – so he personally stood to profit from this sort of popularisation of inflammatory actionable crap. As did fellow Rumble original main investor Peter Thiel, the man behind Palantir, the big tech company Wriggling Wes Streeting is keen tohand all our NHS data to, revealing an interlocking and endless web of bad influence that only “cat woman” Carole Cadwalladr had thepersistence of vision to apprehend, and she’s currently shunting off to a subscriptionSubstack site, a crowdfunded Cassandra in an era busy eating its own brainstem.For a brief period around teatime on Monday,Keir Starmer, who once left his “village and went to the city of Leeds” and “discovered a whole new world of indie bands – like Orange Juice and the Wedding Present” delusionally imagined he could be some kind of go-between twixt observable reality and Trump. But did West Yorkshire jangle-pop pioneers the Wedding Present radically retool their signature sound for 1991’sSeamonstersalbum just so Starmer could become a Neville Chamberlain for the cover-mounted fanzine flexidisc generation?We have staved off outright fascism throughout most ofEuropepretty well for 80 years now, but outright fascism in Europe was never quite so well funded and promoted as it is now, since the US government and the social media platforms that do its bidding decided backing outright fascism was a good way to smash the EU. Think what Hitler could have achieved if he’d had Twitter, currently X, and Google at his disposal. He wouldn’t have needed the V2 rocket, Lord Haw-Haw and Hugo Boss. He could have razed half of Europe with a Hulk Hogan meme, some persuasive online misinformation and a dozen jauntily askew baseball caps.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfthis year, with a Royal Festival Hall run in July.

Lisa Nandy must pick up the batonSun 23 Feb 2025 13.30 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 14.12 ESTShareThe date is not in many history books. But it should be. It is 60 years on Tuesday since Britain’s first minister for the arts,Jennie Lee, published the first UK government white paper on the arts. Thewhite paper, which crammed more into 18 pages than many government documents do at 10 times that length, was a landmark, an attempt to set out “a more coherent, generous and imaginative approach” to the arts policy this country lacked.The current culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has yet to publish such a white paper herself. She ought to do so. Nevertheless, last week she did the next best thing, travelling to Stratford-upon-Avon, the most iconic location on these islands in which to reflect on arts policy, to deliver an anniversary lecture inBuzz Goodbody’sexperimental Other Place theatre.Today, as in February 1965, government money is tight. But Ms Nandy’slecturewas similarly strong‑minded. “Today’s artists need more financial help,” Ms Lee stated, promising that “notwithstanding the difficulties of the present situation, the government propose to increase substantially their grant to the Arts Council”. There was an echo of that in Ms Nandy’s announcement of a £270mfunding packageto prevent further decay in Britain’s “crumbling cultural infrastructure”.There were deeper parallels too. Both Ms Lee and Ms Nandy see the school system as the unmatchable arena to nurture passion for the arts and to widen social access. “The place that the arts occupy in the life of the nation is largely a reflection of the time and effort devoted to them in schools and colleges,” wrote Ms Lee in 1965. “Culture and creativity has been erased from our classrooms,” complained Ms Nandy, adding: “This is madness.”Like Ms Lee, Ms Nandy advocates a wide national approach to an arts ecology that is too routinely London-centred. In some parts of Britain, said the 1965 white paper, “professional companies are nonexistent”, adding: “All this must change.” That same anxiety shone through Ms Nandy’s call for “reviving culture in places where it is disappearing”. The key is to level up, not level down.Though daunting, these are nevertheless two of the relatively straightforward challenges facing UK arts policy. In the digital and multicultural age, however, it will not be enough to invoke the iconic figure of Ms Lee and insist that if only today’sLabourgovernment can reconnect with her example, admirable as it was, then all will be well.The arts ecology that she inherited was shaped by the wartime popularisation work ofJohn Maynard Keynes, which led to the Arts Council in 1944. Keynes wanted the arts to become “a living element in everyone’s upbringing”. In the postwar years, the Arts Council retreated from this approach, leaving Ms Lee’s white paper to try to reverse the drift.Today, we must do thesame again. Yet we live in changed times. Britain is more divided and disrespectful. Digital media have revolutionised the arts. Confidence in an inherited national culture, strong in Keynes’s day, has declined. Yet in 2025 the arts are a far larger part of the economy and of British life than in 1965. Too many past arguments destructively pitted excellence against access, when both must be cherished equally. Ms Lee always stood for excellence and access alike. Ms Nandy’s lecture suggests she knows that, in the upcomingspending review, she will be fighting the same battle. She needs to win it.Explore more on these topicsLisa NandyOpinionLabourArts policyArts fundingArts Council EnglandeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Violence had exploded and conditions had deteriorated following President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in 2021. Then, last February,gangs banded togetherto free thousands of prisoners, besiege airports and police stations, and demand that Haiti’s unpopular replacement leader departed.Ariel Henry was ousted, but the nation has only spiralled further into crisis. Violence intensified again towards the end of last year. Armed criminals control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Already desperate circumstances have become much more so: more than a million people – around one in 10 of the population –have now been displaced, triple the level a year ago. Half are experiencing acute food insecurity.At least 5,600 people were killed in gang violence last year. The United Nations says that sexual violence against childrenhas risen tenfold; many are beingforcibly recruitedinto organised crime. The kidnap and murder of health workers has put around two-thirds of medical facilities out of use. Even commercial flights have largely halted after gangsopened fire on planes.Amid all this, the United States announced on Thursday that it is scrapping temporaryprotection from deportationfor half a million Haitians in the US, meaning that they could be removed by August. That’shardly a surprisegiven the vile lies about Haitian migrants spread by President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in last year’s election. And some deportations continued even under the Biden administration. But the announcement is no less appalling for that – and all the more so given the role of the US in the nation’s troubles over the years. A country born in such hope, in the uprising of enslaved people, has never shaken off the impact of thedevastating reparationsFrance imposed for its freedom and the years of foreign occupation and meddling that followed.Last spring was supposed to mark a turning point for the country, with the arrival of a UN-backed and largely Kenyan-staffed security support mission, and the move to a transitional government supposed to pave the way for elections next year – more than a decade after the last polls. But the council, which contains just one token representative of civil society, has been beset by self-interested struggles, and three of its nine members face corruption charges but refuse to resign. The security mission has less than half the personnel initially envisaged, has failed to make an impact, and now Mr Trump has frozen US funding for it.A newreportby the International Crisis Group warns that elections cannot be held safely under current circumstances, and that pressing ahead with them might fuel further violence by gangs attempting to push their cronies into power. It argues that the priority for the transitional council must be focusing on basic governance.Meanwhile, every possible legal avenue to extend protection from deportation for Haitians in the US must be employed. The US must do more to cut off the flow of arms in breach of the embargo. Humanitarian support for the nation, always inadequate and now hit by Trump administration cuts, must be properly backed. The UN’s 2024 appeal was less than half funded, leaving millions of people unsupported. With the need now far greater, it is askingfor $900m. That is the least that is owed to Haitians.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yet still we tell them they’re not wanted, 16 February).Less well known is that thousands of health and care workers who arrived before this date have also been prevented from bringing their children – most of them single mothers. Areportpublished on 22 January by Action for Southern Africa and Women of Zimbabwe revealed that thousands of single mothers, from Zimbabwe and elsewhere, settled into their jobs only to then be denied visas for their children, who were waiting back home to join them.These mothers – looking after our loved ones every day – have been separated from their children for years now, making multiple costly visa applications (some exploited by unscrupulous legal advisers in the process), because of Home Office refusals based on their concept of “sole responsibility”. This is a concept created by the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) which is incredibly hard for single mothers to prove, as it extends further than the internationally recognised notion of “sole custody”.Ourreportreveals lack of clarity about what documents the UKVI will accept as proof, inconsistent application of its own guidelines, and evidence of so-called hostile environment tactics to cause delays in decision-making.The impact is devastating on everyone. One mother from Zimbabwe was separated from her two girls for almost two years. It took six applications before she was granted the visas (three for each child). Eight similar cases are documented in our report, but thousands of children remain in limbo. Why is it deemed acceptable for children from southern Africa to be kept apart from their mothers for extended periods of time? Echoes of Windrush abound.Tricia SibbonsDirector, Action For Southern AfricaPatricia ChinyokaFounder, Women of ZimbabweI wholeheartedly agree with John Harris and the “bitter absurdity” of the situation both in theNHSand the care sector. Last summer, my 90-year-old mother collapsed and was taken to A&E in Worthing. The department was massively busy, patients were being cared for in the corridor and ambulances were arriving with alarming regularity. The bay my mother was in was staffed by two nurses from overseas, who cared for all their patients with exemplary professionalism and kindness.I was, however, horrified to hear overtly racist comments being made by patients, with one declaiming loudly: “Look what has happened to our NHS.” Bitter absurdity indeed. I left the department feeling immensely grateful to the staff and incredibly angry and embarrassed by what I had witnessed.Sally SmithWorthing, West SussexJohn Harris’s article is timely, but immigrants and their offspring are not only the backbone of the NHS. My Guardian is delivered by an Indian, and my teeth are maintained by an Indian. Our postman of 20 years is Chinese; our local station is opened and closed at ungodly hours by a Nigerian woman; our supermarket tills are almost exclusively staffed by south Asians; our cat is regularly jabbed by people from Spain, Poland and India; and the drivers on our local bus route have recently included people from Ghana, Nepal, Somalia and Albania.In addition to all these good people, when I fell downstairs and broke my fibula five years ago, it was excellently repaired by a Turkish Cypriot. This demonising of migrants has to be exposed for the evil that it is. Remember that the Hallelujah Chorus was written by an economic migrant.Warwick HillmanPinner, LondonDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

They miss a round of domestic fixtures as a result and Borthwick uses the time to oversee a warm‑weather training camp in Girona. The extra week’s access to players was also a key part of the previous arrangement between the RFU and the Premiership.The PGP, signed last summer, is said to account for Borthwick to have four weeks’ access this autumn based on the arrangement that England would play three Tests, however. In effect the extra match against Australia – scheduled for 1 November, before subsequent Tests against Fiji, New Zealand and Australia – is set to replace the training camp in Girona.View image in fullscreenFin Smith during an England training session in Girona before the 2024 Six Nations.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesIt will be a bitter pill for Borthwick to swallow because he considers the extra training week crucial as he tries to build cohesion within his squad. He and his players have talked regularly of the difficulty in coming together from 10 Premiership clubs to gel before a campaign and now Borthwick will have one less week to get everyone on the same page. Players will be available for their clubs the weekend before the Australia Test so Borthwick will have to contend with potentially injury problems, too.According to the Times newspaper, he is deeply frustrated by the situation.Last autumn, England lost the first three of their four Tests – going down against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa – before beating Japan. They began the series sluggishly and Borthwick said after the South Africa defeat that his players did not begin the series in good enough condition compared with their south hemisphere counterparts. Getting them up to speed this year will now be an altogether more difficult task.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Back at the team hotel they were replaying thedefeat against Australiathe previous night on a jumbo‑sized screen, with the gentle flute muzak in the lobby barely softening the sight of Josh Inglis going gangbusters.Plenty went back to their own struggle to tee off with the bat. At the 30-over mark, England were 200 with just two down, only to finish 351 for eight. It was their highest score at a global event, the highest by any side at a Champions Trophy. But it was still only par and swiftly bumped down to No 2 as regards the second of those two records.Alex Carey’s acrobatics lay foundation for Josh Inglis’ fireworks | James WallaceRead moreWell in excess was a must given the evening conditions that followed andJos Buttler, among those to let things slip when holing out on 23, tried to mask his disappointment yet again. Australia were ruthless, while England did hint at improvement before things unspooled. But even with the semi-finals not yet out of reach, there are growing shades of Joe Root’s final days as Test captain here.The more authentic post-match reaction came from Ben Duckett. In contrast to the Gordon Brown smile that Buttler has tried through this run of winter defeats, a glum Duckett admitted he was “pretty flat”. And not without good reason. After leaving India with a groin injury and questions swirling about his ability to kick on after starts, the opener’s wonderfully stitched 165 had set a platform for colleagues to exploit.It’s here where, along with Buttler and Harry Brook, Liam Livingstone enters the conversation. The last recognised batter, strolling out at 280 for five with nine overs to go, Livingstone muscled one typically brawny six to the short square boundary before taking on the longer one to perish for 14 off 17 balls. Had Jofra Archer not raided 21 at the death, a pretty convincing defeat would have become a shellacking.In contrast to the late dew that fell at the back end of the chase, Livingstone said on Sunday that two softening balls and a slowing pitch were the problem. And in fairness, No 7 is a tough, specialist role; sometimes tasked with putting out a fire, other times needing to squeeze the trigger from the get-go. But just shy of 100 white-ball caps – 37 one-day internationals, 60 Twenty20s – and a senior in the squad aged 31, these are also the moments across five InternationalCricketCouncil tournaments he is still truly to seize.Indeed, despite some bilateral success these past 12 months, Livingstone averages 15.4 with the bat when there is a global trophy at stake, with a best of 33. That 33 is also the closest he has come to nailing the role on the big stage, only to be caught hitting into the wind needing 25 from 17 balls to beat South Africa in the T20 World Cup last year. Had he got England over the line, the far trickier semi‑final against India, on a turner in Guyana, would have been swerved.For all this, Livingstone is one of the first names in the XI, those leggies and off-breaks – a creditable one for 47 from seven overs on Saturday night – making him England’s next best spin option after Adil Rashid. They have slightly painted themselves into a corner with the squad overall, as the reserves are Tom Banton, a top‑order bat, and three quicks in Saqib Mahmood, Gus Atkinson and Jamie Overton.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There is no left-armer, a shortage of variation among the right-armers, and no frontline spinner should they somehow kick on and play the Dubai semi-final.“Like anything, it can take a little bit of time,” Livingstone said, when asked about Brendon McCullum’s impact since becoming white-ball head coach this year. “But we don’t really have time on our side in this tournament, for sure. Hopefully that turnaround comes in the next game and we can ride away from there.”England stay put for now, Afghanistan next up in Lahore on Wednesday – another day‑nighter in which again conditions could lurch – before switching to Karachi to play South Africa three days later. They may yet ride away to make Buttler’s smile less forced. But as per their past two global events, they continue to do it the hard way.Explore more on these topicsICC Champions TrophyJos ButtlerEngland cricket teamAustralia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There are no marks for artistic merit, no specific rewards (beyond a try bonus point) for throwing the ball around in the name of entertainment. Occasionally, though, there are days when the losers’ enterprise and energy leaves the deepest impression.None more so, at long last, than Wales. After barely four training sessions under theirinterim head coach, Matt Sherratt, they looked a team who have not so much had an extreme makeover as assumed a whole fresh identity. Last time out they were gloomily trudging through Italian treacle; suddenly they were running and passing with elan and briefly threatening to cause the mother of all tournament upsets.Prendergast kicks Ireland to triple crown success against spirited WalesRead moreScotland? Their fizzing backline frequently made England look horribly pedestrian and not a single home fan could have cried foul had Finn Russell landed his fateful final conversion. The visitors outscored their opponents three tries to one and might have had at least a couple more with a touch more composure inside the English 22.All of which raises a few interesting questions. Might it be the weekend, for example, that prompts the game’s guardians to reconsider rugby’s traditional scoring system? No one is suggesting radical change and seven points for a converted try still feels broadly fine. But what if, in future, tries were worth six points rather than five and a conversion just one instead of two? Scotland, with that subtle tweak applied, would have edged the game 18-16 on Saturday and their pace and ambition would have been more tangibly rewarded.Clearly it would not have altered the outcome in Cardiff but it might just help to incentivise more sides to play a brand of rugby which captures a few more imaginations. As a free‑wheeling France underlined in Rome, it is not compulsory to play with pace, purpose and panache but it sure helps to attract sofa‑bound neutrals.Then again, in the words of one particularly erudite ex-pro, rugby union is for ever destined to be perfectly imperfect. The side scoring the most tries has also never been guaranteed to win theSix Nations. It has happened in only two of the past six championship seasons and, overall since 2000, the rate of top try scorers topping the table stands at a modest 56%.View image in fullscreenWales’s Will Rowlands takes on Ireland’s Peter O’Mahony. Wales gave their opponents a big scare but Ireland found a way to win.Photograph: Ian Cook/CameraSport/Getty ImagesRather more relevant is a selection of less immediately obvious stats, with tries conceded historically high on the list. Take 2015, when Joe Schmidt’s Ireland retained their title having scored only eight tries and conceded three in five games. In a total of 160 minutes of rugby at home to France and England they scored one solitary try and not a single Irish supporter cared in the slightest.Kicking from hand is another pivotal metric. To hear the boos ringing around Allianz Stadium (née Twickenham) as England kicked the pimples off the ball in perfect, dry conditions was to sense again the widening disconnect between old-school conservative coaching priorities and the modern-day consumer. Box kicks are emphatically not box office.But good, smart kicking unquestionably has its place. Both Wales and Scotland carried for hundreds of metres more than their opponents and beat many more individual opponents. Kicking-wise, though, the Irish booted the ball a remarkable 1,108 metres compared with Wales’s 637. The comparable figures in London were 861 metres for England and 762 for Scotland. Getting rid of the ball remains as crucial to the outcome as weaving intricate attacking patterns.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No wonder Gregor Townsendwas frustrated by some of the officiating callsagainst his side given England’s general lack of attacking penetration while his counterpart Steve Borthwick highlighted the increasing importance of the penalty count. “We have won the penalty count in two of the three games in the Six Nations and in three of the four games in the autumn series.“In a game like that [keeping your discipline] is essential. When the ball is in the middle of the field and both teams are trying to find an avenue to open up and get access into the opposition 22 you need to minimise that by discipline.”Which is among the reasons why, despite the ugliness of their weekend win, England are still clinging to Ireland’s tails in the title race. The unbeaten Irish remain front runners, still to play France in Dublin and Italy away. Were they to lose againstLes Bleusand Scotland were subsequently to triumph in Paris, however, it is not inconceivable England could sneak an improbable title with bonus‑point victories over Italy and Wales next month.Because while that might seem a remote prospect – England have conceded 10 tries in three games, the same as Wales – rugby is not just about vapour trails and flying dives into the corner. Under pressure it can also be about playing the percentages, staying cool, scrambling in defence and, as the unfortunate Russell will testify, kicking your goals. As well as avoiding cards and keeping on the right side of the officials. England, pretty or not, are still winning some key little battles.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025Six NationsRugby unionEngland rugby union teamScotland rugby union teamWales rugby union teamIreland rugby union teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Belgian has been under extreme pressure since thehumiliating Scottish Cup exitat the hands of the Scottish Championship side Queen’s Park a fortnight ago, and a first Ibrox lossto St Mirrensince 1991 on Saturday proved to be the final straw for the board.Clement departs Rangers – 13 points adrift of their city rivals Celtic at the top of theScottish Premiership– at a time when the club are in talks about a multimillion-pound investment by a United States-led consortium which includes Paraag Marathe, president of 49ers Enterprises and chairman of Leeds United.Genius-level Salah enters his imperial phase to guide Liverpool to win at City | Barney RonayRead moreA statement fromRangerson Sunday evening read: “Rangers Football Club can confirm it has tonight parted company with men’s first-team manager, Philippe Clement.“The club would like to put on record their sincere thanks to Philippe for his hard work and dedication during his spell in charge. A further update from the club will ­follow in due course.”Clement succeeded Michael Beale in October 2023 and led Rangers to the League Cup two months after his appointment. The former Club Brugge and Monaco manager briefly hauled them into title contention last season, but they eventually finished eight points adrift of Celtic. He was never able to recapture the promising form of his early months in the job.Although he led the club tothe last 16 of the Europa League, where they will face Fenerbahce next month, the 50-year-old vacates his position at Ibrox with Rangers well adrift of Celtic at the top of the league and set to end the season without a domestic trophy.Rangers have struggled badly on their travels this season, winning only five of their 13 away matches in the Premiership, but their relatively strong home form at least kept them clear of the pack in second place.Patrick Stewart, their recently appointed chief executive, had twice given his backing to the increasingly beleaguered manager.However, their last two Ibrox results in effect signalled the end for the 50-year-old, who described ­Saturday’s display in the 2-0 defeat by St Mirren as “by far the worst I’ve seen in all the time I’ve been here”.PA MediaExplore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Shortly afterwards the Newcastle manager said that, even though his team had won 4-3, he felt as if they had lost one of the most extraordinary Premier League games of the season.Torn between exasperation and relief, Howe did not initially know quite how to react as his side clung on to beat Nuno Espírito Santo’s side in a match the home team had led 4-1 at one stage. It left Newcastle fifth and only three points behind Forest in third after a chaotic afternoon that could exert a significant bearing on Champions League qualification at the end of the season.Newcastle hold off Nottingham Forest as Isak double edges seven-goal thrillerRead more“I am still trying to control my thoughts and stay positive,” Howe said. “It was a crazy game. You’ve seen the best of us and the worst of us. It feels like we lost the game, even though we won it.”At the end Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chair, making a rare visit from Riyadh, stepped on to the pitch and embraced Howe. “It was good to see the chairman but he might have heard a couple of swear words from me,” the manager said. “I think he was in the same sort of emotional state, though.”Newcastle’s Saudi Arabianowners will decide this weekwhether they want the club to remain at a rebuilt St James’ Park or seek planning permission for a new build in nearby Leazes Park and Al-Rumayyan will lead discussions with UK-based directors amid the seclusion of the Northumberland countryside.Any new ground will struggle to host games as dramatic as this. “At our best we were free-flowing and dynamic but we weren’t perfect,” Howe said. “We couldn’t get a grip when we lost momentum in the second half. It was a great first-half performance but we didn’t manage the game well and we showed frailties at set plays.”View image in fullscreenNikola Milenkovic scores Nottingham Forest’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesAt leastHowe had Alexander Isak on his side. The manager duly praised his Sweden striker for scoring his 49th and 50th Premier League goals in 76 appearances for the club. “It’s a huge achievement, when Alex plays like he did in the first half, he’s massive for us,” he said.Howe also had warm words for his 18-year-old midfielder Lewis Miley, who shone throughout and scored Newcastle’s first goal. “A really good performance from Lewis Miley,” he said. “I’m very pleased with his development.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the first half every time Newcastle had the ball they looked like scoring. But I wish there had been another 10 minutes at the end of the second half.

A ruthless 11-try demolition of a handy Italy side on their own patch served as a reminder that, on their day, there are few better outfits in rugby than a French team in full flow.Fabien Galthié, the head coach, made some bold selection decisions, dropping his ace wing Damian Penaud and fly-half Matthieu Jalibert from the match-day 23. A seven-one bench split was a sign of the plan and France’s power game duly delivered. They stomped over the gainline with just about every carry, unloaded six heavies off the bench in one go on 48 minutes and pulverised the Italians, who sparkled on rare occasions but were totally outgunned.Freeman believes in England’s Six Nations title hopes despite fans’ boosRead moreFrance’s eye-watering 73-point haul is the second-highest inSix Nationshistory and with this win they leapfrogged England into second in the table. If they beat Ireland in Dublin they could yet be champions.There were early warning signs as the magnificent Louis Bielle-Biarrey had a try chalked off on 10 minutes after Thomas Ramos, shifting from full-back to fly-half, sprayed a forward pass in the buildup. Soon after, Tommaso Menoncello burst through a gap in midfield on the angle to hand Italy the lead. It was little more than a false dawn.Mickaël Guillard then carried three Italian defenders on his back to score his first Test try. After a Tommaso Allan penalty, Peato Mauvaka rumbled over off the back of a lineout maul. Antoine Dupont then rounded off a slick move sparked by Léo Barré’s lightning feet and hands. Dupont was officially recognised as the player of the match, but it was the French full-back who was instrumental in so much that worked in the backline.Juan Ignacio Brex kept the try tally ticking and Italy within touching distance. Once again the French midfield of Yoram Moefana and Pierre‑Louis Barassi was pulled apart like a freshly baked croissant. If there’s one area of concern for France it is their weakness against first‑phase strike‑plays from set pieces. Ireland will no doubt target them there.View image in fullscreenLéo Barré was at the heart of much of France’s best play.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesNot that defensive frailties matter when you have monstrous ball‑carriers. With Dupont zipping it around from the front foot, he simply had to find willing runners off his shoulder. Before half-time Paul Boudehent and Barré scored to notch up the bonus point as France went into the break 35-17 to the good.Five minutes after the restart, Grégory Alldritt crashed over. The lineout served as the platform but, rather than maul, the ball pinged off the top for the No 8 to barrel down the inside 10 channel.France’s ability to combine power with panache was in full bloom. Then cameLe Bombe Equipe.French rugby has not shaken off fully the disappointment of their 2023 World Cup quarter-final defeat by South Africa but Galthié is not too proud to pull a page from the Springboks’ playbook. A new front row, and fresh legs in three other positions in the pack, fuelled the onslaught to come.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Before the hour, Bielle-Biarrey scored his sixth try in as many Tests and Dupont bagged his second of the match, collecting an inside pass from Ramos before fending off Allan with a stiff hand. The Garbisi brothers combined when the scrum-half Allesandro straightened the line and fed the fly-half Paolo off the back of a solid scrum, but the Mexican waves in the stands were proof that the home crowd had given up hope of a revival.In the closing minutes Dupont moved to fly-half as Maxime Lucu entered the scene. It might have been a coincidence, but France looked less cohesive from then, perhaps handing Galthié enough evidence that his best player is not necessarily an option at No 10. Not that it mattered. France’s domination of the gainline created space in the trams for Théo Attissogbé and Barassi to score before the close. France are back with a bang and remain in the hunt for the title.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2025Italy rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

One of the projects involved training mothers and children in Bamiyan, one of the largest cities in central Afghanistan.There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school, but this project had apparently been approved by the Bamiyan local authority.The couple were arrested alongside an American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them, and a translator from the couple’s Rebuild training business.An anonymous Rebuild employee told the PA news agency the group was informed that their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”.For the first three days after their arrest, the couple kept in touch with their children via text message, explaining they were being held by the interior ministry and stating they were fine.Then the texts stopped. Their children have not been in contact with them since.The Reynolds’s home in Nayak has since been raided and their employees have been interrogated about whether the couple were engaging in religious proselytising, which all of them denied.“This is really bad,” their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, from Daventry, Northamptonshire, told the Sunday Times. “My mother is 75 and my father almost 80 and [he] needs his heart medication after a mini-stroke.“They were just trying to help the country they loved. The idea they are being held because they were teaching mothers with children is outrageous.”With her three brothers, she has written an open letter to the Taliban leadership, begging for her parents’ release.The couple met at the University of Bath and married in Kabul in 1970 after falling in love withAfghanistan. Barbie went on to become the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban.In the letter, Entwistle and her brothers pleaded with the Taliban to set their parents free so that they can continue their good work in schools and pointed out they have been given dual citizenship.“We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest,” they wrote. “Our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded.”The anonymous employee, who said Rebuild workers were “in danger” and living in hiding, described the couple as “the most honourable people I have ever met in my life”.They told PA they feared for Peter’s condition. “It seems that if Peter and Barbie are not released soon, Peter may lose his life because he needs medication, and the Taliban are not allowing him it,” they added.As well as their project in Bamiyan, the couple had been running projects in five schools in Kabul. “The Taliban leaders were so impressed and inspired by the programmes Mum and Dad were offering, they said they would like them set up in every province of Afghanistan,” Entwistle said, adding that her parents had done nothing without permission.“They were meticulous about keeping by the rules even as they kept changing,” she said.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTalibanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

He doesn’t like [the French president, Emmanuel] Macron partly because Macron talks too much and tries to lecture him.”Starmer will also be advised to flatter Trump when he can, to say that everyone is so grateful that he has focused the world’s attention on the need for peace between Russia andUkraine. But to flatter subtly. And not to lay it on too thick.View image in fullscreenFormer British prime minister Theresa May is said to have rushed to flatter Donald Trump during her first trip to the White House in 2017.Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PAOne – unconfirmed – story from Theresa May’s first visit to seeTrump at the White House in 2017is doing the rounds in Whitehall again before the Starmer trip, and is being used as a cautionary tale for the current prime minister.“When May first went to see Trump, she was told she had to congratulate him on lots of things,” said one source.“So she rushed over to him and congratulated him on his new cabinet appointments, saying: ‘You’ve appointed a great team, Donald.’“At which point he said: ‘Oh thank you so much, Theresa – who do you particularly like among them?’ Which left her a bit stumped, so she just said: ‘Oh, well, all of them, Donald.’”The lesson being that too much flattery can get you into trouble if you do not do your homework.Dealing with, and responding to, Trump in his self-appointed role as ultra-provocative would-be global peacemaker is requiring other leaders the world over to perform near-impossible balancing acts when framing their responses.View image in fullscreenUkrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was last week blamed by Donald Trump for starting the war with Russia.Photograph: Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesMany of the US president’s statements on the Ukraine conflict, such as those suggesting thatUkraine was responsible for the Russian invasionand that its president,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is a dictator, are regarded by European governments, including the British one, as patently ludicrous.Yet at the same time, no one can say so for fear of what the man who said those things will do next and what revenge he might wreak in return.Peter Ricketts, former UK ambassador to Paris, said that Starmer should himself tune out from Trump’s rhetoric. “He should focus not on what Trump says but what he does. He needs to get into Trump’s mind that a rushed deal with [Vladimir] Putin over the heads of Ukraine/Europe is bound to be a deal that serves Putin’s interests, and that Putin would be seen as strong and Trump weak.”Another senior UK source agreed, saying that Starmer needed to convey to Trump that the only thing that would stop him earning his place in history would be by getting a great peace that was not seen as a “fair deal”. “He needs to make Trump think that his success rests on not giving in to Putin, because if he does he will himself seem weak,” said the source.While cross-continental mud-slinging has intensified, UK political leaders have had a painfully difficult few days trying to adapt to Trump’s barrage of remarks, the latest of which was to say neither Starmer nor Macron – who will meet Trump at the White House on Monday –have done anythingof note to sort out the war in Ukraine.EvenNigel Farage, who prides himself on his closeness to Trump and the Republicans, has had to equivocate and throw up a cloud of deliberate confusion around his own responses, so he can claim to be both distancing himself from the US president and validating his interventions at the same time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When, however, it was put to Farage that Trump had told Zelenskyy: “You should have never started it[the conflict],” Farage then replied: “OK, he did. If you’re happy.”With UK public opinion overwhelmingly critical of Trump’s comments on Zelenskyy and Ukraine – today’s Opinium poll for theObservershows the Trump administration has a -40% approval rating on Ukraine compared with -2% for the previous Biden administration – the Tory leader,Kemi Badenoch, also felt the need to part company with Trump, tweeting on X that “President Zelenskyy is not a dictator”, though she backed him over the need for European nations to increase defence spending.About 61% of Tory voters disagree with the Trump administration on Ukraine, so for Badenoch not to express some reservations over the US president could have left her in big trouble in her own party.Observer/Opinium poll chartFrom saviour to Judas… How Trump’s pivot on Russia also endangers his own country  | Simon TisdallRead moreTheLiberal Democrats, meanwhile, looking for more seats and votes behind the “blue wall” have spotted an opportunity as the anti-Trump party. Calum Miller, their foreign affairs spokesman, said the Lib Dems had a duty to stand up for people in his constituency and others who flew Ukrainian flags in their villages and had taken in Ukrainian refugees.“It is our role to be their voice in parliament,” he said “to say that Trump is a narcissist who is not to be trusted.”Government sources suggested on Saturday nightthat Starmer would probably try to speak to Macron on Sunday before the French president flies to Washington, so as to agree the broad outlines of a European position.But another senior source said the last thing Starmer should do when he meets Trump is try to speak for the Europeans or represent a European position.“Trump has made clear what he thinks of European leaders [last]week. Starmer needs to be his own man, to say the UK was the first country to offer to send troops to Ukraine and do its bit.“If he does that, and succeeds in persuading Trump that it will look terrible to the world if he allows Putin just to get everything he wants, it could be a big moment for him.”Explore more on these topicsKeir StarmerThe ObserverDonald TrumpUS politicsRussiaVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUkrainenewsShareReuse this content"

Given the numerous pressures being loaded on to UK farming this will be a welcome positive.”Reed will hope to receive a warmer reception at Tuesday’s NFU conference than in January, when his speech to delegates at the Oxford Farming Conference waspunctuated by the blasts of tractor hornsparked outside the venue by protesters.At the time, Reed said the government would start to monitor the origin of food bought by the public sector as part of efforts tohelp farmers get a “fairer share”of catering contracts.Relations between the government and the farming community have soured further in recent days, after the NFU and other agricultural organisationsreacted with “fury”when the Treasury dismissed their proposals aimed at softening the impact of the inheritance tax changes on farmers.Farming groups had suggested to ministers the use of a “clawback” mechanism, which would mean that those inheriting a farming business would be eligible for paying inheritance tax only if they decided to sell the business within a specific timeframe. They argued that this would still raise revenue for the government, but would protect family farms from paying the tax.Explore more on these topicsFarmingPublic financeFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Senior officials and climate policy experts now believe past delays in cutting emissions make it improbable the 2045 target will be met.Sarah Boyack MSP, Scottish Labour’s net zero spokesperson, said this followed “years of environmental failure and inaction” by the Scottish National party.“For too long the SNP has relied on sticking plaster solutions and chased headlines. It would be an appalling betrayal if it walks away from its promise to reach net zero by 2045.”Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-convenor who served as a junior minister in a short-lived coalition with the Scottish National party, said he became aware of this data while in government.Harvie urged the Scottish government to take decisive action when ministers publish new carbon budgets and new policies later this year. Missing the 2045 target “is not baked in yet; that’s not locked in, [but] the clock is ticking.“We are not seeing ambition yet. That’s on the government.”Scotland has already been forced to abandon a much earlier target of cutting its emissions by 75% by 2030 after the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), the official advisory body, saidit was “beyond what is credible”.Before itscrapped that target last year, Scotland had missed eight out of its 12 annual emissions reduction targets and had failed to meet its targets on tree planting, peatland restoration, cutting car use and installing low-carbon heating in homes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Scotland’s sole success has been switching heavily to renewable electricity and closing coal-fired power stations, which initially led to deep and rapid cuts in overall emissions.The consultancy Ricardo AEA has told ministers Scotland could meet its 2045 target by massively increasing reforestation, peatland restoration and the use of technologies such as machines that extract CO2from the air and carbon capture from bioenergy plants.But it said the data that supports that conclusion “should be interpreted with great caution”. The feasibility of substantially restoring damaged peatlands, which emit carbon, “is unclear”. Carbon-removal technologies, known as negative emissions technologies (NETs), are “in their infancy”.The report states that if both those strategies are excluded “greenhouse gas emissions in 2045 would be close to 20MtCO2e.” It adds that because of that uncertainty “there is a very high risk that the Scottish government’s statutory targets will not be achieved … without additional policies.”A Scottish government spokesperson said it was “committed to ending our contribution to global emissions by 2045 at the latest, as agreed by parliament on a cross-party basis”.“Between 1990 and 2022 our emissions halved while the economy grew by 66%, demonstrating that a thriving economy and falling emissions are compatible. However, the second half of our journey will be even more challenging and it is vital we ensure a just transition in areas like agriculture, transport and heat in buildings.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandGreenhouse gas emissionsJohn SwinneyScottish politicsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Nobody would blink an eyelid if they heard Wagner in the church.”Mynett, a senior lecturer in music technology at the University of Huddersfield, said the hostility towards heavy metal was because “opera and classical are often seen as high culture, whereas metal music is often seen as working class”.The York Minster gig – which sold out within days – is the latest example of England’s churches hosting somewhat untraditional events to stave off financial crisis and draw in younger crowds.CanterburyandPeterboroughcathedrals drew criticism from some quarters last year for putting on “rave in the nave” discos to try to swell their coffers.About 3,500 churches in the UK haveclosed since 2013, while more than 900 places of worship are on Historic England’s “heritage at risk” register. In Scotland, more than 180 are officially at risk, and the Church of Scotland is considering closing up to 40% of its churches.Figures released by the Church of England in December showed thataverage weekly attendance was 171,000people below pre-pandemic levels in 2023, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Compared with 2009, there were 389,000 fewer attenders on average.Mynett said some churches were bucking the trend by being “more open minded and not as judgmental” and in turn attracting younger and more diverse audiences.He added: “What is going to happen with the Church ofEnglandif its deepening decline continues? What happens with all this heritage? What happens with all this history?“What happens with all of the pipe organs within those buildings? They are going to be lost.“We are sleepwalking towards losing an incredibly important part of British heritage with our churches and pipe organs – they need reimagining and reimagining quickly.”York Minster previously said the event – for which tickets cost up to £20 each – would “cater to those with different musical tastes and showcase the magnificence of the organ that has played a central role in worship atYorkMinster for over 1,000 years”.A spokesperson added: “The performers and organisers of this event are acutely aware of the sanctity of the site and will deliver a show that respects the values of York Minster as a site of Christian pilgrimage and worship.”Explore more on these topicsChristianityYorkMetalReligionEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He said that should leverage up to £600m more in private investment.Speaking to reporters after his announcement at Scottish Labour’s annual conference, he rejected suggestions this had come too late for the scores of Grangemouth workers recently given redundancy notices, or those who will be laid off in the coming months.He said Labour had acted as quickly as it could, but it took time to work up a credible proposal. “It’s very easy to put proposals on the table that don’t hold water. What I want to do is take the time to do this properly,” he said.“We’re not talking about just a sort of something that tides people over, not something for the next three or four years. It’s a generational opportunity for Grangemouth.”The crisis at Grangemouth has quickly become the biggest political headache for Labour in Scotland: trade union leaders have accused the UK government of failing to act quickly enough, and union members demonstrated outside the party conference in Glasgow on Friday.Labour ministers privately accuse the former Conservative government and Scottish National party ministers of being largely inactive despite knowing Grangemouth was due to close. Soon after the election, it announced a £100m growth deal for the region agreed with the Scottish government.Labour’s popularity has slumped in Scotland since it scrapped the universal winter fuel payment, refused to compensate Waspi pensioners, hiked national insurance and the party was caught up in rows over undeclared gifts to Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the chancellor.With Scottish Labour now as low as 18% in the polls, it faces the prospect of a humiliating fifth successive defeat at the hands of the SNP in next year’s Holyrood election. Grangemouth’s fate will heavily influence votes in nearby seats.Last week, John Swinney, the first minister and SNP leader, added to the pressure by announcing a further £25m in Scottish government funding for a Grangemouth “just transition fund”, to add to £7.8m in its budget.Trade union leaders have urged both governments to invest heavily in new technologies such as sustainable aviation fuel and biofuels in Grangemouth. They see it as a substantial test of Ed Miliband’s claim the UK government is investing in a fair transition away from fossil fuels.The Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, has urged Starmer and Miliband, the UK’s energy and net zero secretary, to temporarily take over Grangemouth from its owners, PetroIneos, to stem job losses before then converting it to produce green aviation fuel.UK ministers said there were significant regulatory and technical issues blocking the immediate development of green aviation fuel in the UK, due to it being neglected by previous governments.Miliband said Starmer’s announcement showed the UK government was serious about securing a viable future for the plant, which is Scotland’s last oil refinery. “We have always said that we will leave no stone unturned in seeking a sustainable industrial future for Grangemouth and its workers,” he said.Roz Foyer, the general secretary of the Scottish TUC, said the £200m could not be dismissed lightly, but castigated the government for rejecting Graham’s proposals. “This must be the priority from all governments, not retrospective action that assumes the closure of the site is inevitable,” she said.Explore more on these topicsTrade unionsScotlandLabourJob lossesOil and gas companiesEnergyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s the sort of kit that teenagers might need for a Duke of Edinburgh trip.But this bag is for young homeless people, to give them a fighting chance of getting some sleep on the streets of London. Holly and her colleagues at the New Horizon Youth Centre are packing them to give to the young people they now have to turn away every day, as an increasing number of emergency shelters shut their doors.“Things are going backwards,” says Phil Kerry, New Horizon’s chief executive. “People come to the centre and we’re not able to help them that day and they’re going out on to the streets. That’s a daily reality. There are simply not enough places for people to go, even in the winter.”This is the last kit bag because the 199 others that New Horizon bought for the winter have already been handed out, six weeks earlier than expected.The number of rough sleepers in London had risen from 3,107 in March 2023 to 4,612 by December last year, according to data from Chain, the homelessness information network. More than a third are under 35, meaning they are over-represented compared with the population average of 27% of adults inEnglandand Wales.View image in fullscreenEmergency provisions given by New Horizon Youth Centre to young adults who are sleeping rough.Photograph: Sophia Evans/the ObserverNew Horizon’s experience is echoed by charities around the country. Roundabout in Sheffield began running hostel accommodation in Sheffield 10 years ago and last year ran out of space for the first time, putting about 15 people in hotels instead, a number that has tripled this year.In Manchester, Depaul UK supports young people at risk of homelessness, trying to prevent them from sleeping rough. By May last year, a third of those coming for help were sleeping rough and that rose to 60% by December, according to Nicola Harwood, Depaul’s executive director of operations.New Horizon runs a drop-in centre at King’s Cross, central London, offering help to find housing and work, as well as food and a place to have a shower, do laundry and get warm.There are broadly four kinds of people needing help, staff say, although a common factor is family breakdown brought on by the cost of living crisis.“Some of them have quite severe mental heath needs,” says Udobang, who is New Horizon’s counsellor. “Some have been kicked out of their family home because of their sexuality. We get a lot of people escaping gangs. And we get a lot of people from Home Office accommodation.” Homelessness among refugeesdoubled last year. On 9 December, the Home Office extended the number of days asylum seekers can stay in government accommodation before finding their own (to 56 days), but by then charities said they were already facing an emergency.The rising demand has been compounded by shrinking numbers of “supported exempt accommodation” projects, intended for people with extra needs, such as care leavers or domestic abuse survivors, and for which the amount of housing benefit is uncapped.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The sector has beenexploitedby criminals and landlords providing substandard housing. In 2023, MPs passed the Supported Housing (Regulatory Oversight) Act to tackle the problem and local authorities have been less prepared to sanction them.The charity can afford to put some people in hotels for up to seven days but costs are spiralling. “In my first year at the centre, in 2018, I think we spent about £30,000 on emergency accommodation,” Kerry says. “Last year, it was over £100,000. This year, I don’t know where we’re going to end up but we spent £50,000 in the last three months.”Young people looking for housing face what Kerry calls “triple discrimination”. Under-35s receive less housing benefit due to their age, under-25s get less universal credit, and under-21s have a lower minimum wage. Social housing is in short supply and private rents are too high – Kerry says just one room out of more than 2,000 on Spareroom.com in Camden, north London, would be affordable on the reduced benefits available to young people. The only remaining option is supported exempt accommodation.“Having to make referrals through these supported providers was really the only option we could use for young people,” says Neil Parkinson, co-head of casework at Glass Door, a homeless charity in London that runs a night shelter. “A lot of homeless people do have additional needs but having to evidence that [can be hard].”In the middle of this month, MPs on the housing, communities and local government committee warned ministers that England faced a rough sleeping emergency, which its chair, Florence Eshalomi MP, described as “a source of national shame”. She added: “The success of the Everyone In policy during the pandemic shows it’s possible to end rough sleeping.”Angela Rayner is leading an inter-ministerial group on tackling homelessness and rough sleeping and in December allocated nearly £1bn on homelessness spending, including £37m for a rough sleeping accommodation programme.Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessThe ObserverEnglandYoung peopleHousingCommunitiesSocial exclusionnewsShareReuse this content"

Introduced by the Tories in 2017, the two-child limit prevents families from claiming child tax credits or universal credit for more than two children.View image in fullscreenBridget Phillipson says the most disadvantaged areas will benefit first.Photograph: Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty ImagesA group of Labour MPs has been pressing for the government to meet them halfway by extending the cap from two to three children, which they claim would cost very little. But government insiders suggested that the idea had already been rejected by the government’s own child poverty taskforce which is chaired jointly by Phillipson and the work and pensions secretary Liz Kendall. It is due to report before the spending review this summer. But with Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, facing the prospect of having to raise taxes or cut spending as a result of deteriorating public finances, sources suggest there is no hope of lifting the cap in the foreseeable future.One Labour source said: “There is a need to prepare the ground a bit and make clear that in the current financial position we are in, we cannot realistically do it. What we can do is talk about what else we are doing to limit child poverty.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They said the fact that the government was only providing 60p per pupil would leave them with a large deficit if they took part.Paul Whiteman, general secretary at school leaders union NAHT, said the pilot scheme was welcome but concerns about funding needed to be addressed: “We have already heard from some school leaders who are worried that funding for the scheme will fall short of the cost of delivering it.Last Julyseven Labour MPs were suspendedfrom the whip for voting in favour of scrapping the two-child limit which has been criticised by several senior figures in the party as punitive and indefensible. But while ministers have suggested they would like to see it lifted they have said this can only be done if the public finances allow. Labour’s general election manifesto last year committed to spending £315 million on breakfast clubs in 2028–29. But there are now concerns over funding, with some charities warning that the government’s apparent insistence on having clubs of at least 30 minutes before school, as opposed to “grab and go” food offers or breakfast in the classroom will prove too expensive as they will mean employing extra staff.Explore more on these topicsSchoolsThe ObserverPovertyLabourBridget PhillipsonBenefitsEnglandChild benefitsnewsShareReuse this content"

John predicted the proposal “would devastate our creative community”, while helping “powerful foreign technology companies”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Chris Riddell/The ObserverThe letter specifically targets a clause of the government’s ­upcomingAI Opportunity Action Plan, which argues that an end to copyright restrictions and intellectual property law is needed to allow greater data-mining of artwork and writing.The signatories say they ­understand the government aim of ­boosting growth, but describe themselves as “staring in astonishment” at Whitehall’s eagerness “to ­hastily wrap our live’s work in attractive paper as a welcome gift to automated competitors”.“Imagine asking ChatGPT to generate your child’s artwork instead of asking the child. And then sticking that on the fridge. It’s a horrible thought, isn’t it?” said children’s book author and illustrator Ged Adamson.“Why then are we scooping up ­creativity en masse to build something without any soul that will rob us, not only of income, but maybe eventually our ability to think ­creatively?“The idea that all this work and dedication and honing skills was ­ultimately just to make tech billionaires even richer – it makes me feel sick, angry and depressed.”His fellow author Davies said he fears that “the basis of an entire creative culture” is on the point of being sold off. “They’re not even bothering to tell us it will benefit us in the long run because they know that it won’t,” he told theObserver.“Copyright ­protects individual ­creative output and this proposal rides roughshod over that. I’m so ­disappointed with this government.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The livelihood of workers will become their profit,” said Adamson.The campaign also aims to dispel popular misconceptions. AI, they argue is not innovative. It can only re-mix the past. It cannot discard old prejudices or develop new positions. “If we do not take steps now to protect and respect the space for human culture, creativity and the creators of the future we may lose what it means to be human entirely,” argues supporter Susie Alegre, the author of Human Rights, Robot Wrongs… Being Human in the Age of AI. “Destruction of cultural heritage is an international crime, in part because it paves the way to inhumanity. Without creatives there is no cultural heritage.”View image in fullscreenA children’s book illustration by Ged Adamson, one of the letter’s signatories.Illustration: Ged AdamsonAnother signatory, picture book creator Chris Haughton, insists it is not about being “anti-tech”. “But the way generative AI operates is not at all creatively exciting. It is stealing,” he said this weekend. “If these lobbies succeed in convincing our government we will effectively be handing all the wealth created by the creative industries, hundreds of billions, and giving it all straight to the tech industry.”Abe argues that the representation of diverse and minority groups will take a step back if AI takes the creative reins. “For BAME people, especially east- and south-east Asian, authors and illustrators, the door to the children’s book industry has finally cracked open over the past five years and some of us have managed to squeeze into the super-competitive world,” she said. “But generative AI will create unfair competition for all creatives, and minority creatives would be the first ones to be squeezed back out.”Her co-campaigner, Ciraolo, adds that the early mistakes made with social media are about to be repeated if there is no protest and the right voices are not heard. “Nothing of what the government proposed offers a single good thing for us. The consultation was designed to create a sense of inevitability, to put people off objecting to it and make us cave in in advance,” she said, pointing out that artists are far from “jealous gate-keepers of privilege”, but instead are hard-working and badly paid.“I am worried we are taking away from kids the opportunity to learn the skills that take effort to develop, but give them a lot of confidence and satisfaction. Generative AI looks like creativity, but it robs you of embodied skills,” she said.The headline of this article was amended on 23 February 2025 to correct the spelling of Michael Rosen’s first name.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverTeen booksPublishingComputingProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

Several foreign delegations attended the funeral, including the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, and several Iraqi lawmakers.“I can’t even express how I feel, it feels like my father or grandfather I died. Most of us still don’t believe he’s actually dead,” said Mohammed Khalifeh, a Lebanese man who traveled from Australia for the funeral.Nasrallah was born into a working-class family in Beirut in 1960, though he was originally from southLebanon. One of the founding members of Hezbollah, he was the longest-serving leader of the group and was famed for his charisma and skills as an orator.1:04Tens of thousands of people attend the funeral of former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah – video reportHe became a celebrated figure in Lebanon for Hezbollah’s role in ending Israel’s 18-year occupation of south Lebanon in 2000, although that image was tarnished after the group’s intervention in Syria’s civil war in support of the long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad. The group’s dominance of Lebanon’s politics over the last two decades also engendered resentment among its opponents.Mourners wept as Nasrallah and Safieddine’s caskets were paraded around the stadium and threw rings, jackets and scarves for pallbearers to rub on the coffins and return to them as mementoes of the late leaders. As the caskets were unveiled, four Israeli fighter jets flew low over the stadium, prompting cries of “Death to Israel!”.View image in fullscreenMourners at the funeral of Nasrallah and Safieddine.Photograph: Fadel Itani/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said the planes were “conveying a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel and attacks Israel – that will be the end of him. You will specialise in funerals – and we will specialise in victories.”.Israeli fighter jets bombed south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley before and during the funeral ceremony, despite the ceasefire agreement signed months earlier.Nasrallah’s death marked the beginning of an escalation in the Hezbollah-Israel war, which up until then had mostly been defined by low-level, tit-for-tat-style fighting in Lebanon’s border region.Hezbollah tries to claim victory as Lebanon mourns its deadRead moreHezbollah attacked Israel on 8 October 2023 “in solidarity” with Hamas’s attack from Gaza on Israel the day before. The conflict was confined mainly to the Lebanese border until a dramatic Israeli escalation and ground invasion in south Lebanon in late September 2024, which left more than 3,000 people in Lebanon dead and displaced more than a million people.Fighting officially ended under a ceasefire agreement and Israeli troops mostly withdrew on 18 February, though Israeli troops have remained in five points in south Lebanon and continue to strike targets periodically.Despite the organisation’s massive losses and the immense humanitarian cost of the war, Hezbollah’s followers said on Sunday that they remained undeterred.“They thought that after they killed our leaders that we would become weak and that they could occupy Lebanon, but they couldn’t do it,” said Lina Jawad, a 27-year-old designer who lives in Beirut.1:15Israel kills at least 22 Lebanese while they attempt to return to their homes – videoHezbollah’s secretary general, Naim Qassem, whose speech during the ceremony was televised from a remote location, said the group would “not submit” and would not accept Israeli forces remaining in the country.The group’s status in the country and influence on the state after the war has been diminished, withLebanon’s new governmentattempting to disarm the non-state group.Hezbollah has long claimed its forces acted a deterrent to Israeli invasions, although some of the Lebanese public has grown frustrated with the now-weakened militant group.In the government’s first statement last week, it dropped any references to the right to “armed resistance” – a reference to Hezbollah’s right to hold weapons – the first time since 2000 that the state did not pay homage to Hezbollah.In a meeting with an Iranian delegation on Sunday, the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, said the country was “tired of others’ wars” and that Lebanon had paid a “heavy price” for the Palestinian cause.The state faces the task of reconstruction, after large swathes of the country were levelled by Israeli bombing. It is courting international donors, including gulf countries, for funds.The new government also has demanded the full withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon and is relying on diplomatic channels to pressure Israel to do so.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Tarrio denied any involvement in the incident.Organizers of the Principles First summit, which isconsidereda center-right alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), confirmed the bomb threat after they abruptly asked attendees to clear the room hosting the conference.“We have received a credible bomb threat from an account claiming to be ‘Enrique T.’ ‘To honor the J6 hostages.’ Yesterday, the recently pardoned leader of the Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and the attack of January 6th came to the Summit and harassed the J6 police who were speaking,” organizers said ina social media post.“Hotel security, private security, and MPD have made the decision to evacuate Summit floor so that the area can be secured,” the note added, referring to Washignton’s Metropolitan police department. “We intend to reconvene and continue with the Summit once the area has been secured.”As the situation unfolded, Tarrio shared asocial media postdenying any connection to the incident and threatening Principles First organizers with legal action for accusing him.Jim Acosta, the former CNN host, posted acopy of the threatening messageon social media. The message claimed that four pipe bombs had been deployed against political enemies of “Emperor Trump” who “all deserve to die”, including attendees at the conference, Michael Fanone, a former US Capitol police officer, Fanone’s mother and John Bolton, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser.After police officers completed the security sweep of the hotel, Heath Mayo, founder of Principles First, confirmed that organizers received a threatening email with the subject line “explosive surprises” from an account belonging to “Enrique T”.Mayo commended the police officers and security officials who responded quickly to the threat,telling summit attendees: “We are not going to be cowed … It would have been easy to go home and write this off and let these threats win. But this is what America is all about, and America’s democracy – the way that our government works – cannot be cowed by threats like this or people like this.”The crowd responded with loud applause.Heath Mayo, founder of Principles First, addressed the bomb threat at a summit in Washington on Sunday.The incident comes one day after Tarrioappearedat the Washington hotel hosting the summit to insult a group of police officers who protected the US Capitol on January 6, one of whom was receiving a “profile in courage” award from Principles First.Invideoshared by Tarrio on social media on Saturday, he was seen following the officers and mocking them as “fucking cowards”.“You were brave on Twitter,” Tarrio said to the officers. “You guys were brave at my sentencing when you sat there and laughed when I got 22 fucking years. Now you don’t want to look in my eyes, you fucking cowards.”Fanone, the former police officer, then turned to Tarrio and said: “You’re a traitor to this country.”Aquilino Gonell, a former Capitol police sergeant, acknowledged the confrontation with Tarrio as he accepted his “profile in courage” award from Principles First on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re the traitor. They’re the one who attacked the Capitol,” he added.Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to his role in the January 6 attack, but the presidentpardoned him and roughly 1,500 other insurrectionistsafter taking office last month.Organizers received the threatening email from “Enrique T” on Sunday at 12.15pm, Mayo said, when attendees were on their lunch break. As the audience started trickling back in to the conference room, expecting to hear next from Bolton, an organizer asked everyone to exit and proceed to the upper levels of the hotel.The summit was able to resume about two hours later on Sunday afternoon. As they started making their way back to the conference room, attendees applauded the police officers who assisted with the security sweep and then broke out into chants of “USA! USA!”Speaking to reporters later, Mayo said: “We cannot be cowed by these threats of political violence.” He was joined on stage by Fanone, whose mother’s home was targeted. “This has been my life for the past four years,” Fanone said. “This is what my family has to endure.”Asked whether he had a message for Trump after the events of the past couple of days, considering the president’s pardon of Tarrio, Fanone repeated his message to Trump from the panel he appeared on Saturday: “Go fuck yourself.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsWashington DCUS Capitol attacknewsShareReuse this content"

In a Telegram post, a branch of Hamas’ military wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, praised the attacks but stopped short of taking responsibility.1:05IDF expands military raids in West Bank using bulldozers in Tulkarm – video reportIntensified raids in the West Bank come as the fragile Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza lurches from crisis to crisis.Hamas released six Israeli hostages on Saturdayunder the terms of the agreement, but Israel suspended the handover of more than 600 Palestinians it was due to free from its prisons in exchange, putting the five-week-old ceasefire agreement in further jeopardy.Delayed talks on the second stage of the deal, which is supposed to involve a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, are due to begin this week, but no date has been announced.On Sunday, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was prepared to return to hostilities in Gaza “at any moment” and vowed to complete the war’s objectives “whether through negotiation or by other means”.A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, said: “There will be no dialogue with Israel through the mediators at any stage before the release of the Palestinian prisoners.

They added thatMSNBCplans to replace Reid’s slot with a new show co-led by three anchors – Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez and Michael Steele – who currently co-host The Weekend show.Townsend is a Democratic strategist and ex-counsel to former vice-president Kamala Harris, who lost the race for the White House in November toDonald Trump. Menendez is a television commentator.

Kutler, who was then MSNBC’s senior vice-president for content strategy, replaced Jones.Following Jones’s departure, Mark Lazarus, NBCUniversal Media Group chairmantoldthe network’s employees, “We have a lot to do.”In January, Chuck Todd, a prominent anchor and former host of the network’s Meet The Press,announcedthat he was leaving NBC News.

Early steps have includedthreatening to “take back” the Panama Canal,accusing Mexico’s government of being in cahoots with narco-traffickers,sending an envoy to meet the Venezuelan dictator, Nicolás Maduro, andclashing with Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, over deportation flights.John Feeley, who was regarded as one of the state department’s top Latin America experts untilhe resignedfrom his job in Panama during Trump’s first term, said he was horrified but not surprised by Trump’s moves.“If you use as your psychological paradigm [for Trump] a combination of Tony Soprano and Thucydides … it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that he’s going to go to theAmericasfirst,” the ex-ambassador said, referring to the ancient historian who chronicled the fifth-century BC struggle between Athens and Sparta.Feeley believed the most famous line from Thucydides’s account of that war – “The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must” – explained Trump’s bully-boy worldview.“[He’s doing it] because he can – because the asymmetry of American commercial and military power is so incalculable in relationship to Mexico, Central America, Panama, even Brazil, Argentina. They can’t really do much other than suffer the consequences. And so I think, in a sort of mafioso way, he is very adept at reading relative power,” said the former diplomat, who attributedhis 2018 resignationto how Trump had “warped and betrayed … the traditional core values of the United States”.“He’s a velociraptor … He kills anything he perceives as a threat.”Feeley did not believe Trump would follow through on his threat to forcibly reclaim thePanamacanal if his demands over alleged Chinese meddling in the trade route were not met.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead more“It’s all bluster. He doesn’t have the votes for it. He ran on a ticket of American isolation … He doesn’t want to keep US bases in Germany. He doesn’t want to protect Europe. He doesn’t want to send America’s blood and treasure to fight and die in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. He wants to ‘make America great’.“His vision of a ‘Great America’ is an America that sits in its sphere of influence, king in its own castle, and exploiting parts of the world for American gain, such as $500bn inUkrainian rare earths,” said the diplomat who also served in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico during a 28-year state department career.Feeley praised Panama’s handling of the “relentlessly transactional” US president’s tactics by making tactical concessions while maintaining control of the canal.The former ambassador saw a similarly Soprano-like modus operandi in Trump’s engagement with Maduro, whom the US president appears to have warmed to after trying unsuccessfully to overthrow him during his first administration.View image in fullscreenJohn Feeley, then deputy chief of mission in Mexico, speaks in Mexico City in 2010.Photograph: Eliana Aponte/Reuters“A mobster doesn’t kill every one of his competitors. Frequently, he buys them off. Frequently, he corrupts them. Frequently, he co-opts them,” Feeley said. “And he saw in Maduro a tinpot little mobster in a country that he doesn’t care about – a country that he currently, in this transactional moment, needs to be able tosend a bunch of C-17 Globemasters [transport planes] back to and dump out a bunch of Venezuelans in orange jumpsuits and shacklesso that he can go back to his Maga base and say: ‘See, Joe Biden let these rapists and drug dealers in. I kicked them out.’”Feeley thought Trump’s engagement with Maduro was motivated by his mass deportation campaign, not a desire to access Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “The United States set record oil and gas productions last year … We don’t need the black gold from the Orinoco belt.”By striking a deal with Maduro allowing him to send deportation flights to Caracas, Feeley argued that Trump had betrayed the opposition politicians widely believed to have beaten the Venezuelan autocrat in last July’s presidential election. “He sold them down the river after they gave him their vote,” the former ambassador said of the Venezuelan Americans who backed Trump in the 2024 US election hoping he would help rid their country of Maduro.But if Trump was channeling Tony Soprano in his treatment of Latin America, Feeley believed he was also channeling Trump. “Donald Trump’s approach to Latin America is reminiscent of the manner in which he and his father ran their buildings in Queens.They put a big C [for “coloured”] on any application from a family that was Black or Hispanic. And not surprisingly, those people didn’t get apartments. They settled that case with the Department of Justice in the 1970s. But it’s very clear to me that Donald Trump sees Latin America as a place to exploit and to get rent from – but not to allow to live in his building,” he said.“I am ashamed of my country. I am angry at my country for electing him. And I am hopeful that we have still the guardrails of democracy to get back to, not perfection, but a place where we value strategic alliances to keep us all safe, where we incorporate human rights and concepts of basic decency into our foreign policy, and where we cultivate our soft power.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyPanamaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Yet they also show that many Russians – especially in major cities like Moscow and St Petersburg – appear to yearn for the pre-war days when they could easily fly toEuropeor browse the aisles of Zara.A recent survey by the independent Levada Center in Moscow found that 61% of Russians favoured peace talks over continuing the war – a record high since the question was first asked in the early days of the conflict.If there was one clear takeaway from the high-level meetings in Riyadh, it was that the US, under the transactional leadership of President Donald Trump, was eager to revive economic ties with Russia.His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the end to the war would be “the key that unlocks the door” for “potentially historic economic partnerships”. Crucially, he suggested that the US could drop sanctions against Russia as part of a peace deal.Russian media and commentators seized on Rubio’s words, fuelling a wave of speculation that western giants – from Nike toApple– were rushing to reopen stores in the country. For now, these discussions remain purely theoretical.A viable path to peace is still elusive, with Ukraine’s leader,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, insisting that his country will not accept unjust terms. Meanwhile, European leaders have rejected the idea of lifting sanctions on Russia, and there is no indication that western companies are preparing to return.Yet the mood in Moscow suggests that many are beginning to think about what a post-war reality might look like.View image in fullscreenMariupol, three years after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Photograph: EPAThe exodus of western brands following Russia’s full-scale invasion – from McDonald’s and Ikea toChanel– has transformed the face of its cities across the country.What was once a landscape of global retail giants has been replaced by Russian stand-ins, with shopping malls now dominated by local imitations of long-familiar western names.As talks progress at a blistering speed, officials in Moscow appear to be still unsure whether to welcome western companies back with open arms. On one hand, for many within the Kremlin’s establishment, the return of western businesses – paired with a peace deal that favours Moscow – would signal that Russia had ultimately been reintegrated into the international fold, despite having launched the largest war in Europe since the second world war. “If western firms return, it would mean that money has trumped all their talk of so-called liberal values. They promised we would be a pariah for invading Ukraine, but in reality, everyone just chases profits,” one well-connected Russian business in Moscow told theObserver.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anatoly Aksakov, a Russian politician, expressed confidence that major financial firms like Mastercard and Visa would seek to re-enter the Russian market. “Of course, they want to return so they can profit from it,” he said.But there was also pushback from Russia’s influential pro-war nationalist voices, who have embraced the country’s path of isolation.Some argue that allowing European and US brands to return would threaten the profits made by their Russian substitutes, which have dominated since the exodus of western competition.Others warned that western firms would reintroduce liberal values that clash with Russia’s ultra-conservative wartime ideology.“What to do with these traitors and how to handle them should and will be decided by professionals across all branches of power,I am confident that domestic companies will be guaranteed that they will not be traded for French rags and Italian slippers,” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson wrote on Telegram. “Our manufacturers must know their contribution to the Special Military Operation will not be betrayed,” she added, using Russia’s official term for war in Ukraine.Speaking on a Russian talk show last week, Alexander Malkevich, an influential Russian propagandist, proposed that for western companies to be allowed to re-enter the Russian market, they should be required to donate money to the Russian army and open stores in Ukrainian cities that are occupied by Russia, such as Mariupol.There were also those in Moscow who felt bittersweet about the possible end of the war. “I think the most important thing is that the war is ending and people will stop dying,” said Alexandra, a Russian public relations consultant who opposed the war but kept her views hidden out of fear of prosecution in Moscow.“But no lessons will be learned from this war if it ends in Putin’s favour,” she added. “Everything will go back to normal as if nothing ever happened.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaThe ObserverUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeForeign policyApplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The same cannot be said for Syria.”When encountered by the Guardian during a rare tour of Panorama prison, Hajj-Obeid admitted to having been an IS member but said he had deeply regretted his actions.“I’ve been here for six years and it’s been traumatising,” he said, the cell floor behind him lined with thin, grey sleeping mats and what appeared to be plastic children’s cutlery. “Many people died, it’s been overwhelming.”The Australian Centre for International Justice’s acting executive director, Lara Khider, said: “Australia is obligated to investigate any allegations of international crimes committed by this Australian citizen”.Zelenskyy says he would ‘quit for peace’ as he refuses US demand for Ukraine mineralsRead moreShoebridge conceded the political appetite for repatriation to Australia was nonexistent, despite national security advantages. He said this was increasingly so, given the fracturing of social cohesion caused by the Israel-Gaza conflict.“There is no political will to bring him orother Australians citizens backbecause we would prefer that distant problems remain distant. But we are not thinking through the consequences,” Shoebridge said.“Having very troubled people with an increasing sense of grievance against their home country and government by being left in atrocious conditions … is a driver of exactly the kind of extremism that created IS.”Dr Andrew Zammit, an expert in foreign fighters and a research fellow at Victoria University, said leaving foreign fighters in Syria presented a national security challenge given the region’s uncertain future.“It’s ultimately Australia’s responsibility to bring the Australians to justice, not the SDF’s responsibility, particularly when the SDF’s future is so unclear following Assad’s overthrow.”Hajj-Obeid said he left Australia in 2015, claiming he was motivated to travel toSyria“to help”. “It was the situation in Syria, Bashar [al-Assad, the former Syrian president], the killing, the drama,” he said.The Australian government stripped Hajj-Obeid of his nationality in 2019, claiming he was eligible for Lebanese citizenship, but was forced to reverse the decision after a successful high court challenge by another man detained in Syria for his connections to IS.The Syrian Democratic Forces were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateSyriaAustralian foreign policyLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

Secondly, and this is the crucial language, including clearing any administrative, operational or technical hurdles to implementation.”So, “this idea that we’re gonna spend the money, but we’re only gonna spend the money after we have study sections, and – oops – we can’t have study sections because we’re not allowing notices of study sections to be filed in the Federal Register” unambiguously ignores that language, Bagenstos added.If the Trump administration continues to evade court orders, Bagenstos says judges have a number of tools at their disposal. They could issue more specific orders directed toward individuals responsible for violations, or even hold them in civil contempt of court, which can include jail time, and whichcannot be undone with a presidential pardon.Study sections bring scientists from institutions around the country together to peer review grant proposals, said Berg. Each section brings 20 or more peer reviewers together to review as many as 100 proposals.“It’s basically about two weeks of work” for each reviewer, says Berg.A source familiar with the process estimated that for every three days’ worth of delayed study sections, $1bn of NIH funding is put on hold. Even though study sections are required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance, meetings scheduled to begin on 20 February were postponed the day before.“This week, without warning, as we were checking in to our flights for DC, my study section was canceled for no reason,” said one scientist who was supposed to have her grant proposal reviewed. The cancellations led the scientist and her colleagues to collectively put together that the problem was related to the Federal Register – a relatively obscure step in the process.Two scientists scheduled to attend 20 February study sections as reviewers said they had never heard about the requirement until this week. One suspected the maneuver is “another clever way to wage war on medical science” because few people, even those who work at the NIH, completely understand how it works. It’s a “logistical thing that someone like me would never have to interact with, or likely would never have heard of”, he said.None of the scientists the Guardian spoke to received an explanation as to why study sections were not cancelled until the last minute, even though they were required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance but never did. LaBonne suspects it’s because NIH staff are still hoping the meetings can go forward somehow.“They’re trying to keep it possible till the very last minute in hopes that someone has mercy and allows study sections to continue, and maybe even waives the 15 day requirement,” LaBonne explained.Stuart Buck, a Harvard Law graduate and executive director of theGood Science Project,says these moves make it “very hard to read the tea leaves” about what will happen next.Jay Bhattacharya, who Trump nominated to direct the NIH, has “not even had a confirmation hearing yet”, Buck said. “Why rush out policies that are pretty drastic without the involvement of the people who are supposed to be the experts running the agency?”Buck continued: “All the public rhetoric is about reducing the deficit or reducing regulation. But the things they’re doing so far are mostly not aimed at the deficit or regulation at all. They’re canceling contracts that are trivial compared to the deficit … firing people and canceling things and creating chaos everywhere.”A scientist who was supposed to attend a postponed study section as a reviewer also had trouble making sense of these actions. If the meetings are ever rescheduled, reviewers will either have forgotten details of the proposals they reviewed or have to spend extra time reviewing them again, which will take time away from their own medical research.“This whole thing makes so little sense to me. They’re not even saving any money by doing this. And ultimately, what they’re doing is going to cost more money than anything else, by just delaying everything and kind of screwing up people’s lives,” he said.Another reviewer said the time waste was “annoying” but “the real disturbing thing here is that there’s a lot of really great science in those grants that really needs to be funded in a time-sensitive way. And if it’s not, labs are going to close.”The NIH press office did not respond to a request for comment in time to be included in the story.This article was amended on 23 February 2025 to clarify that Jeremy Berg’s job title is biochemist, not genetic scientist as previously stated.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsMedical researchDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefieldSoon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we?Donna FergusonSun 23 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareIn 1998, the late journalistJoan Didionwrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication ofTrue at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. “This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,” Didion wrote. “His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.”Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion beganwriting her own journalabout her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband,John Gregory Dunne.The announcement that these post-psychiatry notes, discovered by Didion’s literary executors in an unlabelled folder shortly after she died in 2021,are to be published in Aprilhas raised questions around the ethics of posthumous publishing.Didion left no instructions to her trustees – her literary editor Lynn Nesbit, and two of her longtime editors, Shelley Wanger and Sharon DeLano – about how to handle the deeply private journal after her death from complications of Parkinson’s disease.In total, 46 entries were found – printed out and placed in chronological order – in a portable filing cabinet next to her desk. They will be published in their entirety, with only minimal editing, such as footnotes and corrections of typos, under the titleNotes to John.The book is already being hyped as “an unmissable publication” from “one of the most iconic writers of our time” by its UK publisher 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins. According to the publisher, the “meticulous” notes of conversations Didion had with her psychiatrist were central to Didion’s understanding of the themes she turned to in her celebrated late works, such as her memoirsThe Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights, in which she writes about Quintana and John’s deaths.View image in fullscreenDidion, her husband John Gregory Dunne and their daughter Quintana in their kitchen in Malibu, California, in 1972.Photograph: Henry Clarke/Conde Nast/Getty ImagesA close friend of Didion, who wished to remain anonymous, told theObserver: “I have no doubt that this document will further our collective astonishment at Joan’s work, but I also cannot think of anything more private than notes kept about one’s psychiatry sessions. It’s not my place to say what Joan would have wanted, but as someone who loved her very much, the publication of these pages makes me terrifically sad.”They said that, after discovering that Didion’s literary executors had decided to publish the notes, several of Didion’s closest friends and family members had shared similar feelings of disappointment and anguish: “The collective feeling in her inner circle is that her privacy has been betrayed … While I, of course, understand the public thirst for this document, given Joan’s extraordinary place in American letters, Joan was nothing if not meticulous and intentional with the details she decided to share – and not share – inThe Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights. Anything beyond that seems to me a tremendous betrayal of her privacy by the people she trusted the most.”Dr Rod Rosenquist, who lectures at the University of Northampton on the ethics of posthumous publishing, said the journal was bound to generate interest due to the “cult of Joan Didion”, which saw items such as her $12 blank notebooks fetch $9,000 at the auction of her estate by her heirs in 2022. “She is a celebrity writer within literary circles … and what I think is so interesting about public figures is that they are owned – manipulated in some ways – by the public,” he said.Readers are hungry to better understand the inner life of an author they admire, he added: “That’s the very nature of celebrity.”It is for this reason that writers such as Henry James and Charles Dickens burned their personal papers while they were still alive. But since Didion did not do this or instruct her literary executors not to publish the notes, leaving them “carefully organised” near her desk, where they were bound to be found, then “legally everyone’s acting within their rights and acting in ways that the market encourages them to act”, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I do think it’s debatable.”Paul Bogaards, a spokesperson for the Didion Dunne Literary Trust, said the trust “respectfully declined” to comment.Didion’s biographer, Tracy Daugh­erty, said he did not think Didion – “a careful curator of her image” – would have assumed that the personal nature of the journal protected it from “those who’d want to make it public”. “She was not naive about either publishing or human nature … Leaving behind something as rich as this journal promises to be could not be accidental.”Didion was in decline in her later years but she was not incapacitated, he said. “She had to know that this journal would be, in her terms, ‘gold’.”Explore more on these topicsJoan DidionThe ObserverMental healthPublishingnewsShareReuse this content"

Stars of Bridgerton, Game of Thrones, Line of Duty, Downton Abbey and Happy Valley are among its graduates. Its successes go back decades – Skins, Misfits, This is England, Utopia – including every soap opera and plenty of sitcoms. There is barely a part of television or film left untouched by this 42-year-old organisation.Television Workshop, one of the country’s most successful acting programmes, can be found in a small, unassuming room down a street of former industrial buildings in Nottingham.View image in fullscreenThe 260 places at the Television Workshop are highly sought-after.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIts list of famous alumni is long. Samantha Morton, Vicky McClure, Bella Ramsey, Jack O’Connell and Felicity Jones all learned their trade there, as did Michael Socha and his sister Lauren, Aisling Loftus, Joe Dempsie, Perry Fitzpatrick, Anjli Mohindra and hundreds more recognisable faces.It is for this reason the 260 places at the Television Workshop – or just Workshop, as the students call it – are highly sought-after. Auditions are rigorous and places are allocated based purely on talent. Once young people are accepted, the work is taken very seriously and they are taught the discipline and professionalism needed to survive in film and television.But what makes Workshop different from prestigious theatre programmes and top drama schools is that nobody is turned away because they cannot afford the fees.McClure told the Guardian she was “beyond grateful” for the opportunities given to her by the charity, adding: “Without the TV Workshop I can pretty much, hand on heart, say that I wouldn’t have made it this far, because of the style of training and because it was free of charge.”View image in fullscreenTelevision Workshop alumni include Vicky McClure.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMcClure, who rose to fame alongside a number of other workshoppers in the drama This is England, for which she won a Bafta, is one of the patrons of the charity, as is Oscar nominee and Bafta fellow Morton, and the award-winning film-maker Shane Meadows.And it is still churning out emerging stars. Last year, when the second series of the BBC’s Sherwood aired, a dozen current and former workshoppers could be seen in episode one alone.Two of those were Oliver Huntingdon and Bill Jones, both aged 24, who played Ryan Bottomley and Ronan Sparrow in James Graham’s Nottingham-based drama.“Every actor that’s come out of Workshop keeps their rough edges and their personality and they’re authentic, rather than it being drilled out of you, which you might see from some of the mainstream drama schools,” said Jones, who joined at the youngest possible age, seven, and stayed as long as he could, through to the age of 21.View image in fullscreenStudents acting in character in a Nottingham bar.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHuntingdon agreed. “It was a space with kids like me from similar backgrounds, the same age, similar mindset … enabling us all to test and try and make a fool out of ourselves and find our style. There’s so much talent there, so much variety of talent, and I think it’s becoming hard to ignore now for casting directors.”Jones added: “It’s important to say how unbelievably amazing it is.”Ali Rashley, the Television Workshop’s director, said offering free places to those who cannot afford the fees “will remain the most important thing, no matter how tough it’s getting”.And it is getting very tough. “There’s just no funding at all for us,” she said. “It’s become an absolute battle.” For decades, the programme had been financed by ITV and the BBC but slowly the funding disappeared as broadcasters’ purse strings tightened.Running costs are £120,000 a year – a small figure, even in the charity sector – and £540 trains one child for a year, a minute fraction of drama school fees. Parents who can afford it pay £45 a month, while bursaries are funded by generous members of the public and successful actors, such as Kenneth Branagh, who recently donated after hearing about the organisation through a co-star who had been a member.“He gave up his time completely free and spent an afternoon here, and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing,” Rashley said. She will use his donation to put on a free Shakespeare programme, which for some may be their only chance to perform Shakespeare, given that drama has been entirely erased in many state school curriculums.It is clear organisations like the Television Workshop are vital to address a severe imbalance in the creative landscape. Figures show 35% of Bafta-nominated actors were privately educated (compared with 6-7% of the general public), an enormous overrepresentation.Middle-class actors are often chosen for working-class parts, “but it doesn’t work both ways, does it? That’s really frustrating and it’s just so unfair.”The regional aspect is important too. Casting calls increasingly require a “London base”, further entrenching the over-representation of wealthier children from the south-east of England.“A working-class kid from Nottingham, Sheffield, Doncaster has not got a London base. And nor do they have access to a London base, and nor are they ever going to. So the industry will end up shutting down again to working-class actors. And that’s unforgivable.”The factors combine to meanonly 8% of creatives in film and TV come from a working-class background, a statistic that is “appalling”, Rashley said. “It’s ridiculous. Years ago we were battling this and, if anything, we’re going to go backwards.”Shaheen Baig, a trustee of the charity Open Door, which helps those who are not from privileged backgrounds to access drama school, agreed. She is a casting director whose extensive portfolio of work includes virtually every lauded drama of the last decade, from Peaky Blinders to Black Mirror, and a number of beloved British films, such as 28 Weeks Later, Brick Lane and Scrapper.“I think it’s getting worse,” she said. “If you look at the amount of public funding that’s been cut from the creative industries, if you’re a creative young person, where do you go?”She described the Television Workshop as “brilliant”, adding: “Without those key figures in someone’s life to push them and inspire them and nurture them, it’s really, really hard in this climate for people to do that for themselves.“Everybody’s stories are valid and there’s room for everybody, but everybody deserves the same level of support and encouragement.”She said representation was vital across the industry to tell stories that are more truthful, but, she said: “It shouldn’t be like this, it shouldn’t be such a fight.”Explore more on these topicsDrama and danceClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In his 2004 autobiography, titled Only the Strong Survive: Memoirs of a Soul Survivor, Butler gave credit to a teacher in the fifth grade at his elementary school inChicago. Her name was Ernestine Curry and she taught “maths, English, history, music, etiquette and how to box”.She also told her class of 11-year-olds about such great figures from Black history as Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831, the world heavyweight champion boxerJack Johnsonand the jazz composer and bandleaderDuke Ellington, while getting them to read the works of the historian WEB DuBois and the poet and novelist Countee Cullen. “Mrs Curry gave us a sense of pride and dignity that has carried me and many other of her students through life,” Butler said.View image in fullscreenJerry Butler, centre, with members of the Impressions, Curtis Mayfield, left, and Fred Cash, backstage at the Apollo theatre, New York City, circa 1965.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesIn later life Butler went into politics. He took a master’s degree in political science and became a commissioner for Cook County, whose county seat is Chicago, serving on the 17-member board from 1985 to 2018.His place in the affection of soul fans was retained long after the end of his recording career. When Bruce Springsteen releaseda collection of cover versionsof soul classics in 2022, he included two of Butler’s best known songs:Only the Strong Survive, which gave the album its title, andHey, Western Union Man,.Butler was born in Sunflower County,Mississippi, where his parents picked cotton as sharecroppers. He was aged three when the family became part of the Great Migration, moving to Chicago. His father, Jerry Sr, worked two jobs to feed the family, for the city’s sanitation and streets department and for the Illinois Central Railroad. His mother, Arvelia (nee Agnew), took her children – two girls and two boys – to worship and sing at the Church of God in Christ.Every Sunday morning they listened to the three-hour sermons of the Rev Annie Bell Mayfield, whose grandsonCurtiswas a contemporary and became a friend. Butler was soon joining Annie Bell Mayfield’s Travelling Souls Spiritualist gospel caravan, touring throughout the US in his school holidays as a member of a group called the Northern Jubilee Singers and experiencing at first hand the sounds of the great gospel groups of the time, including the Blind Boys of Alabama and the Soul Stirrers, with Sam Cooke.Butler was 14 when his father died suddenly of a heart attack, forcing him to begin taking night jobs in factories to help the family’s finances while attending Washburne Trade School, where he trained to become a chef.View image in fullscreenJerry Butler performing during a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert honouring Aretha Franklin in Cleveland, Ohio, 2011.Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty ImagesIt was seeing Nat King Cole in a Chicago nightclub that showed the teenaged Butler the kind of performer he aspired to be. In 1956 he stopped going to church and started singing with his first R&B group, a quartet called the Quails. After they split up, he and Mayfield got together to form a group that became the Impressions.For their first single, released on a local label, Butler and two of the other members of the group, Richard and Arthur Brooks, wrote a ballad called For Your Precious Love. Its blend of doo-wop cadences, gospel harmonies and Butler’s pleading vocal not only gave them a Top 20 hit but induced the audience at the Apollo in Harlem to call the young men back for three encores of the same song.Two years later, having been persuaded by the record company to pursue a solo career, Butler achieved even greater success – No 1 in the R&B chart, No 7 in the pop chart – with the lovelornHe Will Break Your Heart, co-written with the record’s producer, Calvin Carter, and Mayfield, who also sang the distinctive high harmony part on the chorus.Mayfield and the Impressions would go on to greater things, but Butler’s subsequent career burned on an intermittent flame. He was the first to record the Henry Mancini-Johnny Mercer songMoon Riverin 1961, but saw it become a bigger hit forAndy Williams. A year later his version of Make It Easy on Yourself, byBurt BacharachandHal David, was also the first to be released. In 1964 his swooning duet withBetty EverettonGilbert Bécaud’sLet It Be Me, with an English lyric by Manny Curtis, reached the top five.In 1965 he and Otis Redding wroteI’ve Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now), a ballad that might have been the sequel to For Your Precious Love. It becameone of Redding’s early hitsand was covered by many other artists, accruing royalties that Butler claimed outstripped all his other earnings put together.In the late 60s he teamed up with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, the gifted and ambitious Philadelphia-based songwriters and producers, for a string of heavily arranged hits that included Hey, Western Union Man, Only the Strong Survive andMoody Woman, and several albums, such as The Iceman Cometh and Ice on Ice, whose titles exploited the nickname bestowed upon him many years earlier.He made frequent appearances as the host of oldies shows on television and served a term as the chairman of the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, a charity set up to provide belated support for black artists unfairly treated by the music business. In 1991 he and the four other original Impressions were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.His brother Billy, a singer and guitarist with whom Butler ran a workshop for young artists, died in 2015. His wife, Annette (nee Smith), whom he married in 1959 and who had been one of his backing singers, died in 2019. He is survived by their twin sons, Randall and Anthony, four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.Jerry Butler, singer and politician, born 8 December 1939; died 20 February 2025Explore more on these topicsSoulBruce SpringsteenPop and rockMississippiChicagoobituariesShareReuse this content"

He taught its intricacies on courses and wrote a definitive book on the subject, The Magic of Scagliola, which was published in 2016.David was born in Salisbury, Wiltshire, to an army officer, Basil Hayles, who was a descendant of Robert Walpole, British prime minister from 1721 to 1742, and Jean (nee Prior), sister of the Conservative politicianJim Prior.After attending Haileybury in Hertfordshire he arrived at theUniversity of Bristolin 1965 to study architecture, but dropped out to seek adventure, leaving for the hippy trail to India.On returning toBristolhe stood in the 1971 city council elections as the first and only candidate for the Bristol Dwarf party on a pro-environment, pro-cycling and anti-car manifesto, also arguing for the legalisation of cannabis.After trying his hand at various trades and ventures, including snake-catching and plumbing, in 1978 he moved into decorative plastering and founded Hayles & Howe, a Bristol-based company. The firm grew over the years and opened a workshop in Baltimore in the US.A heart attack allied to serious brain damage forced him to step down from running Hayles & Howe in 1999, but as soon as he was able he resumed his eclectic lifestyle, living in Oxford in New York state with his second wife, Angelique Bakaylar, whom he married in 2004. David built their geodesic domed house using old beer cans and tyres, while continuing to teach and undertake plastering restoration jobs.In 2018, after surviving throat cancer and the removal of his voice box, he went on a 20,000 mile solo round-the-world bike ride that began at the Reform Club in London, taking a year and a half to complete.At the age of 76 he then set himself another challenge – to cycle from top to bottom of the American continent, starting in Alaska. He had to return home three times to recover from accidents, and his adventures finally ran out in La Paz, Bolivia, where he died.A man with many eccentricities, he was entertaining company and had a store of outlandish stories, many of which were related in his 2016 autobiography, Confessions of an Ornamental Plasterer. Life was never dull with him around.He is survived by Angelique and by two sons, Olly and Jim, from his first marriage to Caroline (nee Grice), which ended in divorce.Explore more on these topicsArt and designOther livesInterior designCyclingInteriorsUniversity of BristolBristolCraftobituariesShareReuse this content"

And why not. But a striking aspect ofCopper Bottom, a new house by the architect Adrian James, is that, apart from being in the most literal sense coloured green, it gives little sense of its sustainability. It looks at first sight like a carefree exploration of built form – a WTF YOLO 3D doodle; a fun folly conceived with no particular thought for the environment.James once worked for the brilliantly original British postmodernistJohn Outram, since when he has been ploughing his own distinctive furrow in Oxford. He andhis practicedesign housing, commercial and education buildings, single private houses, ayoga studio. Nearly 30 years ago he announced himself with a full-bodied, barrel-vaultedThameside housein the city, with notes of ancient Egypt and warehouse construction, for himself and his wife, Sarah. Now, having raised a family there, they have built Copper Bottom for the next stage of their lives. It sits on the very edge of the city (a 15-minute bike ride from the centre), just where a lush part of Oxford’s green belt starts, with views back to the dreaming spires.The joints and tricky angles are beautifully sharp and clean: in other hands they could have been an abominationThe exterior of the house is, windows apart, almost all clad in copper, as if the roof had descended to the ground and engulfed the walls. It is metallic origami, angled and faceted, but punchy as well as papery – an object apparently all of one substance like a meteorite or a pachyderm. It is very much sui generis, with no obvious reference to the work of other architects. James himself, if pushed to name inspirations, suggests the sculptural buildings of the modernist Marcel Breuer, or the art of Henry Moore. He wants, he says, to “explore dynamic forms for the way they conjure movement and action and imbue a building with esprit”.View image in fullscreenThe solar-panelled roof.Photograph: Fisher StudiosYet, with 37 solar panels, an air-source heat pump, timber structure, triple-glazing and generous insulation, the house generates more energy than it consumes. More than that, it will pay back the carbon debt incurred by its construction after 10 to 15 years, and from then on it will continue to generate surplus power that can be returned to the national grid. In other words, the world’s climate will be (very fractionally) better off than it would be if the house had not been built at all. The longer it stands, the better.There is a charging point for electric cars, powered by the solar panels and the heat pump. There is air conditioning, which doesn’t sound so green, but is necessary, says James, to future-proof the house against rising temperatures. It’s used only in hot weather, when the solar panels are at their most productive. As for the copper, a metal sometimes abhorred for the energy and extraction involved in its production, it is here all recycled from scrap. It is at once long-lasting (it barely corrodes) and recyclable, and in any case a very thin layer – less than 1mm deep – fixed to plywood sheets. Its total mass, in other words, is a small part of the building’s.View image in fullscreenCopper Bottom’s copper exterior ‘helps the house sit unexpectedly well in its semi-rural surroundings’.Photograph: Fisher StudiosThere is also logic to the design. The underlying shape is a simple cuboid, which is efficient both in terms of construction and conserving energy. The projections and recessions of the copper wrapping serve to shade the interior from the high summer sun (and so help to stop it overheating), while allowing warming rays to enter at a lower angle in winter. James compares this outer layer to a helmet, whether a cyclist’s or a Greek warrior’s, with the complex shapes here being used to deflect sunshine rather than blows to the head.The interior is calm and plain, with big windows and the main rooms facing the best views and the best light. Lesser spaces, such as bathrooms and a utility room, are arranged on the other, north-west-facing side. A double-height space rises through the middle, with a straight stair behind a freestanding wall in purplish-brown brick, which brings a bit of earthy warmth to the mostly white-walled spaces. There are few frills; it’s a different experience from the excitement of the exterior.View image in fullscreenCopper Bottom’s interior.Photograph: Fisher StudiosThe house is not, after all, extravagant, but a clever mixture of the standard and the bespoke. James estimates that the environmental design added about 5% to the typical cost of house of this type, and the copper wrap another 5%, which he believes are investments that will pay back in the end. The framework for the complex shapes is made with the help of mass-produced roof trusses, here fixed to the walls, at 90 degrees to their usual position.Much of the success of the building relies on the skill of the metalworkersCotswold Metal Roofing, with whom James first worked three decades ago on a copper-domed office behind his first house. The joints and tricky angles are beautifully sharp and clean: in other hands they could have been an abomination. Other details play their part – the copper, for example, has been patinated to achieve a less bluish green than it would naturally have. It’s more a pale malachite, which helps the house sit unexpectedly well in its semi-rural surroundings.James calls the house a “fusion of function and expression”. It shows a way in which architectural enjoyment and sustainability can go together. Meanwhile, although you can’t see its timber construction nor, except from above, the solar panels, they’re still there, doing their job.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe ObserverHousingHomesreviewsShareReuse this content"

He was charming and affable, almost teddy bear-ish. He was also utterly ruthless. When it came to deciding which photographs were worthy of a prize, he went through the selection swiftly – no, no, yes, no – without hesitation or doubt. His eye was impeccable.Has he always known what makes a good photograph? “Oh yes,” says Parr. “Right from the beginning. Total conviction. I knew I would be a photographer from the age of 13, 14, and I knew what was good even then. I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.”We are in his agent’s office, a small upstairs flat on a market street in east London. Parr owns the building, and this room used to be packed with his work as well as Parr-type things: his collections of Saddam Hussein watches, Soviet-space-dog ephemera, Spice Girls merch. He was obsessed with gathering all sorts of daft stuff, but he’s stopped now to concentrate solely on his work. Though as he says, “photography is a form of collecting.”View image in fullscreen‘I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.’ Photo from The Last Resort, 1983-85.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis obsession now is theMartin Parr Foundation, headquartered in Bristol, which he established in 2017 and which is where all of his photos have been moved to (along with the watches, space dogs and Spiceys). The foundation is a collection of documentary photography of the British Isles, his own and other people’s. Alongside maintaining Parr’s huge archive, it buys work by lesser-known photographers, gives bursaries to those who are just starting out, has a library and gallery, curates shows, and is Parr’s legacy, what he’s most proud of. He’s 72, is in cancer recovery and is conscious of his age. “Hopefully it will be of some benefit,” he says. “I’m not going to say I’m saving the world. I never expect photography to change anything.” Perhaps not, but the Foundation is clearly a good thing: thewebsiteis great and the current show, featuringSiân Davey’sphotos of family life, is excellent.“Have you been to visit it?” he asks. I haven’t. He looks a bit miffed. He’s quick to pick up on things he thinks I’ve missed about what he does. When we go for a coffee after the interview, he says, almost triumphantly, “You just missed me taking a photo with my phone, of that wall!”In my defence, there is so much of Parr’s work to see that you could spend your whole life looking at his photographs. He’s been working since the 1980s, has had well over 80 exhibitions all over the world, has published more than 145 photography books. He is madly prolific, with an archive that’s endlessly recategorisable. “If you want me to do a book on dogs, no problem,” he says. “I can come up with 100 pictures straight away. Or cigarettes. I’ve just done a book calledNo Smoking, using my archive, edited by mygalleryhere in London.”Is he constantly thinking about work?“More or less, yes. I’m either thinking about things I haven’t shot, or things I’ve done. What’s got to be done. What can I do next? Where can I go?”View image in fullscreen‘Life is funny. I try to bring that into the images.’ The Leaning Tower of Pisa, 1990.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHow would he define his style? “It’s the palette of bright colours, and getting in close to your subject matter. The colour helps to take it one step away from reality. I guess that’s a part of my, erm… ‘vision’ sounds a bit pretentious. And humour. Life is funny. I try to bring that into the images.”His pictures are balanced between documentary, satire and commentary, serious stuff disguised as entertainment, turning the familiar into something alien, making you look harder. And they’re highly populated: he loves taking pictures of people. When he’s out and about, he approaches anyone he likes the look of – “a bit of flattery is a very good entrée” – and then asks them not to smile. “People always want to, but when I’m doing a portrait I want to show some sense of dignity and what they’re in front of, their relationship to that.” Or he just takes a shot in the moment. He uses a digital camera and if someone gets upset with him, he shows them the photograph and deletes it, no fuss.He resists defining his work but has said, “I create fiction out of reality.” What does that mean? “It’s the subjective nature of photography. The only thing that matters is your relationship to the subject. That’s what you’re in control of. It’s all true, but it’s my truth. My personal truth.”His star was launched in 1986 with his showThe Last Resort, a series of pictures he took between 1983 and 1985 of people enjoying themselves at New Brighton, a litter-strewn seaside resort near Liverpool. “It’s still the work I’m most famous for. We keep republishing. It keeps selling.” In 1986 though, it caused some controversy. Some thought Parr’s photos were condescending, though everyone in the photos seemed to be having a most excellent time.“A lot of people don’t like my work,” he says. “I never quite understand what it is. I suppose they don’t like the directness. They’re blaming me for seeing shabby conditions. WithThe Last Resort, we showed the work in Liverpool in ’86, and no one mentioned this idea of it being exploitative or cynical. But when it went to the Serpentine, that’s when that all happened. People in the south-east, they don’t know what it’s like in Liverpool, because they’ve never been.”View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people don’t like my work… They’re blaming me for seeing shabby conditions.’ New Brighton, 1984.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThere was also snobbery, back then, about whether a serious photographer should shoot in colour, as opposed to tasteful monochrome. Plenty of older photographers were outraged by this, as we see in a new documentary,IAm Martin Parr, directed byLee Shulman, which came out this month. Shulman takes Parr back to the scenes of many of his best known works, including New Brighton. “Much less litter,” he says. “It’s been gentrified.”He also returns to Hebden Bridge, where he took his first-ever serious set of photographs,The Non-Conformists. These are not quite what you’d expect from Parr: they’re centred around the village’s chapels and are more traditionally observational, quieter, with less movement, shot in black-and-white. He and his wife, Susie, stayed in Hebden from 1975 to 1980 and became embedded in the community, especially with a particular Methodist chapel where the congregation was just seven farmers. Parr went to all of their farms and took photographs. Susie taught at the Sunday school, despite being an atheist (“It always tickles me, that,” says Parr).“The thing that was weird,” he says, “was they thought we were going to be there for life, and then we moved. One guy, Stanley Greenwood, got upset because he thought we should have stayed.”Is that the nature of the job?“Yes, it happens all the time, more especially with films. You have such an intense relationship, they give a lot to accommodate you, and then you’re gone. And you leave a void in their lives.”Parr was bornin 1952 and grew up in Surrey with his parents and sister, who was seven years younger than him. It was a quiet life – “boring”, he says, though at the time he didn’t know – with weekends spent with his parents, who were keen birdwatchers. “I got taken to Hersham Sewage Works most Saturdays, to see the migratory birds.”View image in fullscreenThe first photograph taken by Martin Parr, of his father on a frozen stream, in 1963.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosIn the summers he’d go to Yorkshire to stay with his grandparents, where he discovered both photography (his grandpa taught him how to use a camera) and community. He now thinks that his work in Hebden Bridge was partly about recapturing “a lost childhood”, searching out the social cohesion he found so appealing in Yorkshire, “so strong, and very charming. Everyone knew each other, when you’d go down the shops, people would say hello. We didn’t have that in Surrey.” His family never ate out or went to a seaside resort, just “places likePagham Harbour, looking for wader birds.” Today, he notes, resorts and beaches are a constant in his working life.At Surbiton County Grammar school his French teacher deemed him “utterly lazy and inattentive” (now the title of hisautobiography, out in September). Though, according to Parr, his lack of application shaped his life for the better, through two events. The first was him failing his History and English A-levels, which meant that out of the three art colleges he’d applied to, he only qualified for Manchester Poly. It was like a door opening: he met Susie (they later had a daughter,Ellen) and became lifelong friends with other photographers, includingDaniel Meadowsand the lateBrian Griffin. “I often reflect on this, when I think back on my life,” he says. “What would have happened if I hadn’t gone to Manchester?”The other significant academic failure was when he flunked a first-year theory exam and should have been kicked out, but his tutor, Alan Murgatroyd, argued to keep him on the course. When Parr did a big show in Manchester five years ago, he invited Murgatroyd toopen it.Murgatroyd knew what he was talking about: ever since he graduated, Parr has motored through an outstanding career. The amount of books with his name on might seem as though he’s casual about what he does, but that would be wrong: he’s an expert on photography books and he spends a long time working on a subject, several years in many cases. Though he’s speeded up recently: he was diagnosed withmyeloma, a type of bone-marrow cancer, in 2021, which, as he says, has “accelerated things”, and made him want to do more work, more quickly. He’s now in remission (he takes chemotherapy tablets), but it affects his back, and he uses a rollator – a frame on wheels – if he has to walk for a long time. “The rollator makes me less threatening, I think, when I approach people,” he says. “They think, poor guy, he’s disabled.” He’s got a disabled parking badge now, which he loves. “I should put it on my CV: can park anywhere.”Time is running out, and there’s still so much to do! His biography, more shows. He does the occasional fashion shoot (a collection of his fashion photos came out last year calledFashion Faux Parr– he’s always been great with titles), and this summer he’s booked to go to Cheltenham, as well as a week’s Mediterranean cruise and also an airshow. “I’ve never been to an airshow”, he says. “Can you believe it! Everyone looks a bit weird when they’re all looking up, I don’t understand why I haven’t done it before…“Summer is my big shooting moment. Everything’s happening. People are out and about. We’re good at all that in this country, hobbies and agricultural shows and festivals. We excel at it.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re good at all that in this country, hobbies and shows and festivals.’ West Midlands, celebration of the Coronation of King Charles III, 2023.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThere are moments he feels he missed. He’s lived in Bristol since 1987, but didn’t take pictures there for years. “And I wish I’d shot more in the 80s. The miners’ strike, I didn’t even touch, I thought, ‘Oh, someone else is doing all that.’ Then I started collecting miners’ strike ephemera – plates, watches – and we did a show on the strike at the Foundation, featuring other people who covered it, likeJohn Sturrockand John Harris. John Harris did the picture ofthe policeman on the horse,which is now how we remember the miners’ strike. That really demonstrates what photography can do.”Parr’s politics are more hidden than others, and he’s loth to discuss them, but you get a sense of them in his 80s seriesThe Cost of Livingand later,Think of England. “We all hated Thatcher,” he says now, mildly. Over the years, he’s examined the British establishment in detail, covering Harrow and Christ’s Hospital public schools, the army, the City of London’s livery companies. In 2015 he completed a whole series on Oxford university, but they wouldn’t let him photograph the boat-burning at the end of the summer rowing competition. “It’s a secret life,” he says. “And it’s become more secretive.” He was appointed a CBE in 2021, and asked to go to one of the late Queen’s garden parties. He took a small camera – “I looked up the rules, checked it was OK” – and took photos, but then the Palace said he couldn’t publish them. So he just shows the pictures during talks. “I say, ‘You’re looking at censored photos!’ It’s always quite a thrill.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s how I function: my relationship to Britain, through photography.’ Kids in New Brighton, from The Last Resort.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis politics are perhaps more recognised in France than here. Actually, his whole career is much bigger over there – “they love photography more, they buy prints, they review shows” – even though Brexit has made it hard to send his books there. He will say he hates Brexit, “but it’s bit difficult to know how to actually articulate that in photographs.”“In France,” he says, “a guy is singling out the politics of my work for a show inJeu de Paume. It’s going to be quite different. Not risky, but edgier than most of my big shows would be. It will be calledEarly Warning.”Is it about consumerism?“Well, we’re all too rich, and we all consume too much. As the Chinese middle class come online, they have all the demands that we’ve had: air conditioning, ovens, fridges, holidays. Ryanair’s just ordered 50 new jets. Since Covid, tourism has got even more crazy. No one is prepared to sacrifice their pleasures. I’m aware I’m contributing to it, of course: my air-mile record is pretty big, having flown to so many places. I’m a tourist as well.”Tourism is Parr’s subject and, to his detractors, his technique. But that is to do him a disservice: Parr’s approach to photography is far more serious and considered. It’s about the relationship between him and what he photographs – usually the UK – and getting that into the pictures. And it’s everything to him.“It’s what I do, it’s how I function,” he says. “My relationship to Britain, through photography. There’s many things I dislike about Britain. Then there’s all these other things – the hobbies, the fairs, the agricultural shows, the beaches, Radio 4, a cup of tea – those I love. Photographing it all is a form of therapy for me. It’s defined my life.”IAm Martin Parris in cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So what, asks Rhik Samadder, keeps her so grounded?Sun 23 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareEarly on in Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s career, an older, white actor advised she change her name to something easier to pronounce. She declined – a strong choice for a young actor. “I don’t think it’sthatstrong,” rebuts Mbatha-Raw. She likes her name. Besides, “it means ‘Our Pride’ in Zulu. To change that would be the antithesis of its meaning.”Mbatha-Raw is known for choosing roles that combine art and social advocacy. She’s won awards, been honoured with an MBE, appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency. People still mispronounce her name, though. The most extreme example she recalls was in Norway, when a host announced her from a piece of paper. “Gucci… Matthew… Ray? I was like, ‘I guess that’s me!’”I wonder if this says something about the west’s complacency regarding the achievements of those with ethnic roots elsewhere. Doesn’t middle England relate more easily to names that reflect their own? “I disagree,” she says. “I think it’s OK for people to be challenged. To reach outside their culture and know that’s not all there is.” Yes, but do they? “Well, you’ve got to give them the opportunity.” The answer brings me up short.We’re at a farmhouse table at a west London photography studio. When I walked in, Mbatha-Raw was wearing beads of jewellery and doing a fan dance with a pink tutu. She’s here to promote the second series ofSurface, the Apple TV thriller about a woman who suffers memory loss after an apparent suicide attempt. “I’d seen other amnesia stories, but always featuring a male protagonist, from a male point of view,” she says.View image in fullscreenScene stealer: playing a woman with memory loss in Surface.Surface, made byHello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon’s media company, offered Mbatha-Raw the opportunity to come on board as an executive producer.She relished being a bigger part of the process, from pitching to Apple to choosing the creative team and having a voice at script level.Surfaceinvestigates identity, trust and trauma. The first series, set in San Francisco, was measured and mysterious. The second series takes place in the UK – “darker, faster-paced, a bit grittier.”It also boasts a bigger cast includingJoely RichardsonandTara Fitzgerald, actors Mbatha-Raw looks up to. Of anyone working today, who does she most admire? “Cate Blanchett”, she says. “I love how she carries herself in the world.” Blanchett, a fellow UNHCR Goodwill ambassador, is widely respected for her elegance and range, splitting roles between stage and screen. Also, “I don’t know much about her personal life, which I like.”Mbatha-Rawhas never publicly discussed her private life (it’s unknown if she is currently in a relationship). “It’s a way to have longevity as an artist,” she explains. Her job is to take audiences on an imaginative journey through a character. The more they know about the actor, the less they believe. “If people have too many ideas about your world, it dilutes the work,” she says. It’s a purist view of the craft. “There’s thisMichaela Coelquote from a few years ago, about how it’s OK to disappear,” she goes on. “As an artist you need to refill the well, have something to say.” She remembers life before the internet and social media. “I’m thankful to have a perspective that isn’t just pushing yourself out there, simply for the sake of being present.”View image in fullscreen‘If people have too many ideas about your world, it dilutes the work’: Gugu Mbatha-Raw wears feather dress and jacket, bothprada.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverHer self-possession is admirable, but it comes with a certain reserve, a graceful front I’m not sure I’m allowed to see behind. I wonder if I should tease her, but it’s hard – she’s a Teflon mix of LA positivity and British politeness. She keeps a gratitude journal, which she combines with morning pages (a daily practice of stream-of-consciousness writing), and is given to exclaiming “Oh gosh!” like Ned Flanders. When someone sets down a plate of fresh-baked brownies on the table in front of us, she actually says “Holy moly!” I tell her she has head girl energy. “Well, Iwashead girl,” she says. Optimism is part of everything she does. Getting up at 4am to film on location in the freezing cold necessitates faith in a larger goal. “You have to believe in things you can’t yet see.”Mbatha-Raw was bornin the small town of Witney in Oxfordshire in 1983, to a white mother, Anne, a nurse, and a black South African father, Patrick, a physician. Her parents met at the Churchill Hospital, a cancer centre, and divorced when she was around three. They remain active presences in her life. Her mother gave her confidence and work ethic, she says, and supported every interest, from saxophone to ballet. An only child, she was already itching to begin the life of a professional artist. “I would’ve moved to London at age 12,” she says, “if she’d let me.”Her father, an activist who fled apartheid, gifted her political awareness. She remembers dinner table conversations that gave her a global perspective, opening up questions about justice and equality. “As my dad always said, in South Africa, you’re politicised at birth. It’s not a luxury, or a choice.” She has family in Johannesburg. Visiting the country as an adult deepened her understanding of Britain’s role in world history. “Culturally, that’s something we’re still figuring out.”As an adolescent, painting was her passion. During theYBAyears she was inspired by Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, and by the fleshy, psychologically acute portraits of Jenny Saville. But theatre ultimately brought her more out of herself. She started attending the National Youth Music Theatre and was accepted into Rada, which she started two weeks after 9/11.View image in fullscreenBright eyed: on The Morning Show with Bel Powley.Photograph: Apple TV+She made her name in a 2009 production ofHamletopposite Jude Law, followed by the landmark 2013 filmBelle. Two years later she was nominated for anEvening Standardaward for her performance in Jess Swale’s playNell Gwyn, about an orange seller who rose socially to become the mistress of Charles II. She gained a new level of visibility starring inSan Junipero, the queer, Emmy-winning episode ofBlack Mirror. In 2017 the Queen awarded her an MBE for services to drama.Social change happens incrementally, but there are people and moments that drive it.Belle, the 2013 film in which Mbatha-Raw played mixed-race aristocrat Lady Dido Elizabeth Belle, was one. Based on a true story, it helped overturn staid assumptions of what period drama looked like. WithoutBelle, there might not have been aBridgerton, a show she credits with lasting influence in her industry, particularly the hiring of non-white crew members on sets. “There’s a generation of runners and assistants onBridgertonwho are coming up from there, moving onwards.”Diversity is a cause she’s passionate about. While her achievements are frequently held up as a success story, representation is only one aspect of it. “You could go, ‘Oh [the industry has been] fixed because there’s this person in front of the camera’,” she says. “But actually behind the camera is no different than it’s been for years.” In the last two or three years she’s noticed a positive shift, she says, at least in the UK. She now uses her executive role to widen opportunity when staffing crews, as a condition of her involvement. The last two sets she’s worked on have been “by far the most diverse of my whole career, and that’s not by accident”.I ask if she experienced racism growing up in a small town in the 80s. She wasn’t really aware of racism, she says. This stuns me. “I don’t know if I was living in a post-racial bubble of ignorance, or if that was just my experience,” she shrugs.When she was a little older, she learned more about her father’s experiences under apartheid.View image in fullscreen‘If something isn’t feeling good, I’m OK to say it right away’: top, skirt, earrings, cuffs and sandals all Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello,ysl.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverWorking in America in her mid-20s was another turning point. The media there is far more sharply tuned to race, and she observed people keen to assign labels, sometimes farcically. An early experience was ppromoting JJ Abrams’s espionage dramaUndercoversin 2010. She recalls being introduced by a host, who announced, “This is the first show to feature two African-American leads sinceThe Cosby Show!” The only problem being: “I’m biracial British, and my co-star was German-Ghanaian.”She’s since worked with the biggest names in showbusiness, including Oprah Winfrey, who was supportive ofBelle, and whom she later acted alongside in Ava DuVernay’sA Wrinkle in Time. The last time they met was for Edward Enninful’s finalVoguecover, which showcased 40 stars including Serena Williams, Naomi Campbell and Laverne Cox, over the strapline “Legendary!” It was surreal, she says. “To be in a room with somebody like Jane Fond…” she catches herself. “With Jane Fonda! There’s nobody like Jane Fonda.”It is an extraordinary cover: a latter-day, femaleSergeant Pepper. “Everyone thought it was Photoshopped! With AI and CGI, no one believes we were all in one place.” The day may have been a blur, but something stayed with her. “I was in awe of the elders. The mature women in the room, and that idea of longevity that I aspire to.”Longevity is hard for anyone, and there is extra pressure on people of colour. I ask about Will Smith, her co-star onConcussion. She has nothing but praise for his generosity, like the occasion she mentioned she no longer had time for painting. “The next day, my trailer was filled with paints and an easel, in classic Will Smith style.”During the pandemic Mbatha-Raw was locked down in her Los Angeles apartment. Turning out cupboards in boredom, she found the unused art materials Smith had given her. She began painting portraits from photographs, as a way of connecting with family who weren’t there. “To be able to concentrate on somebody’s face made me feel close to them.” Painting every day, and watching the news, she saw America’s racial divisions play out. At the most painful collective moment of 2020, she painted portraits of George Floyd andBreonna Taylor, black citizens killed by the police. “It became a way to metabolise what was going on.” She later auctioned the pieces to raise money forEqual Justice Initiative,The Bail Project,M4BLandBlack Lives Matter.Life is short, she says as we finish. “You hope people appreciate what you’re trying to do, but you can’t get hung up on it.” There’s that self-possession again. It feels innate, but Mbatha-Raw insists it’s something she’s worked on over time. So what’s been the key to her confidence? It boils down to trusting one’s intuition. “If something isn’t feeling good, I’m OK to say it right away, rather than fester,” she reflects. “Your gut is always trying to tell you something.”After years living out of a suitcase, she’s now settled back in Oxfordshire. Though settled may be the wrong word. We’ll see her leading upcomingDoctor Whospin-off,The War Between the Land and the Sea. She’s about to fly to the Caribbean for two months to completeInheritance, a Sky Original which addresses legacies of slavery and colonialism. Filmed between Bristol and Jamaica, the show will tackle the theme of slavery reparations, and how we measure the harms of the past. “It’s going to be a conversation provoker; and I’m excited for the conversation.” She’s where she wants to be, sailing right into the storms that rage loudest. Or maybe she’s making her own weather.How does she switch off? More often than not, watching nature documentaries. “Something where there’s no acting,” she says, pondering the appeal. “That fish is just being itself. Just swimming in the ocean. That’s relaxing to me.”Surface season 2 is streaming on Apple TV+Fashion editor Jo Jones; hair by James Catalano at The Wall Group using Amika; makeup by Tania Grier using Prada Beauty;fashion assistant Sam Deaman; photographer’s assistants Ethan Humphries and Sophie PhillipsExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tip the flour into a bowl and whisk in the eggs until everything is nice and smooth. Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously until you are certain there are no lumps. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.Carefully peel the squash, as the skin can be quite thick and cumbersome to remove. Cut the peeled squash in half (if you’re using a whole one) and scoop out the seeds. Cut the flesh into chunky cubes about 2½-5cm. Scatter the squash out over a roasting tin about 30cm x 25cm. Trickle over the olive oil, sprinkle over the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, and season with salt and pepper. Tumble everything together. Roast the squash for 25-35 minutes, or until it has taken on a little colour and is pretty much tender.Meanwhile, quarter and core the apples, then cut each quarter in two, giving 16 wedges altogether. Peel and cut the black pudding into bite-sized chunks.Take the squash out of the oven and add the apples, black pudding, rosemary and sage. Turn it all together, turn up the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7 and return the tray to the centre of the oven for another 8-10 minutes.Carefully remove the tray from the oven, and working quickly, turn the squash, apples and black pudding once more, using a fork to tease some of the ingredients apart, should they need it. Pour in the batter then set the tin straight back in the oven. Cook for 25-30 minutes, until the batter is puffed up and golden.

This recipe showcases brill’s lovely meaty texture alongside the silky delicate texture of braised leeks, while lemon and thyme do their thing in the background.It’s delicious served alongside a celeriac or potato mash, or simply with good crusty bread for mopping up all the buttery juices.Serves 4leeks6 mediumunsalted butter25gvegetable stock200mlbay leaves2, fresh if you can get themunwaxed lemonzest of 1thyme8-10 sprigsflaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepperbrill fillet4 x 200g piecesolive oil2 tbsp of your bestPreheat the oven to 190C fan/gas mark 6-6½.Trim the leeks but leave them whole, then wash them as best you can by letting cold water run down into their tops and giving them a good old shake. If there is any earth or grit in there, you want to try to get it out. Now cut each leek in half.Arrange the leeks in a suitably sized roasting tin and dot over the butter. Add the vegetable stock, bay leaves, lemon zest and thyme sprigs, and season well with salt and pepper. Use a large sheet of kitchen foil to cover the leeks, making sure you crimp the edges well to seal in all the steam. Pop the dish in the oven and bake the leeks for 35-40 minutes, until they are nice and tender.Season the brill with salt and pepper and lay the pieces down on top of the leeks.Cover the leeks and fish with the foil and return to the oven for a further 10-12 minutes. The exact cooking time will depend on how thick the pieces of fish are. To check, insert the tip of a knife into the fish – the flakes should part with ease and appear nice and glossy.When you’re happy that the fish is cooked just right, squeeze over the lemon juice and trickle over the olive oil. Bring the whole dish to the table and tuck in.Salt cod dauphinoiseView image in fullscreenSalt cod dauphinoise. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverSalt cod has a unique flavour. It’s incredibly savoury and adds a lot of depth and character (in the same way salted anchovies do) to what is a fairly classic dauphinoise recipe. Sometimes I replace half the potatoes with thinly sliced celeriac and pep things up with a generous pinch of dried chilli flakes. Either way, this is a delicious all-in-one pan supper, and just the thing for a cold winter’s night. You’ll need to start this recipe two days ahead.Serves 4-6salt cod250g, sustainably sourcedpotatoes1kg, white floury, such as desiree or maris piperonion1 medium, thinly slicedgarlic4 cloves, peeled and thinly slicedmarjoram2 tbsp, choppedrosemary1 sprig, leaves stripped and choppedsea salt and freshly ground black pepperwhole milk200mldouble cream300mlI like to give the salt fish plenty of time to soak. So, 48 hours before you intend to make the recipe, take the salt cod, place it in a large bowl and cover with plenty of fresh cold water. Pop it in the fridge and leave the fish to soak, changing the water a couple of times during this period. After 48 hours it should be ready to use.Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4.Cut the fish into thin 1-2cm pieces, trimming away any skin and little bones you might come across.Peel and slice the potatoes thinly into 2-3mm rounds and give them a rinse in plenty of cold water. Drain the potatoes and place the slices in a large bowl with the sliced onions, slivered garlic, marjoram and rosemary, and plenty of black pepper (it may not need salt as the fish will bring this to the mix). Pour over the milk and cream and give everything a really good mix.Arrange a nice neat layer of overlapping potatoes and onions in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, about 20-25cm square and 5cm deep. Scatter over some of the sliced fish, then make a second layer of overlapping potatoes and onions. Continue until you have used up the fish, finishing with a layer of potato on top. Pour over all the remaining herby cream from the bowl and let it trickle down through the layers.Place the dish in the middle of the hot oven (you can place it on a baking tray to avoid cream bubbling on to the oven floor) and bake for 1-1½ hours, pressing the potatoes down firmly once or twice during cooking using a spatula, until the potatoes are tender, the top layer is golden and the sauce is bubbling. If the top is looking like it’s getting too dark at any point, lay a piece of parchment or foil over the top.Remove the dish from the oven and allow it time to settle. It will be much better, and still nice and hot, after 20 minutes of sitting.Lamb chops with chickpeas, apricots and saffronView image in fullscreenLamb chops with chickpeas, apricots and saffron. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThere’s so much flavour to be found in good lamb chops, but it’s worth looking for nice thick ones, with a touch of fat on them, as they’ll be even better. If you’re not a big fan of saffron, you can leave it out, or replace it with 1-2 teaspoons of cracked, toasted coriander seeds.In the autumn, I like to do something very similar with pork chops. I swap the chickpeas for butter beans and the chewy apricots for rich, dark prunes. Everything else stays more or less the same.Serves 4chickpeas1 x 700g jar (I like Bold Bean Co)red onions1 medium or 2 smaller, peeled, halved and slicedgarlic4 cloves, thinly slicedchilli flakes½ tspdried apricots175g, unsulphuredsaffron1 pinchcider vinegar½ tbsprosemary2 sprigs, leaves torn from the stemssmoked paprika½ tspolive oil3 tbspsea salt and freshly ground black pepperlamb chops8Preheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7.Drain the chickpeas and place them in a large mixing bowl with the sliced onions, garlic, chilli, apricots, saffron, vinegar, rosemary, smoked paprika and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, then tumble everything together to combine.Scatter the chickpeas, onions and apricots across a large roasting tray measuring about 35cm x 25cm.Give the tray a little shake to even everything out then pop it into the middle of the hot oven for 15 minutes to roast.Meanwhile, take the lamb chops out of the fridge and arrange them over a plate or board. Drizzle them with the remaining olive oil and then season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Massage the seasoning and oil into the chops.Carefully remove the tray from the oven and, using a spatula, turn the onions and chickpeas several times. Arrange the lamb chops in a single layer over the top and return the tray to the oven.Roast the chops for 10 minutes then open the oven, turn the lamb chops over and give them another 8-10 minutes. Ideally the lamb chops should begin to crisp slightly round their edges and remain a little pink within.When the chops are ready, remove the tray from the oven and cover loosely with foil or parchment. Let everything rest for 6-8 minutes before bringing to the table.One-pan buttery chicken curryView image in fullscreenOne-pan buttery chicken curry. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverI prefer buying a whole chicken for this recipe and portioning it up myself. It’s easy to do at home, or a friendly butcher should do this for you. Each breast gets halved, and the legs get split into the drumsticks and thighs. The wings can go into the curry just as they are, or you can freeze them for another day. Alternatively, chicken thighs alone will be excellent too. And if you’re keen on game, this recipe works superbly with pheasant as well.Serves 4cardamom pods6cumin seeds½ tbspcoriander seeds½ tbspcinnamon stick2-3cmfennel seeds2 tspfenugreek seeds2 tspblack peppercorns2 tspfree-range or organic chicken1, jointed into 8 pieces, or 8 good-sized chicken thighsbutter50g, meltedturmeric1 tspgaram masala2 tspblack onion seeds2 tspsea saltonions2, finely dicedgarlic4 cloves, thinly slicedginger1 thumb-sized piece, peeled and very thinly slicedmedium-hot chillies2, dried or freshbay leaves4curry leaves8-10hot chicken or vegetable stock600mlPreheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7.Take a large, heavy roasting tray or ovenproof dish. Scatter in the cardamom pods, cumin and coriander seeds, cinnamon stick, fennel seeds, fenugreek seeds and peppercorns and pop the dish in the oven. Toast the spices for about 5 minutes.Tip the toasted spices into a pestle and mortar or spice mill and grind to a relatively fine texture. You can discard the papery cardamom husk if you like.Place the chicken pieces into a mixing bowl. Pour over the melted butter and scatter over the warm, ground spices. Sprinkle in the turmeric, garam masala, black onion seeds and sea salt then tumble the chicken through the spices and butter to coat.Tip the spiced chicken portions (and all the buttery spices) out into the roasting tin. I like to organise the chicken pieces so they’re all skin side up, and make sure there aren’t too many spices sticking to the skin itself, or they could burn.Pop the tray back into the middle of the hot oven and bake for 18-20 minutes or until the chicken is lovely and golden.Now add the diced onions to the roasting tray, along with the sliced garlic, ginger, chillies, bay leaves and curry leaves. Use tongs to stir the onions into the chicken juices and rearrange the chicken so it’s sitting over the onions.Turn down the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Pour in the stock or water and give the dish a gentle shake to settle everything down. Pop the tray into the oven and cook uncovered for 45-50 minutes, basting the chicken with the buttery juice once or twice.Carefully take the tray out of the oven and taste the sauce. It may need a touch of salt. You can either transfer the chicken to a large serving platter and spoon round the onions and sauce or simply bring the whole tray to the table, just the way it is.Serve with rice and naan bread for mopping up the sauce.Orange, coriander seed and honey polenta cakeView image in fullscreenOrange, coriander seed and honey polenta cake. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-WilsonPhotograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverHere’s a trio I never seem to tire of: orange, honey and coriander seed. They were made for each other. You may not have thought of using coriander seed in a cake, but it’s something I’ve done many times before. On this occasion I thought I’d make a gluten-free version, using ground almonds and polenta instead of spelt flour.The polenta gives the cake a really interesting texture and the ground almonds keep it nice and moist.Serves 6-9unsalted butter200g, softenedcaster sugar225gcoriander seeds1 tbsp, toasted and coarsely crushedorange1 large, finely zested and juicedeggs3 largeground almonds225gfine polenta125gbaking powder1 tspsea salta good pinchrunny honey75gPreheat the oven to 150C fan/gas mark 3½. Grease and line a 23cm tray or springform cake tin (I used a square one, but a round one will be fine too).Beat the soft butter, caster sugar, half the crushed coriander and the orange zest and juice together until pale and light. You can do this by hand, but it’s somewhat easier in a stand mixer or with an electric whisk.Beat in the eggs one at a time. If the mixture begins to split, add a spoonful of ground almonds before you work in the next egg. Once the eggs are in continue to mix for 2-3 minutes.Combine the ground almonds with the fine polenta, baking powder and salt, and fold this mixture into the creamed butter and sugar nice and gently.Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and level it off roughly. Scatter over the remaining crushed coriander seeds and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until it is set.While the cake is still hot, prick its surface here and there with a toothpick or similar, then trickle over the runny honey. Let it soak into the cake as it cools.This cake will keep for several days in a tin.Gill Meller is a chef and food writer.

She has arrived first at Food for Friends, the oldest vegetarian restaurant in the city, and there is something almost mythical in seeing the pioneering Green MP in its window seat, facing the Lanes, framed by trailing foliage. She has been coming here for as long as she can remember, she says – the restaurant opened in 1981 and used to have folk queuing around the block. She recommends the blueberry and ginger “nojito”, orders the Thai noodle salad and crispy tofu, and half apologises for still being “a vegetarian on the road to veganism” without quite yet arriving at that destination.It’s nine months since Lucas stepped down after 14 years in parliament as her party’s first and, in that time, only MP. I sense that she is still getting used to this kind of thing – leisurely lunches on a weekday, without somewhere to dash off to. She is, rightly, adamant that she has not retired. Far from it: she remains a tireless activist on the issues she cares about – the environment and the climate crisis, and Britain’s return to Europe (among several other patron and ambassador roles she is co-president of the European Movement with the former attorney general Dominic Grieve). She is writing a children’s book, and has an acclaimed adult one already out – calledAnother England, and one reason for our lunch. It’s about the idea of England, and “how to reclaim our national story”.She talks animatedly about the joys of her new home near the Seven Sisters cliffs, along the coast at Seaford, where she walks her labrador puppy on the beach – but she resists my suggestion that relief must be her overriding emotion after leaving parliament.“I’m finding it much harder to adapt than I thought I would,” she says. “On the one hand, it is liberating not to have to haul yourself up to Westminster and spend hours and hours in the chamber trying to get speaking time, and then not getting seen by the speaker. But I suppose inevitably you miss the platform, which is an enormous privilege.”One of her reasons for standing down was that for all that time she was the Greens’ one-woman spokesperson on everything from health to education to the economy to defence. It is a measure of her effectiveness between them that she has been replaced in the current parliament by an unexpected four new Green MPs, who can divvy up those briefs between them between them. “When I heard how they were able to split up all the different portfolios, I burst into tears thinking back on it,” Lucas says. “On that responsibility of feeling that if there was going to be a green angle in any debate, then the only person who was going to give it was me.”I think if more of our politicians knew fiction and poetry, we’d have better politicsSome of her conclusions about the frustrations and challenges of those feverish years – through the coalition government, austerity, Brexit and Covid – are expressed in her book. Like everything that Lucas articulates, it is a mix of nuanced hope and sharply informed anger about the state of the nation. The new paperback edition comes with an afterword that is damning about the early Starmer government’s lack of conviction, its weak compromises on environmental commitments (this is even before news of the third runway at Heathrow) and its avoidance of the issues that Reform UK so cynically exploits, including the vexed question of English identity. Lucas believes passionately that the idea of England must be reclaimed from the far right, and that it can be progressive and pluralist and comfortable in its own skin (of whatever colour). “Patriotism isn’t boasting that your country is ‘world beating’ at this or that,” she says. “I like Billy Bragg’s definition, which is, basically, just giving a shit about your country. Wanting it to be as good and fair as it can be.”One of the themes of her book is that Labour has no vision of what this might look like, no story to tell: “They are much less ambitious than their voters.” She thinks it ‘bloody scandalous’ that with their 170-seat majority they are talking so much about cuts, rather than a wealth tax or land reform. Before Lucas became a politician, she gained a PhD in English literature (her dissertation was on writing for women in Elizabethan times) and her polemic is deeply informed by the tradition of dissenting English writers engaging with the social and environmental issues of their time – John Clare’s impassioned poetic manifestos against the Enclosure Acts, for example, the fencing off of the English imagination’s right to roam. “I think if more of our politicians knew fiction and poetry, we’d have better politics,” she says. “We are a country of nature lovers. We’re also one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world. And it’s just like, how does that happen?”With our plates full of fabulous locally sourced veg, we talk a little about how one aspect of that depletion is the fact that, as a society, we are so divorced from the ethics and production of what we eat. (Last year, Lucas resigned as vice-president of the RSPCA over exposed failings in its “RSPCA Assured”accreditedabattoirs. At the time the RSPCA defended its record and said there were “differing viewson how best to address the incredibly complex and difficult issue of farmed animal welfare”.) She regrets to say that she is not much of an enthusiastic home cook – her husband Richard Savage, a recently retired English teacher and one-time professional cricketer, does most of that – but she does love making things that last: batches of marmalade and preserves – “I love to see the jars lined up” – or a Christmas cake.View image in fullscreenCaroline Lucas ate crispy tofu, £8; Thai noodle salad, £18.

They shared pineapple tarte tatin, £9; Japanese purin, £8.Food for Friends, 7-18 Prince Albert Street, Brighton BN1 1HF.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverOne of Lucas’s proudest achievements in parliament was helping to create anew GCSEin natural history. It was designed to bring young minds in closer touch with their environment, and to help them understand sustainability through applied science and literature (a course Wordsworth would have loved). Though ready to be rolled out by the Tories, Labour has, to her dismay,shelved it. Another significant parliamentary legacy, the climate and nature bill – which seeks to bring government policy in line with its international commitments, and link the renewal of nature with the climate crisis for the first time in law – was also, shamefully,scupperedby the government when it was due to bevoted onlast month.Equally scandalous, it seems to me, I suggest, is the fact that Lucas was not elevated to the House of Lords on leaving her seat in the main chamber. Doesn’t it make a mockery of the second house if there is no room for someone of her conviction, expertise and popularity? She doesn’t elaborate – “that’s not for me to say”.She is used to being the committed outsider, though she wishes it otherwise. Lucas grew up in Malvern – Elgar country, where her dad ran a small central heating company and both parents voted Tory. Though there was a sense of freedom in the hills, she was hemmed in by the narrowness of attitudes.What did her parents make of her career?“They were bemused by most of it,” she says. “It was like, ‘When are you going to get a proper job?’” They were a little more sympathetic when she became an MP. “I can’t imagine they ever voted Green,” she says, “but perhaps they became slightly less antagonistic.”She recalls, with a smile, the time she was arrested protesting against American cruise missiles at RAF Molesworth. Her father contacted her from his Rotary club, wondering if there was anything he could do to bail her out. She has maintained a belief in non-violent direct action – she was arrested again in an anti-fracking protest in 2013 – and has been a rallying voice against the draconian sentencing of Extinction Rebellion activists.That consistent rage against the kind of denialism that threatens the planet has found another expression for Lucas since she gave up full-time politics – she is training to become an end-of-life doula, spending time counselling people in hospices and families facing the death of a loved one.“I’m on a mission,” she says of her training with the organisation Living Well, Dying Well. “We are not good at talking about death. But I do love the way in which, with people towards the end of life, you can cut through the crap, you know, and get to what’s important.”The tragedy, she suggests, is that more of us do not get to that realisation about what really matters so much earlier – stop and smell the roses, while there are still roses to smell.We’re finishing up a fabulous shared pineapple tart while we dwell on the big questions. “My biggest fear,” she says, before she goes, “would be to be on your deathbed and regret that you hadn’t done enough.”Another Englandby Caroline Lucas (Cornerstone, £10.99) is out now in paperbackExplore more on these topicsCaroline LucasLunch with...Green partyFoodVegetarian food and drinkRestaurantsClimate crisisinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Only atLondon fashion week.All four women were muses for designers on the third day of catwalks. Barlow’s uncompromising art was the inspiration at Roksanda, where vast ballgowns in bright felt wobbled perilously on the 16th floor of an empty brutalist office block, channeling the audacious spirit of Barlow’s teetering towers of fabric, rope, chicken wire or papier-mache.The challenging spirit of the late Barlow’s toppling piles threatened to overwhelm those galleries brave enough to house them. Roksanda echoed this by placing fabrics upside down. Raffia was upended, with sea urchin tendrils spiking skyward rather than trailing to the ground. A coat, simple wool from the front, revealed upon turning a back view of fake fox fur reversed so that the tufts reached upwards. Sequins were the size of Pringles. The effect was of topsy-turvy drama, as if the models might at any moment be set off balance by their outfits and capsize.Barlow made art out of old cardboard boxes and waste fabric, revisiting memories of growing up in the bomb-damaged East End of London. “I love the way she created worlds out of discarded material,” said Roksanda Ilinčić before her show. “And I wanted to challenge myself in the same way.” The final pieces were made from pieces of felt left over from previous collections, vivid art-room remnants with angular cut-outs where sleeves and collars had once been.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hedren in her lovebird-green suit was on the moodboard, along with Head and Du Maurier, upon whose story the film was based. “When you look at what they wore, it feels as if the style of the author and the costume designer both filter into what Hedren wears on screen,” Wickstead said before her show. “I actually find the film really beautiful. It’s a story about love and acceptance and family.” She updated Hedren’s suit in chartreuse or charcoal, with trousers instead of a dress, worn with modern-urban chunky boots and no makeup. “It is interesting that she is wearing that same suit for three days over the story of the film, which is unusual on screen. And I’m all about clothes you can wear for different occasions.”The models wore their hair tightly coiled into chignons, and conical bras to give them “that pointy breast that is very of its time”, said Wickstead. The unsettling mood of the film rippled through the show: an immaculately tailored double-breasted jacket had an uneven number of buttons, setting it subtly off-kilter.The energy of both shows was upbeat, but both designers reported feeling that London fashion week is going through a rough patch. “The consensus is that designers are leaving London, and that fewer from the international industry are coming” said Wickstead. “But for the size of my brand, it still makes sense for me to show in London.” She noted that fewer international models had travelled to London this season, making casting problematic for those still on the schedule.“It’s tough out there,” said Ilinčić. “But we have to keep going. One positive about London is that we have such a strong creative community. This has always been a hard place to survive, so we support each other. And I really believe fashion still needs shows, because it’s so important not to lose the magic.”Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

Can I question her on her love life?Faithlessness doesn’t only have to take the form of infidelity. It can be the slow erosion of trust and carePhilippa PerrySun 23 Feb 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 11.41 ESTShareThe questionMy wife and I live in different countries and see each other once a year. The last time we saw each other we argued all the time and slept in separate beds. I’ll be going to see her soon and I’m worried she’s seeing someone else, although I have no proof. She will expect sex from me, and I think I should protect myself by wearing a condom. How should I broach the condom suggestion without upsetting her, especially if she is actually being totally faithful?Philippa’s answerIt seems that your marriage is not in great shape. Rather than worrying about condoms, I think you need to think and talk about your relationship together. It sounds like you’ll need time to adjust and get to know each other again, and gradually find a place that feels natural and comfortable for both of you.Perhaps what’s needed here is not so much prophylactic protection but protection for the bond that seems to have grown weaker. You’re considering a barrier in the form of a condom because you suspect she may have been unfaithful, but it may be worth reflecting on whether this impulse to shield yourself comes from a deeper place, one that’s not entirely about her actions. Are you perhaps projecting on to her your own feelings of disconnection, or even your own faithlessness toward the marriage?Faithlessness doesn’t only have to take the form of infidelity. It can be the slow erosion of trust and care, allowing fear and resentment to take up space that once might have been filled by affection and honesty. So, rather than placing a barrier between you, think about how you might approach this reunion with openness and a willingness to uncover what’s real between you now, however uncomfortable that might feel. Rather than treating your marriage as something to be shielded against, perhaps it could be something to nurture and understand, even if that means confronting hard truths within yourself.Think about how you might approach this reunion with openness and a willingness to uncover what’s real between youIf a good marriage is what you’re both after, then honesty and authenticity will be needed. Real intimacy doesn’t happen without vulnerability, and both of you will need to be prepared to share truths that may not be easy to express. That means asking and answering questions that go beyond surface matters, letting each of you see the other in your truest forms. Here are a few questions to consider asking each other, with the commitment to answer honestly, and hear the answers without being defensive.How can we both make each other feel safe enough to speak openly, without fear of judgement or resentment? How might we each feel more connected in our separate lives, and what can we do to make those connections real? What brings each of us joy when we think about our future together? If there’s one way in which I hurt or disappoint you, what would it be? What’s your biggest fear about our relationship, and what do you think we can do to face it together? What makes you feel close to me, and what makes you feel distant? What is something you want but don’t feel able to ask for in our marriage? How can we help each other feel free and supported within this relationship, honouring both our individuality and our union?The purpose of such questions isn’t to accuse or defend, but to understand each other. If you’re going to move forward, you’ll need to be willing to listen without jumping to conclusions, acting defensively or withdrawing into silence. This is about rebuilding connection by creating space for truth, even if that truth reveals painful areas that need work.If you’re truly seeking a good marriage, one built on trust, compassion and shared values, you may find that the hardest work isn’t in trying to confirm or deny suspicions, but in letting go of assumptions altogether. That means committing to understanding each other’s inner worlds, entering each other’s experience. Intimacy, in this light, is less about proximity and more about presence, about seeing each other’s vulnerabilities and accepting not judging.When you engage in the kind of dialogue that brings you closer, that lets each of you feel understood and safe, you may find that this question of “protection” shifts. It’s no longer about guarding yourself from one another but about being open to each other. If both of you can lean into this vulnerability, you might find that protection comes not from barriers or precautions, but from a deeper, more resilient trust.So re-establish a bond in which you both feel secure, simply by being fully present and honest, by exploring your hopes, your needs and your fears together. In that openness, the question of whether you need protection may become not just unnecessary, but beside the point. Rekindling a marriage takes time, these conversations will need to be revisited, but in committing to feeling really connected you may find yourself discovering a trust that can withstand distance and change.One more point: just because someone expects you to have sex with them, it doesn’t mean you must have sex with them. Have sex if and when you both want it.The Book You Want Everyone You Love To Read (and Maybe a Few That You Don’t) by Philippa Perry is now out in paperback.

We questioned workers, from copywriters to cam girls, cab drivers to cops, and the answers were surprisingSun 23 Feb 2025 07.00 ESTShareBetween 2021 and 2023, I spoke to 100 strangers about their jobs. I asked them, what do you do all day? Why do you do it? And do you like it? Their answers filled a book,Is This Working?It is a record of life and work in the listless British economy of the early 2020s, a “services economy” in which 85% of us, from the cam girl to the accountant, spent our days producing intangible products.It’s a vague idea, the services economy, but it does at least capture the growing sameness of modern work. One theme in the book is the spread of administrative work. Time and again, my interviewees spoke of workdays being consumed by admin tasks that had little to do with the jobs they had signed up for. As the matron I interviewed put it, “Things you did routinely but never wrote down now take five pages [of forms] on a computer.”Taken together, with their recurring tales of stress and of satisfaction, the interviews say something about the ways in which our work can at once diminish us and magnify us. But perhaps that is putting it too strongly. After all, it’s just people talking about their jobs.The advertising copywriter30s, male:“You don’t know when you’re going to have a great idea… Then boom!”I’d heard of a uni course for advertising. I got in. As soon as I started ad school, I was like, this is who I’m supposed to be. These are my people. This is the kind of work I want to be doing.In advertising, you work in pairs, a copywriter and an art director. I’ve been partnered up with my art director since ad school. I do the words, he does the pictures. It’s been great to have someone to work with. It’s like having a work spouse – the language you use, how you have to keep an open dialogue between the pair of you, always being honest. It can be delicate and tense, but rewarding.They say that there’s a chucker-upper and a siever in any creative team. I think I’m the chucker-upper. Then he sieves, “That’s bullshit. That’s bullshit. That’s bullshit.” You don’t know when you’re going to have a great idea. It could be in the client brief when you’re fresh to it or it could be like, “I’m stressing. I’ve got nothing to show the client.” Then: boom.To come up with ideas you have to learn how your brain works and be quite self-aware. Everyone’s different. My place is in the pool when I’m swimming. That’s the only place where my brain is truly quiet. And that’s when a lot of my ideas come. I love the freedom of being weightless and I think better in motion. I have a notebook that I take in my gym bag because of how often stuff comes to me. It isn’t always good, but some of it has been. In fact, some of the funniest ideas I’ve had, I’ve had underwater.The sex worker and university student20s, female:“Clients think they’re using me, but I’m the one that’s financially gaining”Before I started working for OnlyFans and a nude modelling site I was having to rely on food banks at the local churches. My student maintenance loan only covers three-quarters of my rent.On Tuesdays, I tend to have uni during the day, then from 7pm until 10pm I do the online modelling. On Wednesdays, Thursdays and Sundays I tend to focus on my uni work. On Fridays I’ll work the morning shift (5am to 9am) on the cam-site. This is quite busy. For some reason men want to log on and pay people before they go to work. Who knows why?I have one client who’s into financial domination. Before our sessions he tells me what he earns, what his outgoings are and what his budget for the call is, so I know exactly what he’s got to spend. Part of my interaction with him is belittling him for not tipping me enough. If he sends me some money, I’ll say, “Come on, you can do better than that.” It’s the easiest call I do. The public perception of sex work is that it takes place in a dark alley, your stereotypical prostitute in a red-light district. Don’t get me wrong, there are still dark aspects to the industry with people being exploited, but there isn’t that darkness to my sort of sex work.I want to work in the corporate world one day and when I talk to all these men who are all quite high up in companies it’s like I’m building connections in that world. You have to earn enough to pay for these sessions because each one costs about £2 a minute.It’s been good for my confidence too. I’m on dating apps like any normal person is. If anyone gives me attitude on those apps, I think, screw you, people pay me for my sex work. My partners do struggle with it. I’m very upfront with them that I do sex work and I’m not going to stop. “Other men have seen your body. Blah, blah, blah.”The clients think they’re using me, but in reality, I’m the one that’s financially gaining from the relationship. It’s using misogyny for my benefit, really.The call centre worker40s, female:“A caller threatened to kill himself because he couldn’t return a tool”The first thing I do in the morning is to sign in as quickly as possible. If you’re a minute late, you’re marked as awol and you have to work back your time, or you have to go to your manager and say, “I was a minute late because the system didn’t work properly.” Then I get started on my calls. It’s call after call after call after call.One day I took a call from a man who was raging because he couldn’t return a tool to a particular store. He had to return it to a different store. He was on the phone in his car and he threatened to kill himself. For 14 minutes I had to speak to this man while he travelled from one store to another, all the while threatening to kill himself and the woman he’d dealt with in the first store. I wrote everything down because I was scared for her safety.I alerted my managers: they were feeding me things to say. He was so aggressive, I was afraid he was going to kill that woman, kill himself, or kill his family. I didn’t sleep that night because I was so worried he was going to go back to the shop and kill them all. I thought, I’m not equipped to deal with this.But I also know how to calm down angry men. I’m good with my voice. I spoke softly, calmly… calm, calm, calm. When he’d got to this other store to get the refund – which was £40 by the way – I was still on the phone to him. I heard him speak to the woman behind the counter. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen. But he was so polite to her, “I just want to return this.” After I’d been screamed at, after he’d told me he was going to kill himself and his family and that it was all my fault, after all that for 14 minutes, he exchanged the tool and that was it. I’m shaking now just talking about it. It’s weird. People’s mental health takes a real hit doing this job.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mojo WangThe gardener30s, female:“I have a purpose in the world, to help people, help the planet, and be outside”When I was younger, my mum gave me one of those old Victorian basins so that I could have my own mini garden. I went to uni and forgot all about the outdoors.I then went to work in marketing. The last company I worked for was not good to their workers. I ended up on mental health sick leave; they let me go the day I got back. I spent a few months trying to decide what I wanted to do. My parents said, “If you want to earn a few quid, come and do our garden.” Word spread and I became a gardener, and I love it.There’s always the stress of what the weather is going to do, but on the other hand, you don’t have any targets, it’s not data-driven and you’re outside: the vitamin D helps with your mood; the soil, when you disrupt it, releases a bacteria that they’re now trialling as a medication for PTSD; and petrichor – the smell of rain after it’s been hot – signals that the fertile season is here and seems to produce a happy hormone in us. I don’t know anyone who doesn’t like that smell.I have a purpose in this world. To help people, help the planet, and to be outside. When I garden, I try to teach people that things don’t need to look perfect.The freelance chef40s, male:“I’d say 85% of chefs are alcoholics, drug addicts or gamblers”Most chefs are slightly off their head – I’d say 85% of chefs are either alcoholics, drug addicts, or have a gambling problem – but it’s always been fun in the kitchen. I’ve seen people crashing in and having fights, in the walk-in fridge, or outside. Head chefs would throw stuff at you or threaten to deep-fry your hand. That’s stopped a bit.I lost one marriage because of it – the cheffing, the lifestyle, being tempted by younger waitresses. It’s not great if you’re trying to have a family. You’ll argue, you’ll bite, you’ll snap, you’ll annoy the other person. You’re not yourself, are you?I’d like to start my own agency, but an agency run by chefs, not business people. I could get my mates involved. If I do a chef de partie job, I get £13 an hour, but the agency rents me out at £19 an hour. They make £6 an hour for doing nothing.The matron60s, female:“You get more than you give in this job, but I’ve cried in the changing room”The first time I ever scrubbed up for a case on my own was in 1970. The surgeon was lovely. He said at the end of it, “I’ll give you 9 out of 10 for that.” I had to squeeze my head through the door.You get more than you give in this job, but you have to learn how to leave things behind. There’s times when I’ve sat in the changing room at work and cried. For instance, when you scrub for a C-section and the baby’s dead, you don’t just feel it for the parents, you feel it for you.I had three miscarriages, but I still worked in an operating theatre where they did terminations. I would never judge those patients. You have no right to unless you can live their lives.There’s a small core of colleagues who’ve been with you a long time. You have a depth of understanding. We’ve lived through a lot of change, upheaval, White Papers from the government, changes of government, changes of management. If we ever get half an hour for lunch as a group, you’ll sit down around a big table and it’d be, “Do you remember when?” The younger ones sit there and say, “You did what!” It’s a nice thing, that shared history.The executive assistant50s, female:“My job is to make the CEO look like the most organised person in the room”I’m working as a PA to the CEO of a private hospital. He’s very respectful and we’re very open with each other. I know exactly where he is, what he’s doing and what he wants. I can read him. He said to me once, “You know exactly what I need before I ask. Nobody has ever been able to do that before.” I have access to his diary, and everything is organised via me. I’m his eyes and ears, so I’ll go around getting feedback from the various teams and I’ll share that information with him without saying who said what.He involves me in everything; it makes me feel alive. He’ll ask my opinion and often he’ll take my advice. Though he’ll never say in front of people, “My assistant suggested this.” Instead, he’ll just say, “So I’ve decided to do this,” and I’ll think, OK, he’s taken on board what I’ve said. It doesn’t bother me that he gets all the glory. I get paid well. I get overtime. I know he appreciates me. At staff forums, he’ll regularly say of me, “She’s the boss.” It makes me feel good. He needs me. It’s my job to make him look like the most organised person in the room. We trust each other. That’s the important thing.The taxi driver50s, male:“It’s like working in a bar. You hear conversations that you shouldn’t hear”There aren’t many taxi drivers who actually have music on in the car. I find that strange. On Saturday nights my job is not like a job, because I’m actually out experiencing that Saturday nightlife as well. I’m listening to the radio with the tunes on. Life and work are intertwined. I’ll have Capital FM on and people are like, “Ah I could stay in here all night!”The taxi trade is like working in a bar. You meet every kind of person from every kind of background with every kind of story. Some of them are funny. Some of them are bad. Imagine being a fly on the wall. You hear conversations that you shouldn’t hear. You see things that you shouldn’t have seen. It’s a rewarding job. It’s a job where everything’s live.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Mojo WangThe former soldier turned primary teacher30s, male:“The army promised a lot of things that never came. You’re just left”When I was in Afghanistan I made friends with some of the Afghans – lovely people. Before you went out there, you got told “This is the enemy. They wear a towel on their head.” It sounds horrible, but that’s what we were told. When you’re there, you realise the Afghans are people who just want to get on with life. They’d bring us things like bread and watermelons.One of the Afghan guys we trained even gave me a chicken. I’d been with him when we’d come under attack. He’d fallen into a river and got his belt caught on the riverbed. I pulled him out and he was really grateful. He said, “I want to give you this chicken. It’s a prize-fighting chicken. Make sure you look after it, or I’ll kill you.” He’d said the last bit in a joking way, but I couldn’t tell if he was joking about the prize-winning bit.I got made redundant when David Cameron cut the army’s numbers. It was a week after I’d been put on a promotion course for lance corporal. The army promised us a lot of things that never came. You do the job. You get messed up by it. And then you’re just left. “That’s it. Your time’s up now.” You’re treated like a number, and I don’t think that’s a secret.After I left the army, I had counselling, off my own back, and eventually went to work in an animal-feed factory and for a fast-food chain. I was really embarrassed, because it’s one of the threats they use in the army, “You can leave if you want, but you’re going to end up flipping burgers”, like it was the worst thing in the world.When I was working in the restaurant, I did an access course at a local university, got a degree in English and then trained as a primary school teacher. I love it.I’m not as resilient as I thought. I’ve probably cried in front of my headteacher more than anyone. Teaching is harder than soldiering, without a doubt. I mean, I’m getting grey hairs, my hair’s thinning. There were some tough times in the army, but I’ve never felt under more pressure and stress than as a teacher. It was far less stressful in Afghanistan. Get me back to being shot at!The MOT tester30s, female:“Imagine a Transit van above your head – I’m waiting to be flattened”Even when I was 40 weeks pregnant, I was under the bonnet of a car, bump over the engine bay, putting cylinder heads back on. On my MOT tester training course, it was me and six other lads. I got 96% on the exam. I was pleased with that, because I’d left school with nothing.The garage has grown since then. It’s busy. The work is exhausting. I’m up at 6am to get the kids ready for school. I get to work at around 9am. I’ll go through what we need to do that day. Then we’ll begin to do the MOTs. You do the pre-checks, then we go online and log the vehicle’s details. We print out the inspection sheet, put the car on the inspection ramp, and you start your test. Bonnet checks, interiors, seatbelts. It’s like hundreds of on-ramp points. Shaker plates. Turn plates. Steering. Suspension. Emissions tests. The older cars struggle to meet the emissions tests, so we have to get them stonking hot.I suffer with anxiety – that inspection ramp does not help in the slightest. Can you imagine someone with a Class 7 Transit van above their head? I’m having to use the shakers. The whole ramp’s shaking above my head. I’m waiting for the ramp to flatten me into the concrete. I can’t get the fear out of my head.The police officer50s, female:“There are so many things you see in the job that never leave your brain”There is one job that has always been in my head, even today. It came through on the radio: “You need to go to this address. We believe it to be an auto-erotic death.”[Arriving at the address, the police officer went upstairs to the scene of the death.]I went back downstairs. Going down the stairs, I saw pictures on the wall of him in a suit.I went into the front room. I said, “I’m so sorry, ever so sorry. Is there anything I can do?” His wife said, “No.” She was distraught. She said, “You know what the worst thing is? I knew he did it.”I went to another job, and I finished my shift at three o’clock in the morning. It’s dark. As I’m going towards the car, I stopped. Who’s in my seat? And all I could see was that man who’d hung himself. I could see him sat there. Of course he wasn’t there. But I could see him. I’ve got to go home. What am I going to do? I thought, just be brave and get in the car.For about six months, I was doing that. Reliving. It was constant. Every night I’d see him. I started talking to him. I used to say to him, “How was your day?” And then after about three or four months I thought, “I can’t do this, I’ve got to let go.” There are so many things that you see in the job, and they just never leave your brain. It’s somewhere locked up.[After a case involving sexual harassment by a senior police officer against a colleague was dropped, the interviewee asked why the case was not being pursued.]The superintendent said, “We don’t arrest our own people, do we?” I said, “With all due respect, if we suspect that someone has committed a criminal offence, we do.” He looked at me, and got close. He was quite a big man. “We don’t shit on our own doorstep, do we?”There is a lot of corruption in the service. People will say there is no corruption now. But I listen to the news, I see the papers, and I think, seriously? What do we, the police, learn? Nothing. We don’t learn because we don’t tell people what mistakes we’ve made.The dairy farmer60s, female:“I felt I had to prove to my dad that I could do the work of a man”I’m a farmer’s daughter. Quite unusually for people nowadays, I’ve only ever moved 50 yards. Even when I was a little girl, I knew I was destined to be a farmer, and I feel that I have made a little bit of a mark for women in agriculture.To start with, working on the farm stopped me getting married, because if I got married and had children, well, goodness, then I’m admitting that I’m a woman. I felt I had to prove to my dad that I was as good as a man, that I could do the work of a man, that I could run a farm. But I found a modern man and I carried on farming. My husband brought the children up. I couldn’t have done all of this without him. If he hadn’t looked after the girls, I wouldn’t have been able to farm in the same way. I was very lucky to find him. He was also lucky to find me.Animal welfare is at the forefront of farming. Take poor old cows – we expect a lot from them. When I had my first daughter and was breastfeeding, producing milk was exhausting. I thought, my God, the cows should be in the field on their backs with their legs in the air, producing all this milk. I know it’s a bit sexist, but I do think women are good at looking after animals. We treat them as we would want to be treated.This is an edited extract from Is This Working?

In January 2024, the UN courtordered Israelto ensure its forces do not commit acts of genocide, although it has not yet ruled on its previous acts. Israel has fiercely rejected the case.“They’re trying to set it up that South Africa is not a credible country to bring such a case,” Williamson said. “You’ll see South Africa dragged through the mud a lot more by Netanyahu [Benjamin, prime minister of Israel] and Trump and Musk.”Ahead of the opening of herretrospectiveat theIziko South African National Galleryin Cape Town on 22 February, Williamson dismissed the US claims that South Africa was expropriating land from white Afrikaner farmers.“It’s a much more considered process. If you look back to the Land Act of 1913, when black farmers lost their land to whites, it’s about time that something was done to reverse that.”South African presidentCyril Ramaphosasigned a law last month that allows for land to be expropriated with “nil compensation” in limited circumstances, such as when the land is abandoned.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Despite government efforts to buy and redistribute land, and some black people buying farms, 78% of private farms remain white-owned, according to Stellenbosch University economistsJohann Kirsten and Wandile Sihlobo.Williamson started art classes while working as an advertising executive in New York. However, her first activist art didn’t come until almost a decade after moving back to South Africa with her young children in 1969 to be closer to her family.When policeopened fire on unarmed schoolchildrenprotesting in Soweto against the imposition of Afrikaans lessons on 16 June 1976, Williamson joined a multiracial activist group that became known as the Women’s Movement for Peace. They demanded to be served together at segregated restaurants and took their children to white-only beaches.In 1977, the group formed a human chain to try to stop the informal settlement of Modderdam near Cape Town’s airport from being bulldozed, but the effort failed when the women had to pick their children up from school.Williamson sketched the demolitions on postcards, accompanied by the imaginary musings of apartheid officials, such as: “Don’t feel sorry for these people.” One of theModderdam Postcards, which were copied to be handed out, was banned from being distributed.Williamson recalled: “The lawyers actually wrote to Pretoria and said ‘Why did you ban this postcard?’ And they wrote back with quite an amusing letter, saying, ‘Well it’s not without artistic merit,’ which I thought was really funny. ‘But it doesn’t explain that these people were here illegally, so it’s propagating false information.’”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump, pictured in the Oval office earlier this month with Elon Musk and son, has cut aid to South Africa.Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/ReutersThe demolition of non-white homes remained a focus of Williamson’s work throughout the 1980s. After her friend Naz Ebrahim was served with an eviction notice while preparing Eid dinner in 1981, Williamson gathered rubble from demolition sites across District Six, a central Cape Town area declared a white-only zone in 1966. Williamson surrounded the rubble with six dining chairs borrowed from Ebrahim, and played voices and sounds from District Six, in an installation calledThe Last Supper.The retrospective includes a new work featuring the same chairs, borrowed again from the Ebrahim family, with audio of District Six residents. Williamson wanted the piece to be a catalyst for change: “I was asking journalists to reflect on the fact that the government is supposed to rebuild District Six and absolutely nothing has happened.”The exhibition’s titular 2013 work,There’s something I must tell you, features videos of veteran female activists telling younger female relatives about their experiences of apartheid. Williamson said the conversations were as important as ever, adding she had been troubled hearing young people telling a radio show that things were better under white minority rule. “I don’t think it’s just in South Africa. I think it’s a worldwide thing in traumatised societies, that parents don’t really want to load that sort of stuff on to kids,” she said. “You have to know your own history to find your own place in society.”Nonetheless, Williamson, who started her career as a journalist, said her 2013 work probably needed an update: “I don’t quite know what young people today think. Maybe I need to make another work and find out.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaThe ObserverAfricaArtElon MuskDonald TrumpinterviewsShareReuse this content"

A ballroom full of cheering conservative activists found out this week when Elon Musk waspresented with a chainsawby Argentina’s president, Javier Milei, who has used the power tool as a symbol of his push to impose fiscal discipline.Wearing sunglasses, a black Maga baseball cap and a gold necklace, Musk giddily wielded the chainsaw up and down the stage. “This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy!”he declared. Members of the audience shouted: “We love you!” Musk replied: “I love you guys, too!” And he quipped: “I am become meme.”It was a wild political theatre that confirmed Musk’s status as a new hero of the Maga movement. The head of Tesla and SpaceX had been fully embraced by theConservative Political Action Conference(CPAC), long a window on the soul of the Republican party and, in recent years, a purity test among Donald Trump’s support base.This year’s conference at National Harbor in Maryland was a four-day celebration not only ofTrump’s return to the White Housebut the rise of global rightwing populism. Emboldened, exultant and convinced that their momentum is unstoppable, speakers put less emphasis than usual on baiting liberals and more on spreading the Maga gospel around the world.Attendees were united in praise for theshock-and-awe approachof Trump’s first month in office, which JD Vance described as “a hell of a lot of fun”. Brett Hawkes, 69, from Rockville, Maryland, hailed the “blitzkrieg”; Christopher Cultraro, 19, from Easton, Pennsylvania, called it “phenomenal”; Adelbert Walker, 72, from Petersburg, Virginia, said: “He’s keeping his promises. He’s going about his agenda at warp speed.”View image in fullscreenJD Vance at CPAC on Thursday.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APThe enthusiasm extended to Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which hasslashed the federal governmentand fired thousands of workers in ways that have been challenged in the courts.Musk, the world’s richest man, who has blocked food and medicine for the world’s poorest people by gutting the agency responsible for delivering US aid, told CPAC: “We’re trying to get good things done, but also, like, you know, have a good time doing it and, you know, and have, like, a sense of humour.”Republicans includingKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary; Pam Bondi, the attorney general; Mike Johnson, the House of Representatives speaker; Rick Scott, the Florida senator; and Eric Schmitt, the Missouri senator all took the stage to heap praise on Musk and Doge.Rightwing figures from overseas got in on the act. Britain’s Nigel Faragecalled Musk a “hero of free speech”and lauded the “amazing Doge project” a month after the tech billionaire suggested that Farage should stand down as leader of the Reform UK party.Liz Truss, the former British prime minister, indicated that Musk is now part of the Maga brand when she declared: “We want a Trump revolution in Britain. We want to flood the zone. We want Elon and his nerd-army of Musk rats examining the British deep state.”View image in fullscreenLiz Truss, the former British prime minister, at CPAC on Thursday.Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APBut across America, there are already stirrings of a backlash against Musk’s “nerd army” of mostly young male engineers with no government experience. Members of Congress were this week confronted byraucous town hallsin which citizens complained about Doge’s chaotic, indiscriminate and illegal tactics.Some 71% of people agree that the very wealthy have too much influence on the White House, according to aReuters/ Ipsos survey, while 58% are concerned that programmes such as social security retirement payments and student aid could be delayed by Musk’s campaign.CPAC attendee Ashlie Hightower, who lives in northern Virginia, acknowledged that workers there are suffering the consequences of Musk’s cuts. She said: “Many people have been affected because it’s a huge area that mostly works for government or has some connection to government. I understand that and it might be painful at first.”Even so, Hightower approves of Doge’s actions, saying: “What they have discovered is that we can actually get out of debt if we rein in some of this nonsense spending. Right now they’ve found it’s equal to about 20 or 30% of our GDP. It incredible. I feel rejuvenated.”Others joined in the plaudits for Musk. Matthew Kochman, 76, a property broker from New York, said: “He’s a genius. What’s wrong with that? He could put people on Mars and the federal government is so effed up it’s not funny. He can do nothing but help. If you find $1 of waste, you’re doing a good thing. If you find $500bn, how can anybody possibly find fault with that unless you’re a moron?”Kochman, who drives a vehicle that he calls a “Trumpmobile”, is equally impressed by the president, saying: “He’s going Trump speed, as they say, and he’s not going to waste any time. He’s doing everything that he promised to do and he’s following the agenda to try and bring the country back from chaos and failure.”One big beast of CPAC is more ambivalent about South African-born Musk, however. Steve Bannon, a rightwing populist and former Trump adviser, regards Musk’s oligarch status and pro-immigration views with deep suspicion. Hetold the conservative website UnHerd: “Musk is a parasitic illegal immigrant. He wants to impose his freak experiment and play-act as God without any respect for the country’s history, tradition or values.”But inhis CPAC speech, Bannon welcomed Doge’s assault on the administrative state and even dubbed Musk “Superman”. And on Friday, a long queue of people waiting to take selfies with Bannon included plenty of Musk admirers content to square that circle.Michael Stearns, 30, who works at a golf course near Nashville, Tennessee, was wearing a Nasa sweater and said: “I’m a big Steve Bannon fan. I love that guy. One of my heroes. I supportElon Muskand I Iove Doge. He’s doing the right thing cutting out all the waste and abuse. I support both guys.”Bannon, meanwhile, became embroiled in controversy of his own. As he called on the audience to “fight, fight, fight”, he briefly held out a stiff arm in what appeared to be a fascist salute reminiscent of one made by Musk on inauguration day. In response, France’s far-right leader, Jordan Bardella,cancelled his CPAC appearancebecause “one of the speakers out of provocation allowed himself a gesture alluding to Nazi ideology”.View image in fullscreenSteve Bannon at CPAC on Thursday.Photograph: American Conservative Union/ReutersBannon also used his typically fiery speech to float the idea of a constitutional change that would allow Trump torun for a third termas president, saying: “We want Trump in 28.”The case was also put at CPAC byThird Term Project, a thinktank exploring the case for reconsidering presidential term limits. Wearing a “Trump 2028” sticker, Amber Harris of Third Term Project said: “You need more than four years to enact some of the things he wants to do.”However, most CPAC attendees interviewed by the Guardian opposed the idea. Nina Golden, 47, from Raleigh, North Carolina, believes Trump is exceeding her expectations and is “100%” supportive of Musk but said: “I believe in the constitution as it is and it should stay that way.”Bannon, who served four months in prison last year for defying a subpoena in the congressional investigation into the January 6 insurrection, hosted hisinfluential War Room podcastfrom CPAC. He interviewed a group who had been imprisoned for attacking the US Capitol only to be pardoned by Trump on his first day in office.The “J6ers” received a heroes’ welcome at CPAC. Richard Barnett, who had put his feet on the House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk and was sentenced to more than four years in prison, revelled in his newfound celebrity byshowing offhis “certificate of pardon” from Trump.The 64-year-old retired firefighter, wearing a sweater emblazoned with “J6” and “political prisoner”, said of the president’s first month in office: “Awesome, baby. Keep it coming.”Stewart Rhodes, the founder and leader of the far-right Oath Keepers, who was convicted of seditious conspiracy but had his 18-year sentence commuted, denied that his group had acted violently on behalf of Trump.Sporting a Trump tattoo on his arm, Rhodes, 59, from Granbury, Texas, said he was “very happy” with Trump, adding: “I got no complaints. His cabinet is fantastic from what I’ve seen so far. I love Doge. Let the sunlight come in and show all the corruption.”View image in fullscreenStewart Rhodes, leader of the Oath Keepers, outside a ballroom at CPAC on Saturday.Photograph: David Smith/GuardianIn past years, CPAC has thrived on opposition to the status quo and targeted Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden with crude insults. But with Trump installed in the White House, and Democrats weak and leaderless, targets were less obvious or conspicuous.Kari Lake, Trump’s nominee to be director of the Voice of America media outlet,observed: “For the past four years, we have been in a fight-fight-fight mode and now we are in a win-win-win mode.”Sebastian Gorka, a White House adviser,said he had expectedanti-Trump protests and “pink pussy hat insanity” but “where are they? We crushed them.”Instead, energy was channeled into Trump worship. People sported Maga caps and other regalia; some even wore giant Trump face masks. Sparkly jackets were on sale with slogans such as “Make fries great again” and “Gulf of America”.The swagger also fuelled CPAC’s expansionist ambitions. The conference was addressed by far-right figures from Argentina, Australia, Brazil,Hungary, Japan, North Macedonia, Poland, Slovakia and South Korea. Many saw Trump as a blueprint for nationalist populism in their own countries; some adopted the slogan “Make Europe great again”.Vance criticised Germany’s free-speech laws, accused European leaders offailing to control immigrationand defended Trump’s negotiations with Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine.As for Musk, he waved around the chainsaw – which had the words “Long live freedom, damn it” written along its blade – after an interview in which he pushed falsehoods about Europe jailing people for memes, astronauts being left in space for political reasons and Democrats having an electoral incentive “to maximise the number of illegals in the country”.Finally, he was asked to paint a picture of the inside of the mind a genius. “My mind is a storm,” Musk replied. “It’s a storm.”Explore more on these topicsCPACElon MuskJavier MileiDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicsRepublicansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Tom! Tom!” she called frantically, realising that he had been hit.The scene is part of a play that captures Kenya’s transition to independence through the extraordinary life of Mboya, who, among other things, was a strident campaigner against government corruption before his untimely death in a suspected political assassination at the age of 38. It is one instalment of a wider series retelling Kenya’s history called Too Early for Birds (TEFB), first performed in 2017.View image in fullscreenTom Mboya and supporters in 1961.Photograph: Archive Photos/Getty ImagesAudience participation is encouraged, and amid the oohing and ahhing and booing and laughing there are occasional shouts of a phrase that brings the past directly into the present: “Ruto must go.”Kenya has been roiled in recent months by the deaths and abductions of people accused of involvement in a series of mass anti-government protests. These began on 18 June in opposition to proposed tax risesbut broadened to encompass wider calls for reform, partly in response to the way the initial demonstrations were violently suppressed. Many of those present chanted for the resignation of the president, William Ruto.On top of thedozens of people killed during the protests, scores more were forcibly abducted or went missing. Between June and December,82 cases of enforced disappearanceswere recorded by the Kenya national commission on human rights. Some of those declared missing have resurfaced alive. Others have either been found dead or not found at all.The protests constituted the biggest crisis in Ruto’s presidency. He eventuallyscrapped the finance billthat contained the proposed tax rises andsacked almost all of his cabinetin an attempt to bring the situation under control, all while dismissing reports of police abductions.View image in fullscreenThe scene from Tom Mboya where the title character is shot.Photograph: Edwin Ndeke/The GuardianSince September the street demonstrations have slowed down, but the wave of killings and abductions – and associated anger towards the police and the government – has continued.“A lot of the events that we describe in Mboya are still happening almost in the exact same way today,” said Mugambi Nthiga, the play’s director and co-writer. “It was necessary to show people that only the calendar time has changed. You still have an old guard that benefits from oppressing, disenfranchising and stealing from the major populace, and young people need to rise up and present an alternative.”The play spans Mboya’s entire life, from his childhood on a colonial farm to his death outside a pharmacy in Nairobi in 1969. Having risen to political power by leading negotiations for independence against the British at Lancaster House, he went on to build Kenya’s trade union movement, start a programme to send Kenyans to American universities, and much more besides. He was minister for economic planning and development at the time of his death.The latest production of Tom Mboya is just one of a series of recent stage shows that offer audiences the opportunity to draw parallels between historical and present-day events. Others include the musicals Dedan Kimathi, about the eponymous Kenyan freedom fighter, and Sarafina!, about opposition to apartheid in SouthAfrica.View image in fullscreenKenyan police officers try to break up a protest against the abduction of demonstrators by state security agencies in Nairobi in December 2024.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesAbu Sense, co-creator of TEFB and an actor in the Tom Mboya play, said: “It’s almost as if we’re making Kenya into a character and giving it a persona, [allowing audiences] to know where Kenya came from and how we’re supposed to move forward.”Ngartia, another TEFB co-creator and actor, said Mboya’s rise from an ordinary childhood and the fact that he had character flaws just like anyone else make him a potent trigger for the notion that individuals can effect change or, as Ngartia put it: “I don’t have to be perfect to participate.”“There is no superman,” he added, quoting a line from the play. “It doesn’t take one man to turn the conscience of a nation … We actually have to go out there and eat that teargas ourselves.”View image in fullscreenAnother scene from Tom Mboya.Photograph: Edwin Ndeke/The GuardianGathoni Kimuyu, the creative director of TEFB, said the similarities between Mboya’s impactful rise as a young man and the present-day accountability movement being driven by people in their 20s shows “we’re not far from what our history is”.‘Enforced disappearances’ send a chill through Kenya’s protestsRead more“I hope it makes the younger generation realise that the things Mboya did and dreamed of are also in their reach,” she added.Beldine Moturi, a 25-year-old software engineer, said after watching the play that it had taught her the importance of “decentralising revolution [from] around one person” and that everybody has to play a role to change a country’s course. “It is everyone, as we’re seeing with the protests,” she said. “It is each and every individual taking their part and doing their part.”Started as an adaptation of articles from a Kenyan history blog called Too Late for Worms (nowOwaahh) by writer Morris Kiruga, TEFB is buildingon a body of Kenyan political theatre that goes back to the 1970s withwriter Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o’sKamiriithu theatre group, which staged plays depicting the brutality of the British colonial administration and critiquing the administration of independent Kenya. The government eventually banned the group.“What we’re doing – scene by scene, story by story, laughter by laughter, tear by tear – is healing bits of this common body we call a nation,” said Ngartia.In the play’s closing scene, the Mboya character, played by Xavier Ywaya , reappears and walks to the front of the stage. “We have a right to be free,” he says. “We have always had the right.”Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricaProtestfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She grows mangoes, avocados, starfruit, jackfruit and coconuts. She is cultivating a tropical tree spinach known as chaya.What she really wants, however, is a chicken coop and hens to provide eggs that are becoming increasingly unaffordable in stores. Asbird flu worsensacross the US and commercial suppliers struggle to keep up with demand, the keeping of fowl and production of eggs in home environments, has surged in popularity, and Whalen is keen to join the revolution.Nationwide, anestimated 84 million chickens are kept privately, broadly similar to the numbers of cats and dogs kept as pets.“[It’s] the news reports of bird flu, the scarcity of eggs,the high cost, really,” she said. “I’ve been wanting for a while to get chickens because I’m into gardening and the whole permaculture stuff that I’m learning about. And obviously chickens are very beneficial in that system.”What is stalling Whalen, and allowing others to press ahead, is Florida’s patchwork of often contradictory laws and ordinances over exactly who can, or cannot, keep fowl in their backyard.Clermont, a city 20 miles (32km) west of Orlando, responded to the egg crisis last week by passing a new law that allows residents tokeep up to five hensin properly constructed coops. Roosters are forbidden, and homeowners must apply to the city for a permit.For residents like Whalen in Port St Lucie on Florida’s Atlantic coast, raising fowl is a hard no. Officials insist they don’t have enough code enforcement officers to make inspections or otherwise regulate the cottage industry.“Raising chickens has been determined to be incompatible with the city’s design and a population that now surpasses 250,000,” it said in a statement.Yet in unincorporated St Lucie county, a formalBackyard Chicken Program, approved in 2021 at the height of the Covid pandemic, is thriving. Dozens of residents signed up and numerous families are enjoying an unlimited supply of eggs, strictly for their “own personal use” per the ordinance.Treasure Coast Newspapers conducted its own survey of municipalities and counties mostly along Florida’s east coast and inland, and found awide disparity in regulations. In general, residents of cities are generally more likely to be prohibited from keeping chickens, while rural areas have looser rules.Such inconsistency prompted Whalen tolaunch a petitionto persuade Port St Lucie commissioners to change their mind, pointing out the economic and environmental benefits of home chicken farming, as well as increasing food security.“A lot of this started around Covid times, with homesteading, growing an edible landscape and having a garden in your yard, because people saw how fragile our food system is with the just-in-time food supply where stores only keep three days’ worth,” she said.“That was a big awakening for people. Now you see recent events, not just in our area but across the US, where some people can’t even get a hold of a carton of eggs. I feel like people want to be able to have a more self-sufficient [life]style where they’re not necessarily fully reliant on outside sources.”The nearest thing the US has to an organization for backyard chicken farmers is the American Poultry Association (APA), which was established for breeders and those who want to show their animals, but has increasingly become a support group for a new generation of enthusiasts.“When Covid hit there were so many folks rushing out to get their own chickens thinking it would be cool and cheaper to just have their own, [but] they were finding out that it’s not as easy as one thinks, especially if you have never had them before,” said Norma Padgett, the APA’s president.“The birds were cheap, but the cost to build a safe pen, feed costs and the issue with dealing with sickness, disease or mites on the birds – they found out it was more work than they expected, and not as cheap.”Those eager to jump in, Padgett said, found the cost of construction materials, such as timber and chicken wire, had also soared. Instead of the free supply they expected, newcomers were faced with the concept ofthe $1,000 egg, their average combined outlay before the first one is ever laid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For feed, I suggest they go to the local feed store and get a layer-type feed with the essential vitamins and minerals. It can be easy to get started, but chicks take up to a year sometimes before the chicken begins to lay an egg.”‘No one wants to pay $25 for breakfast’: US restaurants are cracking under inflationRead morePadgett said she would also like to see consistency in chicken-keeping laws, and better education for those who want to get involved.“I know of a few schools that have started keeping smaller livestock for the kids. So many children have never seen a chicken up close, or even from a distance, and introducing livestock of any kind to a child is something I’ve always felt was important,” she said.“It teaches them where their food comes from. I’ve had adults ask me about eggs, and where they come from. They somehow think they just come from the store magically.”Whalen said she was optimistic that her city commissioners would be open to reconsidering.“I’m still trying to raise awareness and get other locals on board, not as a protest or demonstration, just to bring more awareness,” she said.“There are people here in Port St Lucie that keep chickens who have messaged me anonymously, showing me their coops and saying things like: ‘oh, my neighbors don’t mind’ or ‘when we have people over their kids love it’, so they don’t really have issues in their neighborhoods. It’s working out.“So you know it can be done in a city environment. We’re not going to have chickens roaming around the streets.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaEggsFarmingBirdsBird fluAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

Can you lose your sovereignty by being too soft? If you respond with censorship or even cancelling elections, don’t you lose your values?It’s a challenge for any country as the “international rules-based order”, for what it was ever worth, disintegrates. But it is perhaps sharpest inMoldova.Nestled between Ukraine and Romania, the nation of 2.4 million is being targeted with relentless Russian malign influence operations – a small country made intoa vast laboratory of subversion. As the president, Maia Sandu, put it when I met her earlier this month: “Our democratic processes were not designed for these kind of dangers to democracy.”But Moldova can also be the place where democracies can learn to fight back against such attacks, while remaining true to themselves. As the US retreats from supporting a secure and democratic Europe,Vladimir Putinwill become ever more emboldened. Britain and EU countries need to reinvent how we keep ourselves free.And it’s desperately important to get this right in Moldova, a country that once formed part of the Soviet Union and is now an EU accession country. Moscow’s ultimate aim, Sandu argues, is to help bring its allies to power in Moldova, and then use Moldova to threaten Ukraine from the west and the EU from the east. In the short term, Moscow wants to show that it can use all measures short of outright invasion to keep nations it sees in its “zone of influence” chronically destabilised.The more it can pull off such acts of malign influence, the more its status as a reborn superpower is enhanced, and the weaker the hopes for liberal democracies surviving in a dog-eat-dog world will seem.Sandu appears a personification of such hopes. A slight figure in the spare, high building of the presidential palace, she comes across as principled, neat, precise. She has won two presidential elections on a platform of EU integration, institutional reforms, rule of law, transparency and anti-corruption: the bouquet of concepts that were meant to denote membership of “developed” countries.View image in fullscreenPro-democracy candidate Maia Sandu at the inauguration ceremony for her second term in office as president of Moldova.Photograph: Vladislav Culiomza/ReutersWhile so many of these terms have become hollowed out with hypocrisy, Sandu has a reputation for actually living them. Her father was a vet and the director of a cooperative farm in Soviet Moldova, where he was known for clamping down on workers stealing from the farm. Sandu studied management, attended Harvard, then spent two years as an adviser to the head of the World Bank. As minister for education she made her name introducing CCTV cameras in school exam rooms to stop bribes and cheating – it was unpopular at first, but worked.In a country where people have often become politicians to either grow rich or protect their wealth, Sandu lives in a regular apartment. She’s unmarried, which has brought much misogyny from her rivals, who accuse her of not being “interested in what is happening in the country because she has no children here”; betraying “family values” and of being a “laughing stock, the sin and the national disgrace of Moldova”. She once tartly replied: “I never thought being a single woman is a shame. Maybe it is a sin even to be a woman?”Sanduwon re-election last yearwith 55%, but her referendum thatcommitted Moldova to EU entryonly squeaked through: 50% to 49%. As Sandu reels off the list of active measures taken byMoscow and its proxies over the election, worth an estimated $200m – 1% of the country’s GDP – the scale and scope is startling. Perhaps most audacious was avote-buying schemerun by a fugitive oligarch, Ilan Shor, who has been indicted for stealing $1bn from Moldovan banks, and is now based in Moscow.The scheme involved organising often poor, elderly people to register online accounts with a sanctioned Russian bank. They then downloaded a chatbot on the messaging app Telegram that told them how to vote, protest against Sandu or come to the pro-Russian party rallies. People would only get paid once they had completed all the tasks, and would often need to photograph themselves completing them.locator mapThose involved could see the money hit their accounts – but they couldn’t take the funds from the sanctioned banks easily. So they were meant to put in more effort for the pro-Russian party to win and then remove the sanctions on the bank. “The motivation was very well structured,” admits Sandu.The plot was foiled by the Moldovan police and undercover journalists atZiarul de Gardănewspaper. A total of 138,000 bank accounts were identified – out of some 1.5 million voters. So about 10% of the electorate were paid to vote a certain way. But that could just be the tip of the vote-buying scheme: crypto payments and old-fashioned hard cash incentives were also used, with customs identifying a sudden wave of men travelling in from Moscow with hard cash totalling many millions in the run-up to the vote.Shor boasted that he had many more people on his payroll.And the question remains: what can be done in response? The courts, theZiarul de Gardăeditor Alina Radu explains to me, cannot deal with this amount of cases. So far a couple of thousand people are coming to trial. Going after the grannies who were paid to vote can look unseemly, but the higher-ups are well protected with lawyers. Police and reporters can play a cat-and-mouse game catching such operations, but the fact is they are worth the risk for the perpetrators.“There are not many instruments that you have to protect yourself from these external influences,” admits Sandu. Such vote-buying operations have a particular impact in a small country, but they can be used in a targeted way in a larger country too – similar ones are already beingreported in Bulgaria.One possible response would be to just cancel elections – as Romania did in late 2024 when the authorities discovered a supposed Russian scheme to fund a pro-Moscow presidential candidate. But such radical steps make people deeply suspicious of democratic processes, and thecancellation of the Romanian votewas criticised by the new US government.That’s the dilemma of facing such interference: ignore it at your peril, but if you react in a clunky way you only increase the division Russia wants to fuel.Moldovan policymakers, for their part, decided to expose the operation publicly, hope the evidence would alert people to the danger and inspire them to vote and counterbalance the fraud. It just about worked. “When the society saw the danger, we had such a mobilisation that we managed to out-vote it,” explains Sandu.The vote-buying scheme was just one example of the relentless subversion. Some operations play out in the military sphere. Moldova is home to the Transnistria region, a breakaway slice of the country that is de facto controlled by Moscow, which stations some 1,400 Russian troops there.In the run-up to the election Russia organised exercises in the area, while itsproxies pushed propagandacampaigns that Moldova would risk invasion if Sandu won. Moldova may be particularlyvulnerable to such intimidation, but it’s echoed in Kremlin policy across the Caucuses and central Europe.Other operations are economic. Russia recentlycut off gas suppliesto Moldova and then blamed it on Sandu. Moscow has also been accused of cultivating priests who preach sermons denouncing the EU. Fake letters and posters that look as if they are from the EU or Moldovan authorities, but which discredit EU integration, have been distributed. One fake EU Commission letter claimed that all Moldovan officials who don’t speak English will be fired once the country has joined Brussels.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The police’s website was attacked 2,800 times in one night. The electoral commission was attacked in an attempt to cast doubt on the integrity of voting. Moldovan men were trained in Russia and the Balkans to preparefor street violence. ATMs have been disabled, followed by rumours that the banking system is collapsing.And then there are the ever-increasing array of propaganda campaigns, on TV as well as online. In 2024 Shor used Facebook to run hundreds of ads that were viewed 155m times – in a country of 1 million Facebook users. Anonymous Telegram groups and other social media have pumped out lies and conspiracy theories: that the government helps the west steal Moldovan land, for example. Or that the EU will ban the words “father” and “mother” and replace with “parent number one” and “parent number two”.View image in fullscreenAn opposition protest organised by the Socialist party in Chisinau on 22 February calling for the resignation of the president, Maia Sandu.Photograph: Dumitru Doru/EPATo have a chance of meeting these challenges fully will need a level of coordination across sectors, countries and industries. To help mitigate the waves of online malign influence campaigns, for example, Moldova plans to work with the EU Digital Services Act (DSA) enforcement teams. The DSA is meant to ensure tech companies mitigate the “negative effects on civic discourse and electoral processes”. But it’s a new piece of legislation whose meaning is unclear, as is whether tech firms will comply.In an ideal world the tech companies would set up war rooms to deal with the subversion, promptly and publicly show who is behind cover campaigns and give researchers access to data. The alternative is the chaos we see in Romania, where the lack of transparency from tech companies means no one can tell who exactly boosted the pro-Russian candidate’s campaign.Moldova has another law on broadcast media to mitigate disinformation that can harm “national security”. It took a year to define this law with the Council ofEuropeso that it wouldn’t infringe on freedom of speech, and it still involves a slow process where TV channels are first warned, then fined for strategic, consistent campaigns. It might help to curb some long-term Russian efforts, but it’s no magic bullet.But you can never regulate your way out of stopping subversive campaigns in a democracy – you need to learn how to engage audiences better too, argues Valeriu Paşa, the head of the WatchDog.MD thinktank. “We need to engage the audiences Russian propaganda reaches. They are often primarily Russian speakers, and there is little content for them from regular media.” Such audiences can have a romanticised view of life in “Great Russia”, and about the supposed injustices in what Russian propaganda calls “Gayeuropa”.A new generation of communications strategies can compete. At the heart of the challenge is to engage the deeper emotional needs and fears that the Kremlin preys on. Simply debunking fibs about the EU won’t be enough, just “countering disinformation” misses the point. You need to engage the alienation and lack of community the Kremlin propaganda taps into so effectively. That means investing in non-news content too, from entertainment through to town halls.But by the time you are pushing back against subversion, however, it is often too late. To pre-empt the types of vote-buying and disinformation operations Shor has become known for, one needs international investigations that disrupt the networks that support them. That means collaborating with security agencies across the continent on financial crime, and the growing use of crypto especially. Moldovan criminals and corrupt actors often operate from beyond the country, often in the EU and UK. Shor was based in Israel before Moscow.Indeed countries who like to think of themselves as law abiding have been complicit over many years in sheltering the billions stolen from Moldovan banks by corrupt oligarchs. Sandu feels we can do more to stop them. “They continue to undermine our institutions here, trying to bribe judges and prosecutors in Moldova, finance illegal activities which undermine our democratic processes,” Sandu says.View image in fullscreenAn elderly woman casts her ballot in a mobile ballot box in the village of Ciopleni, Moldova.Photograph: Dumitru Doru/EPAAnd there are other steps Moldova’s partners need to take. Working together on cyber defences is a common priority –Russian hackers are hitting UK hospitalsas well as Moldovan institutions. The domain server attacks on Moldova happen from inside the EU. Ensuring energy continues to flow is critical. Another is to undermine the Russian propaganda narrative that Moldova risks invasion if it dares disobey Moscow.Russian gas shutdown forces closure of almost all industry in TransnistriaRead moreThat can only really be achieved if the EU and Britain finally step up their defence capabilities – a need that is all the sharper with America’s clear signals it has minimal interest in standing up to Putin. Moldova is the perfect place to show we can.The level of collective messaging to show political resolve, the amount of coordination between allies and support to democratic processes are not unfathomable. What it does take, however, is a new mindset. It means treating this challenge like the battle that it is. But the impact if we can prevail is high. By fending off Putin here, we make a clear statement that America leaving does not mean European security is lost.Indeed as the US pivots to Moscow, Moldova’s vulnerability seems less atypical but rather the norm for a Europe and Britain that will be left increasingly to fend for itself. And in that sense Moldova is well ahead of working through the fraught challenge of finding a democratic way to defend from undemocratic enemies.Despite relentless pressure from the Kremlin, Moldova has, Sandu says, managed to “take down a corrupt government; hold free elections and a peaceful transitions of power”.Sandu might belong to the generation of politicians who were committed to an idea of progress where countries try to learn from and become more like “the west”. But now it’s we who need to learn from her. We are all more Moldovan now.Explore more on these topicsMoldovaThe ObserverEuropeVladimir PutinRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next protest in London by the nation’s food producers is expected on Tuesday morning, ahead of the annual get-together of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU).Farmers have regularly swapped their fields for the city since October, when changes to inheritance tax (IHT) for agricultural businesses were announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,angrily protesting and waving banners.This year’s one-day NFU conference will be held for the first time in more than 20 years in the capital instead of Birmingham, after the the organisation decided to cut costs by making its usual Midlands two-day shindig every other year. The meet-up comes as its 40,000 members across England and Wales continue to struggle with a string of challenges.Farmers have beenbattered over the past few yearsby rising costs, labour shortages, and post-Brexit changes to support payments, along with increasingly unpredictable weather, particularly this winter’s flooding, which has prevented many from getting crops in the ground.Income fell for all types of farm in England between 2023 and early 2024, according to themost recent figuresfrom the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).And that is before the ongoing battle with the government over IHT changes –labelled a “betrayal”by farmers – after they were assured before the election by the now environment secretary Steve Reed that a Labour cabinetwould not make any changes to agricultural property relief(APR).Ministers have said a move to bring farms and other business property into IHT from April 2026 is necessary to help fix public services. They have also insisted that a quarter of estates, estimated at 500 a year, and valued over £1m, would be liable to pay IHT at areduced 20% rate, rather than the standard 40%, meaning it would mostly impact wealthy landowners.View image in fullscreenNFU president Tom Bradshaw and other agricultural leaders last week presented an ‘alternative policy proposal’ for the inheritance tax changes to the government.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersHowever, agricultural organisations dispute these figures, and warn the measures will endanger domestic food security, stifle investment and cause hardship to family farms.Relations between farming representatives and ministers havesoured further in recent days. Last week, the NFU’s president Tom Bradshaw and other leaders of agricultural organisations presented an “alternative policy proposal” for the tax changes – but quickly expressed their disappointment when the plans were not met with enthusiasm. A government spokesperson said following last Tuesday’s meeting that its reforms, outlined in the budget, represented a “fair and balanced approach” to raising money for public services.Bradshaw warned the reaction from NFU members would be “one of fury, one of real anger, one of desperation”.The mood, then, is hardly likely to be upbeat this week as about 700 farmers gather for the NFU’s conference, under the slogan “foundations for the future”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is contrary to appearances in recent years by then-PM Rishi Sunak in person and by video message. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer attended in both 2021 and 2023, when Labour was courting traditionally Tory constituencies and he told farmers that rural communities were“in my DNA”.Although the audience of farmers are usually polite – at least those listening in the hall – Reed is unlikely to receive a warm welcome when he steps on to the stage for the conference’s political session.His attempts to reset the government’s relationship with farmers at January’s Oxford Farming Conference – with a promise of a “new deal” for the industry – were somewhat unsuccessful when his speech waspunctuated by the honking tractor hornsof protesters.Reed will arrive on Tuesday armed with an olive branch –he is to tell farmers that more British produce will be served in hospitals, schools and prisons. The public sector will be given a target of sourcing at least half of all food from farms with the highest welfare standards, mostly likely to be in the UK.The announcement showsLabourcoming good on its manifesto promise for half of food bought across the public sector to be either locally produced or linked to higher environmental standards.Tom Walton, a fourth generation farmer from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, will spend Tuesday away from his fields, attending the NFU conference for the first time.“We are having to take a realistic view on the viability of the business and how we go forward” because of the IHT changes, said Walton. The farm, now run in partnership with his parents, has been in his family for nearly a century. He hopes to pass it down, one day, to the baby he and his wife, Gabrielle, are expecting this summer.He is now unsure whether the farm will be handed down to the fifth generation: “Everyone is talking about sustainability in farming at the moment, but few understand that also means financially, and at the moment it is looking rocky.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingObserver business agendaRural affairsProtestInheritance taxLabourSteve ReedKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

But claims that NAD+ infusions are a fix for addiction are unproven, risky – and possibly illegal, anObserverinvestigation revealsShanti DasSun 23 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTShareIt is billed as a “miracle” treatment that can reverse ageing and regenerate brain cells. And getting hooked up to IV drips containing NAD+ has surged in popularity, with record Google searches and celebrity fans such as Kendall Jenner and Joe Rogan.Now NAD+ is being touted in the UK as a treatment for substance ­misuse. Infusions of NAD+, which is derived from vitamin B3, are being sold across the country as a ­“clinically proven” and “effective” way to quit drinking or get off drugs.With drug deathsat a highand pressure onpublicly funded treatment, it’s an appealing option. But there’s a problem, says Dr Michael Sagner, a King’s College clinical adviser and expert in NAD+. “It’s complete nonsense,” he says. “People going through withdrawals are often in physical pain. The last thing they need is NAD+.”TheObserverhas found that unlicensed infusions containing NAD+ are being pushed as a treatment for substance use disorders in a likely breach of advertising and ­medicines rules, and despite a lack of proof that they work. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it had taken action against seven clinics offering NAD+ for medicinal purposes, requiring them to remove treatment claims.The infusions – which some companies state can reduce withdrawal symptoms and “repair” damaged cells by boosting levels of NAD+ (the active form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) – cost from £370 for a “basic protocol” to £2,800 for a five-session “recovery detox”. They are being sold by doctor-owned clinics regulated by the Care Quality Commission (CQC), as well as by wellness companies and beauticians.Prof Harry Sumnall, an expert in substance use at Liverpool John Moores University, said: “It’s untested and unproven. We don’t know anything about its efficacy or long-term safety. There’s very little evidence supporting this approach.”In one case, a businessman who is director of three CQC-regulated clinics advised a reporter posing as the sister of a man needing treatment for alcoholism to pay £5,000 for a ­programme involving ketamine infusions, which could also incorporate NAD+. “For an alcoholic there’s ­nothing like it … His life would completely change,” she was told.Another company claims to have sold its NAD+ infusions to ­“hundreds” of patients struggling with substance misuse. A third promises results in five days, claiming its “groundbreaking NAD+ detox is perfect for the prevention, alleviation, and removal of the acute and chronic symptoms associated with alcohol and drug misuse”.View image in fullscreenPodcaster Joe Rogan promoted NAD+ to listeners.Photograph: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC/Getty ImagesThe cases cast light on a loosely regulated private addiction industry. NAD+ is not approved for use on the NHS, nor has it been licensed by the MHRA for medical purposes, ­meaning it cannot be advertised for the treatment of any disease.Sagner said he was particularly concerned that NAD+ was being offered by doctors. “I’m concerned that people with medical degrees now just want to use it as an opportunity to make money. It’s not ethical and it’s not medical,” he said.Hailed as a “miracle molecule”, NAD+, or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, is a coenzyme derived from vitamin B3. It is found in all cells and plays a key role in repairing DNA and producing energy.Research shows NAD+ levels reduce over time and their depletion is thought to be linked to degenerative disorders and ageing. Studies suggest addiction – as well as stress, bad nutrition and smoking – can also affect NAD+ levels. According to advocates, boosting its levels can reverse damage and lead to a range of health benefits.This hypothesis has driven a boom in people paying for NAD+ infusions. Stars including Hailey Bieber and Jennifer Aniston have reportedly used NAD+, while US podcaster Joe Rogan promoted it to his listeners.In an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience last May, he described NAD+ infusions as an “intense feeling” that is “very uncomfortable for your ­stomach” and “makes you cramp up”, but said there were “a lot of benefits”. “There’s a benefit for your immune system. There’s a benefit cognitively. You feel much better,” Rogan said.Experts in NAD+ question the health claims and say the reported benefits are more likely to be a placebo effect. Sagner, director of the European Society of Preventive Medicine and an unpaid adviser to supplement company Elysium Health, says it makes sense that boosting NAD+ levels might be beneficial, but that despite years of research, there is insufficient evidence to make conclusive claims. “The data are not 100% ­convincing. It’s 50/50,” he says.View image in fullscreenNADClinic’s alcohol detox programme. The webpage has since been updated to say it is only available in South Africa.The science on its use in addiction treatment is even less clear. While clinics promote anecdotal success stories, and some animal studies have suggested a role in NAD+ in craving and drug reward systems, it is far from being proven as a treatment for humans, says Sumnall.Many of the claims that NAD+ is useful for withdrawal stem from research in the 1960s involving about 100 participants. They followed a protocol that involved NAD+ and were said to have seen benefits.Sumnall says: “This is a small uncontrolled study. In terms of clinical decision-making now, it would be considered a very weak study.”In another uncontrolled study in the US in 2022, patients with substance use disorders were given infusions as part of a wider treatment programme. The study reported reduced craving and increased abstinence, which Sumnall calls “interesting”. “But that’s all we can say about it. It doesn’t reach the standards that we’d expect of therapies offered on the NHS or other treatment services,” he said.Other research on NAD+ has been the subject of scrutiny. In November 2024, a study that claimed to show that NAD+ levels in lab rats fell as they got older wasretracted by the journalPLOS Oneover concerns about its accuracy.The journal’s editors said several of the microscope images included in the paper, which were purportedly from different experiments, looked similar to each other and in some cases appeared to have been flipped upside down. When it asked the researchers to supply the underlying data, they failed to do so. By the time the study was retracted it had been cited more than 700 times.A spokesperson for the University of New South Wales in Sydney said the study’s lead author, who has authored multiple papers on NAD+, resigned from his post after the concerns were raised. They said an independent panel was looking into potential issues with several other research papers.There are also questions over how NAD+ is administered. Sagner says there is little evidence that NAD+ infused into the bloodstream ­actually enters cells, where it is needed. He says oral supplements of a precursor – nicotinamide riboside (NR) or nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) – have been shown by clinical studies to be better absorbed. “That’s why it’s completely idiotic from a biochemistry point of view to inject ­yourself with NAD itself,” he added.There are not thought to be acute side-effects from injecting NAD+ which, if it is not absorbed, is expelled in urine. But experts warn using it in place of a clinically proven detox programme for addiction can be dangerous. Withdrawing from alcohol and drugs can cause extreme side-effects, including hallucinations, hyperthermia, irregular heart rate and seizures.View image in fullscreenNADclinic describes the detoxes it offers as being ‘virtually painless’.Despite this, theObserverfound NAD+ infusions being advertised as a “proven”, “safe” and “ground­breaking” treatment for addiction. In some cases, clinics seemed to present it as a standalone therapy for detox rather than an optional add-on.One provider, NADclinic, describes NAD+ as a potential “game­changer in addiction treatment” and offers a £2,800 “Alcohol Detox IV ­programme” as an “affordable alternative to rehab”. “At NADclinic, we do detox differently – and it works, with a 90% success rate,” its website says.The clinic, which has premises in Marylebone, London, states on its site that all its services are “registered and regulated” by the CQC with options for detoxes “right here in London, UK”. After the clinic was contacted by theObserver,several webpages wereedited to say the detoxes, which it describes as “virtually painless”, were only available in South Africa.Another provider, Contral Clinics, described NAD+ infusions as a “highly effective” approach to “tackling alcohol addiction” and “a number of different drugs, including opiates and stimulants”.The clinic, located off London’s Harley Street and owned by Joshua Berkowitz, a General Medical Council (GMC)-registered doctor, went on to claim that NAD+ had been “clinically proven to aid in detoxifying patients”, leading to “improved mental clarity, restoration of energy levels and elimination of cravings” through “intravenous therapy delivered direct to the bloodstream”. It invited people to “Talk to Addiction Counsellors” and “Get Immediate Confidential Help NOW!” by calling its helpline.After Contral Clinics was ­contacted by theObserver,its website was deleted and a spokesperson for Berkowitz said it was no longer offering NAD+ infusions. He said the infusions had only ever been for “wellbeing” rather than ­addiction treatment as part of a protocol known as the Sinclair method, which involves taking a drug called naltrexone to block the pleasurable effects of drinking, adding that marketing ­suggesting otherwise was “not as clear as [it] could have been”.View image in fullscreenA page on the site for Contral Clinics. It has now been deleted.Another provider, Rehab Clinics Group, promoted IV NAD+ therapy as a “vital asset in the fight against addiction” for some, helping them achieve a “complete and long-lasting recovery”. “Only with a combination of NAD+ and regular therapy and support can someone stay on the path of ­recovery,” it said. The group lists three CQC-regulated clinics on its website, including Asana Lodge in Northamptonshire, which is described as “the UK’s first ­residential centre based purely on scientific, ­evidence-based treatments”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionIn a call to Rehab Clinics Group’s helpline in January, a reporter ­posing as a woman seeking help for her brother was advised that Asana Lodge – which has previously promoted NAD+ on social media – could be the best fit.The call handler said the centre had previously offered NAD+ to patients as part of a rehabilitation programme but was no longer doing so at the centre. Instead, she said, NAD+ injections were available for home use, adding that she used them “every day”.Another provider, BIOnad, in Camden, promoted NAD+ infusions as a “safe, scientifically-verified treatment for alcohol addiction”, while the website for 5 Day Addiction Detox advertises a “98% successful completion” rate for its NAD+ detox, which it says can be offered at “discreet residential rehab centres” or “the comfort of your own home”.NAD+ is also being sold in injection form by companies like NAD+ At Home, which charges £350 for 20 doses and primarily sells NAD+ as a wellness product. It has also promoted NAD+ for alcoholism. “NAD+ At Home has the potential to counteract and rectify the adverse effects that alcohol inflicts upon our bodies,” it wrote in a Facebook post last year tagged #stoptober, #alcoholism, #addiction, #recoveryView image in fullscreenA Facebook post by NAD+ At Home.Some promotions are likely to be in breach of advertising rules, under which claims about the health ­benefits of intravenous nutritional therapy, such as NAD+, “need to be backed by robust evidence”, and medical claims cannot be made unless “that specific product has been licensed as a medicine for that purpose”.They may also be unlawful. A spokesperson for the MHRA said: “Anyone who is making medicinal claims about NAD+, including using NAD+ to help with addiction, is in breach of our regulations, [which] can lead to a criminal offence. Our ­priority is the safety of the public.”Beyond marketing, experts are concerned about potential risks. While supplementing NAD+ is unlikely to have serious side-effects, little is known about long-term safety. Injections and IV infusions carry a risk of infection, and many clinics fail to test existing NAD+ levels in a patient before and after treatment.John Gillen, who calls himself the “European pioneer” of NAD+ and helps run three clinics registered with the CQC, said he had been involved in “hundreds” of NAD+ infusions. Asked whether levels were tested, Gillen, who has no medical qualifications, said no. “I don’t believe there’s anything worth looking at … You would look at the criteria of an alcoholic and there’s a physical appearance of NAD [levels] in that person,” he said.Prof Sagner said he had challenged several other companies offering NAD+ and found they were not testing. “Some didn’t even know you could test for NAD levels, which is a joke. A blood test takes two minutes and it’d allow you to make an informed professional decision instead of just injecting people with stuff that might have side effects or do nothing,” he said.Dr David Bremner, medical director for drug and alcohol charity Turning Point, said he feared vulnerable people were being misled. He said it was important to be supportive of “future innovative treatments”, but that anything offered to people suffering from addiction needed “a strong basis of fact”. He added: “I would be very concerned if a patient told me they were spending money on this, especially if that was to the exclusion of the tried and tested remedies and support.”Last week, some of the companies offering NAD+ stood by their claims about the benefits of their infusions.Iain De Havilland, CEO of NADclinic, said it was a “brilliant alcohol detox”. “The results we have seen have been amazing,” he said. He denied that NADclinic had promoted NAD+ as a “treatment” for addiction, saying it had instead called it a “therapy”. “In terms of getting an alcoholic clean, it absolutely works as a therapy,” he said.De Havilland also said while the clinic had no licensing or approvals from the MHRA to market NAD+ for addiction, it had been licensed for use in South Africa, and said the last alcohol detox it did in the UK was in 2023. He said webpages referring to NAD+ infusions in the UK might be from “non-updated” parts of the website. He also rejected claims by other experts that NAD+ itself cannot cross the cellular barrier as an “engineered narrative by people wanting to sell precursors”.Gillen, who is a director of Rehab Clinics Group and has links to 5 Day Addiction Detox, BIOnad and NAD+ At Home, said NAD+ was a “useful nutritional supplement” but should not be used as a standalone therapy.He blamed website content about NAD+ on “marketing people” and said they needed updating. He said he had only offered NAD+ with involvement from a doctor, as part of a full detox in line with Nice guidelines, and that he was concerned NAD+ sales were becoming a “wild west”.Berkowitz, of Contral Clinics, said: “Far from exploiting ­vulnerable patients, I believe NAD+ has the capacity to support them by promoting a quicker recovery.”He said he had “seen many patients gain such benefits from having NAD+ IV therapy” when it was offered as part of a full detoxification process. He added that he had been sent a letter by the MHRA in 2017 saying it had “no objection” to him importing NAD+.But the MHRA said last week that permission to import did not mean permission to promote NAD+ as a treatment for use in addiction or any medical condition, adding that any letters from 2017 would now be “long expired”.View image in fullscreenSome clinics make unproven claims about the benefits of NAD+ for alcoholism.Photograph: fizkes/Getty ImagesThe CQC, which regulates addiction treatment services in England, said it visited clinics to ensure they followed best practice. It did not comment on NAD+ but said clinics deviating from guidelines would need to show they were offering “safe and effective care”.The health regulator in Scotland previously rebuked a private NAD+ clinic for recommending IV infusions to people undergoing alcohol detoxification without making clear they were an add-on.Celebrities help the £500 vitamin jab go mainstreamRead moreNHS England said it did not use NAD+, and Nice said it had not assessed it for addiction but that if there was “high quality published evidence” of efficacy, it would ­consider this. The GMC said doctors were required to “provide effective treatments based on the best available evidence” and that if there were concerns that standards were not being met, it could investigate.Dominic McCann, the director of Castle Craig, a private rehab centre, who helped found the Ethical Marketing Campaign for Addiction Treatment, said desperate ­people were being targeted with misinformation “laid on thick”.He shared emails showing that his own clinic has been approached by salespeople encouraging them to offer their patients NAD+, but he refused because the evidence was weak. “Patients might spend their life savings on addiction treatment, so efficacy and outcome are deeply serious,” McCann said. “There are plenty of other options with a strong evidence base.”Explore more on these topicsAlcoholismThe ObserverHealthHealth & wellbeingNutritionDrugsShareReuse this content"

He’d been a regular there back in the days when it was held at the Colosseum in Vauxhall, south of the river. The move to the West End signalled that its garage music was becoming more a mainstream part of culture. Spencer, who grew up in Newcastle upon Tyne, had been documenting underground party nights for a decade by then for magazines such as theFaceandi-D. He was a soul boy at heart, and saw in garage culture similar attractions: “It was working-class kids dressing up for a big night out,” he recalls, “quite different from acid house, for example.”‘We’ve always been very good at enjoying ourselves’: Ewen Spencer’s photographs of a lost clubbing generationRead moreSpencer’s picture is included in a new Hayward Gallery touring exhibitionAfter the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024. Spencer was influenced by north-east based photographers such asChris Killip and Graham Smith; he wanted to make authentic pictures that captured “some of the moves and female-heavy love and jubilation of those nights”, he says.On the particular night he took this photograph, he’d arrived with a different kind of energy. “I’d been set upon by a couple of guys in Essex Road, while waiting for the 73 bus,” he remembers. “We had a fight in the middle of the street, stopped the traffic. That wasn’t that unusual at the time. We were laughing while having a real go at each other and I came out of it all right. I ran and jumped on a bus going the wrong way, and – classic London – no one said a word.” Of all the pictures he took in those years, this is one of his favourites. “It’s so intimate,” he says. “I’m trying to work out a way to have it blown up really huge and have it on my living-room wall.”After the End of History: British Working Class Photography 1989-2024is at Stills, Edinburgh, 21 March to 28 JuneExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big picturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Early steps have includedthreatening to “take back” the Panama Canal,accusing Mexico’s government of being in cahoots with narco-traffickers,sending an envoy to meet the Venezuelan dictator, Nicolás Maduro, andclashing with Colombia’s president, Gustavo Petro, over deportation flights.John Feeley, who was regarded as one of the state department’s top Latin America experts untilhe resignedfrom his job in Panama during Trump’s first term, said he was horrified but not surprised by Trump’s moves.“If you use as your psychological paradigm [for Trump] a combination of Tony Soprano and Thucydides … it shouldn’t come as much of a surprise that he’s going to go to theAmericasfirst,” the ex-ambassador said, referring to the ancient historian who chronicled the fifth-century BC struggle between Athens and Sparta.Feeley believed the most famous line from Thucydides’s account of that war – “The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must” – explained Trump’s bully-boy worldview.“[He’s doing it] because he can – because the asymmetry of American commercial and military power is so incalculable in relationship to Mexico, Central America, Panama, even Brazil, Argentina. They can’t really do much other than suffer the consequences. And so I think, in a sort of mafioso way, he is very adept at reading relative power,” said the former diplomat, who attributedhis 2018 resignationto how Trump had “warped and betrayed … the traditional core values of the United States”.“He’s a velociraptor … He kills anything he perceives as a threat.”Feeley did not believe Trump would follow through on his threat to forcibly reclaim thePanamacanal if his demands over alleged Chinese meddling in the trade route were not met.Tension and defiance in Panama after Trump threatens to ‘take back’ canalRead more“It’s all bluster. He doesn’t have the votes for it. He ran on a ticket of American isolation … He doesn’t want to keep US bases in Germany. He doesn’t want to protect Europe. He doesn’t want to send America’s blood and treasure to fight and die in places like Afghanistan and Iraq. He wants to ‘make America great’.“His vision of a ‘Great America’ is an America that sits in its sphere of influence, king in its own castle, and exploiting parts of the world for American gain, such as $500bn inUkrainian rare earths,” said the diplomat who also served in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico during a 28-year state department career.Feeley praised Panama’s handling of the “relentlessly transactional” US president’s tactics by making tactical concessions while maintaining control of the canal.The former ambassador saw a similarly Soprano-like modus operandi in Trump’s engagement with Maduro, whom the US president appears to have warmed to after trying unsuccessfully to overthrow him during his first administration.View image in fullscreenJohn Feeley, then deputy chief of mission in Mexico, speaks in Mexico City in 2010.Photograph: Eliana Aponte/Reuters“A mobster doesn’t kill every one of his competitors. Frequently, he buys them off. Frequently, he corrupts them. Frequently, he co-opts them,” Feeley said. “And he saw in Maduro a tinpot little mobster in a country that he doesn’t care about – a country that he currently, in this transactional moment, needs to be able tosend a bunch of C-17 Globemasters [transport planes] back to and dump out a bunch of Venezuelans in orange jumpsuits and shacklesso that he can go back to his Maga base and say: ‘See, Joe Biden let these rapists and drug dealers in. I kicked them out.’”Feeley thought Trump’s engagement with Maduro was motivated by his mass deportation campaign, not a desire to access Venezuela’s vast oil reserves. “The United States set record oil and gas productions last year … We don’t need the black gold from the Orinoco belt.”By striking a deal with Maduro allowing him to send deportation flights to Caracas, Feeley argued that Trump had betrayed the opposition politicians widely believed to have beaten the Venezuelan autocrat in last July’s presidential election. “He sold them down the river after they gave him their vote,” the former ambassador said of the Venezuelan Americans who backed Trump in the 2024 US election hoping he would help rid their country of Maduro.But if Trump was channeling Tony Soprano in his treatment of Latin America, Feeley believed he was also channeling Trump. “Donald Trump’s approach to Latin America is reminiscent of the manner in which he and his father ran their buildings in Queens.They put a big C [for “coloured”] on any application from a family that was Black or Hispanic. And not surprisingly, those people didn’t get apartments. They settled that case with the Department of Justice in the 1970s. But it’s very clear to me that Donald Trump sees Latin America as a place to exploit and to get rent from – but not to allow to live in his building,” he said.“I am ashamed of my country. I am angry at my country for electing him. And I am hopeful that we have still the guardrails of democracy to get back to, not perfection, but a place where we value strategic alliances to keep us all safe, where we incorporate human rights and concepts of basic decency into our foreign policy, and where we cultivate our soft power.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS foreign policyPanamaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The police and military are on every corner and everyone is in a state of panic because we are all wondering where they are going to bomb next,” said Beatriz Carvajal, a 50-year-old teacher in the regional capital, who said businesses were shuttered, schools closed and the streets eerily quiet. “I am in a group with other teachers and none of us can remember anything like this since the 1990s when Pablo Escobar was blowing up whatever he wanted.”The unrest started in the surrounding Catatumbo region in mid-Januarywhen the ELN began warring with dissident factions of the now defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), killing 80 people, displacing 50,000 and prompting Petro to declare a state of emergency and cut off fragile peace talks with the armed rebels.Fighting also broke out in the Amazon rainforest, at the other end of the country, where 20 were killed, while this week the ELN placed thousands of residents of the Chocó regionon the Pacific coast under strict lockdown.The outbreaks of unrest in rural and urban areas hundreds of miles apart has added to a sense of loss of control that Colombia had not seen for years.More people have been displaced so far this year than in the entirety of 2024.“We cannot allow these terrorist actions to hold Cúcuta hostage,” the city’s mayor, Jorge Acevedo, told local media. “This is about protecting our people and restoring order.”Colombia signed a historic peace agreement with the Farc in 2016, formally ending six decades of war that left 450,000 dead and millions more displaced.New armed groups have since emerged to fill the void and Petro has made little progress with his efforts to bring peace by negotiating with all major armed factions.The number of armed factions in the country surged from 141 in 2022 to 184 in 2024, said Colombia’s rights ombudsman.Cúcuta’s location on the lawless border with Venezuela has made it a hub for illicit activity and about 25 groups are vying for control over cocaine trafficking, contraband and other criminal enterprises.The escalating violence has fueled a growing humanitarian crisis, with a lack of water and healthcare and concerns for the conditions in refugee camps where outbreaks of parasitic infections have been documented.“Violence has been relentless and the humanitarian crisis has reached catastrophic levels,” said Mónica Hoyos, Project Hope’s program director in Colombia. “Hospitals are at a breaking point, facing critical shortages.”Explore more on these topicsColombiaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The same cannot be said for Syria.”When encountered by the Guardian during a rare tour of Panorama prison, Hajj-Obeid admitted to having been an IS member but said he had deeply regretted his actions.“I’ve been here for six years and it’s been traumatising,” he said, the cell floor behind him lined with thin, grey sleeping mats and what appeared to be plastic children’s cutlery. “Many people died, it’s been overwhelming.”The Australian Centre for International Justice’s acting executive director, Lara Khider, said: “Australia is obligated to investigate any allegations of international crimes committed by this Australian citizen”.Zelenskyy says he would ‘quit for peace’ as he refuses US demand for Ukraine mineralsRead moreShoebridge conceded the political appetite for repatriation to Australia was nonexistent, despite national security advantages. He said this was increasingly so, given the fracturing of social cohesion caused by the Israel-Gaza conflict.“There is no political will to bring him orother Australians citizens backbecause we would prefer that distant problems remain distant. But we are not thinking through the consequences,” Shoebridge said.“Having very troubled people with an increasing sense of grievance against their home country and government by being left in atrocious conditions … is a driver of exactly the kind of extremism that created IS.”Dr Andrew Zammit, an expert in foreign fighters and a research fellow at Victoria University, said leaving foreign fighters in Syria presented a national security challenge given the region’s uncertain future.“It’s ultimately Australia’s responsibility to bring the Australians to justice, not the SDF’s responsibility, particularly when the SDF’s future is so unclear following Assad’s overthrow.”Hajj-Obeid said he left Australia in 2015, claiming he was motivated to travel toSyria“to help”. “It was the situation in Syria, Bashar [al-Assad, the former Syrian president], the killing, the drama,” he said.The Australian government stripped Hajj-Obeid of his nationality in 2019, claiming he was eligible for Lebanese citizenship, but was forced to reverse the decision after a successful high court challenge by another man detained in Syria for his connections to IS.The Syrian Democratic Forces were contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsIslamic StateSyriaAustralian foreign policyLaw (Australia)newsShareReuse this content"

But now the question was what exactly it meant for the millions of Germans who were either racialised, like him, or who are migrants.Germany has voted. But what kind of government will it have?Read moreHe was among the many who had gathered outside the hull-shaped headquarters of the CDU to take in the results of the election. Unlike the party faithful who had neatly filed into the building earlier, David was not there to celebrate but part of a protest rally organised by an alliance of several civil society groups.“I’m here outside the CDU because it will be them who decide how much they give to the AfD – I’m here to hold them accountable,” he said.While Merz has ruled out any formal cooperation with the AfD,he leaned on the partyduring the campaign to support a non-binding resolution on border policy, marking a historic breach of a taboo.His willingness to do so, and the election result – in which the AfD nearly doubled its share of votes from 2021 – have added to concerns about the influence the far-right party could have in Germany’s parliament.Half of the country’s voters had chosen to cast their ballot for either the CDU/CSU bloc or the AfD, pointed out Gian Mecheril, 32. “That means that the coalition of fascists with the conservative party is possible,” he said. “It’s a danger.”View image in fullscreenGian Mecheril, 32.Photograph: Steffen Roth/The GuardianOn Sunday night Merz again insisted there was “no question” of entering into coalition with the far-right party. But for the millions of Germans who regard the AfD as an unprecedented threat, that is of little comfort, particularly after a campaign marked by political rhetoric against migrants, while issues such as country’s ailing economy, deteriorating infrastructure or housing crisis were seemingly ignored.“The campaign was just filled with racist diversions from the actual problems we face,” said Flo, 19. “I’m anxious about what comes next.”The result was a divisive election that had helped to legitimise the far right, said Ella, 30. “The CDU’s win comes on the shoulders of the AfD,” she said. “They worked with them, they normalised them.”Tens of thousands sought to fight back in recent weeks, taking to streets across Germany to protest against the far right and the AfD’s co-leader, Alice Weidel, as she backed the mass deportation of migrants and peddled a party whose ranks include members who have played down the horrors of the Holocaust and chapters that have been designated as “rightwing extremist” by security authorities.“I would say the AfD is the ridiculous monster our period needs to have,” said Willi Schultz, 32, in a reference to the oft-cited quote attributed to Antonio Gramsci: “The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters.”He contextualised the AfD support within the wider, global surge of backing for rightwing populists – a link reinforced during the election as Elon Musk used his influence to tout the AfD, describing it as the only party able to “save Germany”.The election had laid bare Germany’s fragmented political landscape, said Charlotte, 21. Merz could need one or two parties to form a coalition, probably the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens.“I don’t know what kind of coalition we’re going to have now, but I think it won’t be easy to make new laws and to keep politics going here in Germany,” Charlotte said. “I feel like we’ve forgotten how to speak with each other. We’re just more against each other rather than trying to understand each other’s position.”Conservatives win German election but far-right AfD doubles supportRead moreA case in point, she added, were the one in five voters who had cast their ballot for the far right. The AfD proved particularly strong among in the 25-34 age bracket, receiving 22% of the vote, ahead of the CDU/CSU at 18%, and the Greens and Die Linke at 16% each.“I wish it wasn’t like that, but there’s a big part of the people who think that they are not being seen by politicians right now. So they vote for the AfD.”It remained to be seen what that would now mean for the world’s third largest economic power and most populous EU country. Recent weeks have underscored the scope of the challenge asEuropegrapples with the breakdown of the transatlantic alliance under Donald Trump and looming threats to European security.“The campaign was very much about migration, not anything else, even though we have these big problems to face with Trump and Putin,” said Charlotte. “I wish that had received more attention.”For some, there was some solace to be taken from the late-campaign comeback of the far-left Die Linke, who drew more than 8% of the vote.“It’s like a win for all of us,” said Liv Michel, 25. “It’s a win for everybody who’s afraid right now because of the rightwing movement in Germany.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)The far rightEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It came as a “grant” rather than as “debt” that had to be repaid.“I’m not signing something that 10 generations of Ukrainians are going to pay later,” he said.Zelenskyy said any deal was contingent on the US administration providing security guarantees to stop Russia from violating any future ceasefire – something it has so far refused to do.Ukraine’s president also revealed the onerous financial terms which Washington is seeking to impose.For every $1 of any future military aid Kyiv has to pay back $2 – an interest rate, Zelenskyy noted, of 100%. The same conditions were not applied to Israel, the UAE, Qatar or Saudi Arabia, he remarked, saying he had asked for an explanation but not received one.Zelenskyy insisted he wanted good, “friendly” relations with America – a “strategic partner” - and shrugged offTrump’s bruising description of him as a “dictator”for not holding elections during wartime. “Why should I be offended? A dictator would be offended by being called a dictator,” he said, pointing out he won the last 2019 election with 73% of the vote.He added that he wasready to quit as president if it meant “peace for Ukraine”or membership of Nato, something the US and some other Nato member states oppose. “I don’t plan to stay in power for decades. But we won’t let Putin stay in power over Ukrainian territories either,” he said. “It’s important what Ukrainians think of me,” he added.The press conference was held just hours afterRussia launched its biggest ever aerial attack on Ukraine, using 267 drones. At least four people were killed across the country. Kyiv echoed with the booms of anti-aircraft fire, as crews spent much of the night trying to shoot the drones down. Three ballistic missiles had also been fired, the air force said.Zelenskyy said the massive attack demonstrated it was not feasible to conduct a poll under severe wartime conditions. “How can we do this in Sumy? Are we supposed to send election observers to Pokrovsk?” he asked, referring to two Ukrainian cities on the frontline under constant bombardment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He pointed out that elections were illegal under martial law and that it would be impossible for soldiers standing in trenches to take part.On Saturday, the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Trump was “very confident” an agreement could be made to end the war as early as “this week”.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff hinted that a motivation for Washington to achieve a peace deal was to allow US companies to do business in Russia again.Photograph: Evelyn Hockstein/ReutersSteve Witkoff, one of Trump’s special envoys, hinted on Sunday in a separate interview with CBS News that a motivation for Washington for seeking a Ukraine peace deal was so that American companies would be able to do business again in Russia, which is under sanctions. “Obviously there would be an expectation that if we get to a peace deal, that you would be able to have American companies come back and do business there. And I think that everybody would believe that that would be a positive, good thing to happen,” Witkoff told the Face The Nation programme.US and Russian negotiators are expected to have a second round of talks, followingtheir meeting last week in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.Zelenskyy said it was not possible to reach a meaningful peace deal without Ukraine’s involvement, or without the participation of the EU, the UK and other strategic partners. “It’s impossible to finish the war without one party, without Ukraine. Any bilateral US-Russia deal “would not have any success” or halt the war, he predicted.Zelenskyy conceded his armed forces would lose 20% of international military support, should the Trump administration stop all deliveries. He said Ukraine was still waiting on deliveries of weapons agreed at the Nato summit in Washington last summer, and need another 20 Patriot missile batteries – costing $30bn- to counter Russian air attacks.He said he welcomedthe role played by the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, and France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump this week. “Of course the UK has to be at the table,” Zelenskyy said. He said he expected a European summit to take place after their US trips to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

In a Telegram post, a branch of Hamas’ military wing, Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, from the West Bank city of Tulkarem, praised the attacks but stopped short of taking responsibility.1:05IDF expands military raids in West Bank using bulldozers in Tulkarm – video reportIntensified raids in the West Bank come as the fragile Israel-Hamas truce in Gaza lurches from crisis to crisis.Hamas released six Israeli hostages on Saturdayunder the terms of the agreement, but Israel suspended the handover of more than 600 Palestinians it was due to free from its prisons in exchange, putting the five-week-old ceasefire agreement in further jeopardy.Delayed talks on the second stage of the deal, which is supposed to involve a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, are due to begin this week, but no date has been announced.On Sunday, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said Israel was prepared to return to hostilities in Gaza “at any moment” and vowed to complete the war’s objectives “whether through negotiation or by other means”.A senior Hamas official, Mahmoud Mardawi, said: “There will be no dialogue with Israel through the mediators at any stage before the release of the Palestinian prisoners. The mediators must oblige Israel to implement the agreement.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuHamasnewsShareReuse this content"

Several foreign delegations attended the funeral, including the Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, and several Iraqi lawmakers.“I can’t even express how I feel, it feels like my father or grandfather I died. Most of us still don’t believe he’s actually dead,” said Mohammed Khalifeh, a Lebanese man who traveled from Australia for the funeral.Nasrallah was born into a working-class family in Beirut in 1960, though he was originally from southLebanon. One of the founding members of Hezbollah, he was the longest-serving leader of the group and was famed for his charisma and skills as an orator.1:04Tens of thousands of people attend the funeral of former Hezbollah leader Nasrallah – video reportHe became a celebrated figure in Lebanon for Hezbollah’s role in ending Israel’s 18-year occupation of south Lebanon in 2000, although that image was tarnished after the group’s intervention in Syria’s civil war in support of the long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad. The group’s dominance of Lebanon’s politics over the last two decades also engendered resentment among its opponents.Mourners wept as Nasrallah and Safieddine’s caskets were paraded around the stadium and threw rings, jackets and scarves for pallbearers to rub on the coffins and return to them as mementoes of the late leaders. As the caskets were unveiled, four Israeli fighter jets flew low over the stadium, prompting cries of “Death to Israel!”.View image in fullscreenMourners at the funeral of Nasrallah and Safieddine.Photograph: Fadel Itani/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael’s foreign minister, Israel Katz, said the planes were “conveying a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel and attacks Israel – that will be the end of him. You will specialise in funerals – and we will specialise in victories.”.Israeli fighter jets bombed south Lebanon and the Bekaa valley before and during the funeral ceremony, despite the ceasefire agreement signed months earlier.Nasrallah’s death marked the beginning of an escalation in the Hezbollah-Israel war, which up until then had mostly been defined by low-level, tit-for-tat-style fighting in Lebanon’s border region.Hezbollah tries to claim victory as Lebanon mourns its deadRead moreHezbollah attacked Israel on 8 October 2023 “in solidarity” with Hamas’s attack from Gaza on Israel the day before. The conflict was confined mainly to the Lebanese border until a dramatic Israeli escalation and ground invasion in south Lebanon in late September 2024, which left more than 3,000 people in Lebanon dead and displaced more than a million people.Fighting officially ended under a ceasefire agreement and Israeli troops mostly withdrew on 18 February, though Israeli troops have remained in five points in south Lebanon and continue to strike targets periodically.Despite the organisation’s massive losses and the immense humanitarian cost of the war, Hezbollah’s followers said on Sunday that they remained undeterred.“They thought that after they killed our leaders that we would become weak and that they could occupy Lebanon, but they couldn’t do it,” said Lina Jawad, a 27-year-old designer who lives in Beirut.1:15Israel kills at least 22 Lebanese while they attempt to return to their homes – videoHezbollah’s secretary general, Naim Qassem, whose speech during the ceremony was televised from a remote location, said the group would “not submit” and would not accept Israeli forces remaining in the country.The group’s status in the country and influence on the state after the war has been diminished, withLebanon’s new governmentattempting to disarm the non-state group.Hezbollah has long claimed its forces acted a deterrent to Israeli invasions, although some of the Lebanese public has grown frustrated with the now-weakened militant group.In the government’s first statement last week, it dropped any references to the right to “armed resistance” – a reference to Hezbollah’s right to hold weapons – the first time since 2000 that the state did not pay homage to Hezbollah.In a meeting with an Iranian delegation on Sunday, the Lebanese president, Joseph Aoun, said the country was “tired of others’ wars” and that Lebanon had paid a “heavy price” for the Palestinian cause.The state faces the task of reconstruction, after large swathes of the country were levelled by Israeli bombing. It is courting international donors, including gulf countries, for funds.The new government also has demanded the full withdrawal of Israeli soldiers from Lebanon and is relying on diplomatic channels to pressure Israel to do so.Explore more on these topicsLebanonHezbollahIsraelMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Reynolds told the Guardian that sealing the deal was “a top priority” for him and that he was “not afraid to take the tough decisions needed”.“We’ve seen trade secretaries come and go, and while their efforts have been sincere, it’s no secret that British businesses have nothing to show for it in terms of a final product,” he said. “They need a trade deal they can actually use to cut costs, grow their business and expand in the massive Indian market. That’s what this government is going to get them.”During his visit to India, Reynolds and Goyal will visit BT India’s office in Gurugram. Poppy Gustafsson, the investment minister, is expected to hold business engagements in Mumbai and Bengaluru.Saif Malik, the chief executive of Standard Chartered, which has been operating in India for more than 160 years, said the opportunities of a trade deal for businesses were “significant”.“Whether it’s improved access to India’s growing consumer market, opportunities in manufacturing, infrastructure and innovation, or collaboration in financial and professional services, the relaunch of trade talks can unlock even greater trade, investment and prosperity across the UK-India corridor,” he said.The UK and India are the sixth and fifth largest global economies respectively, with a trade relationship worth £41bn. India is forecast to become the third-largest world economy by 2028.The country is a notoriously tough negotiator on trade, however. Narendra Modi’s government signed a £79bn agreement with the European Free Trade Association – a bloc made up of Norway, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein – in the spring, 16 years after talks began. Donald Trump said this month that Modi was a “much tougher” negotiator than him.Boris Johnson and Liz Truss both set Diwali deadlines to reach agreements but failed to get them over the line. Under Sunak, negotiators got close to finalising a deal but this was put on ice when the UK election was triggered.As part of the deal, the UK has asked for lower tariffs on goods such as cars and whisky, and increased access for British lawyers and financial services companies to the Indian market. In return, India has asked for faster and easier processing arrangements for its companies to send workers to the UK.One sticking point has been Delhi’s concern that Indians working temporarily in the UK on business visas have to pay national insurance despite not being eligible for UK pensions or social security benefits.The Guardian revealed in the spring that India has also asked for an exemption from the UK’s planned carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) – a planned tax on the import of carbon-intensive goods such as steel, glass and fertiliser – on the basis that it is a developing country.Any decision to exempt India from a carbon tax would be controversial. The plans are designed to reduce emissions and support UK steel producers by levelling the playing field with countries that have a lower or no carbon levy.Ministers have recently touted a number of life sciences and tech companies that are increasing their exports to India. About £17bn goods and services were exported in total by UK businesses to the country in 12 months to September 2024.Among the British businesses exporting to India are Radio Design, which has its headquarters in Shipley, West Yorkshire, and has opened a manufacturing facility in India, and the tech company marcusevans group, which has established its global tech operations in Mumbai.ApplianSys, a tech company based in Coventry that offers internet-based education services, has developed a pilot to be used across almost 5,000 Indian schools.Reynolds said tech and life sciences were “two huge growth sectors for the UK” and that their exports into the Indian market “will amount to tens of millions of pounds for the UK economy”.Explore more on these topicsIndiaEconomic policySouth and central AsiaNarendra ModinewsShareReuse this content"

One of the projects involved training mothers and children in Bamiyan, one of the largest cities in central Afghanistan.There is a ban on women working and on female education beyond primary school, but this project had apparently been approved by the Bamiyan local authority.The couple were arrested alongside an American-Chinese friend, Faye Hall, who had rented a plane to travel with them, and a translator from the couple’s Rebuild training business.An anonymous Rebuild employee told the PA news agency the group was informed that their flight “did not coordinate with the local government”.For the first three days after their arrest, the couple kept in touch with their children via text message, explaining they were being held by the interior ministry and stating they were fine.Then the texts stopped. Their children have not been in contact with them since.The Reynolds’s home in Nayak has since been raided and their employees have been interrogated about whether the couple were engaging in religious proselytising, which all of them denied.“This is really bad,” their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, from Daventry, Northamptonshire, told the Sunday Times. “My mother is 75 and my father almost 80 and [he] needs his heart medication after a mini-stroke.“They were just trying to help the country they loved. The idea they are being held because they were teaching mothers with children is outrageous.”With her three brothers, she has written an open letter to the Taliban leadership, begging for her parents’ release.The couple met at the University of Bath and married in Kabul in 1970 after falling in love withAfghanistan. Barbie went on to become the first woman to receive a certificate of appreciation from the Taliban.In the letter, Entwistle and her brothers pleaded with the Taliban to set their parents free so that they can continue their good work in schools and pointed out they have been given dual citizenship.“We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest,” they wrote. “Our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded.”The anonymous employee, who said Rebuild workers were “in danger” and living in hiding, described the couple as “the most honourable people I have ever met in my life”.They told PA they feared for Peter’s condition. “It seems that if Peter and Barbie are not released soon, Peter may lose his life because he needs medication, and the Taliban are not allowing him it,” they added.As well as their project in Bamiyan, the couple had been running projects in five schools in Kabul. “The Taliban leaders were so impressed and inspired by the programmes Mum and Dad were offering, they said they would like them set up in every province of Afghanistan,” Entwistle said, adding that her parents had done nothing without permission.“They were meticulous about keeping by the rules even as they kept changing,” she said.The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsTalibanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaWomennewsShareReuse this content"

He was a private person with the biggest of hearts, who wrote immensely moving, meaningful songs that will continue to find people for years to come.”It continued: “For now, we remember Bill’s legacy as the ‘man in the corner of the room at the piano’, who quietly wrote heartfelt songs that touched and connected with people around the world.”Cult singer-songwriter Bill Fay: ‘I didn’t leave the music business, the music business left me!’Read moreStarting his career in 1967, Fay’s self-titled debut in 1970 and its follow-up, Time of the Last Persecution (1971), had limited commercial success, but his work was rediscovered in the 1990s, when the albums were reissued, and he became a cult figure.Archival releases of demos, and recordings from 1978 to 1981 were released during the 2000s, before Fay released his first studio album in more than 40 years, Life Is People, in 2012 on Dead Oceans.Fay released two more albums: Who Is the Sender? (2015) and Countless Branches (2020).During his comeback, Fay was reluctant to play live. He made only one television appearance, on the BBC music show Later … With Jools Holland.The singer was credited by numerous artists as an influence. Artists including the War on Drugs, Wilco, Pavement and the Soft Cell singer Marc Almond covered his songs.A version of Fay’s song Be Not So Fearful, performed by AC Newman, featured in the US horror drama series The Walking Dead.Fay was born in London in September 1943 and went to college in Wales to study electronics, where he began to write songs on piano and harmonium.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicnewsShareReuse this content"

No clothes or belongings were discovered on the shoreline, and no car or bicycle was found nearby, despite it being a seven-mile hike to the nearest bus stop.A postmortem examination failed to find any DNA or fingerprint matches and two police appeals for information about the man were unsuccessful.Now, more than four months after the body was discovered in Claerwen Reservoir in Powys, Dyfed-Powys police have released an image of the wetsuit in the hope that someone can help them solve the mystery of his identity.Dyfed-Powys Police issued an appeal containing an image of the wetsuit.Photograph: Dyfed-Powys PoliceThe anonymous man was found on 18 October after a member of the public spotted his body in the water just before 8.30am. It is estimated his remains may have been decomposing in the water for up to 12 weeks.A postmortem examination confirmed that the body belonged to a man, aged between 30 and 60 years old, who was approximately 6ft tall.DI Angela Ponting said he was found wearing a “Zone 3 Agile wetsuit”. The size of the wetsuit is XL, indicating that the man was possibly between 6ft (183cm) to 6ft 5in (196cm) tall and weighed 202 to 220lbs (92-100kg), with a 44 to 48 inch chest.It is understood that the police spoke to Interpol to try to ascertain the man’s identity, as the remote reservoir can be popular with tourists.Ponting said: “We have carried out numerous enquiries, including checking missing people records with other forces and conducting forensic enquiries both locally and wider in conjunction with law enforcement partners.“Unfortunately, these have not led to the man being identified.“We are keeping an open mind into the circumstances and continue to work towards finding out who he was, any family and what happened to him.”She said police would like to hear from anyone who visited the Claerwen Reservoir or the surrounding area between the beginning of July 2024 and 18 October, and anyone who thinks the information issued by the police “could relate to a missing person in their own life”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But if he was dumped why put him in a wetsuit?”Alan Austin, who chairs a local rambling group and regularly walks in the area, added that he has “never” seen anyone swimming in the “very cold” water of Claerwen Reservoir.“It can be extremely dangerous,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

Only atLondon fashion week.All four women were muses for designers on the third day of catwalks. Barlow’s uncompromising art was the inspiration at Roksanda, where vast ballgowns in bright felt wobbled perilously on the 16th floor of an empty brutalist office block, channeling the audacious spirit of Barlow’s teetering towers of fabric, rope, chicken wire or papier-mache.The challenging spirit of the late Barlow’s toppling piles threatened to overwhelm those galleries brave enough to house them. Roksanda echoed this by placing fabrics upside down. Raffia was upended, with sea urchin tendrils spiking skyward rather than trailing to the ground. A coat, simple wool from the front, revealed upon turning a back view of fake fox fur reversed so that the tufts reached upwards. Sequins were the size of Pringles. The effect was of topsy-turvy drama, as if the models might at any moment be set off balance by their outfits and capsize.Barlow made art out of old cardboard boxes and waste fabric, revisiting memories of growing up in the bomb-damaged East End of London. “I love the way she created worlds out of discarded material,” said Roksanda Ilinčić before her show. “And I wanted to challenge myself in the same way.” The final pieces were made from pieces of felt left over from previous collections, vivid art-room remnants with angular cut-outs where sleeves and collars had once been.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Hedren in her lovebird-green suit was on the moodboard, along with Head and Du Maurier, upon whose story the film was based. “When you look at what they wore, it feels as if the style of the author and the costume designer both filter into what Hedren wears on screen,” Wickstead said before her show. “I actually find the film really beautiful. It’s a story about love and acceptance and family.” She updated Hedren’s suit in chartreuse or charcoal, with trousers instead of a dress, worn with modern-urban chunky boots and no makeup. “It is interesting that she is wearing that same suit for three days over the story of the film, which is unusual on screen. And I’m all about clothes you can wear for different occasions.”The models wore their hair tightly coiled into chignons, and conical bras to give them “that pointy breast that is very of its time”, said Wickstead. The unsettling mood of the film rippled through the show: an immaculately tailored double-breasted jacket had an uneven number of buttons, setting it subtly off-kilter.The energy of both shows was upbeat, but both designers reported feeling that London fashion week is going through a rough patch. “The consensus is that designers are leaving London, and that fewer from the international industry are coming” said Wickstead. “But for the size of my brand, it still makes sense for me to show in London.” She noted that fewer international models had travelled to London this season, making casting problematic for those still on the schedule.“It’s tough out there,” said Ilinčić. “But we have to keep going. One positive about London is that we have such a strong creative community. This has always been a hard place to survive, so we support each other. And I really believe fashion still needs shows, because it’s so important not to lose the magic.”Explore more on these topicsLondon fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

A file will be prepared for the coroner.Hall’s car, a red Ford Focus, was found on Wednesday parked on the B6278, near remote moorland between Eggleston and Stanhope.A major police search was launched after Hall’s disappearance. Mountain rescue teams, with their specialist drones and sniffer dogs, had combed the Hamsterley Forest and the surrounding areas for a trace of Hall since she went missing.Digital intelligence officers also carried out extensive inquiries into Hall’s mobile phone, smartwatch and running apps.Explore more on these topicsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Senior officials and climate policy experts now believe past delays in cutting emissions make it improbable the 2045 target will be met.Sarah Boyack MSP, Scottish Labour’s net zero spokesperson, said this followed “years of environmental failure and inaction” by the Scottish National party.“For too long the SNP has relied on sticking plaster solutions and chased headlines. It would be an appalling betrayal if it walks away from its promise to reach net zero by 2045.”Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green party co-convenor who served as a junior minister in a short-lived coalition with the Scottish National party, said he became aware of this data while in government.Harvie urged the Scottish government to take decisive action when ministers publish new carbon budgets and new policies later this year. Missing the 2045 target “is not baked in yet; that’s not locked in, [but] the clock is ticking.“We are not seeing ambition yet. That’s on the government.”Scotland has already been forced to abandon a much earlier target of cutting its emissions by 75% by 2030 after the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), the official advisory body, saidit was “beyond what is credible”.Before itscrapped that target last year, Scotland had missed eight out of its 12 annual emissions reduction targets and had failed to meet its targets on tree planting, peatland restoration, cutting car use and installing low-carbon heating in homes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Scotland’s sole success has been switching heavily to renewable electricity and closing coal-fired power stations, which initially led to deep and rapid cuts in overall emissions.The consultancy Ricardo AEA has told ministers Scotland could meet its 2045 target by massively increasing reforestation, peatland restoration and the use of technologies such as machines that extract CO2from the air and carbon capture from bioenergy plants.But it said the data that supports that conclusion “should be interpreted with great caution”. The feasibility of substantially restoring damaged peatlands, which emit carbon, “is unclear”. Carbon-removal technologies, known as negative emissions technologies (NETs), are “in their infancy”.The report states that if both those strategies are excluded “greenhouse gas emissions in 2045 would be close to 20MtCO2e.” It adds that because of that uncertainty “there is a very high risk that the Scottish government’s statutory targets will not be achieved … without additional policies.”A Scottish government spokesperson said it was “committed to ending our contribution to global emissions by 2045 at the latest, as agreed by parliament on a cross-party basis”.“Between 1990 and 2022 our emissions halved while the economy grew by 66%, demonstrating that a thriving economy and falling emissions are compatible. However, the second half of our journey will be even more challenging and it is vital we ensure a just transition in areas like agriculture, transport and heat in buildings.”Explore more on these topicsScotlandGreenhouse gas emissionsJohn SwinneyScottish politicsClimate crisisnewsShareReuse this content"

Tarrio denied any involvement in the incident.Organizers of the Principles First summit, which isconsidereda center-right alternative to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), confirmed the bomb threat after they abruptly asked attendees to clear the room hosting the conference.“We have received a credible bomb threat from an account claiming to be ‘Enrique T.’ ‘To honor the J6 hostages.’ Yesterday, the recently pardoned leader of the Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and the attack of January 6th came to the Summit and harassed the J6 police who were speaking,” organizers said ina social media post.“Hotel security, private security, and MPD have made the decision to evacuate Summit floor so that the area can be secured,” the note added, referring to Washignton’s Metropolitan police department. “We intend to reconvene and continue with the Summit once the area has been secured.”As the situation unfolded, Tarrio shared asocial media postdenying any connection to the incident and threatening Principles First organizers with legal action for accusing him.Jim Acosta, the former CNN host, posted acopy of the threatening messageon social media. The message claimed that four pipe bombs had been deployed against political enemies of “Emperor Trump” who “all deserve to die”, including attendees at the conference, Michael Fanone, a former US Capitol police officer, Fanone’s mother and John Bolton, Donald Trump’s former national security adviser.After police officers completed the security sweep of the hotel, Heath Mayo, founder of Principles First, confirmed that organizers received a threatening email with the subject line “explosive surprises” from an account belonging to “Enrique T”.Mayo commended the police officers and security officials who responded quickly to the threat,telling summit attendees: “We are not going to be cowed … It would have been easy to go home and write this off and let these threats win. But this is what America is all about, and America’s democracy – the way that our government works – cannot be cowed by threats like this or people like this.”The crowd responded with loud applause.Heath Mayo, founder of Principles First, addressed the bomb threat at a summit in Washington on Sunday.The incident comes one day after Tarrioappearedat the Washington hotel hosting the summit to insult a group of police officers who protected the US Capitol on January 6, one of whom was receiving a “profile in courage” award from Principles First.Invideoshared by Tarrio on social media on Saturday, he was seen following the officers and mocking them as “fucking cowards”.“You were brave on Twitter,” Tarrio said to the officers. “You guys were brave at my sentencing when you sat there and laughed when I got 22 fucking years. Now you don’t want to look in my eyes, you fucking cowards.”Fanone, the former police officer, then turned to Tarrio and said: “You’re a traitor to this country.”Aquilino Gonell, a former Capitol police sergeant, acknowledged the confrontation with Tarrio as he accepted his “profile in courage” award from Principles First on Saturday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re the traitor. They’re the one who attacked the Capitol,” he added.Tarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges related to his role in the January 6 attack, but the presidentpardoned him and roughly 1,500 other insurrectionistsafter taking office last month.Organizers received the threatening email from “Enrique T” on Sunday at 12.15pm, Mayo said, when attendees were on their lunch break. As the audience started trickling back in to the conference room, expecting to hear next from Bolton, an organizer asked everyone to exit and proceed to the upper levels of the hotel.The summit was able to resume about two hours later on Sunday afternoon. As they started making their way back to the conference room, attendees applauded the police officers who assisted with the security sweep and then broke out into chants of “USA! USA!”Speaking to reporters later, Mayo said: “We cannot be cowed by these threats of political violence.” He was joined on stage by Fanone, whose mother’s home was targeted. “This has been my life for the past four years,” Fanone said. “This is what my family has to endure.”Asked whether he had a message for Trump after the events of the past couple of days, considering the president’s pardon of Tarrio, Fanone repeated his message to Trump from the panel he appeared on Saturday: “Go fuck yourself.”Explore more on these topicsUS politicsWashington DCUS Capitol attacknewsShareReuse this content"

According to ABC News, the agency was seeking additional guidance from the US justice department on next steps.“FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,” Patel’s message read. “The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with FBI procedures. When and if further information is required, we will coordinate the responses. For now, please pause any responses.”Patel’s missive came amidreports on Sundayindicated that he was expected to be named acting head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), a domestic law enforcement agency that – like the FBI – sits within the Department of Justice.Separately, the US attorney John Durham, the top federal prosecutor in the eastern district of New York, also sent a message to his staff to hold off, according to the outlet.“Of course, a majority of our work is law enforcement sensitive (in addition to much classified work), so even assuming this is legitimate, we will need to be careful in how we respond to this inquiry. As noted, the deadline isn’t until 11.59pm on Monday, so we have plenty of time,” Durham wrote in his letter.And the Department of Defense reportedly told employees to pause responding to the OPM message.“The Department of Defense is responsible for reviewing the performance of its personnel and will conduct any review in accordance with its own procedures,” the force’s undersecretary for personnel and readinesssaidin a message, CNN’s Natasha Bertrand reported on Sunday. “When and if required, the department will coordinate responses to the email you have received from OPM.”Trump’s national health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, however, evidently did not follow the leads of Patel, Durham and the defense department. He required that his staff comply with the OPM directive, according to a copy of an email reported on by Sam Stein of the Bulwark.“This is a legitimate email,” Kennedy’s agency said in an email to staffers. “Please read and respond per the instructions.”Musk, who has been tasked to ostensiblycut government costsduring Donald Trump’s second presidency, telegraphed the extraordinary request on his social media network on Saturday.“Consistent with [Trump’s] instructions, all federal employees will shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week,” Musk posted on X, which he owns. “Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.”Shortly afterwards, federal employees – including some judges, court staff and federal prison officials – received a three-line email with this instruction: “Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager.”The deadline to reply was listed as Monday at 11.59pm, although the email did not include Musk’s social media threat about those who fail to respond.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In fire both new and career workers, the White House and Musk’s so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) have been telling agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions in force” and freeze trillions of dollars in federal grant funds.There is no official figure available for the total number of firings or layoffs so far, but the Associated Press has tallied hundreds of thousands of workers who are being affected. Many work outside Washington. The cuts include thousands at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Parks Service, among others.Musk on Fridaycelebratedhis new role at a gathering of conservatives by waving a giant chainsaw in the air. He called it “the chainsaw for bureaucracy” and said “waste is pretty much everywhere” in the federal government.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationElon MuskUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

They added thatMSNBCplans to replace Reid’s slot with a new show co-led by three anchors – Symone Sanders-Townsend, Alicia Menendez and Michael Steele – who currently co-host The Weekend show.Townsend is a Democratic strategist and ex-counsel to former vice-president Kamala Harris, who lost the race for the White House in November toDonald Trump. Menendez is a television commentator. And Steele is the former lieutenant governor of Maryland as well as chairperson of the Republican National Committee from 2009 to 2011.The cancellation of a show led by one of the network’s most prominent hosts comes about a month after MSNBC’s former president, Rashida Jones, stepped down from the network to end a nearly four-year tenure. Kutler, who was then MSNBC’s senior vice-president for content strategy, replaced Jones.Following Jones’s departure, Mark Lazarus, NBCUniversal Media Group chairmantoldthe network’s employees, “We have a lot to do.”In January, Chuck Todd, a prominent anchor and former host of the network’s Meet The Press,announcedthat he was leaving NBC News. The announcement followed Todd’s prominent role in pushing back against NBC’s decision to hire Ronna McDaniel, the former RNC chairperson, in March 2024.The left-leaning network eventually removed McDaniel, who headed the RNC during Trump’s first presidential administration. The NBCUniversal News Group chair, Cesar Conde, told employees that he had listened to “the legitimate concerns” which came from across the network.At the time of NBC’s decision to drop McDaniel, ReidtoldRachel Maddow, another major MSNBC host, “I know I felt very strongly about it, I know you felt very strongly about it … and I just have to say, when somebody does the right thing, I feel like it should be acknowledged as publicly as we acknowledged our outrage … I know how I feel about it.“I’m grateful to Cesar for actually making the right decision. I think it was the right decision.”Explore more on these topicsMSNBCUS politicsTelevision industryTV newsTrump administrationDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Secondly, and this is the crucial language, including clearing any administrative, operational or technical hurdles to implementation.”So, “this idea that we’re gonna spend the money, but we’re only gonna spend the money after we have study sections, and – oops – we can’t have study sections because we’re not allowing notices of study sections to be filed in the Federal Register” unambiguously ignores that language, Bagenstos added.If the Trump administration continues to evade court orders, Bagenstos says judges have a number of tools at their disposal. They could issue more specific orders directed toward individuals responsible for violations, or even hold them in civil contempt of court, which can include jail time, and whichcannot be undone with a presidential pardon.Study sections bring scientists from institutions around the country together to peer review grant proposals, said Berg. Each section brings 20 or more peer reviewers together to review as many as 100 proposals.“It’s basically about two weeks of work” for each reviewer, says Berg.A source familiar with the process estimated that for every three days’ worth of delayed study sections, $1bn of NIH funding is put on hold. Even though study sections are required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance, meetings scheduled to begin on 20 February were postponed the day before.“This week, without warning, as we were checking in to our flights for DC, my study section was canceled for no reason,” said one scientist who was supposed to have her grant proposal reviewed. The cancellations led the scientist and her colleagues to collectively put together that the problem was related to the Federal Register – a relatively obscure step in the process.Two scientists scheduled to attend 20 February study sections as reviewers said they had never heard about the requirement until this week. One suspected the maneuver is “another clever way to wage war on medical science” because few people, even those who work at the NIH, completely understand how it works. It’s a “logistical thing that someone like me would never have to interact with, or likely would never have heard of”, he said.None of the scientists the Guardian spoke to received an explanation as to why study sections were not cancelled until the last minute, even though they were required to appear on the Federal Register 15 days in advance but never did. LaBonne suspects it’s because NIH staff are still hoping the meetings can go forward somehow.“They’re trying to keep it possible till the very last minute in hopes that someone has mercy and allows study sections to continue, and maybe even waives the 15 day requirement,” LaBonne explained.Stuart Buck, a Harvard Law graduate and executive director of theGood Science Project,says these moves make it “very hard to read the tea leaves” about what will happen next.Jay Bhattacharya, who Trump nominated to direct the NIH, has “not even had a confirmation hearing yet”, Buck said. “Why rush out policies that are pretty drastic without the involvement of the people who are supposed to be the experts running the agency?”Buck continued: “All the public rhetoric is about reducing the deficit or reducing regulation. But the things they’re doing so far are mostly not aimed at the deficit or regulation at all. They’re canceling contracts that are trivial compared to the deficit … firing people and canceling things and creating chaos everywhere.”A scientist who was supposed to attend a postponed study section as a reviewer also had trouble making sense of these actions. If the meetings are ever rescheduled, reviewers will either have forgotten details of the proposals they reviewed or have to spend extra time reviewing them again, which will take time away from their own medical research.“This whole thing makes so little sense to me. They’re not even saving any money by doing this. And ultimately, what they’re doing is going to cost more money than anything else, by just delaying everything and kind of screwing up people’s lives,” he said.Another reviewer said the time waste was “annoying” but “the real disturbing thing here is that there’s a lot of really great science in those grants that really needs to be funded in a time-sensitive way. And if it’s not, labs are going to close.”The NIH press office did not respond to a request for comment in time to be included in the story.This article was amended on 23 February 2025 to clarify that Jeremy Berg’s job title is biochemist, not genetic scientist as previously stated.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS politicsMedical researchDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A fourth staffer was injured in a fall.Gunfire erupted after officers went to engage the shooter, whom Barker identified as Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz, 49. He said Archangel-Ortiz was holding at gunpoint a female staff member who had her hands bound with zip ties when police opened fire.“This is a huge loss to our community,” Barker said at a news conference following the shooting. “It is absolutely clear, and beyond any and all doubt, that the officers were justified in taking their action using deadly force.”Barker added that while the investigation is in its early stages, it appears Archangel-Ortiz had previous contact with the hospital’s ICU earlier in the week for “a medical purpose involving another individual” – and he intentionally targeted the workers there.No one answered the door on Saturday at an address in York believed to be that of Archangel-Ortiz.The officer who died was identified as Andrew Duarte of the West York borough police department.“We all have broken hearts and are grieving at his loss,” the West York borough manager Shawn Mauck told the Associated Press.Duarte was a law enforcement veteran who joined the department in 2022 after five years with the Denver police department, according to his LinkedIn profile. He described receiving a “hero award” in 2021 from Mothers Against Drunk Driving for his work in impaired driving enforcement for the state of Colorado.“I have a type A personality and like to succeed in all that I do,” his LinkedIn profilesaid.Duarte also worked as a patrol officer in Denver, was highly regarded for his work and was close friends with other officers, the department there said in a statement.ThePennsylvaniagovernor, Josh Shapiro, said he met on Saturday evening with Duarte’s parents and fellow officers who were wounded.“Their willingness to run toward danger helped save the lives of others,” Shapiro said on the social platform X. “I’m grateful to them and all law enforcement who answered the call today in York.”At a makeshift memorial on the front steps of the West York borough police department, Linda Shields dropped off roses on Saturday and dabbed tears as she thought of her son, a police officer in Maryland.“He was so young,” Shields said of Duarte. “It makes no sense at all.”Shapiro called the attack on police and healthcare workers “the act of a coward”.UPMC Memorial is a five-story, 104-bed hospital that opened in 2019 in York, a city of about 40,000 people known for its creation of York Peppermint Patties in 1940.Saturday’s attack was one of more than 35 mass shootings in the US so far this year, according to theGun Violence Archive, a nonpartisan resource which defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more victims are wounded or killed.The perennially high numbers of mass shootings in the US have prompted many in the country to call for more substantial gun control, though Congress has been mostly unwilling or unable to enact such measures.The attack on Saturday was also part of a wave of gun violence in recent years that has swept through US hospitals and medical centers, which have struggled to adapt to the growing threats. Such attacks have helped make healthcare one of the nation’s most violent fields, with workers suffering more nonfatal injuries from workplace violence than workers in any other profession, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In 2023, a shooter killed a security guard in the lobby of New Hampshire’s state psychiatric hospital before being fatally shot by a state trooper. An Oregon hospital security guard was shot to death whileprotectinga maternity ward from an attacker that year, too.In 2022, a man killed two workers at a Dallas hospital while there to watch his child’s birth. In May of that year, a man opened fire in a medical center waiting room in Atlanta, killing one woman and wounding four. And just one month later, a gunman killed his surgeon and three other people at a Tulsa, Oklahoma, medical office because he blamed the doctor for his continuing pain after an operation.Guardian staff contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsPennsylvaniaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

She grows mangoes, avocados, starfruit, jackfruit and coconuts. She is cultivating a tropical tree spinach known as chaya.What she really wants, however, is a chicken coop and hens to provide eggs that are becoming increasingly unaffordable in stores. Asbird flu worsensacross the US and commercial suppliers struggle to keep up with demand, the keeping of fowl and production of eggs in home environments, has surged in popularity, and Whalen is keen to join the revolution.Nationwide, anestimated 84 million chickens are kept privately, broadly similar to the numbers of cats and dogs kept as pets.“[It’s] the news reports of bird flu, the scarcity of eggs,the high cost, really,” she said. “I’ve been wanting for a while to get chickens because I’m into gardening and the whole permaculture stuff that I’m learning about. And obviously chickens are very beneficial in that system.”What is stalling Whalen, and allowing others to press ahead, is Florida’s patchwork of often contradictory laws and ordinances over exactly who can, or cannot, keep fowl in their backyard.Clermont, a city 20 miles (32km) west of Orlando, responded to the egg crisis last week by passing a new law that allows residents tokeep up to five hensin properly constructed coops. Roosters are forbidden, and homeowners must apply to the city for a permit.For residents like Whalen in Port St Lucie on Florida’s Atlantic coast, raising fowl is a hard no. Officials insist they don’t have enough code enforcement officers to make inspections or otherwise regulate the cottage industry.“Raising chickens has been determined to be incompatible with the city’s design and a population that now surpasses 250,000,” it said in a statement.Yet in unincorporated St Lucie county, a formalBackyard Chicken Program, approved in 2021 at the height of the Covid pandemic, is thriving. Dozens of residents signed up and numerous families are enjoying an unlimited supply of eggs, strictly for their “own personal use” per the ordinance.Treasure Coast Newspapers conducted its own survey of municipalities and counties mostly along Florida’s east coast and inland, and found awide disparity in regulations. In general, residents of cities are generally more likely to be prohibited from keeping chickens, while rural areas have looser rules.Such inconsistency prompted Whalen tolaunch a petitionto persuade Port St Lucie commissioners to change their mind, pointing out the economic and environmental benefits of home chicken farming, as well as increasing food security.“A lot of this started around Covid times, with homesteading, growing an edible landscape and having a garden in your yard, because people saw how fragile our food system is with the just-in-time food supply where stores only keep three days’ worth,” she said.“That was a big awakening for people. Now you see recent events, not just in our area but across the US, where some people can’t even get a hold of a carton of eggs. I feel like people want to be able to have a more self-sufficient [life]style where they’re not necessarily fully reliant on outside sources.”The nearest thing the US has to an organization for backyard chicken farmers is the American Poultry Association (APA), which was established for breeders and those who want to show their animals, but has increasingly become a support group for a new generation of enthusiasts.“When Covid hit there were so many folks rushing out to get their own chickens thinking it would be cool and cheaper to just have their own, [but] they were finding out that it’s not as easy as one thinks, especially if you have never had them before,” said Norma Padgett, the APA’s president.“The birds were cheap, but the cost to build a safe pen, feed costs and the issue with dealing with sickness, disease or mites on the birds – they found out it was more work than they expected, and not as cheap.”Those eager to jump in, Padgett said, found the cost of construction materials, such as timber and chicken wire, had also soared. Instead of the free supply they expected, newcomers were faced with the concept ofthe $1,000 egg, their average combined outlay before the first one is ever laid.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For feed, I suggest they go to the local feed store and get a layer-type feed with the essential vitamins and minerals. It can be easy to get started, but chicks take up to a year sometimes before the chicken begins to lay an egg.”‘No one wants to pay $25 for breakfast’: US restaurants are cracking under inflationRead morePadgett said she would also like to see consistency in chicken-keeping laws, and better education for those who want to get involved.“I know of a few schools that have started keeping smaller livestock for the kids. So many children have never seen a chicken up close, or even from a distance, and introducing livestock of any kind to a child is something I’ve always felt was important,” she said.“It teaches them where their food comes from. I’ve had adults ask me about eggs, and where they come from. They somehow think they just come from the store magically.”Whalen said she was optimistic that her city commissioners would be open to reconsidering.“I’m still trying to raise awareness and get other locals on board, not as a protest or demonstration, just to bring more awareness,” she said.“There are people here in Port St Lucie that keep chickens who have messaged me anonymously, showing me their coops and saying things like: ‘oh, my neighbors don’t mind’ or ‘when we have people over their kids love it’, so they don’t really have issues in their neighborhoods. It’s working out.“So you know it can be done in a city environment. We’re not going to have chickens roaming around the streets.”Explore more on these topicsFloridaEggsFarmingBirdsBird fluAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

An attacker exploited security controls and was able to transfer the assets. Zhou said all other wallets on the exchange were unaffected.The price of Ethereum dropped by nearly 4% following news of the hack on Friday, but has since almost returned to previous levels.The company has called on “the brightest minds in cybersecurity and crypto analytics” to help it try to recover the hacked funds, and is offering a reward of 10% of the amount recovered, which could total $140m if the entire hacked amount was retrieved.“Bybit is determined to rise above the setback and fundamentally transform our security infrastructure, improve liquidity, and be a steadfast partner to our friends in the crypto community,” Zhou said in a statement.The hack is a setback for the crypto industry, which hasrebounded in recent monthsafter benefiting fromDonald Trump’sreturn to the White House, and his promises to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”amid looser regulation.Although the identity of the Bybit attacker is unknown, some reports have suggested that the perpetrators could beNorth Korean state hackers, such as the Lazarus Group, who have been blamed for previous large-scale heists, including the$615m theft from the blockchain project Ronin Groupin 2022.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCryptocurrenciesE-commerceDubaiHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of theiPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.Ive’s concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. “We need time to understand and react,” he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: “It’s probably the first time in my career that I’m inspired by capability in this way.”Among Ive’s musical choices were Don’t You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds and part of the soundtrack from the Disney Pixar robot movie Wall-E.Explore more on these topicsDesignThe ObserverSteve JobsAppleiPhoneApple WatchDesert Island DiscsRadio 4newsShareReuse this content"

Yet they also show that many Russians – especially in major cities like Moscow and St Petersburg – appear to yearn for the pre-war days when they could easily fly toEuropeor browse the aisles of Zara.A recent survey by the independent Levada Center in Moscow found that 61% of Russians favoured peace talks over continuing the war – a record high since the question was first asked in the early days of the conflict.If there was one clear takeaway from the high-level meetings in Riyadh, it was that the US, under the transactional leadership of President Donald Trump, was eager to revive economic ties with Russia.His secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said the end to the war would be “the key that unlocks the door” for “potentially historic economic partnerships”. Crucially, he suggested that the US could drop sanctions against Russia as part of a peace deal.Russian media and commentators seized on Rubio’s words, fuelling a wave of speculation that western giants – from Nike toApple– were rushing to reopen stores in the country. For now, these discussions remain purely theoretical.A viable path to peace is still elusive, with Ukraine’s leader,Volodymyr Zelenskyy, insisting that his country will not accept unjust terms. Meanwhile, European leaders have rejected the idea of lifting sanctions on Russia, and there is no indication that western companies are preparing to return.Yet the mood in Moscow suggests that many are beginning to think about what a post-war reality might look like.View image in fullscreenMariupol, three years after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Photograph: EPAThe exodus of western brands following Russia’s full-scale invasion – from McDonald’s and Ikea toChanel– has transformed the face of its cities across the country.What was once a landscape of global retail giants has been replaced by Russian stand-ins, with shopping malls now dominated by local imitations of long-familiar western names.As talks progress at a blistering speed, officials in Moscow appear to be still unsure whether to welcome western companies back with open arms. On one hand, for many within the Kremlin’s establishment, the return of western businesses – paired with a peace deal that favours Moscow – would signal that Russia had ultimately been reintegrated into the international fold, despite having launched the largest war in Europe since the second world war. “If western firms return, it would mean that money has trumped all their talk of so-called liberal values. They promised we would be a pariah for invading Ukraine, but in reality, everyone just chases profits,” one well-connected Russian business in Moscow told theObserver.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anatoly Aksakov, a Russian politician, expressed confidence that major financial firms like Mastercard and Visa would seek to re-enter the Russian market. “Of course, they want to return so they can profit from it,” he said.But there was also pushback from Russia’s influential pro-war nationalist voices, who have embraced the country’s path of isolation.Some argue that allowing European and US brands to return would threaten the profits made by their Russian substitutes, which have dominated since the exodus of western competition.Others warned that western firms would reintroduce liberal values that clash with Russia’s ultra-conservative wartime ideology.“What to do with these traitors and how to handle them should and will be decided by professionals across all branches of power,I am confident that domestic companies will be guaranteed that they will not be traded for French rags and Italian slippers,” Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson wrote on Telegram. “Our manufacturers must know their contribution to the Special Military Operation will not be betrayed,” she added, using Russia’s official term for war in Ukraine.Speaking on a Russian talk show last week, Alexander Malkevich, an influential Russian propagandist, proposed that for western companies to be allowed to re-enter the Russian market, they should be required to donate money to the Russian army and open stores in Ukrainian cities that are occupied by Russia, such as Mariupol.There were also those in Moscow who felt bittersweet about the possible end of the war. “I think the most important thing is that the war is ending and people will stop dying,” said Alexandra, a Russian public relations consultant who opposed the war but kept her views hidden out of fear of prosecution in Moscow.“But no lessons will be learned from this war if it ends in Putin’s favour,” she added. “Everything will go back to normal as if nothing ever happened.”Explore more on these topicsRussiaThe ObserverUkraineVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyyEuropeForeign policyApplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The next protest in London by the nation’s food producers is expected on Tuesday morning, ahead of the annual get-together of the National Farmers’ Union (NFU).Farmers have regularly swapped their fields for the city since October, when changes to inheritance tax (IHT) for agricultural businesses were announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves,angrily protesting and waving banners.This year’s one-day NFU conference will be held for the first time in more than 20 years in the capital instead of Birmingham, after the the organisation decided to cut costs by making its usual Midlands two-day shindig every other year. The meet-up comes as its 40,000 members across England and Wales continue to struggle with a string of challenges.Farmers have beenbattered over the past few yearsby rising costs, labour shortages, and post-Brexit changes to support payments, along with increasingly unpredictable weather, particularly this winter’s flooding, which has prevented many from getting crops in the ground.Income fell for all types of farm in England between 2023 and early 2024, according to themost recent figuresfrom the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).And that is before the ongoing battle with the government over IHT changes –labelled a “betrayal”by farmers – after they were assured before the election by the now environment secretary Steve Reed that a Labour cabinetwould not make any changes to agricultural property relief(APR).Ministers have said a move to bring farms and other business property into IHT from April 2026 is necessary to help fix public services. They have also insisted that a quarter of estates, estimated at 500 a year, and valued over £1m, would be liable to pay IHT at areduced 20% rate, rather than the standard 40%, meaning it would mostly impact wealthy landowners.View image in fullscreenNFU president Tom Bradshaw and other agricultural leaders last week presented an ‘alternative policy proposal’ for the inheritance tax changes to the government.Photograph: Hollie Adams/ReutersHowever, agricultural organisations dispute these figures, and warn the measures will endanger domestic food security, stifle investment and cause hardship to family farms.Relations between farming representatives and ministers havesoured further in recent days. Last week, the NFU’s president Tom Bradshaw and other leaders of agricultural organisations presented an “alternative policy proposal” for the tax changes – but quickly expressed their disappointment when the plans were not met with enthusiasm. A government spokesperson said following last Tuesday’s meeting that its reforms, outlined in the budget, represented a “fair and balanced approach” to raising money for public services.Bradshaw warned the reaction from NFU members would be “one of fury, one of real anger, one of desperation”.The mood, then, is hardly likely to be upbeat this week as about 700 farmers gather for the NFU’s conference, under the slogan “foundations for the future”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This is contrary to appearances in recent years by then-PM Rishi Sunak in person and by video message. Meanwhile, Keir Starmer attended in both 2021 and 2023, when Labour was courting traditionally Tory constituencies and he told farmers that rural communities were“in my DNA”.Although the audience of farmers are usually polite – at least those listening in the hall – Reed is unlikely to receive a warm welcome when he steps on to the stage for the conference’s political session.His attempts to reset the government’s relationship with farmers at January’s Oxford Farming Conference – with a promise of a “new deal” for the industry – were somewhat unsuccessful when his speech waspunctuated by the honking tractor hornsof protesters.Reed will arrive on Tuesday armed with an olive branch –he is to tell farmers that more British produce will be served in hospitals, schools and prisons. The public sector will be given a target of sourcing at least half of all food from farms with the highest welfare standards, mostly likely to be in the UK.The announcement showsLabourcoming good on its manifesto promise for half of food bought across the public sector to be either locally produced or linked to higher environmental standards.Tom Walton, a fourth generation farmer from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, will spend Tuesday away from his fields, attending the NFU conference for the first time.“We are having to take a realistic view on the viability of the business and how we go forward” because of the IHT changes, said Walton. The farm, now run in partnership with his parents, has been in his family for nearly a century. He hopes to pass it down, one day, to the baby he and his wife, Gabrielle, are expecting this summer.He is now unsure whether the farm will be handed down to the fifth generation: “Everyone is talking about sustainability in farming at the moment, but few understand that also means financially, and at the moment it is looking rocky.”Explore more on these topicsFarmingObserver business agendaRural affairsProtestInheritance taxLabourSteve ReedKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

In my opinion, Villa and City away are two very difficult games so youcandrop points there.“We are in a good position but we also know how hard it is to play against Wolves. Now we play Newcastle on Wednesday, who we drew 3-3 with. In every other league, having a lead like this would be comfortable.“Three days ago we had a draw at Villa and people told me we weren’t in a good place and then three days later we win and it changes again. We work every single day to achieve this and it is three months of very hard work to maintain this. There is no secret. We are 11 points clear but Arsenal has one game in hand.”Salah now has 30 goals and 21 assists in all competitions, and Andy Robertson praised the forward. “He is on a different world right now and playing out of his skin,” the left-back said.Salah was asked if at 32 he is a better player than ever.“Maybe people prefer my first seasons or now but I prefer now because winning the league, helping the young players, it is special,” the Egyptian said. “We need another title. Me and the big guys in the team need another title.”Despite the defeat that leaves City 20 points behind Liverpool, Pep Guardiola struck an optimistic note. “I saw a bright future,” City’s manager said. “Other than Kevin [De Bruyne] and Nathan [Aké], they [the rest of the XI] are the future, with others who will come in future windows.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All of my teammates and competitors and coaches and the whole World Cup. I’m so grateful,” a tearful Shiffrin said after her historic victory in Italy.Lindsey Vonn sorry for Mikaela Shiffrin comments at skiing world championshipsRead moreShiffrin’s compatriot, Paula Moltzan, finished third thanks to an excellent second run, while the world champion, Camille Rast, crashed out in her first run. “I think it’s pretty special to share it with Paula,” Shiffrin added. “We just keep pushing – she pushes, and I push. And we made it achievable.”She added: “Today a lot of things had to go right for me and actually wrong for some others. Camille, on the first run, was just so fast. So a lot of things had to go in my direction. But in the end I did something right too.”The 29-year-old’s hunt for her 100th career World Cup win was put on hold after she crashed during a giant slalom race in Killington, Vermont, in November.

As the players left the court chants of “Fuck the Mormons”could be heardaround the McKale Center. Around 98% of BYU’s student body are Mormons and the university is sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.“Following tonight’s men’s basketball game, it was brought to our attention that an unacceptable chant occurred,” Arizona athletic director Desireé Reed-Francois said in a statement. “On behalf of the University of Arizona Athletic Department, we apologize to BYU, their student-athletes, coaches and fans. The chant is not reflective of who we are and should not have happened.”The teams tussled after the end of the game, and Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd was critical of a call that led to free throws that sealed BYU’s 96-95 win. But he said his team took responsibility for the defeat.“It’s a bad call. I mean, like, whatever. What am I going to say?” Lloyd said. “You hate for a game to be decided by that … And the guy who called it is one of the best refs. So we’ve got to live with it. But step back.

Just finally being myself a little bit, that’s why I was smiling all game.”So was LeBron James, who chipped in 25 points, 10 rebounds, five assists and three blocks – and several times was on the receiving end of Dončić’s long passes for fastbreak buckets as the Lakers led wire-to-wire against their recent nemisis.LeBron James says he initially thought Luka Dončić’s Lakers trade was a hoaxRead more“I am a natural-born wide receiver and he’s a natural-born quarterback,” cracked James.Dončić said his chemistry with the Lakers, James included, is still budding. “This is my fourth game,” Dončić said. “Chemistry takes time. You saw today that it’s getting better. Every day, it’s getting better. ... Hard, different, but I’m happy to be playing basketball. Every day is going to get better for me. I’m happy to be here. I’m happy for the new journey.”The duo’s performance in Denver should give the Lakers and their followers a sense that they can make the kind of deep playoff run that eluded them the last two years when the Nuggets bounced them in the first round, winning eight of nine when James was teamed with Anthony Davis.The Lakers had just nine turnovers to Denver’s 22 and 15 steals to the Nuggets’ six. And while they took just one more shot, they made nine more baskets.Although they surrendered Nikola Jokić’s 26th triple-double of the season, the Lakers held the reigning MVP to just 2-of-7 shooting and forced him into an uncharacteristic half dozen turnovers.“It was their night,” Jamal Murray said. “Offensively and defensively.”The Lakers never trailed as they won in Denver for the first time since April 2022.Dončić, who had 19 points by halftime, had been slowly adjusting to his new team since the big trade and working himself back into shape after missing several weeks with a calf injury. But in Denver, James said he saw a dialed-in Dončić, the very version that led the Mavericks to theNBAfinals last year.“Once he started hitting those stepback 3s, he could be yelling or barking, either at fans, or us or himself,” James said.Before tipoff, Lakers coach JJ Reddick said he wanted to see the passionate side of Dončić, “to have a blackout moment where he’s yelling.” He got that moment when Dončić hit a three-pointer in the final minute of the first half and let out a big scream.“It was great,” Reddick said.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersLuka DončićLeBron JamesNBADenver NuggetsBasketballUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The future of the 76-year-old Hall of Famer remains uncertain as the team navigates a challenging season without him.Victor Wembanyama set to miss rest of NBA season over blood clot fearsRead morePopovich, who has led the Spurs since 1996 and won fiveNBAchampionships, suffered the stroke on 2 November before a game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Assistant coach Mitch Johnson stepped in as interim head coach and has since compiled a 21-27 record while leading a young Spurs squad.The Spurs faced another setback when franchise star Victor Wembanyamawas shut down for the seasonon Thursday after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder.“It’s wild to think of the circumstances we’ve been through as a team this year,” Spurs point guard Chris Paul said. “But like any family, tough times bring you closer.”Despite his absence, Popovich has remained engaged with the team, offering support and strategy input from afar. Known for his sharp wit, Popovich even joked in December that his rehabilitation team had discovered he was “less than coachable”.Spurs CEO RC Buford praised Popovich’s determined recovery efforts, noting, “The same resilience he’s shown as a coach, he’s bringing to his rehab.”Popovich’s legacy extends to the international stage, having also led the United States to a gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Should this mark the end of his coaching career, Popovich would leave the game as the oldest head coach in NBA history.Explore more on these topicsSan Antonio SpursNBAUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

Anyone doubting the determination of Eddie Howe and Nuno Espírito Santo to take their players on grand European tours next season will have revised such opinions after watching the wildly oscillating frenzy that unfolded on a cold Tyneside afternoon.‘It feels like we lost the game’: Howe left bemused by Forest’s comebackRead moreWhen the final whistle blew Howe’s fifth-placed team had closed the gap on Nuno’s Forest to three points and must have felt that Madrid, Milan, Munich and the rest of the Champions League staging posts had moved into sharper focus on the horizon. Much, though, remains alarmingly blurry about a chameleon side whose inconsistency means they veer regularly from brilliance to basic incompetence and back again.After recovering from the concession of an early goal Newcastle showed off their most appealing colours before ultimately forfeiting so much concentration that they very nearly threw away a three-goal cushion as Forest threatened to snatch a draw at the death. By the end Howe’s defence looked like self-destructing at every visiting set piece.If that was a testament to visiting resilience it also indicated that Newcastle remain in peril of being blown off course by the distraction of the Carabao Cup final against Liverpool next month.They began as if their minds were already at Wembley.When Callum Hudson-Odoi caught Jacob Murphy dithering on the ball in the wake of Tino Livramento’s poor throw-in, he pinched possession and proceeded to cut in from the left.Once Hudson-Odoi realised Dan Burn’s giant frame was inadvertently serving as a sizeable screen, creating a blind spot in Nick Pope’s vision he whipped in a swerving, sixth-minute shot, beating the goalkeeper low at the near post.Pope, recalled in place of Martin Dubravka, could hardly have wished for a worsePremier Leaguereturn after evidently expecting to see his reflexes tested at the far post.View image in fullscreenCallum Hudson-Odoi found the target to give Forest an early lead at St James’ Park.Photograph: Rene Nijhuis/MB Media/Getty ImagesNo matter. Forest were about to be felled by four goals in the space of 11 extraordinary minutes. First Miley equalised, swivelling and shooting low, unerringly and left‑footed through a thicket of legs and on beyond Matz Sels. Miley’s youthful face may reflect the reality that he does not turn 19 until May but his body, and particularly his brain, could easily belong to a man 10 years older.Before kick-off much was made of the looming midfield duel between Miley and another Newcastle academy graduate, Forest’s Elliot Anderson, but of that pair it was Howe’s No 67 who built the stronger case for a senior England callup.If it was no accident that Miley, deputising for the not quite fully fit Sandro Tonali in the starting XI, found himself apparently effortlessly in the right place at the right time, Murphy had looked as if he was almost trying too hard to atone for that earlier error.The right-winger needed to relax and, once he did, redemption arrived as Alexander Isak’s clever, unselfish backheel played in Lewis Hall and the fallout from his cross eventually fell to Murphy to bundle past Sels with his chest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Forest had no answer to the latter’s hallmark glide across the turf and all that remained was for Isak to see a left-foot shot sail over Sels after taking a deflection off Murillo.

After failing to heed the warning when Anthony Elanga missed a sitter Newcastle looked mortified as Nikola Milenkovic cleverly flicked a Wood cross past Pope following Anderson’s half-cleared corner.Small wonder that, as his defence failed to deal with Elanga’s 90th‑minute corner and Ryan Yates half volleyed Forest’s third, Howe’s body language turned incandescent.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedNottingham Forestmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Bivol, who narrowly lost a majority decision to the 40-year-old former champion just over four months ago, won the rematch and the sweetest redemption in the early hours of Sunday morning in Riyadh.The scores were exactly the same as they had been in October – with one judge ruling it a 114-114 draw and the two other officials reaching verdicts of 116-112 and 115-113 – but the key difference was that the winning margins were announced in favour of the deserving Bivol.Beterbiev and Bivol are two of the most undemonstrative men in boxing and they both prefer fighting to talking. It seemed appropriate that Bivol, wearing a shimmering silver tunic, walked fast to the ring, occasionally stretching out a glove to touch the hands of admiring spectators. Beterbiev cut a more solemn figure, dressed in a plain black T-shirt and black trunks, as he marched resolutely down the same walkway.Dmitry Bivol defeats Artur Beterbiev for undisputed light heavyweight championship – live reactionRead moreAfter he was introduced by Michael Buffer, in the venerable MC’s typical style of honeyed gravitas, Bivol raised an arm in salute. Beterbiev simply jogged on the spot before matching Bivol’s gesture when his name was hollered to the rafters.Chants of“Bi-vol, Bi-vol, Bi-vol”echoed around the arena as the tension cut deep. The two men tracked each other warily. Bivol was less aggressive than he had been at the start of their first fight – as part of a strategy to conserve his energy for the decisive later stages of the bout. The round ended with Beterbiev landing, but Bivol had been just a little more accurate in that opening stanza.An obvious pattern soon emerged as Beterbiev stalked Bivol with raw aggression. He is a formidable presence but the implacable Bivol countered with sharp punches. Yet Beterbiev kept after him remorselessly as his own plan seemed to centre on bringing a real ferocity from the very start in an effort to drain Bivol of his clinical clarity and energy.But Bivol is a fighter of great class and composure and, in the third, he clipped Beterbiev with slick combinations, as bunches of punches flew from him. Beterbiev responded and pounded Bivol to the body at the bell. He maintained the pace of his attack in the fourth and Bivol was forced to back away and concentrate on defence and self-preservation. There was little time, or room, for Bivol to counter amid the increasingly dark and threatening storm brought by Beterbiev.A riveting fight had begun to unfold. There was a dip for Beterbiev as he gathered himself – but Bivol nailed him with slinky combinations and a hard and beautiful right hand. Such impudence fuelled Beterbiev and he finished the round strongly, landing a couple of heavy blows, including a damaging straight right which appeared to shake the challenger.Bivol, having to absorb the harder punches, needed to maintain his discipline and nerve as they approached the halfway point of a gripping fight. He landed the more eye-catching flurries of punches and briefly negated Beterbiev’s relentless hostility.Red markings were visible on Beterbiev’s forehead but, in round seven, he resumed his determined pursuit. Bivol could not allow himself to relax in the face of suffocating pressure but he still landed the more effective punches. The technician needed all his poise and skill to keep the marauding Beterbiev at bay – before Bivol connected with a shuddering right hook. His confidence flowed as, bouncing lightly on his toes, he kept snapping out the left jab. The fight had begun to sway his way again after winning two successive rounds, the eighth in especially impressive style.View image in fullscreenDmitry Bivol celebrates after Sunday’s win.Photograph: Hamad I Mohammed/ReutersIn round nine, Bivol again held the initiative at the outset. He even made Beterbiev miss with a wild swing and then cracked him with four successive and unanswered punches in a row. It was turning into a Bivol masterclass as he oozed conviction.Nine minutes, the true championship rounds, were left and the fight was still on a knife-edge because Beterbiev came out fast for the 10th. But Bivol managed to slow him with some crisp punches. The champion still stalked him but Bivol jabbed to the head and hit Beterbiev hard to the body. Bivol was then driven into a corner – but he fought back yet again.The chant of‘Bi-vol, Bi-vol, Bi-vol’ resumed in the 11th round and he caught Beterbiev with another peach of a right hand. Even as Beterbiev ratcheted up the intensity, Bivol refused to wilt.Beterbiev’s corner told him he had to win the final round to have a chance to hold onto his world title and unbeaten record. Bivol, however, had trained too hard, and concentrated so fiercely for so long, to let victory slip away. He cracked Beterbiev with another trademark combination with less than a minute left. Beterbiev poured forward one last time, landing a withering left.They were on their feet at ringside as these two extraordinary champions traded at the last bell. Bivol was cut above his swollen left eye and he needed immediate attention to stem the flow of blood. Beterbiev smiled ruefully as the gloves were removed and the sodden wraps were cut from his hands. It had been a searing contest and they awaited the final verdict.The draw was announced first and Bivol looked pained. After the next two scorecards had been read out in favour of the winner, they had to pause yet again before Buffer yelled out the magic words of“and the new…!”Bivol covered his face in relief and then raised his arms with exultation. He was in tears as the four belts were draped over his shoulders.Asked to pinpoint the difference between the two marginal outcomes, Bivol smiled wearily. “Just me,” he said. “I was better. I was pushing myself more. I was more confident. I was lighter. I just wanted to win so much today. I just told myself that he could start from the beginning to distract me, to disturb me. It was hard, to be honest, to keep him at distance for the first four rounds. And then I saw that he’s tired also. I’m tired, but I have to be smarter. I have to punch more cleanly and I did.”The inevitable query followed. Was he ready to face Beterbiev in the rubber match of an unforgettable trilogy? “I’m ready for any challenge,” Bivol said. “But I want a little bit of rest, because I had some injuries and I was using anti-inflammation [medication] almost the whole camp. I want a little bit of time to heal myself and come back.”The defeated man was blunt. “I don’t want to talk about the decision,” Beterbiev snapped before, a little grudgingly, he added: “Congrats, Bivol [and] Bivol’s team…I think this fight was better than first fight, but now it’s my time to come back.”Asked the same question as Bivol about a third bout, Beterbiev smouldered. “Actually I didn’t want the second fight. It wasn’t my choice. But no problem. We’re going to do a third fight.”Beterbiev refused to shake Bivol’s hand before leaving the ring, his disappointment after the first loss of his career burning inside him. He jabbed his finger repeatedly in the direction of the new champion – in a clear sign that he wants the same kind of revenge which had left Bivol beaming in rapture.After these two great fighters have recovered from such an intense and exhausting battle, a definitive conclusion to their simmering rivalry will be irresistible.Explore more on these topicsBoxingUS sportsShareReuse this content"

The Belgian has been under extreme pressure since thehumiliating Scottish Cup exitat the hands of the Scottish Championship side Queen’s Park a fortnight ago, and a first Ibrox lossto St Mirrensince 1991 on Saturday proved to be the final straw for the board.Clement departs Rangers – 13 points adrift of their city rivals Celtic at the top of theScottish Premiership– at a time when the club are in talks about a multimillion-pound investment by a United States-led consortium which includes Paraag Marathe, president of 49ers Enterprises and chairman of Leeds United.Genius-level Salah enters his imperial phase to guide Liverpool to win at City | Barney RonayRead moreA statement fromRangerson Sunday evening read: “Rangers Football Club can confirm it has tonight parted company with men’s first-team manager, Philippe Clement.“The club would like to put on record their sincere thanks to Philippe for his hard work and dedication during his spell in charge. A further update from the club will ­follow in due course.”Clement succeeded Michael Beale in October 2023 and led Rangers to the League Cup two months after his appointment. The former Club Brugge and Monaco manager briefly hauled them into title contention last season, but they eventually finished eight points adrift of Celtic. He was never able to recapture the promising form of his early months in the job.Although he led the club tothe last 16 of the Europa League, where they will face Fenerbahce next month, the 50-year-old vacates his position at Ibrox with Rangers well adrift of Celtic at the top of the league and set to end the season without a domestic trophy.Rangers have struggled badly on their travels this season, winning only five of their 13 away matches in the Premiership, but their relatively strong home form at least kept them clear of the pack in second place.Patrick Stewart, their recently appointed chief executive, had twice given his backing to the increasingly beleaguered manager.However, their last two Ibrox results in effect signalled the end for the 50-year-old, who described ­Saturday’s display in the 2-0 defeat by St Mirren as “by far the worst I’ve seen in all the time I’ve been here”.PA MediaExplore more on these topicsRangersScottish PremiershipnewsShareReuse this content"

Shortly afterwards the Newcastle manager said that, even though his team had won 4-3, he felt as if they had lost one of the most extraordinary Premier League games of the season.Torn between exasperation and relief, Howe did not initially know quite how to react as his side clung on to beat Nuno Espírito Santo’s side in a match the home team had led 4-1 at one stage. It left Newcastle fifth and only three points behind Forest in third after a chaotic afternoon that could exert a significant bearing on Champions League qualification at the end of the season.Newcastle hold off Nottingham Forest as Isak double edges seven-goal thrillerRead more“I am still trying to control my thoughts and stay positive,” Howe said. “It was a crazy game. You’ve seen the best of us and the worst of us. It feels like we lost the game, even though we won it.”At the end Yasir al-Rumayyan, Newcastle’s chair, making a rare visit from Riyadh, stepped on to the pitch and embraced Howe. “It was good to see the chairman but he might have heard a couple of swear words from me,” the manager said. “I think he was in the same sort of emotional state, though.”Newcastle’s Saudi Arabianowners will decide this weekwhether they want the club to remain at a rebuilt St James’ Park or seek planning permission for a new build in nearby Leazes Park and Al-Rumayyan will lead discussions with UK-based directors amid the seclusion of the Northumberland countryside.Any new ground will struggle to host games as dramatic as this. “At our best we were free-flowing and dynamic but we weren’t perfect,” Howe said. “We couldn’t get a grip when we lost momentum in the second half. It was a great first-half performance but we didn’t manage the game well and we showed frailties at set plays.”View image in fullscreenNikola Milenkovic scores Nottingham Forest’s second goal.Photograph: Alex Dodd/CameraSport/Getty ImagesAt leastHowe had Alexander Isak on his side. The manager duly praised his Sweden striker for scoring his 49th and 50th Premier League goals in 76 appearances for the club. “It’s a huge achievement, when Alex plays like he did in the first half, he’s massive for us,” he said.Howe also had warm words for his 18-year-old midfielder Lewis Miley, who shone throughout and scored Newcastle’s first goal. “A really good performance from Lewis Miley,” he said. “I’m very pleased with his development.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In the first half every time Newcastle had the ball they looked like scoring. But I wish there had been another 10 minutes at the end of the second half.

Napoli could not push on in the second half and were punished in the 77th minute, when winger Assane Diao fired home a stunning finish from Nico Paz’s precise pass.“It’s definitely a setback that hurts because of the way it came, because on a mental level we showed cracks, just like in the last three games where we always got caught up,” Conte said.Inter, whodefeated Genoa 1-0 on Saturday, stay a point clear at the top.

Van Persie collected seven victories from his 23 games in charge at Heerenveen, leading the club to ninth place in theEredivisie.Champions League last 16: tie-by-tie analysis and predictionsRead moreVan Persie began his playing career withFeyenoordbefore moving to Arsenal in 2004, joining Manchester United eight years later. He left Old Trafford for Fenerbahce in 2015 and then returned to Feyenoord in 2018, retiring a year later. Van Persie also earned 102 caps for the Netherlands, scoring 50 international goals.In May 2020, the Rotterdam native started work as an assistant to Dick Advocaat at Feyenoord, and later took on coaching roles in his hometown club’s youth setup. He signed a two-year deal with Heerenveen in the summer but had experienced mixed results, including a record 9-1 away defeat by AZ Alkmaar in September.“Everyone knows how special my bond with Feyenoord is,” said Van Persie. “I am enormously looking forward, together with a strong staff, to working with the player group at 1908 [the club’s training ground] and then in De Kuip, supported by the Legion [fans], playing matches and achieving successes together.”Feyenoord are third in the Eredivisie, 11 points behind the leaders, Ajax. They will play Inter in the last 16 of the Champions League after knocking Milan out in the playoffs under the interim manager, Pascal Bosschaart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A dazzling run from Giorgi Chakvetadze created the second goal for Edo ­Kayembe as Watford avenged their dismal defeat at ­Kenilworth Road in October.This convincing win, which ended a run of five successive home defeats, also reignited the ­possibility of a playoff challenge, with Tom ­Cleverley’s team only three points off the top six. Luton were blown away in a windswept ­Hertfordshire to hand their fans a disconsolate journey back up the M1 to Bedfordshire as their rele­gation fears were exacerbated.Bloomfield, who swapped a promotion push in the division below with Wycombe to take on a daunting challenge at Luton, said: “Of course we have to believe in that [stay up]. The boys are fighting and you saw that second half. We have to have the belief to take one of those opportunities but we need to do that at 0-0 and not 2-0 down.”His optimism did not tally with his team’s toothless display and their status as the lowest scorers in the league offers little suggestion they can overhaul the five-point gap to the last safe spot. Bloomfield said: “The players are obviously extremely disappointed with the result and we’re really disappointed we’ve not given the supporters something to cheer about after turning up in incredible numbers.”Watford flew into the early challenges with the players eager to prove a point after their abject performance in that first derby of the season.View image in fullscreenLuton’s goalkeeper, Thomas Kaminski, brings down Mamadou Doumbia to give away a penalty.Photograph: Zac Goodwin/PALuton’s hopes unravelled early on after conceding a penalty. Mads Andersen dithered in defence, trying to shepherd the ball back to his goalkeeper, with Thomas Kaminski clumsily bringing down the striker Mamadou Doumbia. Dele-Bashiru stepped up and fired low past ­Kaminski to spark delight for the home fans.The early breakthrough reinforced Watford’s confidence and their impressive captain, Imran Louza, flashed a shot towards goal from the edge of the area but Kaminski safely held the effort.Luton’s afternoon took a turn for the worse after conceding for the ­second time. Chakvetadze’s mesmerising run into the penalty area bewildered the defence and the Georgia midfielder squared the ball for Kayembe to tap home his eighth goal of the season.Cleverley said: “I thought today was comfortably our best first-half performance this season. We were first to every second ball, we were winning every duel. I thought we really rose to the challenge and ­managed to guide the game in the way we wanted to. I couldn’t be more pleased with the performance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the other end, Chakvetadze remained an ­attacking threat and struck a long-range shot which was comfortably saved. Luton forced their first attempt on target just before half-time with Alfie Doughty’s fierce shot parried to safety by Selvik.Luton’s dire plight was summed up by Bloomfield’s decision to make a triple substitution at the break with Jacob Brown, Christ Makosso and Shandon Baptiste all brought on in attempt to spark belated life into their team.Championship roundup: blunder hands Hull shock victory at SunderlandRead moreShooting towards their fans, Luton started the half with more purpose and Isaiah Jones struck a venomous volley just over the crossbar from Carlton Morris’s cross. This proved a rare foray, though, and they were unable to build any momentum.Another incisive Watford attack almost resulted in a third goal with Kayembe playing in Louza but the midfielder blasted his strike narrowly over the target.Chakvetadze almost capped his influential performance with the goal he merited after another direct run but his strike was pushed round the post by Kaminski. It did not matter, with Watford claiming the bragging rights, after a result that will leave Luton fearing the worst with only 12 matches to save their season.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipWatfordLuton Townmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They miss a round of domestic fixtures as a result and Borthwick uses the time to oversee a warm‑weather training camp in Girona. The extra week’s access to players was also a key part of the previous arrangement between the RFU and the Premiership.The PGP, signed last summer, is said to account for Borthwick to have four weeks’ access this autumn based on the arrangement that England would play three Tests, however. In effect the extra match against Australia – scheduled for 1 November, before subsequent Tests against Fiji, New Zealand and Australia – is set to replace the training camp in Girona.View image in fullscreenFin Smith during an England training session in Girona before the 2024 Six Nations.Photograph: David Ramos/Getty ImagesIt will be a bitter pill for Borthwick to swallow because he considers the extra training week crucial as he tries to build cohesion within his squad. He and his players have talked regularly of the difficulty in coming together from 10 Premiership clubs to gel before a campaign and now Borthwick will have one less week to get everyone on the same page. Players will be available for their clubs the weekend before the Australia Test so Borthwick will have to contend with potentially injury problems, too.According to the Times newspaper, he is deeply frustrated by the situation.Last autumn, England lost the first three of their four Tests – going down against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa – before beating Japan. They began the series sluggishly and Borthwick said after the South Africa defeat that his players did not begin the series in good enough condition compared with their south hemisphere counterparts. Getting them up to speed this year will now be an altogether more difficult task.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former captain Will Carling described England’s victory as “very ugly” while the World Cup winner Will Greenwood said “they simply play no rugby”.Scotland scored three tries to England’s one – a controversial score by Freeman amid uncertainty over whether he grounded the ball – but the 23-year-old winger sought to explain his side’s approach.“Our strategy is either to go long and find some grass and keep them down in that end, and then hopefully get the ball even further up or off transition,” he said.“Or we go to that contestable kick, and hope you’ll get some good rewards off of having a loose ball and hopefully getting some ball back and then unstructured defences off the back of it. So there’s a strategy to it. We understand it can get too much.”View image in fullscreenSteve Borthwick is hopeful Tom Curry will be fit to face Italy.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAfter a couple of days off, England will convene on Wednesday for a training camp in York with Borthwick hopeful Tom Curry and Tom Willis will be available to face Italy. Curry looked in distress when hobbling off against Scotland but Borthwick revealed he had a dead leg while Willis sustained a head injury and will go through the return-to-play protocols.George Martin, who was absent against Scotland after dropping out of the squad with a knee problem, is also expected to be available but Furbank is likely to miss England’s run-in as he continues his recovery from a broken arm. Borthwick said: “It’s going to be very, very tight to play in the championship given he’s not played, but he’s on track healing-wise. George Martin, all being well, everything should be right for the last part of the championship.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

An attacker exploited security controls and was able to transfer the assets. Zhou said all other wallets on the exchange were unaffected.The price of Ethereum dropped by nearly 4% following news of the hack on Friday, but has since almost returned to previous levels.The company has called on “the brightest minds in cybersecurity and crypto analytics” to help it try to recover the hacked funds, and is offering a reward of 10% of the amount recovered, which could total $140m if the entire hacked amount was retrieved.“Bybit is determined to rise above the setback and fundamentally transform our security infrastructure, improve liquidity, and be a steadfast partner to our friends in the crypto community,” Zhou said in a statement.The hack is a setback for the crypto industry, which hasrebounded in recent monthsafter benefiting fromDonald Trump’sreturn to the White House, and his promises to make the US the “crypto capital of the planet”amid looser regulation.Although the identity of the Bybit attacker is unknown, some reports have suggested that the perpetrators could beNorth Korean state hackers, such as the Lazarus Group, who have been blamed for previous large-scale heists, including the$615m theft from the blockchain project Ronin Groupin 2022.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeCryptocurrenciesE-commerceDubaiHackingnewsShareReuse this content"

While he praised all the benefits that have flowed from the arrival of theiPhone, he said he feels a responsibility for the unintended, negative aspects. This is in his mind when he makes decisions about the tech of the future, he added.Ive’s concern about the threat posed by AI is mixed with his excitement about its possibilities, he said. His main worry is the unchecked speed of development. “We need time to understand and react,” he said. He did not give details of the AI project he spoke about working on last autumn with OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman, but is enthusiastic: “It’s probably the first time in my career that I’m inspired by capability in this way.”Among Ive’s musical choices were Don’t You (Forget About Me) by Simple Minds and part of the soundtrack from the Disney Pixar robot movie Wall-E.Explore more on these topicsDesignThe ObserverSteve JobsAppleiPhoneApple WatchDesert Island DiscsRadio 4newsShareReuse this content"

John predicted the proposal “would devastate our creative community”, while helping “powerful foreign technology companies”.View image in fullscreenIllustration: Chris Riddell/The ObserverThe letter specifically targets a clause of the government’s ­upcomingAI Opportunity Action Plan, which argues that an end to copyright restrictions and intellectual property law is needed to allow greater data-mining of artwork and writing.The signatories say they ­understand the government aim of ­boosting growth, but describe themselves as “staring in astonishment” at Whitehall’s eagerness “to ­hastily wrap our live’s work in attractive paper as a welcome gift to automated competitors”.“Imagine asking ChatGPT to generate your child’s artwork instead of asking the child. And then sticking that on the fridge. It’s a horrible thought, isn’t it?” said children’s book author and illustrator Ged Adamson.“Why then are we scooping up ­creativity en masse to build something without any soul that will rob us, not only of income, but maybe eventually our ability to think ­creatively?“The idea that all this work and dedication and honing skills was ­ultimately just to make tech billionaires even richer – it makes me feel sick, angry and depressed.”His fellow author Davies said he fears that “the basis of an entire creative culture” is on the point of being sold off. “They’re not even bothering to tell us it will benefit us in the long run because they know that it won’t,” he told theObserver.“Copyright ­protects individual ­creative output and this proposal rides roughshod over that.

The livelihood of workers will become their profit,” said Adamson.The campaign also aims to dispel popular misconceptions. AI, they argue is not innovative. It can only re-mix the past. It cannot discard old prejudices or develop new positions. “If we do not take steps now to protect and respect the space for human culture, creativity and the creators of the future we may lose what it means to be human entirely,” argues supporter Susie Alegre, the author of Human Rights, Robot Wrongs… Being Human in the Age of AI. “Destruction of cultural heritage is an international crime, in part because it paves the way to inhumanity. Without creatives there is no cultural heritage.”View image in fullscreenA children’s book illustration by Ged Adamson, one of the letter’s signatories.Illustration: Ged AdamsonAnother signatory, picture book creator Chris Haughton, insists it is not about being “anti-tech”. “But the way generative AI operates is not at all creatively exciting. It is stealing,” he said this weekend. “If these lobbies succeed in convincing our government we will effectively be handing all the wealth created by the creative industries, hundreds of billions, and giving it all straight to the tech industry.”Abe argues that the representation of diverse and minority groups will take a step back if AI takes the creative reins. “For BAME people, especially east- and south-east Asian, authors and illustrators, the door to the children’s book industry has finally cracked open over the past five years and some of us have managed to squeeze into the super-competitive world,” she said. “But generative AI will create unfair competition for all creatives, and minority creatives would be the first ones to be squeezed back out.”Her co-campaigner, Ciraolo, adds that the early mistakes made with social media are about to be repeated if there is no protest and the right voices are not heard. “Nothing of what the government proposed offers a single good thing for us. The consultation was designed to create a sense of inevitability, to put people off objecting to it and make us cave in in advance,” she said, pointing out that artists are far from “jealous gate-keepers of privilege”, but instead are hard-working and badly paid.“I am worried we are taking away from kids the opportunity to learn the skills that take effort to develop, but give them a lot of confidence and satisfaction. Generative AI looks like creativity, but it robs you of embodied skills,” she said.The headline of this article was amended on 23 February 2025 to correct the spelling of Michael Rosen’s first name.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverTeen booksPublishingComputingProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

So here are the best vibrators available.

I’ve worked as an expert independent research and development consultant for more than a dozen adult product companies; I’m a board member of theVagina Museumin London; I’m a campaigner for sexual health and gynaecological charities, includingTerrence Higgins Trustandthe Eve Appeal; and I helped write many of your favourite characters’ lines about dildos, douching and desire in the hit Netflix series Sex Education. All this means I’m well qualified to assess whether these devices have been crafted decently.I’m also a freelancer who works from home. I’ll leave it at that.Types of vibratorView image in fullscreenThe Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1.Asking, “What’s the best sex toy?” is a bit like asking, “What’s the best tool?”: a plethora exists, and selecting the most suitable one is influenced by what you want it to do. Here, I’ve examined three popular styles of vibrators.BulletsSmall, versatile vibrators for external use only. They’re primarily designed for targeted clitoral stimulation but can be used to tickle nipples, glide up the insides of thighs, or take on a tour practically anywhere on the body (except inside the anus – that’s not safe).WandsLarge vibrators with broad heads, again for external use only. Wands deliver the most powerful vibrations over a wide area – this sector is where you’ll find the most bone-shaking master blasters on the market. Fantastic for people who need intense stimulation, and good for deep body massage, too.RabbitsThese vibrators have two parts: an insertable shaft, designed to stimulate inside the vaginal canal and excite the G-spot, and an external head that stimulates the clitoris. This “dual stimulation” is intended to provoke a “blended orgasm”: a climax induced by mixing multiple forms of simultaneously delivered sensation.The best bullet vibratorsBest bullet vibrator overall:We-Vibe Tango XView image in fullscreen£79 at We-Vibe£79 at AmazonThe original Tango came out about 15 years ago, and it’s consistently remained so high up in expert rankings that by this stage it might have altitude sickness.Why we love itIts Goat status is justified: while many bullets offer “buzzy”, high-frequency vibrations that don’t travel far into the body, the Tango is satisfyingly “rumbly” for its size, providing additional lower-frequency stimulation that carries deeper into tissues and awakens more nerve endings. It packs a lot of oomph into its small size.This latest incarnation features a silicone grip to make it less slippery to hold, while the business end remains hard and glossy. There’s nothing to muffle the vibrations: they’re full-on and focused, which isexactlywhat tickles many people’s pickles. Others may find the feeling too “sharp”, however.Three separate buttons to increase/decrease power and change pulse patterns make it easy to find the exact output to suit you. There’s excellent variety between the settings, the lowest of which is more a brisk twitch than a vibration. Plus, a travel lock means you won’t have to trot out the “it must be my electric toothbrush!” line when your handbag starts humming.It’s a shame that …the magnetic charger can be accidentally knocked off its connections, but it’s more hygienic than a lead that needs to plug into a hole in the toy.Speeds:eightVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:two hoursCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbullet for innovation:Hot Octopuss AMOView image in fullscreen£49.95 at Hot Octopuss£49.95 at AmazonAnother tiny yet mighty toy that, given its petite dimensions, is a powerful rumbler. Hot Octopuss is a skilled inventor: its suite of ingenious toys includesPulse – the world’s first “Guybrator”that can induce orgasms from a flaccid penis as well as an erect one, proving a boon for cancer survivors, disabled people and others with erectile difficulties.Why we love itAMO’s ingenuity is in the way it’s sculpted, with a pointy tip for pinpoint pleasure; a broader head on the opposite side for more diffuse vibrations; and a fin-like profile for nestling lengthways between labia. It’s made of silky silicone, which – unlike tougher plastics – won’t hurt or slide around if you press down on it to apply extra pressure.It’s a shame that …the battery life isn’t better, and the payoff of the inventive contours is that the AMO can’t be inserted into strap-ons, dildos or other toys that rely on a standard-shape bullet.Speeds:sixVibe patterns:fivePower:rechargeableRun time:40 minutesCharge time:two to three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestsustainable bullet:Love Not War MayaView image in fullscreen£89.99 at Love Not War£89.99 at VeoIf you want to feel the earth move without harming the planet, Love Not War is your friend with benefits. Its Maya bullet is made from recycled aluminium in a hydroelectric-powered factory, and minimally packaged in a brown cardboard box printed with soy ink.Why we love itSeven different screw-on heads are sold separately to convert the bullet into, say, amini wandorG-spot probe. Interchangeable efforts I’ve tried in the past have suffered from insufficiently strong motors, so they haven’t been able to successfully transmit vibrations throughout each attachment, especially longer/larger ones. Love Not War is mounting an admirable battle against that challenge, however.It’s a shame that …at £45 a pop, amassing a collection of heads will cost you a pretty penny – although the brand will plant a tree for each one sold.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:Love Not War will repair toys to keep them alive for as long as possible‘Expect to see snake-like peeling’: 19 self-care treats for the perfect pick-me-upRead moreBest softand sensual option:Smile Makers The FirefighterView image in fullscreen£44.95 at Boots£49.95 at Beauty BayBullets are often designed to treat the genitals like a game of darts: if the clitoris is the bullseye, they aim to hit it dead on. The Firefighter instead approaches stimulation more like a curling match: gently brushing, sweeping and edging towards a climax.Why we love itThe fluttering, flickering flame-shaped head will suit those who prefer a slow, delicate buildup before switching to the more traditional, targeted “pointy finger” part of the toy.It’s a shame that …it only comes in pink.The Surfer, another Smile Makers bullet, is a refreshingly unusual zesty orange.Speeds:fourVibe patterns:twoPower:rechargeableRun time:three hoursCharge time:two to two-and-a-half hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBestbudget bullet:The Rocks OffRO-90View image in fullscreen£10.99 at Rocks Off£9.95 at AmazonRocks Off makes a whole shooting range of cheap-and-cheerful battery-powered bullets. Take your pick of pointed, rounded, angled or lipstick-shaped tip; select a slick gloss, powdery matt or silicone finish; and choose from more colours than the fabric of Joseph’s Dreamcoat, including one that changes from purple to pink in response to body heat.Why we love itIt’s a fair amount of bang for very few bucks. I singled out the RO-90 as my best budget buy because the AAA battery it takes is much easier to source than the N-size variety insidethe smaller RO-80 model. The slightly longer shaft makes it better suited to use for penetrative play, too, if that’s your bag.Hats off to Rocks Off as well for its four-year collaboration with disability charity Enhance The UK to developa truly accessible toy range, Quest. A 5% share of sales from that collection goes back to the charity.It’s a shame that …single-button controls mean you have to cycle all the way through speeds/pulses to change them. I also question how the shiny metallic finishes might stand up to long-term cleaning.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:1 x AAA batteryRun time:three hours 30 minutesWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsThe best rabbit vibratorsBest rabbit vibrator overall:Je Joue Hera FlexView image in fullscreen£87.20 at Je Joue£109 at SuperdrugThe Hera Flex is such a good problem-solver, it could probably win an algebra contest.Since everyone’s anatomy is different and distances between vaginas and clitorises vary, a frequent dilemma with rabbits is that once the shaft is inserted, the external stimulator doesn’t quite rest on the right spot. Many toys are too rigid to allow sufficient bending and angle adjustment to solve this issue.Why we love itThis Je Joue genius solves that: it’s as flexible as a yoga master and both parts of it are poseable, allowing you to easily customise how it curves to fit your bits. Another irritating rabbit habit is that the “ears” intended to tickle either side of the clitoris can pinch, poke or catch against sensitive flesh, depending on how your body happens to be built. Here, the Hera is a hero once more, replacing the traditional bunny head with a plush, spongy, smooth “thumb”. If you’re someone with a more frilly clitoral hood or labia that gets painfully pulled by rabbit ears, this could be a real thumbs up. A quality, thoughtfully re-engineered rabbit reboot.It’s a shame that …there’s a bit of a jump between the first two power levels. A steadier climb would be preferable. The squishiness of the Hera Flex won’t suit folks who prefer firmer pressure on their hotspots, either. But as so often in the world of sex toys, that’s rather like saying, “people who prefer raspberries shouldn’t choose this banana”; it’s a question of taste, rather than a product being bad.Speeds:fiveVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:one hour and 30 minutesWarranty:one yearBest for temperature titillation:Lovehoney Glow BunnyView image in fullscreen£79.99 at LovehoneyIf you just want to use this toy as an old-school rabbit, it’s a solid choice … but it also has new-fangled tricks up its sleeve.Why we love itThe temperature-play plate on the top of the shaft heats to 38C in less than two minutes, feeling almost like a warm tongue, and swiftly cools to 18C, giving a whole new meaning to “Netflix and chill”. I imagine the cold setting could be particularly enticing during sweltering summer nights, and it works nicely for nipple play, too.It’s a shame that …the power is perfectly acceptable, but not perfect for the power-hungry.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:fourPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:three hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:100 daysBestfor air pulse stimulation:Womanizer Duo 2View image in fullscreen£189 at Womanizer£189 at BootsAdmittedly, this looks more like something Star Trek’s Captain Picard should be at the helm of than a conventional rabbit. Rather than stimulating the clitoris with vibrations, the Duo 2 uses pulses of air to create a throbbing, sucking effect. Womanizer was the first to introduce this technology to the adult market in 2014, when it represented one of the most groundbreaking innovations in years.Why we love itThe firm continues to be a pioneer. This toy boasts multiple proprietary features, including “Smart Silence”: it will only turn on when in contact with skin. This means the battery life is preservedandyou don’t have to fumble to switch it off in a panic if your intimacy is interrupted.An Autopilot mode alternates between surprise pulse patterns and intensities to prevent masturbation from becoming predictable, while the Afterglow setting helps you gradually wind down post-climax, rather than simply switching off.It’s a shame that …the shape takes getting used to, and there are now more intuitive (and affordable) suction and vibration rabbit toys available. That said, I believe the Duo 2 is worth mastering due to its god-tier-level exclusive features.Speeds:14Vibe patterns:10Power:rechargeableRuntime:two hoursCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:five yearsBestfor an innovative shaft:Satisfyer Air Pump Bunny 1View image in fullscreen£58.95 at Satisfyer£39.97 at AmazonSatisfyer is known for two things. First, making excellent-quality, more affordable “dupes” of aspirational high-end sex toys – almost like an Aldi version of Lelo and co. Second, and in contrast to the first, rolling outvastmultitudes of its own novel inventions, including this Air Pump Bunny.Why we love itIt sports an inflatable shaft that can be enlarged by up to 15mm in diameter at the touch of a button, producing a “filling” sensation that some find mind-blowing. This could be just the ticket if your orgasm is intensified by the presence of a girthy internal toy, giving your vaginal muscles something to clench around as the waves of climax hit (more common than is discussed), especially if you need to build up to having something wide inside you. Magnetic charging, smart buttons and a walloping 15-year warranty show this toy is more than just hot air.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

There was a wind-up vibrator that required eight minutes of hand-cranking and looked like something you’d find in an army medical tent, and a solar-powered bullet that had to stay attached to its charging panel to work. But now the Natural Love Company is making beautiful, talented toys, with eco credentials, including the incorporation of reclaimed ocean plastics and carbon-neutral delivery.Why we love itI was intrigued to check out the Senna after being impressed bythe Yarrow: a willow-green rabbit with a thrusting head that’s far more graceful-looking than this kind of gadget has any right to be. The Senna’s undulating shaft mimics a “come hither” motion, with swirling beads beneath a buttery-soft silicone covering, while the rabbit ears have been swapped for a little pulsating bean. It’s another winner that’ll give your knees the hippy shakes.It’s a shame that …the crevices around the clitoral stimulating nub need extra attention to keep clean and bacteria-free between uses.Speeds:threeVibe patterns:sevenPower:rechargeableRuntime:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:one yearBestnewanimal:Snail Vibe CurveView image in fullscreen£119 at Sh!£119.99 at Love HoneyA new animal enters the scene, with an ingenious take on how to tackle those pesky rabbit problems. Instead of bunny ears, the Snail Vibe Curve has a vibrating spiral “shell” that rests externally on the clitoris. As you insert the internal shaft, this shell unrolls to maintain constant clitoral contact – check out the videos onSnail Vibe’s websiteto see what I mean. You can enjoy penetration that’s as shallow or deep as you wish or thrust the toy back and forth, without the clitoral stimulator slipping out of place.The Snail has received a glow-up for its Curve edition, with a ribbed texture applied to the shell; magnetic charging; and most usefully, the addition of a looped handle for easier handling. It has two pleasingly throbby motors on the shell and shaft, which can be independently controlled to fine-tune your experience, inside and out. It takes a while to find your way around a toy this curious, but the payoff is worthwhile.It’s a shame that …the buttons are a fraction fiddly, and don’t think about trombones during use or you won’t be able to stop laughing.Speeds:five for each motorVibe patterns:five for each motorPower:rechargeableRun time:one hourCharge time:two hoursWaterproof:yesWarranty:two yearsBest budget rabbit:BondaraScrewballMonAmourView image in fullscreen£45.99 at BondaraAn aesthetic homage to the popularLelo Soraya 2that costs a quarter of the price.

The hoop handle is intended for users to loop their fingers through, so their thumb rests naturally on the controls, but you could also thread silky bondage rope through it for … reasons.It’s a shame that …Bondara recommends that the Screwball isn’t left plugged in for more than four hours, to avoid impairing the battery over time. That’s a pest if you want to charge overnight (or while you’re at work).

The mains-powered Doxy Die Cast is arguably as hard as you can go. It’s not for the faint of heart (or parts), but it’s so powerful that it can probably conjure up an orgasm through walls. And speaking of your hopefully thick walls, you don’t get 3,000-9,000 revs a minute of power without noise, so be aware this is loud enough to sound like you need a licence to drive it.Why we love itDoxy makes arechargeable Die Cast(£164.99), and several superbsmaller, lighter cordless wands, too. However, I’m recommending the plug-in version because its formidable power never stops. It has a three-metre lead, so it stretches most places you want it to go – if you’re already considering a toy the size of a rounders bat, portability probably isn’t a big concern. I’ve had a version for a decade and a half, and it’s still impeccable.Nothing about the Die Cast is subtle, but I’d argue that the push for sex toys to be “discreet” has roots in shame. Multiple women who’ve sought my advice for anorgasmia have called me, ecstatic, after my Doxy tipoff has tipped them over into their first ever climax: something unabashed that works is better than something understated that doesn’t. Invest in the customisable By You edition, and get ready to rumble.It’s a shame that …at 690g, it’s heavy as hell.

In addition to his links to love and lust, Saint Valentine is also the patron saint of beekeeping, so he would feel quite at home amid the cacophony of buzzing that soundtracked the production of this article.I discounted any products not made from body-safe materials, such as porous jellies that can harbour bacteria and dirt, or plastics containing phthalates, which have been linked to cancer and hormonal interference. I considered things such as whether each device lived up to the claims made by its manufacturer; how easy it was to position and control; how fast it charged and how long the battery lasted, where relevant; and how attractive, adaptable, powerful and comfortable it was.What Ididn’tdo was automatically label a toy as a “holy grail”, or an “almighty fail” if it didn’t happen to float my idiosyncratic boat, or provide what I personally need to reach orgasm, through no inherent fault of its own. Deciding upon the “best” vibrator is highly subjective, so I’ve tried to explain how different items might suit different folks.When making your own considerations, useful questions to ask include:Do I prefer gentle or potent vibrations (or both)? What styles of touch delight me, and do I want external or internal stimulation (or both)?What shape and size of toy will suit my body and my tastes?Do I want something simple, straightforward and intuitive, or experimental/multi-functional/tech-enabled?What materials and textures feel inviting to me?A note on volume: some reviews rate toys on how quiet they are, but I’ve NEVER met a vibe that’s as near-silent as it says it is. For that reason, I’ve only pointed out when a toy is notably loud enough to sound like you’ve rented it from a builders’ merchant.In almost all cases, you do have to put your hand in your pocket if you want the best. Strong motors, neat details and high-performance designs don’t tend to come cheap. I believe pleasure should be accessible to all, though, so there’s at least one budget option included in each category. It’ll have some compromises, but it should give you plenty of “Ooh!” for not much dough.Can vibrators decrease your sensitivity?Let me reassure you: using vibrators will not cause nerve damage to your genitals. However, if, over a prolonged period, youalwaysreach for a toy when masturbating – particularly if it’s a high-strength model like a mains-powered wand – you may inadvertently condition your body to become used to intense stimulation. Much like a curry fan who’s been mainlining vindaloo and is then served a masala, the comparatively gentle feelings provided by fingers or partners may begin to feel less spicy, and you may struggle to orgasm without the potent or pinpointed vibrations with which you’ve become familiar.A similar problem arises for people with penises who hold themselves very tightly and use rough motions during solo play. American sex educator Dan Savage nicknamed this “the death grip”, and it can cause erectile dysfunction and difficulties ejaculating via the relative tenderness of intercourse.Luckily, solutions are simple. First: chill out on your vibrator use, to give your body time to reappraise the delights of the delicate. You may want to try a period of abstinence, where you return to manual masturbation without grabbing a toy. Or if you’ve been cranking your toy’s power straight up to 11, try being a little less Spın̈al Tap and experimenting with softer speeds and patterns. Lubricant can help too, by cushioning sensitive tissues a little.If you find that sex without toys simply doesn’t feel as good, another option is to involve your toys in sex. Contrary to many people’s fears, vibrators can’t replace the profound intimacy and thrill of being with another human being, but they can vastlyenhanceshared experiences – they’re complementary co-pilots, not competitors.If you’re someone who feels threatened by toys, it may help to think of them as specialist equipment. You wouldn’t feel emasculated or belittled if you had to equip yourself with an axe to cut down a tree instead of just using your bare hands, right? Instead, it’s more impressive to learn to wield that equipment like a pro; whether you want to chop timber or set your partner’s night alight. Using the right apparatus the right way is the fastest route to successfully starting a fire. Ask your lover to show you how they like the toy to be positioned, and be eager to take on any feedback they give.Alix Fox is an award-winning writer and broadcaster specialising in sexual wellbeing and culture, with 20 years of experience in receiving dick pics sent not to titillate, but because the worried texter wants an informed opinion on a weird lump/rash/wart.

Try switching off your news alertsEva WisemanAs much as we need to stay informed, that relentless ping of potential horrors can’t be good for usSun 23 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 03.27 ESTShareHow are you not going mad?” is a thing I’ve heard recently. “How are you not talking about this all the time, how are you merrily, some say stupidly, going about your business as if the world did not feel like a coin in an arcade 2p machine, being pushed slowly but definitely off the edge and tasting of blood?” My answer: I’ve turned off breaking news alerts. More than that, I’ve dramatically limited the news I read. How am I not going mad? This is how I’m not going mad.Perhaps turning away from the news is a silly and job-endangering thing to admit to as somebody employed by a news organisation. Perhaps it’s unattractive or exposing, as somebody living in a time when news is currency and ignorance is fatal. But I have seen the red-eyed horror of people immersed, I have felt the heat of anxiety, that burning shiver of the spine, and I’ve lain awake beside scrolling thumbs that dig deeper and deeper into algorithms that know us better than our own mothers, and are just as likely to shape who we become.I don’t want to sound self-righteous. I still believe we have a responsibility to avoid complete ignorance, to engage and resist and all that stuff, to “stay informed” and remain awake to injustice, stupidity, the slow slide of democracy, and I certainly don’t think everybody needs to turn off the news. For many of us though, remaining awake to injustice has come to mean staying awake all night as our phones feed us dread like foie-gras geese. Digesting chaos becomes a crucial part of a daily routine – you check the horrors, you brush your teeth, you check the horrors, you get the kids dressed, quick checking of the horrors while you have your coffee, and on it goes. It becomes addictive too – it feels as though too much is happening and all the time, and there grows a fear of missing something, something important that we need to know now, a fear that drags us in daylight, jaggedy and raw, back to the pipe.Our phones light up to the same degree whether the breaking news is murder or pizza or bombs or prizesAnd the alerts, the alerts! The alerts that act as sharp pinches, reminding us we can never relax, the alerts keeping us alert, keeping us vibrating on this frequency ofoh no oh no. I see it all the time – at desks and dinner tables, the low buzz of breaking news will cause a mass flinch, a grim “Oh God what now” as hands reach to reveal what could be reports of cannon-fire over Manchester or the death of a beloved TV dog. All alerts sound the same, our phones light up to the same degree whether the breaking news is murder or pizza or bombs or prizes. People are not designed to be shocked from their working slumbers five times a day with the silent scream of news. And every time we think, is this it? Is this the news that will ruin our lives?Elsewhere the tick tick tick of potential explosions leads many of us to channel our despair and fear into simple outrage. Posting noisily online might scratch a brief itch but, like with mosquito bites, it only makes the bite worse. We’ve seen now how outrage fuels social media sites and profits their right-wing owners, who push for more.Plus the more we post about, for example, a corrupt president, the more news about them our internet delivers to us. It’s like a sick mirror version of the experience of falling in love – everywhere we look we see him, and everywhere we go we hear his name, and the more we read about him the more there is to read, a terrible self-fulfilling cycle of dread.I’m still paying attention to the news, but I’m not spending all I’ve got. Still, conversations with friends begin with their groans of disbelief and disgust, depending on how much the news might intimately impact them. And even when it doesn’t, of course it does, sometimes in how it shapes their sense of hope or morality, sometimes simply in how their increasing engagement with the news affects their dwindling engagement with their own domestic life, their eyes glued to unfolding events, obsessed with a story that will never end. Worse than those conversations is when I find myself in the middle of a news battle between two men, the day’s discourse lobbed across a party like spaghetti, their faces coated in bloated panic.The aim, I think, is to stay connected without having the news possess you. To remain informed but not loiter in outrage. What use are we to the world if all our energy is wasted sprinting through stories, instead of giving our time to the subjects that matter most to us? Some relief, perhaps, comes with the reminder that the act of reading the news doesn’t change it.A sensible way to wean oneself off 10-minutely updates might be to read the paper in the mornings only, or, instead of trying to drink in everything (a task that creates an abstract sort of terror that freezes you to the edge of your bed where you sit, shivering in a towel), to concentrate only on the angles of a single story. How are you not going mad, they say, and if I’m replying honestly, I say I am sometimes goingquitemad, but rather than a scattershot anxiety, mine points only in one direction at a time.

Clearly, it’s not just a bailout of an ageing steel plant.This package is the first step in turning a crisis into a nation-building opportunity by creating a new industry from the legacy of an old one.Much discussion has focused on the failure of GFG Alliance and its British CEO,Sanjeev Gupta, to deliver on the promises made when their Liberty Steel operation took over the remnants of BHP’s OneSteel holdings in 2017.The lesson is thatsaviours are almost never what they seem, especially when circumstances and hubris conspire against them.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailAs I commented at the time on theABC’s Australian Story: “When Mr Gupta arrived here, the business community thought, ‘here’s a man who has arrived from another planet’.”Eager to avoid Abbott 2.0 accusations, Peter Dutton price-matched Labor’s $8.5bn Medicare plan in a matter of hoursRead moreLiberty Steel had already transformed several moribund plants across Europe and, against the odds, made them profitable. Newport in Wales was the standout example until, like the others, it had to undergo “reconfiguration” withsignificant job losses.Gupta not only had the misfortune to be associated with Greensill Capital, which left him with a mountain of debt, he also massively overreached in 2020 with a bid for the ThyssenKrupp group. Germany’s business and political class were quick to circle the wagons.It was at this point that everything started to unravel in Australia, with both Greensill and GFG Alliance being chased through courts and regulatory bodies around the world. No longer were there parades in the streets of Whyalla, but rather a growing queue of creditors and unpaid royalties.Now imagine you are a federal government policymaker with a newly minted “Future Made in Australia” plan to promote economic resilience and net zero emissions. And you’re working with a premier whose state has a proud history of industrial strategy.Essentially, there are three options.The first option is the easiest – to just let the company fail with devastation in its wake. This is the market “solution” – so deeply embedded in public policy by the Productivity Commission that we have almost no manufacturing left in Australia.The focus here is implicitly on Australia’s “comparative advantage” in unprocessed raw materials to avoid a “misallocation of resources”.The second option is to put the company into administration and hope that a buyer might be interested in a degraded asset loaded up with debt. This option could be sweetened by bailout funds, but the dismal experience of untied support for Qantas during Covid has made it less attractive for governments, let alone taxpayers.The third option is the approach currently being taken by the Albanese government, which is to co-invest with a private sector buyer not only in restoring short-term viability but in the development of a gamechanging new green iron and steel facility.This option includes the prospect of taking a public stake, with a return to the community.Over time, we will see renewable energy driving green steel production … This is what a decarbonised circular economy looks likeIn the absence of a buyer, the government might even take the entire project into public ownership as part of a broader industry plan supported by off-budget investment funds, such as the new green iron investment fund, national reconstruction fund and CleanEnergyFinance Corporation.For those concerned about “picking winners”, the point is that governments pick winners constantly in Australia and globally. The important thing is to avoid the losers.South Korea was told in the 1950s that they would be lucky to be self-sufficient in rice production. Instead, they created the sixth-largest steelmaker in the world, with assistance from BHP technicians.Green steel products will bring premium prices in international markets, especially with the advent of the Europeancarbon border adjustment mechanism. Accenture estimates $122bn in additional export revenue from green metals by 2040.Here in Australia, we require not just railway lines and construction materials but at least 6,000 wind towers along with transmission grid infrastructure, both onshore and offshore. Of course, these can be imported, but they also provide a guaranteed market for domestically produced steel if we build them here.Zelenskyy says he would ‘quit for peace’ as he refuses US demand for Ukraine mineralsRead moreThis is an opportunity to create an innovative new industry with a manufacturing base in Whyalla, Port Kembla and Newcastle and an extensive supply chain across the country. The government has just announced an additional $500m from the Future Made in Australia innovation fund to make it happen.Over time, we will see renewable energy driving green steel production, either directly or through a hydrogen process at scale, for use in wind towers to generate more renewable energy. This is what a decarbonised circular economy looks like.Denmark is known for building a world-leading wind tower industry with the strategic application of knowledge and engineering skills. Australia can do the same and take the next step, which is to reinvent the industry as a catalyst of economic transformation.Emeritus Prof Roy Green AM is special innovation adviser at the University of Technology SydneyExplore more on these topicsEnergyOpinionSanjeev GuptaSteel industrySouth AustraliaBusiness (Australia news)Anthony AlbanesecommentShareReuse this content"

Part of her care, and our joy as owners, was the monthly application of spot-on worm and flea treatment. With veterinary medicine on my mind as a career, I relished the theatre of vets-at-home. We bought doses over the counter, scheduling the dog’s treatment on the calendar like a five-a-side.We applied these drugs to our dog because every other owner did. Because it was encouraged, because it was easy, because it felt right.New research confirms the use of such veterinary drugs as an unmanned checkpoint in the landscape of environmental contamination. Put simply, caring for our dog was polluting the natural world. Astudy from the University of Sussexreveals songbirds as the latest victims. Blue tits and great tits are two of many birds that line their nests with animal fur. Every sampled nest contained fipronil and 89% contained imidacloprid and permethrin – three insecticides so potent they have been banned for agricultural use in the UK and EU, but can be bought by anyone for use on pets.In the study, nest mortality correlated with drug concentration. Eggs never hatched; chicks expired after hatching – at a time whenalmost half of all UK bird species are in a state of serious decline. “The simplest explanation is that eggs and chicks are getting a sufficient dose of pesticide from the nest lining to kill. There’s enough medication in the environment to pollute every single blue and great tit nest,” says Prof Dave Goulson, a co-author of the study.Bird nest pollution mirrors the state of our rivers. Studies by Dr Rosemary Perkins found fipronil persists in99% of samples taken from 20 English rivers, with imidacloprid found in 66% of samples. My dog was one of the approximately 17.5 million cats and dogs in the UK – about80% of the total of 22 million– that get regular over-the-counter worm and flea treatment, whether suffering from an infestation or not. One flea treatment of a medium-sized dog contains enough pesticide to kill 60 million bees. Will it take the silence of vanishing biodiversity for us to hear nature’s cry?Goulson is one of many scientists warning of collateral damage from veterinary drugs, but a regulatory blind spot has kept the environmental repercussions largely hidden – hushed like an interruption. Pet medications aren’t subject to the same risk assessments as they are for use on livestock. When flea treatments entered the market in the 1990s, their environmental impact was assumed trivial.I sense the veterinary profession has been caught off-guard by this ethical battle of balancing pet health with environmental responsibility. “It’s a real dilemma,” says Dr Sean McCormack, a small animal vet and conservationist. “As a vet, you’ve taken an oath to ‘protect and enhance animal welfare’. But you’re contaminating nature – how did we miss this?”Pets aren’t the only source. A recent study shows that handwashing by owners in the weeks after spot-on treatmentis also a major contributor. And McCormack describes the down-the-drain pathway of fipronil administered in “insane quantities” across equestrian facilities to protect hooves and fetlocks against feather mites. Horses return to muddy fields, and fipronil leaches into water and soil, fast and unseen. Vets find themselves in a tough position. They are constrained by the absence of viable alternatives, the expectations of millions of pet owners trying to do the right thing, and the biological phenomenon of the flea.Flea infestations can be fatal, and effective flea treatments must eliminate more than 90% of fleas in the environment. Otherwise, their staggering reproductive rate –a flea can lay 50 eggs a day– makes control nigh impossible. Fleas spend most of their life cycle away from their host, making eradication even more challenging.As for alternatives, flea collars and oral tablets generally contain many of the same harmful chemicals as spot-on treatments. Alternative chemical treatments are either potent toxins or essential oils with no proven efficacy.There is a serious economic argument to lessen animal medication overall.“We could probably remove 80-90% of any of these chemicals with immediate effect,” says Goulson, who also rightly challenges ourbewildering, increasing obsessionwith pets.Reducing pet medication could structure a case-by-case approach. “Most practices are improving – tailoring application schedules to suit the individual pet and owner’s lifestyle,” says McCormack. If the dog is allergic to fleas, they should be prescribed monthly treatment. But treatment shouldn’t be preventive. You wouldn’t treat an empty scalp for head lice, and the same goes for fleas: if there is no infestation, keep a lid on it.We should also welcome recommendations to bond with our pets through husbandry, attentiveness on walks and home hygiene. Regular grooming can detect parasites early, allowing for reactive treatment. Washing pet bedding in hot water every few weeks and vacuuming sleeping areas help eliminate flea eggs and larvae that live there.And if your pet does require treatment? “Please don’t let them enter watercoursesat all,” McCormack implores, citing further work from Goulson’s lab that observed lethal doses of medication washing off dogs28 days after application. How does that measure up to brand advice on the back of the packet? Most recommend a mere “48 to 72 hours” of water abstinence after treatment. Pharmaceutical companies place poison in the palm of our hands.Vets urged to cut back on flea treatments amid UK biodiversity fearsRead moreVeterinary surgeon Dr Claire Whittle works with farmers to treat livestock strategically, and argues that spring is the perfect time to broach the conversation about using less medication with your vet. And countryside management like rotational grazing and taller grassescan be as effectiveat reducing parasite exposure as some pesticides. Native species such as sainfoin and chicory not only pose a structural challenge for parasites, but they contain natural insecticides. “Diversifying plants could be better for animal health as well as wildlife health. Medication should not be the first line of defence,” says Whittle.Looking ahead,parasites are evolving with worsening climate breakdown, spreading new disease risks. But on the brighter side, some countries are improving regulation. Ireland is making flea and worm treatmentsprescription only, offering a valuable case study for future policy changes in the UK. Could this spur urgent cooperation between industry regulators, theVeterinary Medicines Directorate, pharmaceutical companies and the pet-owning public?Protecting our pets should never come at the cost of protecting nature. And I worry this uniquely human business of eliminating parasites, mixed with private sector procrastination to find and fund regulated, alternative veterinary medication, risks us morphing into the most hedonistic parasite of all. But parasites have little to gain from killing their host. They must keep them alive, in symbiosis. There is power for change, in our poisonous hands.Sophie Pavelle is a writer and science communicatorDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But there can be a strange iffiness about sharing the good stuffMaking sense of itis a column about spirituality and how it can be used to navigate everyday lifeSun 23 Feb 2025 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 17.07 ESTShareEveryone knows that parenthood – especially motherhood – is a minefield from the get-go. You’re sleep-deprived, you’re hormonal, you’re riding some serious emotional highs and lows, and embarking on probably the highest-stakes venture of your life.Everyone has their opinions, and pretty soon you do too. You urgently need advice, and there’s no shortage of it. Sure, lots of this advice is not only dogmatic but contradictory, and the algorithm floats all the most guilt-inducing content to the top. There’s little consensus (unless it’s that you’re definitely not doing enough tummy time).The group chat with other new mums can be a lifeline. It may be the blind leading the blind, but at least you’re all going through the same things together.Being a parent means you’re never quite your own person again – but that self-sacrifice can pull off a miracle | Justin TohRead moreExcept when you’re not. It’s a perilous journey out on to that limb, to say to a fellow mum that I’m struggling with this or I’m loving that. There’s payoff in the solidarity of the “me too”. But if you share something difficult and get a blank face in return – not their experience – you can feel cast down and even more isolated. If you share something positive and the experience is not shared,theycan easily be cast down or unsettled by it. Nobody’s fault; still, a minefield.How do you share somebody’s experience if you don’t, well, share their experience? The piece of advice that keeps recurring to me as I step gingerly through the minefield is this one: rejoice with those who rejoice, mourn with those who mourn. It’s from the Bible, the Apostle Paul’s letter to Christians in Rome, and it neatly sums up how to do life with people whose circumstances are sometimes much better and sometimes much harder than your own. When any one member of the group has something to celebrate, we all have something to celebrate. When any member is cast down, we’re all cast down.It sounds straightforward enough, but it takes quite a bit of emotional agility to do both at the same time – to celebrate people’s wins when you’re deep in the slog, or to enter into someone’s woes when things are going well for you.The art of celebration and the art of empathy – both crucial to the art of communityWhen it comes to motherhood, there’s been a huge swing in recent times towards the “mourn with those who mourn” side of the equation. There’s a whole genre of social media post that begins “What nobody tells you about having kids is …” followed by whatever is currently driving them crazy about their kids. But as parenthood loomed for me, it felt like all anyone tells you about having kids is the hard stuff: the loss of sleep, time, autonomy, even self. Practically every mummy blog for the last 20 years has gone into great detail about what a hard job this is.All this is a great advance on the conspiracy of silence that (to some extent) once existed – the sense that it would be betraying your kids and your sacred vocation as a mother to acknowledge that you don’t exactly love everything about it, all the time. The solidarity of mourning with those who mourn – venting with those who vent? – is hard-won, and cathartic. But have we lost the knack of the opposite – rejoicing with those who rejoice?(Just anecdotally here, I wonder if the pattern is reversed for men. The stereotype was once that guys chafed more at the constraints of family life. But while we waited for our munchkin to arrive, my husband had more than one male colleague tell him: don’t listen to the negativity; having kids is the best.)The golden rule of the parents’ group chat? No chit-chat | Natasha ShollRead moreJoy is definitely a word we associate with becoming parents. But there can be a strange iffiness about sharing the good stuff. Laments for lost sleep or lost sanity meet a sympathetic ear, but to enthuse about time with your baby can sound like bragging, or trigger an uneasy competitiveness. It’s basic politeness, of course, not to mention to other new parents that your baby is sleeping through the night. (And prudence, maybe; sleep deprivation makes us a bit murderous.) But why does it sometimes feel like it’s only acceptable to be open about what sucks?I flip back to that rejoice/mourn passage to find another key to navigating the minefield: love must be sincere, it says. Love, the simplest and the hardest thing in the world. If we’re genuinely – sincerely – seeking the good of the other person, then it becomes not only possible but intuitive to enter into their joy or pain, and to regulate our own decisions about what and how much to share. Love can rush in where the prudent fear to tread.It also makes space for our mistakes. Love covers over a multitude of sins: another nugget of wisdom, from elsewhere in the New Testament. You can forgive a lot from someone who you know wants only good things for you. To rejoice with those who rejoice and mourn with those who mourn is an art. The art of celebration and the art of empathy – both crucial to the art of community. It takes a village, they say. Even if that village is built on a minefield.Natasha Moore is a senior research fellow at the Centre for PublicChristianity(CPX)Explore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyChristianitycommentShareReuse this content"

The coalition led by the centre-left Social Democratic party (SPD), born in hope, has fallen apart, thanks in no small measure to the continual attempts atsabotage by the Free Democratic party(FDP), its most junior member. That last successful effort resulted in the dissolution of the government.Yet the other two coalition parties are also culpable – the Greens, who failed to articulate a compelling enough vision for a future with clean energy, and the SPD itself, whose vote has tumbled by 10% and whose leader,Olaf Scholz, the chancellor, has mostly been as invisible as his predecessor,Angela Merkel, was imposing.Having lived and worked in Germany for 10 years, I have long understood Merkel’s tenure as an aberration in national politics. For all her flaws, she took a step of rare and historic bravery, welcoming a million Syrian immigrants as they fled a dictatorship that was bombing their schools and hospitals. Yet this move was one from which her own party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), now cannot distance itself quickly enough. It is striking that, when Bashar al-Assad was overthrown late last year, the first instinct of Germany’s newspapers and politicians was not to celebrate Merkel’s role in saving Syrian lives. Instead, it was to try to work out how quickly all thoseSyrians could now go home.The poll-leading CDU, meanwhile, has generally responded to the country’s greatest challenges with pettiness or spite. Kai Wegner, when elected mayor of a capital city staggering beneath the weight of overpriced housing, chose not to pick a fight with property developers but to fuel a pointless culture war, pledgingnever to use gender-neutral languagewhen in office.Even though the country is facinga severe shortage of migrant workers, the CDU’s leader, Friedrich Merz, the chancellor-in-waiting, seems to take every available opportunity to alienate the same people he is trying to attract to his nation. Infamously, in September 2023, he remarked that an area of Berlin with a large migrant population“was not Germany”. This was, even for him, a low point.The rhetoric of the AfD has been shamefully and enthusiastically adopted by their supposedly more enlightened peersIf there is room for optimism, we can find it in Die Linke, which hassurged in the pollsthanks to a campaign that has focusedon citizens’ everyday difficulties. While the Greens and the CDU have mostly settled for positive yet vague slogans, and the far right has gone forthe tone of returning emperors, the far left Die Linke has taken the most trouble to actually ask people about their household bills and to suggest taxes on wealth. This novel conceptcould see them win enough votes to return to the Bundestag.But the campaign has been dominated bythe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), whose rhetoric has been shamefully and enthusiastically adopted by their supposedly more enlightened peers, and whose ascent has been accompanied byan explosion of violence. In late 2023, senior party members were caught plotting theviolent deportation of millions of people: not only migrants, refugees and asylum seekers but anyone they did not consider to be sufficiently German, including German citizens born in Germany.Fearing a public backlash, these politicians and their wealthy backers were so secretive that they communicated with each other only by letter. They need not have been so worried. Though their poll numbers dipped a little in the aftermath,they now stand at about 20%, as the second most popular party, withthose plans for mass violence against migrants– euphemistically dubbed “remigration” – at the centre of their campaign.Yet the far right’s xenophobia is not at the fringes of German society: it can be found in voices at its very centre. The loudest such voice is Merz. After two fatal attacks by migrants on their fellow citizens – the first by an “anti-Islam activist” who drove a car into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, killing five, and the second a knife attack by a former Afghan asylum seeker in Aschaffenburg, killing two – Merz seized his moment. Instead of calling for the enforcement of existing and entirely adequate migration policies, he did something that no German political party had done since the 1930s: he formed an alliance on a crucial vote with the far right, in order to push through a migration bill that was contrary to EU law. His efforts failed, butthe damage was done. Merz, meanwhile, has only escalated his rhetoric, making thebaseless claimthat every day in Germany asylum seekers are perpetrating gang rapes. With language like this, a coalition with the AfD is not as far away as pundits think or hope it is – just look at all the seeminglyeternal norms that have been undonein no time at all. The cracks are swiftly spreading throughout the German iceberg.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For allthe hundreds of thousandswho have admirably taken to German streets ordebating chambersto protest against the dangers of authoritarian rule, there are far too many who have remained silent, whether at their dinner tables, in their workplaces or their group chats.Recently I spoke to Jennifer Kamau, who works forInternational Women’s Space, a Berlin-based NGO that protects the rights of migrants and refugees. She sounded so worried that days later I was still pondering her words: in particular, the loathing of migrants and refugees she sees across the political spectrum, even in some traditionally progressive spaces.“We don’t even know who to work with,” Kamau said. “Everybody that I am with is feeling afraid. There is a certain energy that you feel when you enter a train, even in Berlin… You see the hostility.” If there is not a concerted effortto present a positive vision of immigration, she fears the very worst. “The atmosphere is so pregnant with arrogance and hate,” she said. “This hate is too big. They can’t hide it any more.”Musa Okwonga is an author and football podcaster based in BerlinDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Why do so many on the right say no?Kenan MalikAn argument about Rishi Sunak’s identity reveals how ideas of ethnicity and race have become conflatedSun 23 Feb 2025 03.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 04.06 ESTShare‘They think they’re English because they’re born here. That means if a dog’s born in a stable it’s a horse.” That was a staple of the comedian Bernard Manning’s routine back in the 1970s. Enoch Powell had, a decade earlier,expressed the samesentiment in more refined language: “The West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman. In law he becomes a United Kingdom citizen by birth; in fact he is a West Indian or an Asian still.”Few today would laugh along with Manning or take seriously the claim that only white people can be English. Britain has transformed over the past half-century andmost English peoplenow embrace Ian Wright and Idris Elba as being as English as David Beckham or Joanna Lumley.Which is why the argument that surfaced last week about English identity might seem odd. In a discussion about immigration with the podcaster Konstantin Kisin, the formerSpectatoreditor Fraser Nelson insisted that Rishi Sunak “is absolutely English, he was born and bred here”. To whichKisin responded:“He’s a brown Hindu; how is he English?” A clip of the exchange went viral, provoking a furious wider debate, with critics condemning the claim that a “brown Hindu” could not be English, and myriad racists emerging from the online woodwork to protect the whiteness of English identity.Kisin is no racist, and certainly no Manning or Powell. He describes himself as “classically liberal” (though John Stuart Mill may wish to have a word about that). The exchange exposes, though, a contemporary paradox. Britain is more liberal and inclusive in its understanding of national identity than ever before. Yet, old racist tropes keep being rehashed by those on the right who would describe themselves as hostile to racism. Kisin despises the racial politics of Manning and Powell. But it is difficult to see how his view of “brown Hindus” being debarred from Englishness differs from Powell’s assertion that a “West Indian or Asian does not, by being born in England, become an Englishman”.Kisin insists he was simplydrawing a distinctionbetween British nationality and English ethnic identity. Many strands of nationalism, though, view nationhood as inextricably linked to ethnicity. At the same time, ethnicity is a concept highly malleable in meaning.“There is no consensus on what constitutes an ‘ethnic group’,” theOffice for National Statistics observedwhen describing ethnic categories used in the 2001 census.Ethnic groups are defined by a bundle of attributes such as a shared language, culture, religion, history and ancestry; which of these are significant varies from identity to identity. Kisin seems to assume that to be English one must possess certain immutable traits denied to Sunak as a “brown Hindu”. That returns us to questions about the relationship between ethnicity and race.Many strands of nationalism view nationhood as inextricably linked to ethnicity. At the same time, ethnicity is a concept highly malleable in meaningThe concept of ethnicity has a long history, and its meaning has shifted over time. In the 1930s and 40s, against the background of nazism and the Holocaust, ethnicity was reworked into its contemporary form.In the early 1920s, the biologist Julian Huxley, a key figure in this reworking,described black Americans, in theSpectator,as “childlike in their intellects”, and warned against miscegenation because “by putting some of the white man’s mind into the mulatto you not only make him more capable… but you increase his discontent”, driving him to make “trouble because of the American white blood that is in him”.Barely a decade later, in his bookWe Europeans,co-writtenwith the anthropologist AC Haddon, Huxley condemned the exploitation of “race” to “rationalise emotion”, proposing instead the alternative term “ethnic group”. He had not changed his views about race as a biological category, nor his contempt for the intellectual capacities of black people. He had, however, become horrified at the Nazis’ use of the concept. After the war, Huxleyhelped Unesco formulateits first “statement on race” in 1950, which argued that “it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term ‘race’ altogether and speak of ethnic groups”. “Ethnicity” became a means of talking about race without mentioning race.The new notion of ethnicity was wrapped around the importance of culture as helping to define a people. Culture, too, though, became a stand-in for race. There was a widespread understanding of cultures as fixed, self-contained units; of every individual as belonging to a distinct culture; of every culture as defined by its unique history. These were all attributes of “race” now transposed to “culture”. It was a vision of culture as functionally equivalent to race except that the “essence” of a people was rooted in history, not biology.These ideas became important for liberal concepts of multiculturalism and for what we now call “identity politics”. They became even more important for far-right notions of “ethnopluralism”. “The true wealth of the world,” the French political philosopherAlain de Benoist insisted, “is first and foremost the diversity of its cultures and peoples.”The founder of the Nouvelle Droite in France, and a philosophical mentor to contemporary reactionary movements,Benoist recognisedthat the far right could sustain itself in the postwar world only by exchanging old beliefs about race for new ideas of cultural difference and ethnic identity. “Authenticity of culture” became the new “purity of blood”.Immigrants, Benoist insisted, were carriers of alien cultures and histories and so could never be absorbed into the host nation. Democracy worked only when “demos and ethnos coincide”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Racialised ideas of belonging and identity have become accepted even by many of those formally opposed to racism.Konstantin Kisin: anti-woke libertarian who reluctantly calls himself ‘right wing’Read moreIn 1905, Britain introduced its first immigration controls, aimed primarily at excluding Jews fleeing pogroms in eastern Europe. Without this law, the prime minister,Arthur Balfour, told parliament, “though the Briton of the future may have the same laws, the same institutions and constitution… nationality would not be the same and would not be the nationality we should desire to be our heirs through the ages yet to come”. As so often in such discussions, Balfour conflates ideas of nationality, ethnicity and race. His point, though, is clear: too many Jews would undermine Britishness.Few today would deny that Jews can be properly British ordispute their sense of being English.

One of our senior diplomats once offered me an explanation of the allure: “The red carpet is laid out, the national anthems are played, all that stuff is very seductive.” This will be customarily accompanied by ritualistic words about the importance and invincibility of the “special relationship”.Number 10 lobbied hardto get Sir Keir Starmer across the Atlantic early in the second term of Donald Trump and, until recently, Downing Street people were telling themselves that an encounter between the two men needn’t be a disaster and might even turn out to be a success. In the weeks since Trump’s re-election as US president, UK policy might be summarised by the phrase “Don’t poke the beast”. Keep the temperature cool. Ignore provocations. Attempt to trade on British heritage – golf, the royal family – with which this US president has an affinity. Put David Lammy out there to suggest that there is lots to respect about the man whom the foreign secretary used to call a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath”. Softly-softly was the doctrine and they thought it was bearing fruit.While a fusillade of blistering Trump attacks have been launched against other countries – among them places asvarious as Canada, Denmark, Mexicoand Panama– the UK has so far avoided being whacked. While trade threats have been made against China, the EU and America’s neighbours, ministers still hope the UK has a fair chance of dodgingthe tariffbullet. They were rather pleased with themselves at Number 10 when, a few weeks ago, the US president called Sir Keir “a very good person” who has done “a very good job thus far”. Perhaps, they told themselves in Downing Street, it was going to be OK.As a doctrine, ‘Don’t poke the beast’ only worked for as long as the beast chose not to bite off your leg regardlessNobody sentient in Number 10, the Foreign Office or the Ministry of Defence is relaxed now. Not after what has been unleashed over the past 10 days. As a doctrine, “Don’t poke the beast” only worked for so long as the beast chose not to bite off your leg regardless.Sir Keir, less than eight months into his term and still a relative novice in geopolitics, is flying to America this week with transatlantic relations smashed up like they have never been before. Although it is not his fault, the haunting thought for him is that the alliance forged during the Second World War is disintegrating on his watch. The first swing of the wrecking ball was Trump’s declaration that he had initiated land-for-peace negotiations with Vladimir Putin over the heads of Kyiv and the European members of Nato. That ambush has been followed by the US secretary of state meeting his Russian opposite numberin Saudi Arabiawith Ukraine uncordially uninvited to have any say about its fate.In a deeply disturbing speech to the Munich security conference, the vice-president,JD Vance, trolled Europeby questioning whether the continent’s values were worth defending, before holdinga taboo-busting meetingwith the leader of the far-right AfD on the eve of the German elections. We have since heard the US president falsely brand Volodymyr Zelenskyy “a dictator” andbaselessly blameUkraine’s democratically elected leader for the war that has ravaged his country. No one should really need reminding that the conflict was started three years ago by thebarbaric Russian invasionintended to extinguish its smaller neighbour as an independent state. The span of the UK political spectrum has rejected the US president’s regurgitation of risible Kremlin propaganda, which attempts to shift culpability from the aggressor to the victim. Even Nigel Farage, usually an unashamed cheerleader and apologist for Trumpery,has had to sayhe can’t go along with that. Sir Keir wasquick to repudiatethe attack and call President Zelenskyy to express his support. Says one member of the cabinet: “Keir has been quite ballsy about that.”One question accompanying the prime minister across the Atlantic is how “ballsy” he is prepared to be when he is up close and personal with the US president. Should Trump repeat his smears aboutUkraine, the prime minister will have a choice to make. If he responds meekly or mutely, it will be at the great risk of looking pathetically pusillanimous. If he calls it out as a calumny, it will be at the serious peril of making himself the target of the fiery wrath of this thin-skinned and vindictive US president.That’s just one of the jeopardies of a visit pregnant with hazard. Another danger is that Sir Keir is greeted with a flat rebuff when he attempts to convince the American that Europe must have a role in negotiations and Ukraine has to be “kept in the fight” to strengthen the west’s hand with the Russians. Some in the UK government contend that the odds on making headway could be a bit better than they look. “A lot of commentary is jumping way ahead of itself,” says a senior figure closely involved in the preparations for the visit. “The Trump administration is still settling down. Even hard-declared positions change 24 hours later. There are multiple voices competing for Trump’s ear.”Number 10 has spent a lot of time wondering how to make the voice of the prime minister persuasive enough to influence US policy. Trying to talk up Sir Keiras a “bridge” between America and Europe sounds vainglorious. This US president doesn’t see a bridge without wanting to blow it up. European leaders baulk at the idea of the UK representing itself as an interlocutor, especially since we are no longer a member of the EU. There’s more sense in coordination with Emmanuel Macron, whosetrip to Washingtonwill precede Sir Keir’s, to marshal the argument that Europe can’t be excluded from decisions that critically effect the security of its own continent. Another task for the prime minister is to challenge the view, held by some in the Trump circle, that the US will profit from a deal with Putin because it will break the Russia-China alliance.I’m told that the prime minister will contend to the president that leaving Europe insecure will undermine the strategic position of the US because it will embolden aggressive moves by China and strengthen Beijing’s ties with Moscow, exactly the opposite of what Washington wants. Sir Keir will also make the case that Europe is now heeding Trump on taking more responsibility for its own security.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The truth may very well be that members of the Trump regime haven’t settled upon or don’t agree among themselves about their desired endpoint.Diplomats reckon that there is one approach with the greatest potential to have traction on this occupant of the Oval Office. That is to appeal to his ego and self-interest with the warning that a dirty carve-up of Ukraine on the Kremlin’s terms will project Putin as the apex predator and leave the US president looking like a weak dupe. Kim Darroch, a former UK ambassador to the US, suggests: “If I were Starmer, I would say to Trump that this is your chance for your place in history, the man who brought peace and ended this war. But it has to be a fair deal. If it’s a bad deal, you are not going to get that praise, you are going to get a load of criticism and that will be your record in the history books.”Vanity is one of the more reliable traits ofDonald Trump. Leaning into his narcissism may be undignified, but it may also be essential if Sir Keir is to come home from Washington with anything that he can call a success.Andrew Rawnsley is the Chief Political Commentator of the ObserverExplore more on these topicsKeir StarmerOpinionDonald TrumpVolodymyr ZelenskyyUkrainecommentShareReuse this content"

But it must act swiftlySun 23 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 06.44 ESTShareIt was a week that shook the world. The spilled Ukrainian blood counted for nothing as Donald Trump openly sided with Russia to achieve a peace that can only reward it for its unilateral aggression. As profoundly, the US president has launched a new era in which might is right, “strong” men carve up the globe, and international law and multilateral institutions are eviscerated. Nor, as the former head of MI6 Alex Younger told BBC’sNewsnight, is there any going back.Britain may be only a middle-ranking power but, given the politics and defence capacity of the rest ofEurope, it now has a special responsibility – in its own interests as much as Europe’s – to take a lead in creating a functioning order to replace the old. Andto do its very best to secure a just peace in Ukraine. For all its modest standing, Britain still retains important political and strategic assets. They must be deployed.First and foremost, Britons overwhelmingly recognise Vladimir Putin and Trump for who they are, that Ukraine’s battle is existential and that what we have done before we may have to do again. Our populist right, in the guise of Nigel Farage, is on the defensive much more than its counterparts in mainland Europe. Politically, the geopolitical challenges confronting Keir Starmer are as profound as those of 1945 or 1989: but also the opportunity to demonstrate defence and moral leadership.A reset in transatlantic relations was increasingly likely under any US president, given public opinion there. But even a president with as primitive America-first-and-only views as Trump must ultimately recognise that undermining$4tn of US foreign direct investment in Europe– dwarfing Ukraine’s imagined mineral wealth – is not in US interests. He will also learn that, astwo-thirds of America’s importscome from affiliates of US multinational companies operating overseas, placing tariffs on them is to tax yourself. US defence spending is presented by both Trump and western leaders as a kind of free public good offered as an American gift to the world. Wrong. It was the vital adjunct to protect US economic, trade and financial interests. It is to US advantage to play a backstop security role in Europe even as Europe does more to help itself – the message Starmer must take to Washington this week.A rigorous review of taxation – business reliefs, residential property, fuel duty, among other taxes – would yield up to £40bn extra revenueYet the fact remains that, confronted by new dangers, the UK has to raise defence spending. We need an army large enough to shoulder our proportionate share in any joint European security, now recognised as a necessity, and vastly strengthened air and naval defences. The mismatch between rhetoric – Britain will do what it takes on defence – and simultaneously accepting that an ultra-conservative interpretation of “fiscal rules” prohibits meaningful increased defence spending is unsustainable.Putin and Trump will see it for what it is: weakness. Russia will not wait while the UK and Europe get their acts together; deterrence has to kick in now. On the other hand, the chancellor’s caution is grounded in a painful reality. Suddenly, British government debt is seen as the soundest in the G7 (as measured by the price of credit default swaps), in part because the financial markets believe Reeves’s tough fiscal stance. Given that Britain’s precarious financial viability depends on the cold calculus of foreign investors, it is an asset that cannot be compromised even while we move to increase defence spending. But that requires finding more money more quickly.Fortunately, there are resources to hand. The government is undertaking a politically risky “zero-based” public spending review of how every government pound is spent, aiming to reduce spending in real terms despite the legacy of austerity. It should apply the same rigour to the tax system and, in particular,argues the Institute for Government, to the £63bn of tax reliefs to business – 2.3% of GDP – the highest of any advanced industrial country. Many reliefs fail to produce the desired result, and should either be more closely focused or scrapped.Nor should the taxation review stop there. The taxproceeds from wealth, especially from residential property, have fallen proportionately by half since 1980. Now is the moment tophase in a rational systemof taxation based on today’s property values rather than a regressive council tax based, incredibly, on 1991 values. With other measures – increasing excise duties on fuel again, while freezing income tax and national insurance thresholds until 2028/29 – there is up to £40bn of additional financial wherewithal. If it has the will, the UK could lift defence spending to 3% of GDP by 2029, and use the balance to head off another unwanted round of austerity.The tax rises would not be deflationary but, as a transfer from private spending and saving to higher public spending, expansionary. Another gain is that house prices may even fall a little. The public already half expects what needs to happen, but it has to be addressed as adults. Step up George Robertson, former secretary-general of Nato, who is completing a root and branch review of defence. Widely respected, he must explain his findings to all of us as part of a wider drive to spell out the choices. Politics in Norway and Canada show that patriotic progressivism can allow the left to go on the offensive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On 19 May, Britain hosts a summit with EU leaders to discuss resetting the UK-EU relationship. This must be a moment when Europe agrees its collective security response – a potential European defence fund, common European defence procurement and enhanced military collaboration. The UK must use its newly found resources to take a lead. As a quid pro quo, it should insist on a big, generous deal to reverse shrinking UK-EU trade. Farage, along with the rightwing press, will instinctively want to cry sellout. But what is the alternative? Britain can be cordial to Trump without being the accomplice to Ukraine’s defeat and the weakening of European security.Thus, amid the massive dislocation and threat there is an opportunity. The UK can better defend itself, protect its key public services, reflate its economy around higher defence spending, boost its ailing trade further to stimulate growth, become a co-leader in advancing Europe’s security and fashion a new transatlantic relationship. Moral, security and economic interests – and those of gallant Ukraine – are combined. It is also a political lifeline for a government mired in unpopularity.Labourmust seize the moment.Will Hutton is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsTax and spendingOpinionEuropeDefence policyEuropean UnionLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

If I find that I am going to lose my greatly valued independence and suffer increasingly intolerable pain, I wish the option to end it. I would like that option without having to go to a soulless clinic in Switzerland, causing any relative who in any way assists me to possibly be subject to criminal investigation.But Sonia Sodha is concerned about the possibility of what she calls “wrongful” deaths; of people who have chosen to die, but might have been influenced to do so (“Voices that oppose the assisted dying bill aren’t ‘noise’. They are vital scrutiny”, Comment). To remove that risk, she proposes creating more hoops than those already in the bill through which someone has to pass before being allowed by the state to die when they choose. And if they don’t satisfy the judge, they will be kept alive and in agony despite their clear wishes. If such a law is an improvement on what we have now, I don’t see how.RBL OwenChetnole, DorsetThe fact that family members have no right to know about an individual’s choice or intention is wholly consistent with our societal obligation to treat competent adults as individuals, not owned by their family. That individual’s choice and exercise of free will cannot be subject to their family’s views and may certainly be made with a desire to avoid excess suffering, rather than avoiding being a burden.Pat StevensonHolywell, NorthumberlandAI threatens livelihoodsWe are among the 2.4 million people working in the UK creative industries. We are astonished that the government is making plans to do away with significant areas of our intellectual property rights, readying to hastily wrap our life’s work in attractive paper as a welcome gift to automated competitors.Matt Clifford, the government’s AI opportunities adviser, made the wishlist of generative AI developers front and centre of the implemented AI Opportunity Action Plan, of which clause 24 calls on the government to put an end to copyright protection as we know it and introduce an exception that would make our country a data-mining paradise for the generative AI industries.If implemented, it will be legal for AI companies to scrape everything we upload, without licence or permission. They will be allowed to profit from the output of commercial AI products that would be trained, for free, on our copyrighted work. The livelihood of workers will become their profit.The mechanism that is meant to balance the rights of creators against those of AI developers is an “opt-out” option, the same mechanism that the EU tried, but failed, to implement. Opt-outs are universally considered unfair and unworkable by anyone who has looked into the matter objectively, including many in parliament. Moreover the burden of reserving the rights would fall on us, the creators, reversing the principle of automatic protection that underpins UK copyright law.In an attempt to justify this indefensible transfer of value – from our industry, who produces it, to the one that wants to extract it – those who push for the reform have fabricated a rhetoric of “uncertainty in the law”. This, regrettably, has been amplified through the media. MP Pete Wishart, voicing what we all know, recently said that the notion of current UK law being uncertain is just nonsense, adding that nobody actually believes it, that even AI companies wouldn’t say that there is any question surrounding that idea. Indeed the only issue that urgently needs to be remedied with new legislation is transparency: if AI companies can refuse to disclose the content of their datasets, any talk of fairness is farcical.We stand beside our government in their effort to make our economy thrive and the United Kingdom a successful and welcome home for trailblazers. The creative industries are already a successful source of wealth for the nation, accounting for more than 5% of GDP and contributing £124bn of value to the economy. But they do more than that: they’re a source of pride, joy and wellbeing for the people of this country and the crown jewel of British soft power. Subjecting our creative industries to the desires of Big Tech will boost neither growth nor innovation: unregulated tech is inherently extractive in nature and we run the risk of seeing it bleed our industries of the energy that comes from its grassroots in a reckless and unsustainable “slash-and-burn” approach that sacrifices quality and our values for the sake of a quick buck.Large language models are sensational in their capacity to imitate thought and human expression, but they don’t think, they can’t feel and they can’t question norms. Creativity remains, unquestionably, a human trait. Culture is a human artefact, our heritage was created collectively by the people and it should remain under their care.The government’s public consultation on copyright and AI runs until 25 February. This is our last chance to express our concern and disagreement to the approach proposed. We are demanding transparency and a strong copyright regime that safeguards the livelihood of freelance workers and the vitality of human creativity.Michael Rosen,Mark Haddon,Brian Merchant,Axel Scheffler,Rob Biddulph,Felicita Sala,Benji Davies,Marta Altés, Stanley Donwoodand many othersOn the wrong side of history“Humiliated and anguished, European leaders are crying ‘betrayal’ ”, says Andrew Rawnsley (“Europeans are right to be angry with Trump, but they should be furious with themselves”, Comment), but the analogy from the Munich security conference should not be with the Munich agreement of 1938, but the Nazi-Soviet pact of 1939, when Hitler and Stalin partitioned Poland and triggered the Second World War. This time, the Germans are defending democracy and the Americans – tearing up the rules-based international order, choosing far-right politicians as collaborators and denouncing liberal values as decadent – are on the wrong side of history.Robert Gildea, Professor Emeritus of Modern History, University of OxfordWhy gen Z is disillusionedI am not strictly gen Z, being a younger millennial, but I do feel a lot of those “trends” ascribed to gen Z apply to me (“They say we don’t like sex, drugs, democracy or DIY. But here’s how we in gen Z really feel”, Focus).There is a sense of disillusionment among my peers over social mobility and justice. Politicians keep courting and chasing older generations of homeowners and pensioners, which is reflected in their decisions. Our voices seem not to matter, and there isn’t a party or platform that seems ready to represent and protect our interests. As for DIY, neither I nor my husband has ever owned a wall where we could practise putting in a nail or painting, without repercussions from a landlord.Diana AnisimovaLondon N6Spend more, get moreInThe Great Crash of 1929, JK Galbraith highlighted how a dogmatic belief in a “balanced budget” and fear of inflation was a formidable straitjacket on governments’ ability to mitigate the impact of the financial crash and the depression that followed.Nearly a century later, Rachel Reeves finds herself in the same trap (“How to dodge an economic crisis: Reeves has three choices – all unthinkable”, News). The only answer appears to be to tax more and spend less, which will have the opposite effect to the reignition of robust economic growth. Keynes argued that we can afford what we can do, rather than do what we can afford. Government deficit spending pumps new money into the economy, creating growth. Isn’t it time the UK threw off this straitjacket?Jonathan BunnLondon SW15Mothers and prisonWhen considering the impact and appropriateness of imprisonment on women, it is important that the issues faced by their children are considered (“Why are women still being sent to prison as ‘a place of safety’?”, Magazine).The relatively low number of women’s prisons means that often mothers are hundreds of miles from their families, making face to face visits economically challenging. When considering the option of non-custodial sentences, courts should be mindful of the consequences of maternal imprisonment on children.Stuart HarringtonBurnham-on-Sea, SomersetPrawns’ painful endHow could anyone think of eyestalk ablation to improve egg production? (“Waitrose to stop selling suffocated farmed prawns, as campaigners say they feel pain”, News.) Obviously, the eyes are on stalks for a very good reason. Most people would think carefully about eating these creatures if they knew how they have been treated.Marion RoweNew Ross, Wexford, IrelandThe truth about cats and dogsI own neither a cat nor a dog, so perhaps I can comment on both sides. We have spent years creating a bird- and wildlife-friendly garden. I do not mind how many cats people have as long as they stop them from digging in the veg patch, sitting under the bird table, trying to catch the butterflies and sitting on the nest box.Dogs do not come into our garden but I would prefer it if all, not just some, owners cleared up their dog’s deposits in the park. There are bins available.

After decades of depradations, Labor’s reforms are putting Medicare back on trackSat 22 Feb 2025 22.06 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 00.47 ESTShareWhen the Hawke Labor government implemented Medicare in 1984, it established a new foundational principle for the Australian health system – that access to health services for all is a right, not a privilege.Since then, successive Labor governments have sought to deliver the simple proposition that all Australians, regardless of where they live, should have timely access to the highest quality medical services and advice based solely on clinical need, rather than on their financial capacity to pay.Labor pledges 18m extra bulk-billed GP visits a year as part of $8.5bn Medicare investment iRead moreIn 1984 Bob Hawke claimed that, compared with the succession of postwar private health schemes adopted by conservative governments, Labor’s Medicare would be fairer, simpler and cheaper.Four decades later, Hawke’s promises have been more than fulfilled.The principle of access to services based on need, not wealth, is the very definition of fairness.Provision of, and payment for, medical services through a single, state-owned payer, and hospital services through a tightly regulated hybrid public-private hospital system is relatively simple and efficient.And in terms of the national health budget, Medicare provides comprehensive health services, steady increases in life expectancy and quality health outcomes for about 10% of GDP compared to, for example, the disastrous health outcomes of the largely privatised United States healthcare system which consumes almost 20% of the American GDP.But over four decades the continuing public policy challenge has been to deliver access to medical services at no or very little cost at the point of delivery.Bulk billing is the mechanism through which Medicare delivers this equitable access.In 1984, the first iteration of Medicare provided generous funding to general practitioners to bulk bill and thereby reduce or remove financial barriers to patients seeking medical advice and treatment.Since then, in poll after poll and election after election, the Australian people have overwhelmingly supported the core principles of Medicare, including bulk billing.Remarkably, however, Medicare’s success never stopped ideological and political attempts to undermine its universality and equity.In 1993, the Liberals’ “Fightback” manifesto launched a frontal demolition attack on Medicare and envisaged replacing it with a privatised system based on the American model.This foolishness contributed to the conservatives’ resounding defeat at that election.Chastened by the consequences of their zealotry, since 1996 conservative governments in office have opted for a more subtle and crabwise undermining of Medicare.The political calculus was simple – if bulk billing could be steadily eroded by reducing nominal and real reimbursements to general practitioners, over time doctors would be forced to levy co-payments, consumer and voter dissatisfaction with “Medicare” would increase, and political support for an alternative, privatised medical system might emerge.Influenced by American private equity interests, local neoliberal thinktank economists attempted to redefine Medicare as a “safety net” rather than as a universal scheme.Dutton has backed more funding to women’s health. But the political record is worth revisiting | Van BadhamRead moreNo form of privatised health provision could ever be fairer, simpler or cheaper to individuals and health budgets than Medicare – but this did not deter Liberal governments from undermining bulk billing by continuing significant freezes in the level of rebates paid to general practitioners, as well as increasing and largely unnecessary overregulation of general practice.The deep ideological commitment to the destruction of Medicare was apparent in the Abbott government’s 2014 proposal to introduce a high co-payment for doctors’ consultations.While the co-payment proposal collapsed, along with Abbott’s prime ministership, the ideological assault on Medicare continued unabated until the election of the Albanese government in 2022.When he came to office, the health minister, Mark Butler, was faced with the consequences of more than a decade of relentless and effective conservative depredations on the core principles of Medicare.But since 2022, Butler has restored and strengthened Medicare step by step.More than 80 Medicare urgent care clinics – all bulk-billed – have been established, with more to come to meet demand, especially in the outer suburbs and rural and regional Australia.The critical importance of general practice has been recognised by funding significantly increased numbers of general practitioners through the training system.A series of primary care reviews have delivered achievable reforms aimed at enhancing all aspects of primary care and the rapid adoption of emerging new technologies to improve patient and professional outcomes.The government tripled the bulk-billing incentive for those who needed to see their GP most often – pensioners, concession cardholders and families with children.But the decision to introduce the new bulk billing practice incentive program to cover all Australians and to introduce a 12.5% loading patents for fully bulk-billing practices, are the reforms that shatter for good the idea that a safety-net Medicare could ever be acceptable to modern Australia.Butler’s reforms finally put Medicare back on track to meet and exceed the promises made to the Australian people by Hawke’s government 40 years ago – an effective and efficient health system designed by, and for, Australian people, that reflects the core values of fairness and equity and rewards those who dedicate their lives to deliver such excellent health outcomes.Bill Bowtell AO is an adjunct professor at UNSW and a strategic health policy consultant.

Violence had exploded and conditions had deteriorated following President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination in 2021. Then, last February,gangs banded togetherto free thousands of prisoners, besiege airports and police stations, and demand that Haiti’s unpopular replacement leader departed.Ariel Henry was ousted, but the nation has only spiralled further into crisis. Violence intensified again towards the end of last year. Armed criminals control 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Already desperate circumstances have become much more so: more than a million people – around one in 10 of the population –have now been displaced, triple the level a year ago. Half are experiencing acute food insecurity.At least 5,600 people were killed in gang violence last year. The United Nations says that sexual violence against childrenhas risen tenfold; many are beingforcibly recruitedinto organised crime. The kidnap and murder of health workers has put around two-thirds of medical facilities out of use. Even commercial flights have largely halted after gangsopened fire on planes.Amid all this, the United States announced on Thursday that it is scrapping temporaryprotection from deportationfor half a million Haitians in the US, meaning that they could be removed by August. That’shardly a surprisegiven the vile lies about Haitian migrants spread by President Donald Trump and Vice-President JD Vance in last year’s election. And some deportations continued even under the Biden administration. But the announcement is no less appalling for that – and all the more so given the role of the US in the nation’s troubles over the years. A country born in such hope, in the uprising of enslaved people, has never shaken off the impact of thedevastating reparationsFrance imposed for its freedom and the years of foreign occupation and meddling that followed.Last spring was supposed to mark a turning point for the country, with the arrival of a UN-backed and largely Kenyan-staffed security support mission, and the move to a transitional government supposed to pave the way for elections next year – more than a decade after the last polls. But the council, which contains just one token representative of civil society, has been beset by self-interested struggles, and three of its nine members face corruption charges but refuse to resign. The security mission has less than half the personnel initially envisaged, has failed to make an impact, and now Mr Trump has frozen US funding for it.A newreportby the International Crisis Group warns that elections cannot be held safely under current circumstances, and that pressing ahead with them might fuel further violence by gangs attempting to push their cronies into power. It argues that the priority for the transitional council must be focusing on basic governance.Meanwhile, every possible legal avenue to extend protection from deportation for Haitians in the US must be employed. The US must do more to cut off the flow of arms in breach of the embargo. Humanitarian support for the nation, always inadequate and now hit by Trump administration cuts, must be properly backed. The UN’s 2024 appeal was less than half funded, leaving millions of people unsupported. With the need now far greater, it is askingfor $900m. That is the least that is owed to Haitians.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

My dog likes her. I’m not a particular believer in the idea that animals are great character judges but, in this case, me and the dog are aligned. I like Anderson too. She combines openness with a kind of vulnerability, and you warm to her immediately.Settled on a sofa in a small dressing room off a photography studio, she asks for a coffee and promptly spills it everywhere. “I strive for imperfection,” she jokes. “I strive for it, and I just hit it every time.” Cortado mopped, she takes a breath, before talking excitedly of a new phase in her eventful life. “A door opened, and I walked through,” she says. “It’s hard to believe.”Two years ago, Anderson had accepted that her time in the spotlight was pretty much done, and had decided to locate herself in and around her beachside home in Ladysmith, on Vancouver Island in Canada. Her focus, she decided, would be her garden and animals. Though she’d long been a celebrity – smashing into 90s public consciousness as aPlayboymodel and scarlet-swimsuitedBaywatchstar, becoming notorious as one half of a sex’n’drugs’n’rock’n’roll marriage to Mötley Crüe’s Tommy Lee, celebrated and disdained as a cartoon fantasy girl – she was no longer being offered any work she liked. She’d had a decade or so making money on international reality shows (India, Germany, Argentina, the UK); she’d made her mark as ananimal rights activist; but that, she thought, was that. She gave up on her last marriage, to her bodyguard Dan Hayhurst, and went back home.View image in fullscreenWith former husband Tommy Lee in 1995.Photograph: Steve Granitz/WireImage“I went home to my garden and made pickles and jams, I wrote a vegan cookbook, I did a vegan cooking show, and I was perfectly happy with that,” she says. “I spent some time for myself, stripping away this caricature that I created, because I’d started believing that it was true. You have to have self-acceptance, and I honestly believed it was over, that life. It was like a death, in a way. But it was the beginning.”The change began in 2022, when she played Roxie Hart inChicagoon Broadway, which she loved. “Doing it every night, the classic Fosse choreography,” she says. “I just realised you don’t know if you can do something unless you try. I’m not a dancer, I didn’t know I could sing. I didn’t know I could do any of it.” She brought out her autobiography in 2023, the same year as a Netflix documentaryPamela, A Love Story, which revealed Anderson as a sweet, gentle optimist and shifted people’s opinions of her (“I’m not a damsel in distress,” she says in it. “I put myself in crazy situations and I survived them”). But the real, life-changing breakthrough has come with the filmThe Last Showgirl.I have so much respect for the craft [of acting], and I’m just a sponge. I’m just aching to see what’s in meDirector Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis Ford, niece of Sophia) shot the whole movie in just 18 days, on dreamy 16mm film. It tells the story of the final days of the Razzle Dazzle, a long-running Vegas showgirl revue, all feathers and sparkly headdresses and mildly erotic dances, based on old Parisian Lido shows. Once the biggest pull on the Strip, times have changed, and the show is seen as dated and uncool, not funny or risque enough. It barely brings in an audience. The owners decide to close. Anderson plays Shelly, the longest-serving dancer, whose image is on the fading sign, who still believes in the glamour and the glitz, whose life is so wrapped around the Razzle Dazzle that she may well be lost without it.Though she very nearly wasn’t in the film at all. Her ex-agent passed on the part without showing it to her, but Coppola approached Anderson’s son Brandon, and he got the script to his mother.View image in fullscreenIn the heyday of Baywatch in 1992.Photograph: Allstar“It was the first time I read a great script with a really well-rounded role that I felt like I could tackle, as an actress,” she says. “So that was exciting to me.” Anderson had enormous empathy for Shelly’s “flawed but very human” character, and related to her story, not least because Shelly has a daughter, Hannah (Anderson has two adult sons, Brandon and Dylan). “Raising a child in this industry is never easy,” she says, “and there’s no perfect way to be a parent.” And Hannah and Shelly’s relationship is far from perfect.“No, it’s not, but Shelly thought she was doing what was best for her child,” says Anderson. “She also thought she was setting a good example, showing that you can follow your dreams, and we don’t have to play these roles that have been society’s roles for us. It’s always a fight, I think, for women. For some reason, we’re always explaining ourselves and our choices. I’m always explaining myself and my past.”There are meta-layers in the film, to do with casting and what we expect of women, especially desirable women as they age. Jamie Lee Curtis plays wise-cracking Annette, once a showgirl, now a hostess in a casino. (In one scene she dances on a low platform amid the slot machines, to Total Eclipse of the Heart; ignored by the punters, she has a strange lonely dignity.) Billie Lourd plays Hannah. Lourd, as daughter of Carrie Fisher, granddaughter of Debbie Reynolds, could bring in her experience of being the child in a family of performers.“Billie said making the film was like therapy for her,” says Anderson. “You can talk to your best friend, you can go to therapy, but doing an art project heals parts of you that you don’t even know are hurt, all these places that we lock away in ourselves. If you can unlock those things. And that’s what Shelly did for me. She’s unlocked parts of me that I locked away and I know I repressed in some way.”In the past, I felt I was the poster girl for causes and that was great, but in some cases, it didn’t really helpAnderson is good at revealing the complications and conflicts in Shelly. She’s a baby-voiced dreamer but also a tough worker, someone who genuinely believes in the beauty and worth of her vocation. “She believes in the fantasy of what she does, and I could relate to that. When I moved from Canada to the States, I had my fantasy of what a model was, and I wanted to do the best I could. But then I’d see somebody else in a photoshoot and go, “Oh, my God, nobody else is rolling around like me”. Shelly has dreamed this life for herself and made it work.”And now Anderson’s dreams are starting to play out in real life. “I’ve been able to realise a little bit of my potential, and that changes the conversation. Even in interviews, I feel like it’s apples and oranges. People, if they haven’t seen the film, ask me different questions than if they have seen it.”View image in fullscreenWith Vivienne Westwood at a Paris fashion week show in 2009.Photograph: Dominique Charriau/WireImageHer future projects include a remake ofThe Naked Gun, where she plays opposite Liam Neeson: “I’m a femme fatale. You can tell, because I wear a beret.” And she’s inRosebush Pruning, directed by Karim Aïnouz, about a dysfunctional family: “I leave my family to the wolves, but it all gets turned around on me real quick.” She loved working in a cast of “incredibly hot” actors – Callum Turner, Riley Keough, Jamie Bell, Lukas Gage, Elena Anaya, Tracy Letts – and also relished playing a few years older than her real age (she’s 57).It seems like Anderson has found herself; at least, her working self, her artistic and intellectual side, the one that wants to confront the discipline and emotional excavation of acting. “I’ve always read [Richard] Boleslavsky,Acting:The First Six Lessons, on repeat, over and over. I finish it, I start it again. I get something out of it each time,” she says. “I wish there was an Actors Studio. I have a great acting teacher, Ivana Chubbuck, but I wish there was something comparable so I could work between projects. I have so much respect for the craft, and I’m just a sponge. I’m just aching to see what’s in me.”It’s like a flame has been lit inside you, I say.“I feel like I’ve finally been able to access part of what I’m capable of,” she says. “If I never do anything else, I have done something. I feel like this has really been the catalyst for the rest of my life.”She reaches down and pets my dog again. Anderson has many fans. How does she feel about answering some of their questions, I wonder?“Oh I’m excited,” she says. “This is my excited time.”The Last Showgirlopens in UK cinemas on FridayWatch a trailer for The Last Showgirl.Stella McCartneyDesignerWhat is something in this world that you love and needs saving?Oh … cinema? I watched this documentary,Room 666Room 999[two docs filmed 40 years apart about the future of cinema] about the great directors that go to Cannes. They’re talking about saving cinema and how some people think it’s over. I feel like small films are the answer, because they’re a director’s singular vision. Big studio pictures, there’s so many cooks in the kitchen that they lose their vision. I want to do a lot of independent cinema, work with directors who are artists. Of course, every actor wants to do this – but cinema is something I’d love to save.Liam NeesonActorHow does working in your garden inspire you in the same way a good script and director can?Everything seems to always go back to the garden for me, it is a good metaphor … There’s no easy way around it, there’s no shortcuts. You’ve got to nurture, and you’ve got to plant the seeds, and you’ve got to see it grow, and you see yourself grow, and you see what works, what doesn’t work. It’s a lifetime obsession. Love and work and creativity, and also having some faith that you don’t have to control it. You don’t have to observe it.Ruby WaxWriter and interviewerDo you miss your youngBaywatchbody?I still have my youngBaywatchbody! I was thinking that the other day. There’s little things here and there, but yes, still here. 90% maybe.Gia CoppolaDirectorPamela, you are a wise soul. I’ve never seen you fangirl more than when we were in Zurich visitingCarl Jung’s house. What is the greatest piece of advice you’ve been given?The best piece of advice I’ve ever been given is to be yourself. I think that came from me. You know, you’re always trying to work out … what are my original thoughts? Who am I? How do I want to present myself to the world? I even tell my kids that. I say, “Tell me something that onlyyouthink.” Like: “Don’t think other people’s thoughts.” That’s important as an artist, but also as a person. Just to remind ourselves, because we’re inundated with so much information all the time, that we are not those thoughts, that we are not other people’s thoughts. It’s always going back to who you are and what your purpose is, and what your reason for being here is. We all have a reason for being here.Naomi KleinWriter and activistYou and I both live on theSalish Sea in British Columbia. It’s not exactly convenient. So I’m wondering, what does this ecosystem do for you?I live in a rainforest. What a dream. The bald eagles, the whales, the owls… it’s so rich with life, and I feel like the trees have known me since birth. I like walking on the beach where I walked as a young girl, and it has always inspired me. I lived other places, but going home was really important to me, because I wanted to rewrite my beginnings, almost. When I didBroadway, the only picture I had on my mirror was of me at four years old. I said, “She deserves it. I just need to get out of the way.” Every time I go home, I stick my feet in the water, in the Salish Sea. It’s home.Your sons come across as really nice young men. How did you balance parenthood with the ups and downs of fame?Karalee Clark, Calgary, AlbertaI took a lot of time off when my kids were young. I didn’t have a nanny. I really wanted to raise them myself, and in the crazy world that we were in, I didn’t want to take my eyes off of them. But I feel like there’s no perfect way to be a parent. In the movie, I did improv for a scene on the telephone, and I said, “We’re just doing the best we can with the tools that we have,” and I believe that. I always wanted my kids to be who they were, and to be these wild little spirits. As they got older, we were very open and honest with each other. And at some point, they just became … you never want to put that on your kids, but they became very protective of me. We have these businesses together now, but they have their own lives too. You want to do the best you can and be as honest as you can, but you’re not their friend, you’re their parent.Andreas KronthalerDesigner,Vivienne Westwood’s longterm partnerYou and Vivienne were so close. What drew you towards each other, and what did her friendship mean to you?She was very … she didn’t like a lot of people, but she loved me, which was really wonderful. We met when we were getting people to sign petitions to free Leonard Peltier, and we just got on so well. She was like, “I want you in all my campaigns.” And I met Juergen Teller and Andreas, and Vivienne and I would be in these little, tiny rooms dressing each other. And Andreas would always say, “You women are the hardest women to dress, but I love it.” The three of us were such a funny little crew, and we did a lot of photoshoots together, and spent a lot of time together. I just loved her, and her relationship with Andreas was very special. They were madly in love, and so kind and sweet to each other, and giggly and cute together. And they were … they’re like family. I see Andreas as much as possible. I’m wearing Vivienne Westwood right now. This is Vivienne Westwood.View image in fullscreenAt the Bafta film awards in London last week.Photograph: Joe Maher/GettyHow do you start loving how you look without makeup? I need to quit using eye makeup after nearly 40 years, and my smoky-eye look has been part of my identity for so long. Without it, I find it hard to love my looks.Freya Samstra, the NetherlandsWell, first of all, you just have to stop wearing makeup. It takes a while to get used to it, and then you go to the grocery store, little things … I know it sounds superficial, but for me it was really a freeing thing. You know, I love makeup, and now, if I’m doing a photoshoot or going to an event and I want to put a little bit of makeup on, it feels more special. It feels like, “I’m good enough the way that I am, and the rest is fun”, instead of making it so much a part of your identity. Everyone’s beauty journey is different, and no matter where you are in your beauty journey, no matter what you feel, sometimes it’s nice to take a step back and go, “OK, I’m good with this”. And then go again into something else. Maybe you’ll have a think about a lip or something else you get drawn to. But sometimes you have to take it back to go, “OK, the blank canvas,” and being OK with that.Alexandra PaulActorYou often brought your beautiful, playful dogStarto the set ofBaywatch. Do you have any dogs in your family at the moment?I do. I have three dogs, three big dogs. I have Zou Bisou Bisou, after the song, and I have Lucky and Lola, who are chocolate labs kind of monsters, and Zou-zou is a golden retriever-ish. I just let them out in the morning and they come back when they want. I have a big, fenced-in yard. I moved my parents on to my property last year, into their own little cabin. They’re getting older, they’re in their late seventies and I was planning on being in my garden, bringing my mum and dad closer so I can keep an eye on them. But then I started travelling, working so much. And they have to look after the dogs. They have three big dogs and a little tiny cat, and their cabin is very small, probably as big as this room. My mum just loves to care for them, so it really keeps her busy. Three big dogs. I don’t think I could even put three of them on the leash and walk them anywhere. They just need to be free.Yanis VaroufakisEconomist and politicianGreetings from Greece. I watchedThe Last Showgirland was moved by the immense power you projected from appearing wholly vulnerable. Do you intend to press that power into serving any new political project?We’re both friends of Julian Assange, and I met Yanis through Slavoj Žižek, a philosopher, who introduced us. It’s fun to have a conversation with these brains. Right now, I call myself a gentle activist, a romantic activist, in that I’m working on things behind the scenes, because I feel like I can be more effective that way. I’m always a part of the dream that we all share as people who care about love, empathy for other people and the planet. When I first met Julian Assange, I said, “How can I be more effective as an activist?” And he said, “Support other activists and the families of activists.” So that’s what I do. In the past, I felt I was the poster girl for causes and that was great, but in some cases, it didn’t really help. My image didn’t necessarily help. I only want to help, and so … I found my way.What makes you laugh? A proper full-on belly laugh.Jo Foggo, MerseysideMy dogs. I have the best time with my dogs, and they’re so funny. Anywhere I go, I try to find a park – like if I’m in New York I go to Central Park, because the dogs just make me laugh, and it’s the best way to start the day.Michael CeraActorIf you were able to magically chat and give advice to your 20-year-old self, what advice would you give?Hang in there. Hold your head high. Keep going. This too shall pass [laughs]. Keep trusting animals. They are on your side, unconditional love. I would say to my younger self, “Work. Keep on improving yourself. Work on your voice. Take dance classes, take acting classes.” Just keep on filling your pockets with skills that you never know if you’re going to use, but you can only be a more interesting and better person if you do that. Keep reading. Keep watching old movies.When you put on the red swimsuit for the first time, did you have an inkling of the power it held?Ayesha, WorthingNo, I had no idea. You don’t have any idea when you’re taking a job. You never know if it’s going to be like the No 1 show in the world. People sometimes ask me, “How come you made these amazing choices?” I was going to the beach. I had a job. I would have been at the beach anyway. It wasn’t like I was calculating my career. These are the things that were presented to me and that I did.Philip TreacyMillinerHow did the headdresses you wore in the movie make you feel?Well, they’re very heavy. You had to have a good straight back, and you have to have balance. I think the bigger the hat, the closer you are to God [laughs]. It was a spiritual moment. I love Philip Treacy. I haven’t seen him in a long time, but he used to put the funniest, greatest hats on me. He’s fantastic, he’s incredible. He’s a genius.View image in fullscreenPamela Anderson in The Last Showgirl.Photograph: Zoey Grossman/APThe costumes inThe Last Showgirlwere amazing.Well, they’re museum pieces, and they haven’t left the building in 30 years. We really had to shake the dust off those feathers. Some of them even had the names of the girls that wore them before. So you felt like there was magic in them, and that was part of the reason why you were able to stand in them, because a lot of women had worn them before you. They were such an honour to wear.Jeff KoonsArtistPamela, you’ve experienced so much in your life. When do you feel the most alive? And can you describe what that sensation feels like to you?Feeling most alive for me is living in the mystery of not knowing what’s next and having complete faith it’s going to be OK. It feels like you are jumping off a bridge and there’s nothing to grab you. And then something grabs you. I get chills thinking about it.When was the last time you felt it?I’m feeling it right now. I’m in the zone. I’m in the place where I don’t know what’s next … so you have to be willing to fail. And that’s a real vulnerable place. I feel like I only scratched the surface, and I’m a little nervous of what I have to give. I want to meet somebody, a director, do projects with somebody who can really find things in me that I don’t even know are there, but that are wanting to come out. I feel like there’s this little monster inside of me that just wants to get out. And that’ll make me feel free and alive. I feel I’m on the verge of that. I do feel very alive right now, but I also feel like it’s a very vulnerable, open, scary, interesting, exciting time.Kiernan ShipkaActorWhat’s something you’ve never done that you’d still love to do?I want to do a play. I want to be in the theatre. It scares the hell out of me, but it’s something I need to do. I am inching my way closer to the east coast and looking for a place in New York, because if I’m closer to Broadway – or maybe the West End, who knows? – maybe that would help. It would be great to do theatre again now.What was it like moving from Canada to California?Michaela, LondonWhen I moved to California, I’d never been on a plane before, and I was like, “I don’t know this place. Everyone’s going to have parrots on their shoulders.” I don’t know what I was thinking about America, but going there, I didn’t know what I was in for, and I was alone, and I’m painfully shy, but wanted to get that off of me. I needed to shed that person and step into something new.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Venetia Scott/The ObserverMikey MadisonActorDo you have a dream role you’d like to play?There’sThe Glass Menagerie, right? Amanda? I think that would be great. People don’t realise that when I was shootingPlayboycovers, I was at Samuel French [bookshop], reading Tennessee Williams and Eugene O’Neill and Sam Shepard, wondering, “How do I get from here to here?” Like, “Is that even a possibility?” I loved Barbara Loden and Ellen Burstyn and Elizabeth Hubert and Isabelle Huppert. Shirley MacLaine. Shirley MacLaine was the first actress I really fell in love with, the physical element of her. The comedy. She’s so funny and had that depth of talent.Daniel LismoreActivistIf you could share advice with the world, what would it be?I think the rebel move right now is to be kind and to be loving. If AI is listening to everything we’re doing, let’s fill it full of loving, communal thoughts as a community, and not follow the hurt. Everybody’s fighting an invisible battle, so we have to be kinder to each other, and to our fellow creatures, and the planet. The planet is stronger than we think, but we have to be more respectful.In a recent interview you mentionedCarl Jungand his books and visiting his home, which I found fascinating. How did you come across Jung and have you been through Jungian analysis?Sandra, Haverford, PennsylvaniaI remember being a teenager readingMemories, Dreams, ReflectionsandPsychology and Alchemyand Carl Jung’s shadow [theory] and all this stuff. And people were like, “Why are you reading that?” I don’t know. I’ve always been a searcher. I don’t know if I dreamed of being some kind of analyst, but I’ve definitely analysed myself a lot. And yes, I’ve had Jungian analysis. My first therapist I ever got was a Jungian analyst, I sought him out because I really resonated with that. One thing for me was, what is real? Dreams are reality, where do your dreams end and reality begins? I love that. Dreams are really important, and your unconscious.Do you have any regrets?Kevin,Wallasey, WirralNot necessarily regrets. At this point in my life, when I look back, I know I would have done things differently, but I needed the life experience to get me to this point to teach me that maybe those things could have been handled in a different way. In my personal life … I really didn’t recover from my first relationship, and I always kept on trying to fill a void that I didn’t need to. I was trying to create something for my children or for myself, some kind of place of safety. So those things, I guess. But other than that … I couldn’t have played the character of Shelly the way I did if I didn’t have the life I had. So I always think it was all worth it. It was a boot camp.Explore more on these topicsPamela AndersonYou ask the questionsTelevisionTheatreBroadwayBaywatchfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On other occasions that change, or at least the understanding of that change, comes gradually, with the enormity of the situation obscured by the natural human propensity to hope for a happy outcome. For Eunice Paiva – the phenomenal Fernanda Torres – in Brazilian director Walter Salles’s superb, factually based Portuguese-language dramaI’m Still Here, both are true.When we first meet Eunice, life with her husband, Rubens (Selton Mello), a former congressman and civil engineer, and their five children in a beachfront house in 1970 Rio de Janeiro, is full of friends and laughter; books and art; cigars, whisky and celebration. The flexing muscle of Brazil’s military dictatorship is background noise – the helicopter blades carving up the sky as the kids play beach volleyball; the rumble of a convoy of armoured vehicles on the seafront – that can be tuned out. It feels removed from the liberal intellectual social whirl of the Paiva household.The realisation that her husband is gone for good is a gradual process that plays out. largely without words, on Torres’s faceThen one afternoon, men with guns and sour faces arrive at the door. They’ve come, they say, to take Rubens to make a statement. Who they are and where he has been removed to remain a mystery. Eunice and her 15-year-old daughter, Eliana (Luiza Kosovski), are also questioned. Eliana, although Eunice doesn’t know it, is released after 24 hours. Eunice, meanwhile, is kept in a filthy cell and subjected to repeated interrogations over 12 days. It’s the kind of trauma that scars a person’s psyche, but Eunice, for the sake of her kids and her own sanity, puts on a brave face and one of her many immaculately chic trouser suits and campaigns for Rubens’ safe return.The first and longest chapter of this involving saga observes an unwittingly sheltered woman slowly coming to terms with the fact that the world has changed for ever, and so must she. The realisation that her husband is gone for good is a gradual process that plays out, largely without words, on Torres’s face, in a performance of extraordinary intelligence and emotional complexity. She is deservedly Oscar-nominated for best actress.I’m Still Hereis also in contention for best picture and best international feature film, and following theEmilia Pérezdebacleit’s the one to beat in this last category.Film-maker Walter Salles: ‘Cinema, as opposed to noise, used to be at the heart of the Oscars’Read moreHis first Brazil-set feature sinceLinha de Passein 2008, it’s a personal project for Salles (The Motorcycle Diaries;Central Station). As a child in Rio, he was close friends with the Paiva children – part of the constant tide of visitors who flowed through the always-open doors of the airy, friendly house on the beach.I’m Still Hereis based on a memoir by Eunice’s son Marcelo Rubens Paiva, who co-wrote the screenplay with Murilo Hauser and Heitor Lorega; the considerable Paiva archive of photos and home videos was an invaluable resource. In this film about the resilience of family, there’s also apersonal connectionfor lead actor Torres: her mother, Fernanda Montenegro, nominated 26 years ago for an Oscar for her performance inCentral Station, appears in this film in a brief but devastating coda, playing Eunice as an older woman.Meticulous in its period detail,I’m Still Hereunfolds in a vividly evoked early 1970s Rio, with two later chapters set in 1996 and 2014. Far-reaching in its themes, the picture represents Salles at his absolute best. It looks sublime: the director chose to shoot on various film stocks, with grainy, skittish Super-16 capturing the energy and excitement of being a teenager running riot on the streets of Rio, and 35mm bringing a pleasing, lived-in texture to the domestic scenes. A terrific soundtrack balances the irreverent energy of Brazilian Tropicália artists such as Tom Zé and Caetano Veloso against a pensive, brooding score byWarren Ellis.View image in fullscreen‘The magnetic pull of happier times’ (clockwise from top left): Selton Mello, Fernanda Torres, Cora Mora and Guilherme Silveira in I’m Still Here.Photograph: Alile OnawaleAmong the film’s many exquisitely realised scenes, several stand out. One comes immediately after Eunice has heard from an associate of her husband the unconfirmed rumour of Rubens’ death. She has promised to take the children for ice-cream and that’s what she does, wrapping them in a protective layer of normalcy. But she scans the room in anguish, each laughing family sharing sundaes a choking reminder of the small, shared marital joys stolen from her.Another is when Eunice decides to relocate the family to São Paulo to go back to college (in real life, she went on to become a human rights lawyer). As the last of their possessions are loaded into the car, the youngest of the Paiva children, Babiu (Cora Mora), sits on the doorstep, her face a mask of grief, leaning towards the now empty rooms as though drawn by the magnetic pull of happier times. It’s in this moment, we later learn, that the Babiu “buried” her father, realising then that he wasn’t coming home.

Stars of Bridgerton, Game of Thrones, Line of Duty, Downton Abbey and Happy Valley are among its graduates. Its successes go back decades – Skins, Misfits, This is England, Utopia – including every soap opera and plenty of sitcoms. There is barely a part of television or film left untouched by this 42-year-old organisation.Television Workshop, one of the country’s most successful acting programmes, can be found in a small, unassuming room down a street of former industrial buildings in Nottingham.View image in fullscreenThe 260 places at the Television Workshop are highly sought-after.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianIts list of famous alumni is long. Samantha Morton, Vicky McClure, Bella Ramsey, Jack O’Connell and Felicity Jones all learned their trade there, as did Michael Socha and his sister Lauren, Aisling Loftus, Joe Dempsie, Perry Fitzpatrick, Anjli Mohindra and hundreds more recognisable faces.It is for this reason the 260 places at the Television Workshop – or just Workshop, as the students call it – are highly sought-after. Auditions are rigorous and places are allocated based purely on talent. Once young people are accepted, the work is taken very seriously and they are taught the discipline and professionalism needed to survive in film and television.But what makes Workshop different from prestigious theatre programmes and top drama schools is that nobody is turned away because they cannot afford the fees.McClure told the Guardian she was “beyond grateful” for the opportunities given to her by the charity, adding: “Without the TV Workshop I can pretty much, hand on heart, say that I wouldn’t have made it this far, because of the style of training and because it was free of charge.”View image in fullscreenTelevision Workshop alumni include Vicky McClure.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianMcClure, who rose to fame alongside a number of other workshoppers in the drama This is England, for which she won a Bafta, is one of the patrons of the charity, as is Oscar nominee and Bafta fellow Morton, and the award-winning film-maker Shane Meadows.And it is still churning out emerging stars. Last year, when the second series of the BBC’s Sherwood aired, a dozen current and former workshoppers could be seen in episode one alone.Two of those were Oliver Huntingdon and Bill Jones, both aged 24, who played Ryan Bottomley and Ronan Sparrow in James Graham’s Nottingham-based drama.“Every actor that’s come out of Workshop keeps their rough edges and their personality and they’re authentic, rather than it being drilled out of you, which you might see from some of the mainstream drama schools,” said Jones, who joined at the youngest possible age, seven, and stayed as long as he could, through to the age of 21.View image in fullscreenStudents acting in character in a Nottingham bar.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHuntingdon agreed. “It was a space with kids like me from similar backgrounds, the same age, similar mindset … enabling us all to test and try and make a fool out of ourselves and find our style. There’s so much talent there, so much variety of talent, and I think it’s becoming hard to ignore now for casting directors.”Jones added: “It’s important to say how unbelievably amazing it is.”Ali Rashley, the Television Workshop’s director, said offering free places to those who cannot afford the fees “will remain the most important thing, no matter how tough it’s getting”.And it is getting very tough. “There’s just no funding at all for us,” she said. “It’s become an absolute battle.” For decades, the programme had been financed by ITV and the BBC but slowly the funding disappeared as broadcasters’ purse strings tightened.Running costs are £120,000 a year – a small figure, even in the charity sector – and £540 trains one child for a year, a minute fraction of drama school fees. Parents who can afford it pay £45 a month, while bursaries are funded by generous members of the public and successful actors, such as Kenneth Branagh, who recently donated after hearing about the organisation through a co-star who had been a member.“He gave up his time completely free and spent an afternoon here, and it was amazing. Absolutely amazing,” Rashley said. She will use his donation to put on a free Shakespeare programme, which for some may be their only chance to perform Shakespeare, given that drama has been entirely erased in many state school curriculums.It is clear organisations like the Television Workshop are vital to address a severe imbalance in the creative landscape. Figures show 35% of Bafta-nominated actors were privately educated (compared with 6-7% of the general public), an enormous overrepresentation.Middle-class actors are often chosen for working-class parts, “but it doesn’t work both ways, does it? That’s really frustrating and it’s just so unfair.”The regional aspect is important too. Casting calls increasingly require a “London base”, further entrenching the over-representation of wealthier children from the south-east of England.“A working-class kid from Nottingham, Sheffield, Doncaster has not got a London base. And nor do they have access to a London base, and nor are they ever going to. So the industry will end up shutting down again to working-class actors. And that’s unforgivable.”The factors combine to meanonly 8% of creatives in film and TV come from a working-class background, a statistic that is “appalling”, Rashley said. “It’s ridiculous. Years ago we were battling this and, if anything, we’re going to go backwards.”Shaheen Baig, a trustee of the charity Open Door, which helps those who are not from privileged backgrounds to access drama school, agreed. She is a casting director whose extensive portfolio of work includes virtually every lauded drama of the last decade, from Peaky Blinders to Black Mirror, and a number of beloved British films, such as 28 Weeks Later, Brick Lane and Scrapper.“I think it’s getting worse,” she said. “If you look at the amount of public funding that’s been cut from the creative industries, if you’re a creative young person, where do you go?”She described the Television Workshop as “brilliant”, adding: “Without those key figures in someone’s life to push them and inspire them and nurture them, it’s really, really hard in this climate for people to do that for themselves.“Everybody’s stories are valid and there’s room for everybody, but everybody deserves the same level of support and encouragement.”She said representation was vital across the industry to tell stories that are more truthful, but, she said: “It shouldn’t be like this, it shouldn’t be such a fight.”Explore more on these topicsDrama and danceClass act: how the British arts are failing on diversityTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Played by Rin Nasu, she is not a demonstrative woman, but insists on finding a cure. Referred to a counsellor, she describes her only symptom: she cannot remember her name. Elicia Daly’s empathetic therapist takes her seriously. “Without a name we’re nothing,” she says.It is a scene from Haruki Murakami’s 2006 short storyA Shinagawa Monkey, about a woman fearing for her sense of identity. Here, in this collaboration between Glasgow’s Vanishing Point and Yokohama’sKanagawa Arts Theatre, it provides an extra layer of intrigue to an adaptation of the author’s more recentConfessions of a Shinagawa Monkey, which is a magical-realist encounter between a man and a talking animal in a down-at-heelryokan, the only place the man can find a room for the night.Adapted by director Matthew Lenton and actor Sandy Grierson, these short tales have a dream-like uncertainty, the line blurred between real and imagined. What is less likely: that a monkey might work in a hot-spring bathhouse or that he has a fetish for stealing women’s names? Like the set that appears and evaporates – a triumph of stage management – the narrative offers little solid ground.View image in fullscreenIn and out of focus … Aisha Goodman.Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The GuardianNo question this can be beguiling, but on stage, it is also a limitation. What is whimsical and unknowable in just 30 pages of print feels like it is straining for meaning across a 90-minute production. Even on a metaphorical level, loss of identity is not one of the burning issues of the day. It is an intriguing idea for a brief, elliptical story, not a dramatic dilemma. It means a theatrically gorgeous show is thematically slight.Haruki Murakami: ‘My books have been criticised so much over the years, I don’t pay much attention’Read moreBut gorgeous it is. Bathed in Simon Wilkinson’s dusty orange lights, the stage occupies a space between night and day, wake and sleep, where the unsettling patterns of Mark Melville’s sound design slowly give way to the soothing melodies of Bruckner. The actors fade in and out of focus, a shadowy chorus bearing witness to Grierson’s astonishing performance as the Shinagawa Monkey, his politeness disrupted by guttural grunts, his human manners overwhelmed by simian impulse.

At 72, he tells Miranda Sawyer, he’s still thinking about what to shoot nextSun 23 Feb 2025 02.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 11.01 ESTShareAbout 20 years ago, I was on a judging panel for a photography competition, and one of the other judges was Martin Parr. He was charming and affable, almost teddy bear-ish. He was also utterly ruthless. When it came to deciding which photographs were worthy of a prize, he went through the selection swiftly – no, no, yes, no – without hesitation or doubt. His eye was impeccable.Has he always known what makes a good photograph? “Oh yes,” says Parr. “Right from the beginning. Total conviction. I knew I would be a photographer from the age of 13, 14, and I knew what was good even then. I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.”We are in his agent’s office, a small upstairs flat on a market street in east London. Parr owns the building, and this room used to be packed with his work as well as Parr-type things: his collections of Saddam Hussein watches, Soviet-space-dog ephemera, Spice Girls merch. He was obsessed with gathering all sorts of daft stuff, but he’s stopped now to concentrate solely on his work. Though as he says, “photography is a form of collecting.”View image in fullscreen‘I was obsessive about photography. All artists are obsessive, I think.’ Photo from The Last Resort, 1983-85.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis obsession now is theMartin Parr Foundation, headquartered in Bristol, which he established in 2017 and which is where all of his photos have been moved to (along with the watches, space dogs and Spiceys). The foundation is a collection of documentary photography of the British Isles, his own and other people’s. Alongside maintaining Parr’s huge archive, it buys work by lesser-known photographers, gives bursaries to those who are just starting out, has a library and gallery, curates shows, and is Parr’s legacy, what he’s most proud of. He’s 72, is in cancer recovery and is conscious of his age. “Hopefully it will be of some benefit,” he says. “I’m not going to say I’m saving the world. I never expect photography to change anything.” Perhaps not, but the Foundation is clearly a good thing: thewebsiteis great and the current show, featuringSiân Davey’sphotos of family life, is excellent.“Have you been to visit it?” he asks. I haven’t. He looks a bit miffed. He’s quick to pick up on things he thinks I’ve missed about what he does. When we go for a coffee after the interview, he says, almost triumphantly, “You just missed me taking a photo with my phone, of that wall!”In my defence, there is so much of Parr’s work to see that you could spend your whole life looking at his photographs. He’s been working since the 1980s, has had well over 80 exhibitions all over the world, has published more than 145 photography books. He is madly prolific, with an archive that’s endlessly recategorisable. “If you want me to do a book on dogs, no problem,” he says. “I can come up with 100 pictures straight away. Or cigarettes. I’ve just done a book calledNo Smoking, using my archive, edited by mygalleryhere in London.”Is he constantly thinking about work?“More or less, yes. I’m either thinking about things I haven’t shot, or things I’ve done. What’s got to be done. What can I do next? Where can I go?”View image in fullscreen‘Life is funny. I try to bring that into the images.’ The Leaning Tower of Pisa, 1990.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHow would he define his style? “It’s the palette of bright colours, and getting in close to your subject matter. The colour helps to take it one step away from reality. I guess that’s a part of my, erm… ‘vision’ sounds a bit pretentious. And humour. Life is funny. I try to bring that into the images.”His pictures are balanced between documentary, satire and commentary, serious stuff disguised as entertainment, turning the familiar into something alien, making you look harder. And they’re highly populated: he loves taking pictures of people. When he’s out and about, he approaches anyone he likes the look of – “a bit of flattery is a very good entrée” – and then asks them not to smile. “People always want to, but when I’m doing a portrait I want to show some sense of dignity and what they’re in front of, their relationship to that.” Or he just takes a shot in the moment. He uses a digital camera and if someone gets upset with him, he shows them the photograph and deletes it, no fuss.He resists defining his work but has said, “I create fiction out of reality.” What does that mean? “It’s the subjective nature of photography. The only thing that matters is your relationship to the subject. That’s what you’re in control of. It’s all true, but it’s my truth. My personal truth.”His star was launched in 1986 with his showThe Last Resort, a series of pictures he took between 1983 and 1985 of people enjoying themselves at New Brighton, a litter-strewn seaside resort near Liverpool. “It’s still the work I’m most famous for. We keep republishing. It keeps selling.” In 1986 though, it caused some controversy. Some thought Parr’s photos were condescending, though everyone in the photos seemed to be having a most excellent time.“A lot of people don’t like my work,” he says. “I never quite understand what it is. I suppose they don’t like the directness. They’re blaming me for seeing shabby conditions. WithThe Last Resort, we showed the work in Liverpool in ’86, and no one mentioned this idea of it being exploitative or cynical. But when it went to the Serpentine, that’s when that all happened. People in the south-east, they don’t know what it’s like in Liverpool, because they’ve never been.”View image in fullscreen‘A lot of people don’t like my work… They’re blaming me for seeing shabby conditions.’ New Brighton, 1984.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThere was also snobbery, back then, about whether a serious photographer should shoot in colour, as opposed to tasteful monochrome. Plenty of older photographers were outraged by this, as we see in a new documentary,IAm Martin Parr, directed byLee Shulman, which came out this month. Shulman takes Parr back to the scenes of many of his best known works, including New Brighton. “Much less litter,” he says. “It’s been gentrified.”He also returns to Hebden Bridge, where he took his first-ever serious set of photographs,The Non-Conformists. These are not quite what you’d expect from Parr: they’re centred around the village’s chapels and are more traditionally observational, quieter, with less movement, shot in black-and-white. He and his wife, Susie, stayed in Hebden from 1975 to 1980 and became embedded in the community, especially with a particular Methodist chapel where the congregation was just seven farmers. Parr went to all of their farms and took photographs. Susie taught at the Sunday school, despite being an atheist (“It always tickles me, that,” says Parr).“The thing that was weird,” he says, “was they thought we were going to be there for life, and then we moved. One guy, Stanley Greenwood, got upset because he thought we should have stayed.”Is that the nature of the job?“Yes, it happens all the time, more especially with films. You have such an intense relationship, they give a lot to accommodate you, and then you’re gone. And you leave a void in their lives.”Parr was bornin 1952 and grew up in Surrey with his parents and sister, who was seven years younger than him. It was a quiet life – “boring”, he says, though at the time he didn’t know – with weekends spent with his parents, who were keen birdwatchers. “I got taken to Hersham Sewage Works most Saturdays, to see the migratory birds.”View image in fullscreenThe first photograph taken by Martin Parr, of his father on a frozen stream, in 1963.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosIn the summers he’d go to Yorkshire to stay with his grandparents, where he discovered both photography (his grandpa taught him how to use a camera) and community. He now thinks that his work in Hebden Bridge was partly about recapturing “a lost childhood”, searching out the social cohesion he found so appealing in Yorkshire, “so strong, and very charming. Everyone knew each other, when you’d go down the shops, people would say hello. We didn’t have that in Surrey.” His family never ate out or went to a seaside resort, just “places likePagham Harbour, looking for wader birds.” Today, he notes, resorts and beaches are a constant in his working life.At Surbiton County Grammar school his French teacher deemed him “utterly lazy and inattentive” (now the title of hisautobiography, out in September). Though, according to Parr, his lack of application shaped his life for the better, through two events. The first was him failing his History and English A-levels, which meant that out of the three art colleges he’d applied to, he only qualified for Manchester Poly. It was like a door opening: he met Susie (they later had a daughter,Ellen) and became lifelong friends with other photographers, includingDaniel Meadowsand the lateBrian Griffin. “I often reflect on this, when I think back on my life,” he says. “What would have happened if I hadn’t gone to Manchester?”The other significant academic failure was when he flunked a first-year theory exam and should have been kicked out, but his tutor, Alan Murgatroyd, argued to keep him on the course. When Parr did a big show in Manchester five years ago, he invited Murgatroyd toopen it.Murgatroyd knew what he was talking about: ever since he graduated, Parr has motored through an outstanding career. The amount of books with his name on might seem as though he’s casual about what he does, but that would be wrong: he’s an expert on photography books and he spends a long time working on a subject, several years in many cases. Though he’s speeded up recently: he was diagnosed withmyeloma, a type of bone-marrow cancer, in 2021, which, as he says, has “accelerated things”, and made him want to do more work, more quickly. He’s now in remission (he takes chemotherapy tablets), but it affects his back, and he uses a rollator – a frame on wheels – if he has to walk for a long time. “The rollator makes me less threatening, I think, when I approach people,” he says. “They think, poor guy, he’s disabled.” He’s got a disabled parking badge now, which he loves. “I should put it on my CV: can park anywhere.”Time is running out, and there’s still so much to do! His biography, more shows. He does the occasional fashion shoot (a collection of his fashion photos came out last year calledFashion Faux Parr– he’s always been great with titles), and this summer he’s booked to go to Cheltenham, as well as a week’s Mediterranean cruise and also an airshow. “I’ve never been to an airshow”, he says. “Can you believe it! Everyone looks a bit weird when they’re all looking up, I don’t understand why I haven’t done it before…“Summer is my big shooting moment. Everything’s happening. People are out and about. We’re good at all that in this country, hobbies and agricultural shows and festivals. We excel at it.”View image in fullscreen‘We’re good at all that in this country, hobbies and shows and festivals.’ West Midlands, celebration of the Coronation of King Charles III, 2023.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosThere are moments he feels he missed. He’s lived in Bristol since 1987, but didn’t take pictures there for years. “And I wish I’d shot more in the 80s. The miners’ strike, I didn’t even touch, I thought, ‘Oh, someone else is doing all that.’ Then I started collecting miners’ strike ephemera – plates, watches – and we did a show on the strike at the Foundation, featuring other people who covered it, likeJohn Sturrockand John Harris. John Harris did the picture ofthe policeman on the horse,which is now how we remember the miners’ strike. That really demonstrates what photography can do.”Parr’s politics are more hidden than others, and he’s loth to discuss them, but you get a sense of them in his 80s seriesThe Cost of Livingand later,Think of England. “We all hated Thatcher,” he says now, mildly. Over the years, he’s examined the British establishment in detail, covering Harrow and Christ’s Hospital public schools, the army, the City of London’s livery companies. In 2015 he completed a whole series on Oxford university, but they wouldn’t let him photograph the boat-burning at the end of the summer rowing competition. “It’s a secret life,” he says. “And it’s become more secretive.” He was appointed a CBE in 2021, and asked to go to one of the late Queen’s garden parties. He took a small camera – “I looked up the rules, checked it was OK” – and took photos, but then the Palace said he couldn’t publish them. So he just shows the pictures during talks. “I say, ‘You’re looking at censored photos!’ It’s always quite a thrill.”View image in fullscreen‘It’s how I function: my relationship to Britain, through photography.’ Kids in New Brighton, from The Last Resort.Photograph: Martin Parr/Magnum PhotosHis politics are perhaps more recognised in France than here. Actually, his whole career is much bigger over there – “they love photography more, they buy prints, they review shows” – even though Brexit has made it hard to send his books there. He will say he hates Brexit, “but it’s bit difficult to know how to actually articulate that in photographs.”“In France,” he says, “a guy is singling out the politics of my work for a show inJeu de Paume. It’s going to be quite different. Not risky, but edgier than most of my big shows would be. It will be calledEarly Warning.”Is it about consumerism?“Well, we’re all too rich, and we all consume too much. As the Chinese middle class come online, they have all the demands that we’ve had: air conditioning, ovens, fridges, holidays. Ryanair’s just ordered 50 new jets. Since Covid, tourism has got even more crazy. No one is prepared to sacrifice their pleasures. I’m aware I’m contributing to it, of course: my air-mile record is pretty big, having flown to so many places. I’m a tourist as well.”Tourism is Parr’s subject and, to his detractors, his technique. But that is to do him a disservice: Parr’s approach to photography is far more serious and considered. It’s about the relationship between him and what he photographs – usually the UK – and getting that into the pictures. And it’s everything to him.“It’s what I do, it’s how I function,” he says. “My relationship to Britain, through photography. There’s many things I dislike about Britain. Then there’s all these other things – the hobbies, the fairs, the agricultural shows, the beaches, Radio 4, a cup of tea – those I love. Photographing it all is a form of therapy for me. It’s defined my life.”IAm Martin Parris in cinemas nowExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The livelihood of workers will become their profit,” said Adamson.The campaign also aims to dispel popular misconceptions. AI, they argue is not innovative. It can only re-mix the past. It cannot discard old prejudices or develop new positions. “If we do not take steps now to protect and respect the space for human culture, creativity and the creators of the future we may lose what it means to be human entirely,” argues supporter Susie Alegre, the author of Human Rights, Robot Wrongs… Being Human in the Age of AI. “Destruction of cultural heritage is an international crime, in part because it paves the way to inhumanity. Without creatives there is no cultural heritage.”View image in fullscreenA children’s book illustration by Ged Adamson, one of the letter’s signatories.Illustration: Ged AdamsonAnother signatory, picture book creator Chris Haughton, insists it is not about being “anti-tech”. “But the way generative AI operates is not at all creatively exciting. It is stealing,” he said this weekend. “If these lobbies succeed in convincing our government we will effectively be handing all the wealth created by the creative industries, hundreds of billions, and giving it all straight to the tech industry.”Abe argues that the representation of diverse and minority groups will take a step back if AI takes the creative reins. “For BAME people, especially east- and south-east Asian, authors and illustrators, the door to the children’s book industry has finally cracked open over the past five years and some of us have managed to squeeze into the super-competitive world,” she said. “But generative AI will create unfair competition for all creatives, and minority creatives would be the first ones to be squeezed back out.”Her co-campaigner, Ciraolo, adds that the early mistakes made with social media are about to be repeated if there is no protest and the right voices are not heard. “Nothing of what the government proposed offers a single good thing for us. The consultation was designed to create a sense of inevitability, to put people off objecting to it and make us cave in in advance,” she said, pointing out that artists are far from “jealous gate-keepers of privilege”, but instead are hard-working and badly paid.“I am worried we are taking away from kids the opportunity to learn the skills that take effort to develop, but give them a lot of confidence and satisfaction. Generative AI looks like creativity, but it robs you of embodied skills,” she said.The headline of this article was amended on 23 February 2025 to correct the spelling of Michael Rosen’s first name.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)The ObserverTeen booksPublishingComputingProtestnewsShareReuse this content"

So what, asks Rhik Samadder, keeps her so grounded?Sun 23 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareEarly on in Gugu Mbatha-Raw’s career, an older, white actor advised she change her name to something easier to pronounce. She declined – a strong choice for a young actor. “I don’t think it’sthatstrong,” rebuts Mbatha-Raw. She likes her name. Besides, “it means ‘Our Pride’ in Zulu. To change that would be the antithesis of its meaning.”Mbatha-Raw is known for choosing roles that combine art and social advocacy. She’s won awards, been honoured with an MBE, appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Refugee Agency. People still mispronounce her name, though. The most extreme example she recalls was in Norway, when a host announced her from a piece of paper. “Gucci… Matthew… Ray? I was like, ‘I guess that’s me!’”I wonder if this says something about the west’s complacency regarding the achievements of those with ethnic roots elsewhere. Doesn’t middle England relate more easily to names that reflect their own? “I disagree,” she says. “I think it’s OK for people to be challenged. To reach outside their culture and know that’s not all there is.” Yes, but do they? “Well, you’ve got to give them the opportunity.” The answer brings me up short.We’re at a farmhouse table at a west London photography studio. When I walked in, Mbatha-Raw was wearing beads of jewellery and doing a fan dance with a pink tutu. She’s here to promote the second series ofSurface, the Apple TV thriller about a woman who suffers memory loss after an apparent suicide attempt. “I’d seen other amnesia stories, but always featuring a male protagonist, from a male point of view,” she says.View image in fullscreenScene stealer: playing a woman with memory loss in Surface.Surface, made byHello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon’s media company, offered Mbatha-Raw the opportunity to come on board as an executive producer.She relished being a bigger part of the process, from pitching to Apple to choosing the creative team and having a voice at script level.Surfaceinvestigates identity, trust and trauma. The first series, set in San Francisco, was measured and mysterious. The second series takes place in the UK – “darker, faster-paced, a bit grittier.”It also boasts a bigger cast includingJoely RichardsonandTara Fitzgerald, actors Mbatha-Raw looks up to. Of anyone working today, who does she most admire? “Cate Blanchett”, she says. “I love how she carries herself in the world.” Blanchett, a fellow UNHCR Goodwill ambassador, is widely respected for her elegance and range, splitting roles between stage and screen. Also, “I don’t know much about her personal life, which I like.”Mbatha-Rawhas never publicly discussed her private life (it’s unknown if she is currently in a relationship). “It’s a way to have longevity as an artist,” she explains. Her job is to take audiences on an imaginative journey through a character. The more they know about the actor, the less they believe. “If people have too many ideas about your world, it dilutes the work,” she says. It’s a purist view of the craft. “There’s thisMichaela Coelquote from a few years ago, about how it’s OK to disappear,” she goes on. “As an artist you need to refill the well, have something to say.” She remembers life before the internet and social media. “I’m thankful to have a perspective that isn’t just pushing yourself out there, simply for the sake of being present.”View image in fullscreen‘If people have too many ideas about your world, it dilutes the work’: Gugu Mbatha-Raw wears feather dress and jacket, bothprada.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverHer self-possession is admirable, but it comes with a certain reserve, a graceful front I’m not sure I’m allowed to see behind. I wonder if I should tease her, but it’s hard – she’s a Teflon mix of LA positivity and British politeness. She keeps a gratitude journal, which she combines with morning pages (a daily practice of stream-of-consciousness writing), and is given to exclaiming “Oh gosh!” like Ned Flanders. When someone sets down a plate of fresh-baked brownies on the table in front of us, she actually says “Holy moly!” I tell her she has head girl energy. “Well, Iwashead girl,” she says. Optimism is part of everything she does. Getting up at 4am to film on location in the freezing cold necessitates faith in a larger goal. “You have to believe in things you can’t yet see.”Mbatha-Raw was bornin the small town of Witney in Oxfordshire in 1983, to a white mother, Anne, a nurse, and a black South African father, Patrick, a physician. Her parents met at the Churchill Hospital, a cancer centre, and divorced when she was around three. They remain active presences in her life. Her mother gave her confidence and work ethic, she says, and supported every interest, from saxophone to ballet. An only child, she was already itching to begin the life of a professional artist. “I would’ve moved to London at age 12,” she says, “if she’d let me.”Her father, an activist who fled apartheid, gifted her political awareness. She remembers dinner table conversations that gave her a global perspective, opening up questions about justice and equality. “As my dad always said, in South Africa, you’re politicised at birth. It’s not a luxury, or a choice.” She has family in Johannesburg. Visiting the country as an adult deepened her understanding of Britain’s role in world history. “Culturally, that’s something we’re still figuring out.”As an adolescent, painting was her passion. During theYBAyears she was inspired by Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin, and by the fleshy, psychologically acute portraits of Jenny Saville. But theatre ultimately brought her more out of herself. She started attending the National Youth Music Theatre and was accepted into Rada, which she started two weeks after 9/11.View image in fullscreenBright eyed: on The Morning Show with Bel Powley.Photograph: Apple TV+She made her name in a 2009 production ofHamletopposite Jude Law, followed by the landmark 2013 filmBelle. Two years later she was nominated for anEvening Standardaward for her performance in Jess Swale’s playNell Gwyn, about an orange seller who rose socially to become the mistress of Charles II. She gained a new level of visibility starring inSan Junipero, the queer, Emmy-winning episode ofBlack Mirror. In 2017 the Queen awarded her an MBE for services to drama.Social change happens incrementally, but there are people and moments that drive it.Belle, the 2013 film in which Mbatha-Raw played mixed-race aristocrat Lady Dido Elizabeth Belle, was one. Based on a true story, it helped overturn staid assumptions of what period drama looked like. WithoutBelle, there might not have been aBridgerton, a show she credits with lasting influence in her industry, particularly the hiring of non-white crew members on sets. “There’s a generation of runners and assistants onBridgertonwho are coming up from there, moving onwards.”Diversity is a cause she’s passionate about. While her achievements are frequently held up as a success story, representation is only one aspect of it. “You could go, ‘Oh [the industry has been] fixed because there’s this person in front of the camera’,” she says. “But actually behind the camera is no different than it’s been for years.” In the last two or three years she’s noticed a positive shift, she says, at least in the UK. She now uses her executive role to widen opportunity when staffing crews, as a condition of her involvement. The last two sets she’s worked on have been “by far the most diverse of my whole career, and that’s not by accident”.I ask if she experienced racism growing up in a small town in the 80s. She wasn’t really aware of racism, she says. This stuns me. “I don’t know if I was living in a post-racial bubble of ignorance, or if that was just my experience,” she shrugs.When she was a little older, she learned more about her father’s experiences under apartheid.View image in fullscreen‘If something isn’t feeling good, I’m OK to say it right away’: top, skirt, earrings, cuffs and sandals all Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello,ysl.com.Photograph: Rachell Smith/The ObserverWorking in America in her mid-20s was another turning point. The media there is far more sharply tuned to race, and she observed people keen to assign labels, sometimes farcically. An early experience was ppromoting JJ Abrams’s espionage dramaUndercoversin 2010. She recalls being introduced by a host, who announced, “This is the first show to feature two African-American leads sinceThe Cosby Show!” The only problem being: “I’m biracial British, and my co-star was German-Ghanaian.”She’s since worked with the biggest names in showbusiness, including Oprah Winfrey, who was supportive ofBelle, and whom she later acted alongside in Ava DuVernay’sA Wrinkle in Time. The last time they met was for Edward Enninful’s finalVoguecover, which showcased 40 stars including Serena Williams, Naomi Campbell and Laverne Cox, over the strapline “Legendary!” It was surreal, she says. “To be in a room with somebody like Jane Fond…” she catches herself. “With Jane Fonda! There’s nobody like Jane Fonda.”It is an extraordinary cover: a latter-day, femaleSergeant Pepper. “Everyone thought it was Photoshopped! With AI and CGI, no one believes we were all in one place.” The day may have been a blur, but something stayed with her. “I was in awe of the elders. The mature women in the room, and that idea of longevity that I aspire to.”Longevity is hard for anyone, and there is extra pressure on people of colour. I ask about Will Smith, her co-star onConcussion. She has nothing but praise for his generosity, like the occasion she mentioned she no longer had time for painting. “The next day, my trailer was filled with paints and an easel, in classic Will Smith style.”During the pandemic Mbatha-Raw was locked down in her Los Angeles apartment. Turning out cupboards in boredom, she found the unused art materials Smith had given her. She began painting portraits from photographs, as a way of connecting with family who weren’t there. “To be able to concentrate on somebody’s face made me feel close to them.” Painting every day, and watching the news, she saw America’s racial divisions play out. At the most painful collective moment of 2020, she painted portraits of George Floyd andBreonna Taylor, black citizens killed by the police. “It became a way to metabolise what was going on.” She later auctioned the pieces to raise money forEqual Justice Initiative,The Bail Project,M4BLandBlack Lives Matter.Life is short, she says as we finish. “You hope people appreciate what you’re trying to do, but you can’t get hung up on it.” There’s that self-possession again. It feels innate, but Mbatha-Raw insists it’s something she’s worked on over time. So what’s been the key to her confidence? It boils down to trusting one’s intuition. “If something isn’t feeling good, I’m OK to say it right away, rather than fester,” she reflects. “Your gut is always trying to tell you something.”After years living out of a suitcase, she’s now settled back in Oxfordshire. Though settled may be the wrong word. We’ll see her leading upcomingDoctor Whospin-off,The War Between the Land and the Sea. She’s about to fly to the Caribbean for two months to completeInheritance, a Sky Original which addresses legacies of slavery and colonialism. Filmed between Bristol and Jamaica, the show will tackle the theme of slavery reparations, and how we measure the harms of the past. “It’s going to be a conversation provoker; and I’m excited for the conversation.” She’s where she wants to be, sailing right into the storms that rage loudest. Or maybe she’s making her own weather.How does she switch off? More often than not, watching nature documentaries. “Something where there’s no acting,” she says, pondering the appeal. “That fish is just being itself. Just swimming in the ocean. That’s relaxing to me.”Surface season 2 is streaming on Apple TV+Fashion editor Jo Jones; hair by James Catalano at The Wall Group using Amika; makeup by Tania Grier using Prada Beauty;fashion assistant Sam Deaman; photographer’s assistants Ethan Humphries and Sophie PhillipsExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without it we may lose the next generation of writing talentKatie HimsHundreds of hours of original plays have been cut from the corporation’s programming in recent years. If the trend continues, a valuable training ground for writers will be lostSun 23 Feb 2025 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 23 Feb 2025 05.14 ESTShareThe BBC’s output of new original and adapted drama has more than halved since 2018 – a cut that amounts to hundreds of lost hours, although precise figures are hard to come by. At a time when interest in audio content has never been higher – the number of existing podcasts is somewhere between 3m and 4m; a hit series is downloaded millions of times a month (The Rest Is History: 29m!) – the BBC’s audio drama output is at an all-time low. As a career radio dramatist, whenever I am gloomily dwelling on this fact, the football phrase “snatching defeat from the jaws of victory” comes to mind. Because in this new era of audio storytelling and podcast ubiquity, the BBC’s incredible track record in radio dramashouldhave proved a fabulous advantage. Instead, we are facing the possibility of extinction.It all began with the 60-minute Friday Play (decommissioned in 2010). This was followed by The Wire (Radio 3) in 2014. The 15-minute drama inWoman’s Hourwas lost in 2021.Radio4’s Friday afternoon play became 30 minutes rather than 45 soon after. Its 60-minute Saturday play – once a weekly event – has been steadily whittled down to 12 new original dramas a year. The latest cut – Radio 3’s Sunday night drama, the UK’s last remaining 90-minute slot – has generated some press, and a petition from the likes of Judi Dench and Ian McKellan, but it is only the latest in a series of losses. BBC radio drama production staff have largely been made redundant and only a skeletal team remain in a handful of BBC radio drama departments. This amounts to an exodus of skill and talent. Many of these makers go on to create work outside the corporation, and indeed for it, but a freelance producer will struggle to make a living solely in drama.View image in fullscreenBilly Elliot screenwriter Lee Hall began his writing career with radio plays.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianWhy does this matter? It matters because BBC radio has historically played a unique role in the development of drama in this country.Radio dramais a unique art form that reaches millions of listeners and offers a tremendous range and variety of stories from the epic series to the small and local. These cuts have terrible implications for actors and writers, for diversity, inclusion and access… Should we really just shrug our shoulders at the prospect of it all disappearing?Quick GuideTheatre critic Susannah Clapp picks five great BBC radio dramasShow1.Home FrontOne of the most ambitious and illuminating of all drama series. More than 500 episodes charting aspects of life in Britain away from the fighting during the 1914-18 war, day by day, each episode airing 100 years later. Sex, spies, women’s soccer.2.Cabin PressureJohn Finnemore’s wonderfully well-written comediesy, which began in 2008, about a hopeless airline. The cast includes Benedict Cumberbatch and Stephanie Cole, and a creamy-voiced, supercilious, hilarious Roger Allam.2.The Voyage of the St LouisTom Stoppard has written extensively for radio. His impressive 2020 adaptation of Daniel Kehlmann’s play – about Jewish refugees on an ocean liner just before the outbreak of the second world war – featured Toby Jones.3.Waterloo StationKatie Hims’s beautifully turned romance won the best radio drama at the 2023 Writers’ Guild of Great Britain awards.4.Under Milk WoodStill a masterclass in radio’s inner murmurings. If Richard Burton’s velvet tones in this 1954Play for Radio“play for voices” rub you up the wrong way, get hold of a recording ofGeorge Martin’s reorchestrated version, with Bonnie Tyler as Polly Garter.5.The ArchersThe long history, the in-real-timeness ofThe Archersallows some stories to rise from the trudge and hit home. John’s death, Jack Woolley’s illness and now reckless, imprisonedGeorge Grundy. Emerald O’Hanrahan’s performance asEmma, George’s stricken mother, lifteds whole episodes.Susannah ClappWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.My first radio play was recorded in Manchester in 1997.The Earthquake Girlwas the story of an agoraphobic librarian played by Saskia Reeves. Jean Alexander and Burt Caesar also starred. I had watched Alexander play Hilda Ogden onCoronation Streetwith my nan for years. So it was a huge thrill to hear her say the words I’d written and she was fantastic as an intransigent woman who refused to stop crunching crisps under the No Eating sign in the library. I cannot imagine where else or even how else I would have been able to tell that story – or who might have encouraged me to tell it. The play went on to win the Richard Imison award and I have been writing radio drama ever since. I have been incredibly lucky.But the small single play that allows a writer to be themselves or rather – crucially – tobecomethemselves is increasingly rare. A writer’s loss is an audience’s loss too: look at what some first-time or early-stage writers of these small single plays have gone on to do. Lee Hall’s first radio play,I Luv You Jimmy Spud, was broadcast in 1995. He went on to write the screenplay forBilly Elliotsoon after; his latest hit is the libretto for Royal Opera’s new adaptation ofFesten. A 27-year-old Roy Williams (Sucker Punch, Death of England) had his playHomeboysbroadcast in the BBC’s First Bite Young Writers festival in 1995. The first play by Tanika Gupta (Lions and Tigers, A Tupperware of Ashes),Asha, was broadcast on radio in 1991. Radio play regular Peter Straughan is up for an Oscar next month for best adapted screenplay forConclave. James Graham, Rebecca Lenkiewicz, Nick Payne and debbie tucker green all had early successes on radio. I could list many more.Historically, radio has always been a more accessible route into writing drama than film, television or theatre, but it is not, however, simply a stepping stone to other more high- profile work: it is a valuable art form in its own right. Alistair Cooke’s famous assertion that “the pictures are better” on radio was a reference to sport, but he could just as easily have been talking about drama. Radio is such a limber medium. Just as you can listen anywhere, you can go anywhere in the storytelling. Backwards or forwards in time. You can write ghost stories and sci-fi, jump from Lewisham to China and back again. There is no budgetary impact if you decide to set the whole thing in space.View image in fullscreenMike Bartlett, centre, whose first commission was the radio play Not Talking, with June Whitfield and Richard Briers.Photograph: Marc BrennerRadio is also the most collaborative of mediums, because the collaboration extends to its audience. You can be getting on with something else while you listen, but then have to stop so you don’t miss a word. You might find yourself rooted to your car seat at the end of a journey, just to hear how something ends. Or have to stop what you’re doing just so you can cry. Lee Hall’s radio playSpoonface Steinbergfamously had lorry drivers pulling over in laybys in order to weep.The intimacy of the medium seems to foster this very human, often very emotional, connection between the work and the listener. The story goes straight into your mind. Now that we can listen anywhere, any time, our external world can become part of this collaboration too. Listening to a ghost story while walking on the beach one late afternoon, I didn’t notice how much darker it had become or the fact that I was completely alone. The story finished and I was completely spooked. As a story gets inside you, you also get inside the story.Mike Bartlett has had tremendous success on stage (Cock;Earthquakes in London;Unicorn, starring Stephen Mangan and Nicola Walker, currently in the West End) and in TV (Doctor Foster), but his first commission was a radio play –Not Talking, with June Whitfield and Richard Briers – which he wrote when he was 25. When I ask him what makes the form unique for him as a writer, he tells me that radio drama is “the most human of mediums, in the way it is written, produced and experienced”. He also describes the difficulty of telling certain stories on television when there is now such pressure, in the age of streaming behemoths and international co-productions, to create global appeal. “In radio you can be more specific, you can reflect the local – you can write about a small town, about scrambled eggs, you can reflect the world that people live in. It can be hard to sell the story of a local town if you have to seek co-production from another country.” But we know that the most specific stories can often prove the most universal in terms of appeal. If done well.View image in fullscreenPlaywright Tanika Gupta is another graduate of the school of radio drama.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianPeople say to me all the time – well, what about writing for other audio content providers? But there isn’t the infrastructure or the economic model to make this a viable full-time or even part-time alternative. Despite everything, the BBC is still the largest provider of audio drama in the world, but if the cuts continue at such pace there will soon be nothing left. And while it is not, of course, the BBC’s job to train writers, it does have a public service remit – and if the BBC cannot fulfil this role, then who will? BBC audio drama has a key role to play in the ecosystem of drama production in this country. Cutting it back to almost nothing is like cutting down a small rainforest. The effects are being felt now but they will be felt even more urgently in the future. And the loss will be everyone’s.Katie Hims is an award-winning radio playwrightExplore more on these topicsRadio dramaThe ObserverRadioPodcastsBBCcommentShareReuse this content"

Joan Didion journal opens ethical minefieldSoon we can all read the late author’s private notes about her therapy. But should we?Donna FergusonSun 23 Feb 2025 04.00 ESTShareIn 1998, the late journalistJoan Didionwrote a scathing essay about the posthumous publication ofTrue at First Light, a travel journal and fictional memoir by Ernest Hemingway, 38 years after the author killed himself. “This is a man to whom words mattered. He worked at them, he understood them, he got inside them,” Didion wrote. “His wish to be survived by only the words he determined fit for publication would have seemed clear enough.”Just over a year later, in December 1999, Didion beganwriting her own journalabout her sessions with a psychiatrist. She addressed these notes – detailing her struggles with alcoholism, anxiety, guilt and depression, a sometimes fraught relationship with her adopted daughter Quintana and reflections on her childhood and legacy – to her husband,John Gregory Dunne.The announcement that these post-psychiatry notes, discovered by Didion’s literary executors in an unlabelled folder shortly after she died in 2021,are to be published in Aprilhas raised questions around the ethics of posthumous publishing.Didion left no instructions to her trustees – her literary editor Lynn Nesbit, and two of her longtime editors, Shelley Wanger and Sharon DeLano – about how to handle the deeply private journal after her death from complications of Parkinson’s disease.In total, 46 entries were found – printed out and placed in chronological order – in a portable filing cabinet next to her desk. They will be published in their entirety, with only minimal editing, such as footnotes and corrections of typos, under the titleNotes to John.The book is already being hyped as “an unmissable publication” from “one of the most iconic writers of our time” by its UK publisher 4th Estate, an imprint of HarperCollins. According to the publisher, the “meticulous” notes of conversations Didion had with her psychiatrist were central to Didion’s understanding of the themes she turned to in her celebrated late works, such as her memoirsThe Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights, in which she writes about Quintana and John’s deaths.View image in fullscreenDidion, her husband John Gregory Dunne and their daughter Quintana in their kitchen in Malibu, California, in 1972.Photograph: Henry Clarke/Conde Nast/Getty ImagesA close friend of Didion, who wished to remain anonymous, told theObserver: “I have no doubt that this document will further our collective astonishment at Joan’s work, but I also cannot think of anything more private than notes kept about one’s psychiatry sessions. It’s not my place to say what Joan would have wanted, but as someone who loved her very much, the publication of these pages makes me terrifically sad.”They said that, after discovering that Didion’s literary executors had decided to publish the notes, several of Didion’s closest friends and family members had shared similar feelings of disappointment and anguish: “The collective feeling in her inner circle is that her privacy has been betrayed … While I, of course, understand the public thirst for this document, given Joan’s extraordinary place in American letters, Joan was nothing if not meticulous and intentional with the details she decided to share – and not share – inThe Year of Magical ThinkingandBlue Nights. Anything beyond that seems to me a tremendous betrayal of her privacy by the people she trusted the most.”Dr Rod Rosenquist, who lectures at the University of Northampton on the ethics of posthumous publishing, said the journal was bound to generate interest due to the “cult of Joan Didion”, which saw items such as her $12 blank notebooks fetch $9,000 at the auction of her estate by her heirs in 2022. “She is a celebrity writer within literary circles … and what I think is so interesting about public figures is that they are owned – manipulated in some ways – by the public,” he said.Readers are hungry to better understand the inner life of an author they admire, he added: “That’s the very nature of celebrity.”It is for this reason that writers such as Henry James and Charles Dickens burned their personal papers while they were still alive. But since Didion did not do this or instruct her literary executors not to publish the notes, leaving them “carefully organised” near her desk, where they were bound to be found, then “legally everyone’s acting within their rights and acting in ways that the market encourages them to act”, he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It has mashed-up shades of Miss World – except this is a feminist version of that contest, sending up and railing against women’s place in TV culture and in life.The competition is down to five finalists – including Mia, who has bumped her head just before going on air. Her concussed state leads her to speak and sing in unfiltered ways about the hypocrisies of reality TV and its cynical gender politics. When she performs her first, punkish protest to a live studio audience with the song Fuck This Show, her popularity rockets and producers begins using this to their advantage.Tobia Rossi and Oliver Lidert’s script, based on an original concept by Ilaria Fioravanti, is a caffeinated monologue in which Daisy Steere plays every character, including the Italian producer and “backstage fascist” Maria, as well as every finalist. Directed by Ruthie Stephens,contestants speak to the off-stage voice of Big Sis (Natalie Casey), and there is occasional Gogglebox-style commentary from characters on small screens on the stage.The aim is clearly to lay bare the biases and skulduggery of such shows, which manipulate contestants and pin women to stereotypical ideals. And the script is lively but the satire is too self-evident. Steere proficiently switches between several accents, which helps distinguish the characters, but there is reductive comedy in a contestant’s Liverpudlian straight-talking, a God-fearing Irish woman (“In der name of der fader …”), a foxhunting Sloane, and so on.View image in fullscreenThese characters are too broad, while the play’s polemic is as unfiltered as Mia’s concussed outrage, and its earnestness sits oddly against the satire. There are mentions of chemical dumping, the wage gap, Jeffrey Epstein, JK Rowling, corporate greed, toxic masculinity and the patriarchy, but critiques are fleeting and unfocused. The songs (with music by Simone Manfredini) deliver generic messages but have little bite and are unmemorable.The end twist is so contrived it seems incoherent, but the production does capture the tinny tone and pace of a reality TV competition, and Steere gives a thoroughly jaunty performance. It is a shame that the show rails against so many social ills but addresses none of them sharply enough.Atthe Other Place, London, until 9 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreReality TVTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

Forty years later, the closest thing to hallucinatory visions tonight are the trippy, lysergic slides that play behind him, as the ex-singer of the neo-prog rock outfit Marillion begins his farewell tour at 66.There are roars from the crowd and a Scotland flag draped over the balcony to welcome the singer and his band, who prepare to depart on an emotional note. The opening Vigil, from Fish’s 1990 debut solo album, comes to life with atmospheric whirrings of synthesiser that float through the room before Fish’s voice gently joins in, and soft plucks of glimmering guitar arrive as it hums along with an ever-building presence before erupting with euphoric force. It sets the tone for an evening of back and forth between theatrical, epic, sprawling soundscapes and tender, stripped-back, restrained songcraft.View image in fullscreenFish at Albert Hall ManchesterPhotograph: Lucy EvansFish’s voice mirrors this pendulum swing too, sounding mighty, rousing and a little raspy on tracks such as the thundering Credo or the punchy Big Wedge, but graceful and sweet on songs such A Gentleman’s Excuse Me. The band’s playing, if occasionally a little dated and tonally repetitive, is immaculate and slick – as displayed during moments such as the vast six-part song Plague of Ghosts, which is stuffed with intricacies and details.

Here he is, walking along the pier at New Brighton, or eating a 99 Flake, just like the holidaymakers snapped for his breakthrough 1986 collection,The Last Resort. But director Lee Shulman’s camera does not study Parr’s face with the same merciless ferocity that Parr turned on his own subjects, instead hovering behind his shoulder, looking at wherever he’s looking at.Some of the more direct attempts to defend Parr’s reputation are unpersuasive.Obviouslypaid gallery employees are going to say they think the boss is good at putting people at ease. Yet something in the forbearing expressions of these interviewees, as the camera is shoved in their faces, suggests otherwise. Meanwhile, the inclusion of celebrity fan David Walliams only prompts the disquieting inference that Parr’s work might be the art-world equivalent ofLittle Britain.And yet the opportunity here to see Parr’s many truly striking images – especially his lesser-seen and touchingly humanist early black-and-white work – leaves the photographer’s legacy in no doubt. He set out to “create an archive about the time that I’ve lived in Britain” and did just that – brusque manner and fabled faux-Parrs notwithstanding.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for I Am Martin Parr.Explore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsThe ObserverMartin ParrPhotographyreviewsShareReuse this content"

Footage of all his amazing saves – the ones that won Euro 92 for the Danish national side, or led Man U to the treble in ’99 – impressively affirm the Great Dane’s greatness. The question though is how? And why?At 6ft 4in tall, his imposing physicality obviously had something to do with it (“Thespanwas like an aeroplane!” marvels Sir Alex Ferguson). Schmeichel’s competitive edge and total inability to abide weakness are attributed to the parenting of a tough, Polish-born father who was orphaned at a young age by the second world war; their story of estrangement and reconciliation is worthy of soap opera. But it’s the insights that the Schmeichels, senior and junior, offer into the tao of the goalie – that “position of ultimate responsibility” – which are most interesting, especially when delivered in that delightful Manc-Danish accent.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for SchmeichelExplore more on these topicsDocumentary filmsThe ObserverSport filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

A celebratory atmosphere greets this comeback show at the nearby Queen Elizabeth Hall, the Coliseum’s temporary home until it reopens for panto season. Seated at cabaret-style tables, we’re here for an engagement party. But this production flatly fails to engage.It starts as it means to go on. After a punishingly long period of awkward stalling, groom-to-be Zack reports that fiancee Sofia has got cold feet. While we wait for her to come round, three “elders”, who narrate and manipulate the drama like the sprites fromA Midsummer Night’s Dream, rewind to the couple’s first meeting in Oldham.afshan d’souza-lodhi’s skimpy plot withholds information and plot development to the final stages, including the reason for Sofia’s doubt, leaving the first half to plug the vacuum with laborious audience participation. Hesmondhalgh is even parachuted in via video, with a cloying speech about love conquering all.Lines sound plucked from the cheesiest wedding speeches. One character reflects: “What changed? I found love.” Another opines: “Don’t listen to the same song on repeat; sometimes you’ve got to hit shuffle.” The script meanders through fate, family and legacy like a best man trying to lend his speech profound emotional ballast.Despite posing as a love letter to Oldham, and using a local community cast to stand in for wedding guests, the only sense of place comes from references to the town’s chicken shops. The couple’s attachment to the town is consequently unclear, although Connor Darren-James and Marucia Ferreira’s naivety is endearing.Equally rudderless is Amanda Huxtable’s direction, which relies on freeze frames and slo-mo. Intermittent pop love songs are soulfully performed by Zee Mehdizadeh and a live band in one corner, but leave the audience exchanging awkward glances across the tables.

Ian Hislop, editor ofPrivate Eye, and his longtime collaborator Nick Newman (they first worked together onSpitting Imagescripts) have dramatised the acid-sharpThe Autobiography of a Cadby Scottish writer AG Macdonell (their fifth play for the small but perfectly formed Watermill theatre). What could possibly go wrong?The novel, published in 1938, covers the life of Edward Fox-Ingleby across roughly the first 26 years of the last century: his landed background, entitled youth at Eton and Oxford, debauched years as a rake about town, profiteering during the first world war, entry into politics, marriage, adultery, double dealings – think Evelyn Waugh but without that author’s sunny view of humanity. Macdonell’s cad presents himself to the reader as a gentleman, covering despicable actions with self-serving, pseudo-altruistic justifications. He typifies the worst kind of landowner, capitalist, politician, developer and misogynist, a composite character revealing the spectrum of corruption across society in his time – and all times.Where the adaptation does indeed go wrong is in trying to cut and paste the picaresque, first-person narrative into a linear development that focuses the antihero into the character of a dodgy politician. The full scope of Fox-Ingleby’s malevolence is lost; he is reduced to a conceited, blustering bounder.Hislop and Newman set themselves a tough task, made harder by budget constraints, limiting their cast to three – but what a trio. James Mack revels in the melodramatic exaggeratedness of the title role. Rhiannon Neads and Mitesh Soni kaleidoscope through 20-plus other roles – each a distinctive gem. A playful spirit characterises every element of director Paul Hart’s well-crafted production. Scene by scene, the script delivers witty, even laugh-aloud moments, but they’re like the stutters of an engine that fails to spark; the whole does not hold.The Autobiography of a Cadis at the Watermill theatre, Newbury, until 22 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverComedyIan HislopreviewsShareReuse this content"

And why not. But a striking aspect ofCopper Bottom, a new house by the architect Adrian James, is that, apart from being in the most literal sense coloured green, it gives little sense of its sustainability. It looks at first sight like a carefree exploration of built form – a WTF YOLO 3D doodle; a fun folly conceived with no particular thought for the environment.James once worked for the brilliantly original British postmodernistJohn Outram, since when he has been ploughing his own distinctive furrow in Oxford. He andhis practicedesign housing, commercial and education buildings, single private houses, ayoga studio. Nearly 30 years ago he announced himself with a full-bodied, barrel-vaultedThameside housein the city, with notes of ancient Egypt and warehouse construction, for himself and his wife, Sarah. Now, having raised a family there, they have built Copper Bottom for the next stage of their lives. It sits on the very edge of the city (a 15-minute bike ride from the centre), just where a lush part of Oxford’s green belt starts, with views back to the dreaming spires.The joints and tricky angles are beautifully sharp and clean: in other hands they could have been an abominationThe exterior of the house is, windows apart, almost all clad in copper, as if the roof had descended to the ground and engulfed the walls. It is metallic origami, angled and faceted, but punchy as well as papery – an object apparently all of one substance like a meteorite or a pachyderm. It is very much sui generis, with no obvious reference to the work of other architects. James himself, if pushed to name inspirations, suggests the sculptural buildings of the modernist Marcel Breuer, or the art of Henry Moore. He wants, he says, to “explore dynamic forms for the way they conjure movement and action and imbue a building with esprit”.View image in fullscreenThe solar-panelled roof.Photograph: Fisher StudiosYet, with 37 solar panels, an air-source heat pump, timber structure, triple-glazing and generous insulation, the house generates more energy than it consumes. More than that, it will pay back the carbon debt incurred by its construction after 10 to 15 years, and from then on it will continue to generate surplus power that can be returned to the national grid. In other words, the world’s climate will be (very fractionally) better off than it would be if the house had not been built at all. The longer it stands, the better.There is a charging point for electric cars, powered by the solar panels and the heat pump. There is air conditioning, which doesn’t sound so green, but is necessary, says James, to future-proof the house against rising temperatures. It’s used only in hot weather, when the solar panels are at their most productive. As for the copper, a metal sometimes abhorred for the energy and extraction involved in its production, it is here all recycled from scrap. It is at once long-lasting (it barely corrodes) and recyclable, and in any case a very thin layer – less than 1mm deep – fixed to plywood sheets. Its total mass, in other words, is a small part of the building’s.View image in fullscreenCopper Bottom’s copper exterior ‘helps the house sit unexpectedly well in its semi-rural surroundings’.Photograph: Fisher StudiosThere is also logic to the design. The underlying shape is a simple cuboid, which is efficient both in terms of construction and conserving energy. The projections and recessions of the copper wrapping serve to shade the interior from the high summer sun (and so help to stop it overheating), while allowing warming rays to enter at a lower angle in winter. James compares this outer layer to a helmet, whether a cyclist’s or a Greek warrior’s, with the complex shapes here being used to deflect sunshine rather than blows to the head.The interior is calm and plain, with big windows and the main rooms facing the best views and the best light. Lesser spaces, such as bathrooms and a utility room, are arranged on the other, north-west-facing side. A double-height space rises through the middle, with a straight stair behind a freestanding wall in purplish-brown brick, which brings a bit of earthy warmth to the mostly white-walled spaces. There are few frills; it’s a different experience from the excitement of the exterior.View image in fullscreenCopper Bottom’s interior.Photograph: Fisher StudiosThe house is not, after all, extravagant, but a clever mixture of the standard and the bespoke. James estimates that the environmental design added about 5% to the typical cost of house of this type, and the copper wrap another 5%, which he believes are investments that will pay back in the end. The framework for the complex shapes is made with the help of mass-produced roof trusses, here fixed to the walls, at 90 degrees to their usual position.Much of the success of the building relies on the skill of the metalworkersCotswold Metal Roofing, with whom James first worked three decades ago on a copper-domed office behind his first house. The joints and tricky angles are beautifully sharp and clean: in other hands they could have been an abomination. Other details play their part – the copper, for example, has been patinated to achieve a less bluish green than it would naturally have. It’s more a pale malachite, which helps the house sit unexpectedly well in its semi-rural surroundings.James calls the house a “fusion of function and expression”. It shows a way in which architectural enjoyment and sustainability can go together. Meanwhile, although you can’t see its timber construction nor, except from above, the solar panels, they’re still there, doing their job.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe ObserverHousingHomesreviewsShareReuse this content"

Memorial Device on X once said of them: ‘not uncommon to find a box of Spartans with teeth marks in every single one – the unaware searching for the nonexistent soft centre,’ which made me guffaw.I gave Olivia some suggestions but she came back to say she’d ‘found the winner inAudrey’s Chocolates. I gave her a selection for Christmas and she loved them.’ I’d never heard of them, which delighted me as I love new recommendations.Audrey’s Chocolates date back to 1948 – and they are still handmade in the same factory – and is apparently a very quaint little shop in Hove, which I intend to visit soon. But they do a roaring online service. Their boxes are super cute, old-fashioned (this is a compliment) and would make excellent presents. You can order exactly the centres you want: hard, soft, nuts etc (though a minimum of three of each). Prices start at £29 for thepack-your-own. There are also pre-selected boxes: selections, rose and violet creams, caramel and truffles, nuts and fruits. I also tried and loved the dark chocolate peppermints, £25, which were beautifully dark and refreshing.Explore more on these topicsChocolateNotes on chocolateFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After three years as head chef at cult London bakery the Dusty Knuckle, Rosina changed tack in 2021, showcasing her retro, comforting yet humble style of cooking at a pop-up, Let Me Fill You Up. “It was six courses and all about stuffed food,” she says. Dishes included cabbage rolls, stuffed chicken wings and jelly (“Ilovejelly”), with a burlesque show thrown in for good measure. A regular supper club, Come To My House I’ll Make You Fat, soon followed, and dinners at her London home have sold out ever since. “I’m still working hard, but now I can do whatever I want,” Rosina says. “And I like doing whatever I want.”View image in fullscreenParis Rosina with her Dinner Lady banner, handmade byAlice Gabb.Photograph: Perou/The ObserverSupper clubs are nothing new; chefs relishing independence and talented amateurs harnessing social media have been opening their homes to paying strangers since late 2008. “Coming from a non-professional kitchen background, I never imagined myself belonging in a restaurant,” saysAna Da Costa, whose Fat Tea supper club celebrating her Macanese heritage has led to restaurant pop-ups and events such as Meatopia. “Professional chefs often focus on the food itself, while amateur cooks like me bring a sense of warmth and familiarity.”James Ramsden rode the early supper club wave in 2010 with Secret Larder. This “led unintentionally to the last 10 years”, which meant opening restaurants including Pidgin in London (now closed). Since he moved to Yorkshire, Ramsden’s supper club – now calledThe Clock Barn– is back, and he has joined the growing number of chefs swapping professional kitchens for something more homely. “I love to cook but have zero desire to work day to day in a restaurant kitchen,” he says. “Now, once a month I do lunch and dinner for 20 people, which is nice and buzzy but seldom overwhelming.”Supper clubs scratch that professional and creative itch while offering greater autonomy over the food and working hours, and an element of certainty that a restaurant can’t. “There’s comfort in knowing how many people are coming to eat, that there’s one menu, and therefore how much money you’re going to take,” adds Ramdsen. But it’s not money that drives him: “If I crunch the numbers, it’s probably not worth doing, other than the fact I really enjoy it.”He’s not alone: last year also saw chefs Marc Johnston and Jonathan Mackle join forces for the rovingTumshie supper club in Glasgow; Rosina’s February supper clubs sold out fast and she has more planned for spring. “I just love hosting – everyone sitting in the kitchen with the music on and the candles lit,” she says. “As my friend always says, your food never tastes better than at your home.”Anna BerrillParis RosinaMeet the Miga familyMiga, arguably London’s standout opening in 2024, launched quietly in May, with an inconspicuous Instagram page (which currently has only three posts) to match its minimalist interiors. Its name means “flavourful house”, and its star dishes include ox bone broth; beef tartare with egg yolk and Korean pear; and braised short ribs, a delicately sweet stew with pears and carrots, alongside sticky rice and tangy, crunchy homemade kimchi.View image in fullscreenThe Miga team … from left, Eun Ah Ko, Hyun Sang Ko, Jae Hun Ko, Kyung Suk Lee and Jae Kyum Ko.Photograph: Pål HansenMiga is a family affair. Hyun Sang Ko moved to London in 1990, working in many of the city’s top Korean and Japanese restaurants. He runs the kitchen, with his three children front of house; their mother, Kyung Suk Lee, has another, very different Miga in south London, which launched in 2020. The latter, son Jae Ko says, is “neighbourhood auntie cooking”, with classic dishes such as bibimbap and Korean fried chicken.The Hackney restaurant has a more modern approach, and Jae’s pride in his father’s cooking is evident: “My dad is the best Korean chef in London, and arguably one of the best chefs in London. [Hackney] is where the competition is. I want to be among the best, because I know my dad can stand out.”Inspired by the Korean cultural wave, orhallyu, spearheaded by its pop music and cinema, Korean restaurants are opening at unprecedented rates. In the US, Hyun Sang says, Korean food is “better than in Korea. Here, I don’t think so.” He is helping to change that.Tomé Morrissy-SwanMigaRising star: Ash Valenzuela-HeegerView image in fullscreenErin and Ash Valenzuela-Heeger of Riverine Rabbit, Birmingham.Photograph: ZAMANIEGO STUDIOFrom the Test Kitchen, a World’s 50 Best regular in her native South Africa, to London’s three-Michelin-star the Ledbury, Ash Valenzuela-Heeger learned from the very best during her first 15 years in professional kitchens. “I endeavoured to push myself, moving around, becoming a better chef,” she says, and those formidable skills are paying dividends at Riverine Rabbit.Opened last January in the Birmingham suburb of Stirchley, and named after a native of South Africa’s Karoo desert, the 12-seat counter-dining venue was an instant hit. Valenzuela-Heeger cooks solo while her wife, Erin, handles front-of-house duties. Praise for the restaurant’s warmth (“We want it to feel like you’re being hosted at ours,” says Erin) and its small plates – such as crab muffin, brown butter hollandaise, pickled lemon and sea herbs; or bone-in skate with a yuzu buttermilk beurre blanc – soon reverberated beyond the West Midlands.There are themes to Valenzuela-Heeger’s food. She likes using seasonal game, and “cooking with fire is core”. Otherwise her dishes are a very now, very personal melding of hip, homely and high-end influences, embodied in eclectic snacks like wagyu biltong, boquerones and cheese on toast, or a fried chicken dish inspired by “throwing caviar on KFC tenders”.That individual approach extends to the Rabbit’s opening hours. Erin is a materials scientist by day; to allow the couple to spend weekends together, Riverine only opens Monday to Friday. “All our hospitality friends told us we were mad,” says Valenzuela-Heeger. “Straight away, Mondays were booking up as fast as Fridays.”Demand means Riverine could grow – extra staff, longer hours, more diners – but that is not on the agenda. For smaller independents, chasing every pound can be counterproductive: untenable at a personal leveland not always wise financially.“You’ve got to be tactical about when you’re open,” says Valenzuela-Heeger, whose recentMichelin Young Chef of 2025 awardwill only make reservations harder to get. And you need to be memorable. “We take care of you,” she continues. “We are like an oasis in a really busy world.”Tony NaylorRiverine RabbitWhen cakes meet chemistry – Dr Josh SmalleyIf you are aGreat British Bake Offfan, Josh Smalley may look familiar. A finalist in the TV competition in 2023, he hasn’t taken the customary post-show path. Instead, he runs an unusual cafe at the centre of the University of Leicester campus. Smalley – a postdoctoral researcher in chemistry – converted an old student hangout into a hub where he demonstrates his baking expertiseandhis knowledge of science.View image in fullscreenJosh Smalley in the Science Kitchen at the University of Leicester.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The ObserverHe teaches the principles of chemistry through practical cooking displays and shows how scientific laws underpin the creation of cooked dishes. One of Smalley’s lectures examines focaccia, in which enzymes break down complex sugars in the dough and drive the fermentation that creates the pockets of gas which give the Italian bread its cratered appearance. During the demonstration, sensors in the bread monitor the production of carbon dioxide. “It is a great way to visualise what is going on,” he says. Other demonstrations include the chemistry of caramel sauce, the science behind swiss roll and how to generate gingerbread in a lab.“There are all sorts of ways that science affects cooking,” says Smalley. “Take blueberry muffins: the sponge will come out red or pink if it is slightly acidic to begin with, but ends up more bluey-green if it is alkaline. People are absolutely fascinated by that sort of thing.”Smalley has taken his shows to the Cheltenham Science Festival and the Royal Institution in London. An April performance at the Edinburgh Science Festival promises a demonstration of Easter food – including, presumably, the chemistry of the hot cross bun.Robin McKieJosh SmalleyMaham Anjum, storytelling ceramicistMaham Anjum is a ceramics designer who researches global craft traditions and revives them for the modern age. “I live and breathe it,” she says from her home in London, where she’s surrounded by shelves full of ceramics from around the world.Inspired by the roadside potters near her grandmother’s house in Lahore, Anjum has worked closely with craftspeople in Sri Lanka, Ethiopia and India to create bespoke tableware for chefs including Jamie Oliver and Asma Khan, and ranges for companies such as Habitat and David Mellor.View image in fullscreenCeramicist Maham Anjum in her north London studio.Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer“You need to be sensitive and respect the craft,” Anjum recalls of her work in Sri Lanka. “We enhanced their hand-making techniques and took time finding clays that could be thrown by the potter but were durable enough for the dishwasher.”She travelled between Sri Lanka and London four times each year for 13 years. “I would sit with the potters, throw with them, introduce them to the buyers.” The potters were paid 30% more than the local market would provide for their work – which was bought by Vivek Singh’s Cinnamon Club, among others.Storytelling is central to Anjum’s work with chefs, whether it’s creating a modernised version of thekulhar(chai cups) Asma Khan remembered from Kolkata, or her range for Vineet Bhatia that fused British and Indian pottery techniques to reflect his menu. Collaboration is also key. “Paula Wolfert, who wrote a book on clay-pot cooking, said: ‘The chef, the potter and the gourmand have been connected for thousands of years,’” Anjum says. “I do the same in a 21st-century context. It’s all teamwork.”Hayley MyersMaham AnjumDavid Carter, restaurateur of the momentLast year was a good one for David Carter. The restaurateur with the Midas touch opened Oma and Agora in London’s Borough Market to great acclaim (picking up a recent Michelin award for best opening, and a star), after being smitten by the Greek islands on a trip in 2022. “I was so inspired I went back six or seven times that year,” he recalls.The original concept was simply Oma (meaning “raw”), but the semi-industrial building was too big. “It would have been suicide to do just one restaurant,” says Carter. So downstairs became Agora, serving slow-grilled chicken thigh skewers and bowls of hummus and masabacha with hot crisps for scooping. “I was more confident about Agora; from a price perspective it’s accessible, but it’s also urban, filthy, and you can come in your pyjamas.”View image in fullscreenRestaurateur David Carter in Oma.Photograph: Amit Lennon/The ObserverUpstairs, Oma is more elegant, with raw sea bass and jalapeño aguachile, plus its much-lauded spanakopita gratin: “It’s more like the creamed spinach you’d get in a steakhouse but spiked with feta. It’s quite naughty.”Carter was “born a glutton”. He grew up in Barbados, baking cakes with his mum before he could walk. Although architecture was the plan (“I love how design makes people feel”), he landed a job at the Four Seasons in LA, before joining the Gordon Ramsay Group in London. But cooking over fire is in his veins, and Carter opened Smokestak, with its brisket buns and pork belly ribs, in 2016: “We were late to the barbecue party, but the food represents me and how I grew up.”Manteca, founded with chef Chris Leach, followed in 2019. Originally in Soho, now in Shoreditch, the restaurant quickly became a London must-visit, thanks to its smart take on Italian food. Silky pasta and nose-to-tail charcuterie showed Carter staying abreast of the curve – not that he believes in trends: “My guiding force is to create restaurants I want to eat in.”What’s next? “I’m attracted to homely concepts: comforting, warming, never stiff.” Does that mean there is a new restaurant in the pipeline? “It takes a year to get a restaurant off the ground, and the year after you get itchy feet,” he says. “Put it this way: we’re approaching a year since Oma opened.”Anna BerrillOmaAgoraJenny Lau’s communityJenny Lau has spent six years building a community through food, and her events have made connections well beyond her London home. She jokes it’s “for selfish reasons”: to create something she longed for. But for the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people who have benefited, she is a hero who has built kinship among diasporic communities.Born in London, Lau moved to Hong Kong with her family as a newborn, then back to the UK aged 11. “You never really think about your identity until you become framed as someone who doesn’t belong,” she says.View image in fullscreenLau studied classical music and is a writer and author – her first book,An A-Z of Chinese Food (Recipes Not Included)was published in January. In 2018 she visited the Hackney Chinese Community Centre in north London (now theESEA Community Centre) and started hosting potluck meals, where each guest brings a dish and stays for the feast. Now she cooks at the centre’s twice-weekly lunch club, which is open to all, and facilitates supper clubs that raise funds for the centre and other charities.Although the centre’s membership hails mostly from east and south-east Asian backgrounds, those who pass through its doors have roots across the world.Lau has helped change the centre’s fortunes. Last year, it moved to a bigger site, and since Jenny’s involvement, younger people have started coming to the centre – an intergenerational connection that benefits everyone.Emily Chung, a doctor, cookbook author and one half of theRangoon Sisters supper club, takes her children there so “they can be around older Asian uncles and aunties. I was fortunate to grow up around that, but they don’t have that so much now. Jenny has allowed so many of us to connect with our roots.”“Someone said my events are ‘for people like me, who feel they don’t belong, or feel safe and accepted in any space’,” Lau says. “That’s exactly what I’m trying to create, for the ‘unbelongers’ who feel a bit awkward and don’t fit in.”Melissa ThompsonJenny LauSam Grainger: the ideal modern chefWhen Sam Grainger opened Manchester’sMedlock Canteenlast year, he wanted its dishes – including a vast turkey schnitzel with salsa verde and a fried duck egg, and a deep-fried fruit pie and custard – to feel as generous as home cooking. “If you’re ordering a portion of mash,” says the 34-year-old, “it should sink you.”View image in fullscreenSam Grainger: ‘I’m bored of all that ego-cheffy stuff.’Photograph: Fabio De Paola/The ObserverTalented chefs rarely concern themselves with big portions, full bellies and offering clear value during a cost-of-living crisis. But Grainger, executive chef and co-owner at a growing portfolio of hip, friendly northern venues, has proven adept at reconciling his on-point modern cooking with that eagerness to please – and feed.Grainger made his name withBelzan, a small-plates restaurant in his native Liverpool – which, at first, “was all about me”. When it opened in 2017, Grainger refused to serve potato dishes. It felt too easy.Belzan remains cutting-edge. But Grainger has learned to edit his wilder creative urges and enthusiasm for new ingredients to create menus that take diners with him: “I’m bored of all that ego-cheffy stuff. The business has become more about people and enjoyment.”This ethos has seen him hit a hot streak with venues includingMadre, a Mexican restaurant collaboration with Breddos Tacos that has sites in Liverpool, Manchester and, soon, Leeds. This year, he will open Manchester bar Speed Limit and an east Asian-inspired restaurant at the city’s Treehouse Hotel.Grainger first cooked professionally in Sydney and Thailand, where food (“so spicy, so flavourful”) offered daily revelations. He likes similarly big flavours and dishes that encourage communal sharing. “I don’t want to sit in stuffy restaurants having 70 minuscule courses,” he says. Dinner should make people smile: “It’s a social thing. It’s about big, hearty stuff on the table you’re going to pass around and chat about. It’s about people.”Tony NaylorSam GraingerKaneda Pen, cooking between culturesRegulars to Soho may know that some of the most exciting recent restaurants began life at the Sun & 13 Cantons pub. At the moment, it’s Mamapen, where Kaneda Pen cooks Cambodian grills and curries, burgers with a Khmer accent and … tattie-mince noodles? It’s Pen’s favourite dish on the menu – comforting, warm, a big-hitter in savoury flavour. As with much of his food, it has its origins in the home kitchen. His Scottish girlfriend (a chef at neighbouring Mountain) was making mince and tatties. She grabbed some leftover gravy from the freezer, “but in that gravy was star anise, oyster sauce, soy sauce …” She put the gravy in the mince; they ate it with potatoes, but Pen kept thinking about noodles, turning it over in his mind, waiting for an opportunity to put it on the menu. When he did, it was an instant bestseller.View image in fullscreenKaneda Pen of Mamapen at the Sun and 13 Cantons in London.Photograph: Nic Crilly-Hargrave“We’ve achieved so much in such a short amount of time,” he says, looking around the dining room. In a different life, Pen used to drink in the Sun & 13 Cantons. Fifteen years ago, he was an executive in a media agency. He suffered burnout, got signed off for a few months and decided he had to reset, so he trained as a chef. He cut his teeth on the tempura section at Aqua Kyoto before cooking in a few places, most recently at live-fire outfitFrom the Ashes.The first iteration of Mamapen happened in 2020 at a pub in Hackney. Now eight months into his new home, Pen has a young, diverse team he’s proud to lead and tables are full every night, often with people experiencing Cambodian food for the first time. Mamapen has been called London’s only Cambodian restaurant – Pen is unsure of that, but it’s certainly one of a scant handful in the UK.“Sometimes we do get the authenticity police turning up,” Pen says, with a shrug, a sigh, a small smile. People who have been to Cambodia on holidays come in and ask for amok – but, he says, that fish curry is a royal dish. “My mum and my auntie never cooked that for us.”The people who ask for amok need to sit down with Pen and learn about him, he says: “My story is as much being British as Cambodian.” He was born in Cambodia, but moved to the UK in 1980 to escape the war. Mama Pen had five kids in tow, and the ingredients she was used to were “non-existent” in Britain at the time. Cooking between two cultures, she did her best. “We grew up having soy sauce in bolognese, stuff like that.” She’s still Pen’s number-one inspiration: it’s her spring-roll filling that tops the pork toast. “We always get the best food at home,” Pen says, adding that though he’s proud to be one of the first, perhaps that’s why there hasn’t been such a need for Cambodian restaurants. “Our mums are the best.”Holly O’NeillMamapenFood and drinkSea Sisters: British conservas“Sea Sisters isn’t tinned fish. It’s Britishconservas,” Charlotte Dawe says, speaking from the craft cannery she founded in west Dorset with her partner, ex-Trullo chef Angus Cowan. Conservas – high-quality preserved fish – had sustained and inspired the pair while they travelled in a van through Spain. “We became obsessed with trying the different cans,” Cowan says, “and thought it’d be cool to be the first producers in England.”View image in fullscreenCara Lennon, Angus Cowen, Charlotte Dawe, and Honor Smith-Wright of Dorset’s Sea Sisters.Photograph: Harry Borden/The ObserverThe first Covid lockdown was an opportunity to experiment in their small kitchen in east London. “There were lots of Post-it notes, and fish hanging everywhere,” says Cowan. Sea Sisters, named for their two young daughters, was launched the following year from a micro-cannery in Hackney Wick, before their relocation to the south-west: “To be closer to the fisheries and shorten the supply chain,” says Dawe.Two years on, they are bastions of sustainability. “We have a massive responsibility to talk about local species and their seasonality,” she says. Cowan continues: “We only use ethically sourced fish, such as mussels, which clean the water and encourage biodiversity, and Cornish hake that have had the chance to reproduce.” Beyond offering a quality delicacy, their mission is to educate people about the British fishing industry. “Ninety per cent of British fish is exported,” says Dawe. “For us, success is someone enjoying a locally landed species for the first time and talking about it. It’s a small shake-up, but we’re hoping for a ripple effect.”Hayley MyersSea SistersMeera Sodha’s mushroom shawarmaView image in fullscreenMeera Sodha’s mushroom shawarma with sumac cucumbers.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The Guardian.

It’s simple: mix torn-up mushrooms and wedges of red onion with a paprika-spiked marinade. Bake, then serve with quick-pickled sumac cucumber, pitta, pickled chillies and – another swerve from tradition – vegan garlic mayo (the vegan part is optional). There are other versions of this dish, including one by Jamie Oliver, but Sodha’s is the shawarma I keep coming back to.Killian FoxMeera SodhaUrban wineries“There is no shortage of good wine,” Warwick Smith concedes. But by making his in – get this – Walthamstow, the Renegade Urban Winery founder sees an opportunity to educate and innovate.View image in fullscreenStacey Raath and Harry Appleyard of Northern Wine.Photograph: Sheenah Alcock/PRTypically marketed through a prism of vineyards, farming and terroir, Smith believes the detail of how wine is made is underappreciated. “My angle is to show why themakingmakes a difference,” he says, which includes inviting visitors to his winery and bar to explore its wine press, barrels and bottling-line apparatus.Renegade sources grapes from Britain and Europe, and gets creative with them. It has made a pinot noir by combining British, Italian and German grapes. It adds craft beer hops to its Bethnal Bubbles sparkling white. British wine is a blank slate, says Smith, so “let’s be innovators”.Across northern Europe, a small but growing band of urban wineries are working in various ways to produce distinctive wines in unexpected places: London’sBlackbookandLondon Cru;Chateau Amsterdam; Gothenburg’sWine Mechanics.Launched in 2022, Cumbria’s Northern Wine takes grapes from UK vineyards (saluting the logistics with a pinot noir called Roadworks on the M6) and creates limited-run wines so impressive they are served in Simon Rogan’s Michelin-starred restaurants.Northern’s approach is patient, fastidious and low-intervention. “Time is a great friend,” says co-owner Stacey Raath. Long lees-ageing allows English wines to develop real “textural, layered” complexity: “We stay steadfast until it’s ready.”Tony NaylorRenegade Urban WineryNorthern WineGod-tier fish and chipsFood is endlessly prey to fads and hype, and that makes a place like Drake’s in Knaresborough’s Silver Street all the more admirable. Restaurant manager Karen Rankine has worked at this fish and chip shop for almost 30 years, and its traditional methods endure. Fish is cooked to order in Yorkshire’s sacred beef dripping; batter is made each morning; mushy peas are steeped and cooked daily; tartare sauce is homemade. “It’s what we’ve always done,” says Rankine. The result is fish and chips of such vivid freshness and lip-smacking savoury depth that it really is a timeless classic.Tony NaylorDrake’sMauby: defying stereotypesA rich jerk chicken in a thick, spicy sauce, with perfectly crisp blackened skin.

Mauby draws influences from both, but defies national categorisation: it is a London restaurant. “It’s food we love to cook and eat with friends and family,” says Maynard. “When you’re passionate about food and enjoy cooking, you don’t need to conform to one set cuisine. We’ve been called a Caribbean restaurant, but we’re not strictly that. We’re trying to defy stereotypes.”The pair have run pop-ups in London since 2016, and transformed an old chippy into a warm, inviting room for their first restaurant. The menu is short, seasonal and affordable. “We try to offer a range, so that it can meet your budget,” says McCrindle. “It’s important for us that you enjoy every dish and feel welcomed in our space, whether that’s having the whole menu twice over, or a few cocktails and a couple of small plates in a nice setting.”ToméMorrissy-SwanMaubyJonah Schulz: makes beer, draws beerWhen brewer Jonah Schulz isn’t working his day job atThe Kernelin south London, he’s designing logos and labels for another terrific microbrewery –Newbarns in Leith, Edinburgh, launched by a pair of Kernel alumni in 2019. “They offhandedly asked me if I’d be interested in helping with their visual identity,” says Connecticut-born Schulz, who studied fine-art printmaking in New York, “and I very much was.”View image in fullscreenNewbarns Brewery cans by Jonah Schulz.Photograph: Michael Whitaker/The ObserverAs well as Newbarns’ logo, combining a barn roof with an ear of barley, he has created more than 90 designs for the company, mainly can labels. “For the most part they let me get on with it, which feels like a special relationship because some of it has frankly been quite odd.” Schulz points to a pale ale called I Have No Proof, for which he created an elaborate film noir-style poster featuring a detective and a crocodile. More often, his labels prioritise typography and strong blocks of colour, but they’re distinctive and beautifully conceived, standing out amid the riot of designs in your local craft beer shop.KillianFoxJonah SchulzGilda’s cinnamon morning bunsJon Warren is working out how many cinnamon buns leave the ovens at Gilda, his bakery near Bishopsbourne in Kent, each week. It’s normally between 250 and 300. “We can just never make enough,” he says. “We’d love to make more.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sonja Horsman/The ObserverThe pastries were created in partnership with a nearby hotel, The Pig at Bridge Place, who requested a local replacement for the breakfast bun they’d been trucking in from Dorset. A croissant dough made fromHinxden Farm Dairymilk, organicShipton Millflour and cultured butter fromthe Estate Dairyis layered with cinnamon, then plaited and cajoled into tall muffin moulds for height and a crisp casing. They’re rolled in cinnamon sugar after baking for added textural interest, but absolutely not drizzled with syrup, to keep them on the right side of sweet. “It’s the simplicity of it,” says Warren. “We’re keeping it quite natural and not messing around.”How good are they? Good enough for one couple to request them as their wedding cake next summer.Kate GuestGildaCaro’s Cook RiteView image in fullscreenMost of us think of all-purpose seasoning as the dried stuff found in supermarkets. But Caroline Bucchan is making a zingy fresh version from her kitchen in Forest Hill, south-east London. Born in St Vincent and the Grenadines, Bucchan came to London in the 1990s to work as a nanny, bringing her mother’s recipe with her. She set up Caro’s Cook Rite in 2023 and started selling her all-purpose green seasoning at local food markets. The range now includes an extra-hot version, blends for fish (with lemon zest), chicken (with rosemary) and lamb (with mint), plus limited editions for seasonal specialities. “My mother used her seasoning on absolutely everything,” Bucchan says, “and that’s what my customers do, too. They use it for meat rubs and on couscous, salads and stews.”Lindsey McWhinnieCaro’s Cook RiteChoc ice v ice-cream sandwichView image in fullscreenVagabond’s vegan choc ices and Happy Endings’ ice-cream sandwichesThere is a curious pleasure, no doubt rooted in nostalgia, to buying ice-cream not in a tub, a cone or on a stick but wrapped in greaseproof paper and sandwiched between two thin slabs of biscuit, usually containing chocolate. The London-based company Happy Endings, founded by Aussie chef Terri Mercieca, has been selling terrific ice-cream sandwiches for the best part of a decade; they are stocked at shops and restaurants all over the capital, and a few beyond. “They’re fun to make,” says Mercieca. “They involve about 15 more steps than just pouring ice-cream into a tub, but people respond really well to them.” Their bestseller, she says, is The Malty One, which is “like a Hobnob smashed up with a Malteser but more fancy”.Similarly packaged, but more like choc ices than sandwiches, are the supremely delicious plant-based creations of Lucy Masters, who trades as Vagabond. Her inspiration came from four years spent in Los Angeles. “Anything was possible, like lavender caramel … and vegan ice-cream wasn’t really demarcated in the same way.” Returning to south London, she found local offerings “so boring” that she decided to make her own, first from home and now from a workspace in Brockley.She makes plant-based ice-cream because her daughter can’t eat dairy, and she wants to make ice-cream available to everybody: “Not good for vegans, just good ice-cream.” Her peanut butter and pretzel is a highlight, though I particularly enjoyed one with cherries that took Masters a long time to perfect – she ended up boiling the cherries for hours, until they turned into a “rich and delicious” syrup.“I love choc ices,” she says. “You pick it up, it’s a really nice object, you unwrap it, you see the chocolate but you don’t know what’s inside. And then you bite it, which is really fun. You get the crack of the chocolate. You can eat it on the go and it’s just slightly joyful.”Killian FoxHappy EndingsVagabondModern Jew-ish foodA new wave of chefs are exploring their Jewish identities by experimenting with flavours and culinary influences, and highlighting the adaptive nature of diasporas themselves. Reinterpretations of secular Ashkenazi cuisine in particular have been building in the US, with chefs such asJeremy Umansky(Larder Delicatessen & Bakery),Jeremy Salamon(Agi’s) andKatianna Hong(Yangban) leading the way.In the UK, Ollie Gratter of Wilde’s Deliand Ruben Dawnay of Ruben’s Reubens aren’t just replicating the “New York-style” food. They’re drilling down into their Ashkenazi culinary and cultural heritage and marrying traditional flavours and cooking techniques with global cuisines, food trends and local influences, producing dishes such as barbacoa on challah, Polish/Chinese burnt leek dumplings and furikake smoked lox.“It was a bit about heritage, a bit about my name, and exploring the foods that were all around me,” says Dawnay, who has homed in on pickling, curing and smoking techniques. He has also been led by flavours, beginning with the first reuben sandwich he ever ate, at Monty’s Deli. “The first time eating caraway seeds, I thought: ‘This is the coolest thing ever. I don’t know if I love them or hate them but they’re definitely present.’”For Gratter, it’s about allowing space for reinterpretation: “Breaking traditions is an important part of progress. Traditional ways have their place, but adaptation is also inherent to Jewish food, like any other diaspora. I want to use recognisably Jewish ingredients in new ways.”Adrienne Katz KennedyRuben’s ReubensWilde’s DeliPlacesLittle Piece of BahiaDuring lockdown,Camila Vargasreceived a call from her mother in Brazil, who was receiving treatment for cancer and didn’t have long to live. Her mother told her it was time for Vargas to continue the family legacy of cooking food from their state – Bahia, in north-eastern Brazil.View image in fullscreenCamila Vargas at her Little Piece of Bahia stall in east London.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer“I didn’t know how to cook,” says Vargas, “but she said, ‘You’re my daughter, you’re black, it’s ancestral food. The food’s inside you, it will come out.’ And it did. I couldn’t believe the success.”Bahian cuisine has its roots in Africa. Dishes are cooked in dendê, an unrefined palm oil. The ingredients aren’t hard to find, says Vargas – African shops stock many of them, including palm oil and black-eyed peas.Vargas has sold her version of Bahian and wider Brazilian cuisine at markets in Manchester and London for three years, and now has a permanent site at Arndale Market in Manchester. Star dishes include acarajé, a black-eyed pea fritter filled with a creamy shrimp, coconut milk and nut paste and smoked prawns; and moqueca de camarão, a spicy seafood stew laden with rust-red palm oil. Homesick Bahians come from across Europe, says Vargas, while locals have fallen in love. “They are resistant to it, something they’ve never seen before. But when they try it, they go crazy.”ToméMorrissy-SwanLittle Piece of BahiaMara’s Picklery, EdinburghThanks to Mara’s Picklery, burping ferments and briny provisions have arrived in Marchmont, Edinburgh, close to the leafy Meadows. With its custard-coloured frontage amid a sea of stone tenements, it appears playful, but the flavours served up are serious: think venison bresaola with persimmon carpaccio and chai-pickled grapes. At the helm are Eilish Leyland-Jones and Pragnesh Patel, who met at a vineyard in New Zealand in 2017.View image in fullscreenMara’s Picklery, Edinbugh.Photograph: PRSince opening in March 2024, they’ve been busy. “Our pickle plates have been flying,” says Leyland-Jones, “but we’re not just a shop selling jars of pickles, and we’re not just about pickle plates.” They are fiercely seasonal, she says. “We do quick pickles in the summer, but in the colder months we’re big on sweet and sour caraway cabbage, and we’re pickling romanesco as we’ve got extra.”Mama Patel’s chai, based on a family recipe from Gujarat, is an instant warmer-upper. Their bestseller is a simple cheese toastie elevated by pickled chilli jam with apple, and a zingy ginger switchel is a good idea whatever Edinburgh’s weather. The pickles may change with the seasons, but the customers are already on repeat.Caroline EdenMara’s PickleryDestination ThessalonikiOn the north-western corner of the Aegean, Thessaloniki was one of the most important cities of the Byzantine Empire, and centuries of occupation, trade and refuge have resulted in a heavy dose of Turkish, Arabic, Jewish and Baltic influence in everything from the architecture to a food scene unlike any other in Greece.“Food combinations are more daring than in other parts of the country,” says Thessalonian chef Vasilis Chamam, who fuses the city’s historic traditions with global flavours and cooking techniques. (With a flurry of interest in contemporary Greek food in the UK, chefs like Chamam and Diamantis Kalogiannidis – ex Da Terra, now in residency atPasero– are helming pop-ups in London, showcasing what makes Thessalonian cuisine so special.) Chamam has witnessed the city “going through a modernisation of its cuisine, with lots of chefs cooking food that’s looking at the city’s past”. To “taste the city’s traditions”, he recommends making a reservation at neighbourhood restaurantIliopetra.While you’ll see all the taverna classics in Thessaloniki, expect to see heartier food, much as you would in the north of Italy. Claypot cooking is a strength: meats simmered low and slow, the rich sauces finished with pasta such as hilopites or orzo. Spices are used in a way not seen elsewhere in the country: unusually, ginger is prevalent, especially in drinks, in hot salepi (made from orchid root) and lemonade from street carts; while tomato-based dishes might be laced with chilli, allspice and other aromatics.Frappe was invented in Thessaloniki, but the presence of Greece’s largest university means that as well as old-school kafeneons, there are plenty of hip coffee shops and bars within the 4th-century walls. And those with a sweet tooth should note that Thessaloniki is known for its bakeries. There’s trigona, a filo triangle filled with a thick sweet cream, and it’s thought that bougatsa, Greece’s famous pie, originated in the city.Bougatsa Giannisis one of the most popular bakers in town, with a super social scene of people sitting outside, chatting over the classic sweet custard pies, as well as less common savoury versions filled with slow-cooked meat or cheese. It doesn’t open until 8pm and goes through till 3pm – which tells you everything you need to know about this exciting, 24-hour food-obsessed city.Georgina HaydenVasilis ChamamBizarre restaurant names“It still astounds me that’s the name we went with,” says Alex Claridge of his Birmingham restaurant, Albatross Death Cult.Opening a second restaurant was, says Claridge, “financially, emotionally, creatively,an albatross around my neck” – hence thatRime of the Ancient Mariner-inspired moniker. The name generated publicity, but was primarily intended to attract inquisitive diners – people with “a sense of humour” who would “embrace the slightly avant garde” and dig the restaurant’shighly creative seafood tasting menu.View image in fullscreenDon’t Tell Dad restaurant.For such a creative industry, few restaurants boast interesting names. The current trend is prosaic: Café This, or Something Canteen. Briefly, Claridge toyed with calling his counter-dining restaurant Counter.Happily, like York’s Brancusi (Romanian sculptor), London’sSesta(a medieval wine vessel), the playfulDon’t Tell Dador the taqueria Homies On Donkeys, its name acolourful homageto the owners’ Tijuana roots, Claridge took a more entertaining route. As did chef Simon Bonwick, currently cooking upstairs at the Oarsman pub in Marlow under the nameTroublesome Lodger.Goodbye Horses is both an epic slice of 1980s synth-pop by Q Lazzarus and a London wine bar. The title was chosen, says co-founder Alex Young, for its “nostalgic, somehow warm” aura: “The way those words feel is the feeling we’re trying to create in the restaurant.”It is also “fun and mysterious” in not explaining what Goodbye Horsesdoes. Intrigue is attractive, agrees chef Josh Overington. The name of his Yorkshire restaurant,Mýse(old English, to eat at a table), is opaque until you dine there and see how its dishes draw on historical English recipes.Restaurants needn’t be “an open book”, says Overington. “I quite like not knowing what I’m getting into.”Tony NaylorAlbatross Death CultGoodbye HorsesChez Bruce: 30 years of stealth influence“Chefs feel the need to perform, to do something different,” says Matt Christmas. That pressure, explains Chez Bruce’s head chef, is why chefs might use bananas in a tarte tatin: “Think of all the fruit you’ve dismissed to arrive at banana. What are you doing? If you don’t need to, don’t piss about with it.”That guiding principle has, in the three decades since Chez Bruce opened, established the south London restaurant as a touchstone in British hospitality. Of course, it has evolved. Its food is less overtly French these days. It serves a miso-glazed aubergine starter. ButOFM readers who, in 2006, voted it their favourite restaurant, could still eat a three-course dinner of soup, chauteaubriand and creme brulee from its Michelin-starred menu. Consistency, says Christmas, is “a big draw”.View image in fullscreenBruce Poole, of Chez Bruce, photographed for Observer Food Monthly, March 2006.Photograph: John ReardonChristmas, head chef since 2005, and co-owner and chef Bruce Poole insist on traditional cooking methods (stocks are made from scratch, breads baked in-house), and on big, bold flavours that interact with confidence. No daft garnishes. No fussy over-elaboration. “I hate meek cooking,” says Christmas.Over the decades, numerous chefs have absorbed the Chez Bruce method. Joe Mercer-Nairne, chef and co-owner at London’sMedlar, loves their skilled process: “It’s hot pans. You cook. It’s old fashioned, quite labour intensive. But you get a better product.” Chef-restaurateur Gary Usher, founder ofElite Bistros, learned many crucial lessons in Bruce’s famous kitchen opposite Wandsworth Common. For example, highlight one primary flavour in soups and purees: “Parsley soup needs to taste of parsley. Seasononlyto enhance that flavour.”At times, Chez Bruce’s rigour and simplicity has looked anachronistic. But, in 2025, artisan skills and French brasserie cooking areen vogueagain. Christmas laughs: “We’re almost back in fashion.”Tony NaylorChez BruceLe Doyenné, Saint-Vrain, outside ParisThere’s been a trend in recent years for talented French chefs to escape the big city and set up restaurants with rooms and a plot of land where they grow their own veg and raise livestock. One outstanding example is Le Doyenné in Saint-Vrain, an hour’s drive south of Paris. In 2017, Australian chefs James Henry and Shaun Kelly (who worked together atAu Passage) took over a “complete ruin” of a mansion and spent five years turning it into the restaurant-guesthouse of their dreams.View image in fullscreenChefs Shaun Kelly and James Henry in Le Doyenné’s vegetable garden.Photograph: Evan SungFirst, they revived the orchard and one-hectare vegetable garden, then they created a dining room in the stables formerly used by the artist Niki de Saint Phalle. They opened in June 2022 and have attracted a devoted following for their inventive, hyper-seasonal menu – a highlight from my visit was a spectacular board of crudités with charcuterie from their own pigs. The location sets the project apart: “We’re fortunate to have found these ideal conditions so close to Paris,” Henry says. “From the moment you enter, you feel like you’re transported. The city falls away, even though you’re really on the doorstep.”Killian FoxLe DoyennéTake a bite out of the ’burbs“We have way more space than we could afford in town,” enthuses Jo Myers – who, with chef husband Stu, is poised to open the Swine Bistro in suburban Headingley, having previously run the Swine That Dines in Leeds city centre.Historically, high-quality restaurants wanted, if not needed, to be in city centres, for the footfall and visibility. Myers’s migration is – like Jöro’s relocation from central Sheffield to Oughtibridge, orPilgrim’s imminent relaunch in Liverpool suburb, Allerton – indicative of a new confidence that good food can thrive in the hinterlands.Anecdotally, the pandemic repopularised “staying local” – relaxed socialising in neighbourhood clusters of bars, bakeries and restaurants, without the hassle of going into a city centre. The trend was already visible in foodie hubs such as Altrincham, Pontcanna in Cardiff and Bishopthorpe Road in York, and as demand grows in affluent or fashionable suburbs, restaurants are meeting it.Sometimes that move is a personal choice. “We wanted to integrate into a community,” says chef Sandy Jarvis, co-founder of Bavette, in Horsforth, a northern suburb of Leeds. TheGood Food Guidenamed it2024’s best local restaurant, but its location has not stopped it attracting diners from the wider area. Indeed, Bavette is in such demand it retains two tables (only bookable directly, by regulars), to help maintain its neighbourhood feel.Technology helps. Social media allows restaurants to advertise their presence anywhere; and, says Myers, thinking of her own city breaks, exploring Britain’s suburbs is easy now, “with Google Maps telling you which bus to take, or Uber”. Foodies will hunt out good food, wherever it is.Tony NaylorThe Swine BistroBavetteGeo-Cafe, CavershamProspect Street, in Caversham, Reading, was a culinary wilderness when I was growing up nearby in the 1990s. Today, it is a pocket-sized but perfect go-to dining destination.Clay’s Kitchen & Bar, raved aboutby Grace Dent, is famous for its outstanding Hyderabadi-style dum biryani and chepala pulusu (monkfish curry), but it is the Geo-Cafe a few doors down, run by Georgia-born Keti Maglakelidze and her family, that has my heart. Maglakelidze is certain that locals stay loyal to her “because of the strong and friendly sense of community” that the cafe fosters – and because “people appreciate that we are the actual makers of most things we offer”.On the menu, the chicken and adjika (salty spice paste) wrap served with homemade tkemali plum sauce or walnutty, garlicky bazhe sauce sells best, Maglakelidze says, closely followed by the aubergine wrap, which is based on the classic Georgian mezze dish badrijani nigvzit, aubergine rolls stuffed with walnut paste.Caroline EdenGeo-CafeMediaA book of cult sandwichesView image in fullscreenAn illustration by Dave Bain fromCult Sandwiches.The high-end sandwich boom showsno sign of abating, but, as food writer David Paw makes clear in the introduction to his new bookCult Sandwiches, for the recipes that pass the test of time we must look past the latest clout-chasing viral sensation. His compendium of 100 all-time classic sandwiches from across the globe is an attempt to do just that. It is a beautifully designed tome featuring everything from seafood po’ boys (New Orleans) to mie goreng toasties (Sydney) to balik ekmek (Turkey). Paw acknowledges that his list, though carefully compiled, barely scratches the surface – and that even the definition of “sandwich” is up for grabs (is a burger a sandwich? And if not, why not?). Nonetheless, it’s a loving and energetic culinary world tour, celebrating a cult that’s only gaining followers.Max OleskerCult SandwichesThe Evin Prison Bakers’ ClubIranian activist Sepideh Gholian was arrested during a peaceful workers’ rights protest in 2018, aged 24, and has spent most of the past six and a half years in jail. First, she wrote and – with the help of journalist Maziar Bahari – published a prison diary. Now, by the same route, she has created the extraordinary, genre-defying book,The Evin Prison Bakers’ Club – Surviving Iran’s Most Notorious Prisons in 16 Recipes(published in the UK in April), which combines stories of life inside Iran’s brutal carceral system with baking recipes.The recipes – tres leches cake, finger-twist halva, date crumble – are integral to Gholian’s story. For her, and the women she befriended in custody, baking is a refuge from the horrors of prison and a way to remember those who died of neglect or were murdered by the authorities. The book is proof of Gholian’s triumphant resistance against a regime that wants her silenced, and a powerful message of hope for the future.Killian FoxThe Evin Prison Bakers’ ClubThe Ómós DigestView image in fullscreenChef Cúán Greene.Photograph: Ellius GraceEvery week for the past four years, the gifted young Irish chef Cúán Greene has been writing thoughtfully and honestly about the highs and lows of cooking for a living. One recent dispatch of his newsletter,Ómós Digest– Ómós isalso the name of his forthcoming restaurant, guesthouse and four-acre farm in County Laois – dealt with the impact of kitchen bullying; another considered the stigma of taking a career break, which Greene himself has been doing since leaving Dublin’s Bastible in 2020 (prior to that, he worked at Noma).The newsletter, which has more than 4,000 subscribers, also charts his culinary travels, celebrates Irish producers and invites fellow food experts to contribute guest posts. It’s rare to find a chef who can write with Greene’s acuity, and he tells me the newsletter will live on after his new venture – with sky-high ambitions, backed by Stripe co-founder John Collison – finally opens in June 2026.Killian FoxÓmós DigestExplore more on these topicsThe ObserverFoodFood and drinkFood and drink booksChefsRestaurantsShareReuse this content"

Small plates £7-£19, large plates £9-£42, desserts £9, wines from £38A Monday lunchtime, and my phone pings. There’s a text. “Gilgamesh London. It’s our Birthday! ONE milestone gift to you,” it says, with a dizzyingly random use of capital letters. “50% OFF A la Carte Menu. Online bookings.” Which is all very nice. Except I’m already booked to go to Gilgamesh. The next day I’m served up a trio of their ads across this paper’s homepage online, offering “3 courses for £20”. It could be described as pathologically needy were that not an insult to needy people.Gilgamesh is the rebirth of a bonkers restaurant which opened in 2006 inside The Stables at London’s Camden Market at a cost well north of £12m. It could seat 570 people and had a hilariously garish interior of sculptures and gold-effect reliefs telling the story of the Babylonian King Gilgamesh. As both god and man, he smote people, built mighty walls and generally made the weather across what is now the Middle East. Therefore, the food was pan-Asian. Well, of course it was: creaky stabs at sushi, dim sum, Thai curries and the rest. It was eventually taken over by Richard Caring of the Ivy group, before closing in 2018.View image in fullscreen‘Tastes of very little including either lemongrass or chicken’: lemongrass chicken.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverA year ago it reopened on a site at the top of St Martin’s Lane which used to be Marcus Wareing’s Tredwells. So why my interest? I’m a completist, my time on this column is coming to an end and I simply needed to know: would Gilgamesh Mk II make any more sense than the original? As ever, it depends on your terms of reference. Despite the desperate come-hither ads and texts, they appear to be doing fine. On a midweek night, the place is rammed. They have a private party upstairs, so there’s no room in the cloakroom for my bag “because we have, like, 50 backpacks there already.” You can hear that crowd honking and hooting at each other at maximum volume over the mezzanine balcony into the vault at the front of the restaurant, where high mounted outdoor heaters have been fitted to fend off a chill. We are seated beneath their glow, before being moved so that we don’t slowly grill.View image in fullscreen‘A sloppy blight upon the dish’s very name’: beef rendang.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe now have a lovely view of the same ludicrous gold-effect interior which, we are told, is the original from Camden. Given the cracks, ragged joins and bubbled marquetry on the tables that’s believable. There’s plastic foliage including a bay tree, which looks as knackered as I’m already feeling, and a thumping bass line that makes the very air tremble. But look, we’re here for what the website calls “a culinary journey inspired by the ancient epic of Gilgamesh, where East meets West”. Apparently “every sip and bite takes you further into the epic tale woven within our restaurant – a sensory experience that transcends time and cultural boundaries.” Which is nice. That immense journey starts with the sort of prawn crackers delivered in a white plastic bag with a cheap Chinese takeaway. They are accompanied by a salsa made with the flesh of pale pink tomatoes which taste of almost nothing.View image in fullscreen‘A disaster’: crispy duck and watermelon salad.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThe best dish of the night is the £16 popcorn shrimp served in a stainless-steel pot the shape of a large martini glass. They are hot and crisp, though when we ask where the advertised spicy chipotle mayo is, we’re told airily that it’s been mixed in. From the sushi list we are mistakenly brought a Gilgamesh dragon roll. It’s coated in a thin, slimy layer of wagyu beef, which has the texture of something you might use to salve a burn. When they deliver the actual dragon roll we asked for, made with barbecued eel and avocado, it’s solid enough. Meanwhile, a crispy duck and watermelon salad, with a handful of cashews expertly removed from their bag and chucked on to the plate, is a disaster. The duck and melon are both excruciatingly sugary. The combination can work, but only if there’s a sharply dressed leaf salad as counterbalance. Otherwise, it’s just a weird trip to the sweetie shop.View image in fullscreen‘Solid enough’: dragon roll.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverThere is then a long wait for the main courses, but they were always bound to turn up, weren’t they? The least offensive for simply being dull is the grilled, cotton-wool thump of the lemongrass chicken, which tastes of very little including either lemongrass or chicken. Then there’s the beef rendang, which should be cooked long and slow until the reduced gravy has a profound warmth, depth and toastiness to it. This one is a sloppy blight upon the dish’s very name. It’s astringent and harsh, as if it were pressure-cooked for 30 minutes and left at that. The roti are greasy and flaccid as, by now, am I.View image in fullscreen‘The best dish of the night’: popcorn shrimp.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe’ve also ordered cauliflower and asparagus fried rice. It smells like it’s been made with the leftover cauliflower that comes alongside a cheap pub Sunday roast; the stuff overcooked yesterday, so that it can be eaten today without recourse to teeth. Of course, asparagus is grossly out of season but if it’s in the dish description, it should be there. It isn’t. It’s just 50% massacred cauliflower. I point this out to our brilliant waiter, who is dealing with the noise and the chaos and a kitchen which doesn’t always send the right order, with grace and dignity. He offers to replace it and though we decline, brings it anyway, but by this point we’re done.View image in fullscreen‘It smells like it’s been made with leftover cauliflower trom a cheap pub Sunday roast’: cauliflower and asparagus rice.Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverWe’ve tried to take the edge off with a £38 bottle of Spanish Sauvignon Blanc headache wine, the cheapest on the list. It hasn’t done the job. Perhaps we should have ordered the Don Julio 1942 tequila at £950 (available online for £146). This evening my cultural boundaries have not so much been transcended as wildly violated. I have indeed had a sensory experience, just not quite the one they intended. Of course, I’ve made a category error here, just as I did 18 years ago. I came to a restaurant thinking the food mattered. But apparently it doesn’t, not even when the bill comes to £175 (I’m told the discount in the text applies only between certain hours). A lot of restaurants are stage sets, Gilgamesh it seems more than most. It’s a space in which to play at having a certain kind of watermelon martini-fuelled night, which is not my thing. We retreat to Anita, the ice-cream parlour next door, for tubs of mixed berry pavlova and chocolate sorbet, which are my thing. It doesn’t transcend any cultural boundaries. It isn’t epic. But it really does make things a little better.News bitesGordon Ramsay’s restaurant group is taking over the site of what was Le Gavroche, which was closed in early 2024 after 56 years by Michel Roux, son of the late co-founder Albert Roux. According to industry magazinerestaurantonline.co.uk, Ramsay’s company has successfully applied to take over the premises licence, with the supervisor named as Silvano Giraldin, the legendary maître d’ who ran front-of-house at Le Gavroche for 30 years. The new restaurant will be a platform for Matt Abé, who has been chef-patron at Restaurant Gordon Ramsay on Royal Hospital Road in London’s Chelsea since 2020. Ramsay was a junior member of the brigade at Le Gavroche under Albert Roux in the late 80s.Ayesha Kalaji, chef-patron of the highly regarded Queen of Cups in Glastonbury, is bringing a menu of her key dishes to the Intercontinental London Park Lane for Iftar, the meal with which Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. The half Welsh-half Jordanian Kalaji, who trained at Leith’s School of Food and Wine, has put together an a la carte menu that includes braised pressed hogget with Persian lime and lavender, Queen of Cups laverbread falafel, and a rice pudding flavoured with rose water and saffron. It will be available for a month from 29 February. Bookhere.Bath BID, the business improvement group for the city, has announced the first ever Bath Restaurant Week, which will run from 3 to 11 May. Hospitality businesses in the city will be encouraged to run special menus and dishes spotlighting their offering, which will be promoted by Bath BID.

It’s a tale that begins in the hillside vines of Domaine Belluard in the village of Ayse in the Haute-Savoie region of the French Alps, where Domaine Belema’s Yann Pernuit, originally from Normandy, learned his trade as a vigneron alongside his friend and mentor, Dominique Belluard. A believer in biodynamic viticulture and the immense potential of the extremely rare local white grape gringet, Belluard’s refined and evocative wines had become cult favourites in the global sommelier community by the time of his tragic death, by suicide, in 2021. Imago is Pernuit’s tribute to the memory of the much-missed Belluard, a pristine representation of the gringet variety that meant so much to Belluard and which Pernuit is committed to preserving, and a wine in which a swell of fresh apple combines with graceful surging mineral acidity.Domaine Dupraz En Route Pour L’Apero, Apremeont, Savoie, France 2023 (from £19.50,gnarlyvines.co.uk;lescaves.co.uk;highburylibrary.co.uk)Pernuit was very far from being the only winemaker moved by the death of Belluard. Indeed, some of the biggest names in natural wine (including Jean-Claude Lapalu from Beaujolais, Théo Dancer in Burgundy, and Franck Balthazar in the Rhône) made a series of tribute bottles in their own styles from grapes sent to them by the Belluard family harvested in the vintage after he died. Those fascinating (and very hard to find) wines, each of which show a subtly different side to gringet, were among various fine Savoyard wines on show at a tasting hosted by UK importer Les Caves de Pyrene earlier this month. Other highlights at the tasting included the wines made from Belluard’s vines – in a beguilingly bright but resonant style not dissimilar to “the master of ginget” – by a young winemaker, Vincent Ruiz, at Domaine du Gringet; and Domaine Dupraz’s effortlessly pear-scented, Alpine stream-racy En Route Pour L’Apero dry white, made from another local hero Savoie variety, jacquère.GraceWineKayagatake Koshu, Yamanashi, Japan 2023 (£30.99, Selfridges)Tasting through Les Caves’ range of Savoie whites, the words that kept cropping up in my notes were “graceful” and “subtle”. These are vinous virtues that don’t always get a fair hearing (or tasting): served alongside bigger, more loudly fruity or aromatic wines, the more understated but no less complex and rewarding qualities can be overwhelmed and come across as insipid. But just as there are times when I’d rather be soothed and slowly charmed by a solo piano rather than energised by the immediate obvious sensual thrill of a rock or jazz band, so the quiet wines are often the most stimulating and pleasurable – not to mention being the best accompaniment to quieter, more subtle food, such as silken tofu or sushi. Such thoughts were also at the forefront as I tasted a range of wines made from the discreetly charming Japanese grape koshu by Grace Winery, 100km west of Tokyo in Yamanashi recently. Wines such as the Kayagatake have a sinuous, serenely insistent quality that is, like the best jacquère and gringet, quietly beautiful.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Once you’ve added the batter, don’t be tempted to open the oven door for at least 20 minutes, as this will help things rise as they should.Serves 2butternut or crown prince squash1 medium (or part of one), about 800g-1kgsunflower oil2 tbspfennel seeds2 tsp, lightly bashedchilli flakesa good pinchsalt and freshly ground black pepperfirm dessert apples2, such as cox or russetblack pudding380gthyme1 small bunch, leaves strippedrosemary2 sprigssage10-12 leavesFor the batterplain flour140geggs4, lightly beatenwhole milk200mlsea salt and freshly ground black pepperPreheat the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6.First, make the batter. Tip the flour into a bowl and whisk in the eggs until everything is nice and smooth. Gradually add the milk, whisking continuously until you are certain there are no lumps. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.Carefully peel the squash, as the skin can be quite thick and cumbersome to remove. Cut the peeled squash in half (if you’re using a whole one) and scoop out the seeds. Cut the flesh into chunky cubes about 2½-5cm. Scatter the squash out over a roasting tin about 30cm x 25cm. Trickle over the olive oil, sprinkle over the fennel seeds and chilli flakes, and season with salt and pepper. Tumble everything together. Roast the squash for 25-35 minutes, or until it has taken on a little colour and is pretty much tender.Meanwhile, quarter and core the apples, then cut each quarter in two, giving 16 wedges altogether. Peel and cut the black pudding into bite-sized chunks.Take the squash out of the oven and add the apples, black pudding, rosemary and sage. Turn it all together, turn up the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7 and return the tray to the centre of the oven for another 8-10 minutes.Carefully remove the tray from the oven, and working quickly, turn the squash, apples and black pudding once more, using a fork to tease some of the ingredients apart, should they need it. Pour in the batter then set the tin straight back in the oven. Cook for 25-30 minutes, until the batter is puffed up and golden. Serve at once.Baked brill with leeks, lemon and thymeView image in fullscreenBaked brill with leeks, lemon and thyme. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverBrill is such a magnificent fish and, like all fish, it’s a serious treat. So when you cook it, keeping things simple pays off. This recipe showcases brill’s lovely meaty texture alongside the silky delicate texture of braised leeks, while lemon and thyme do their thing in the background.It’s delicious served alongside a celeriac or potato mash, or simply with good crusty bread for mopping up all the buttery juices.Serves 4leeks6 mediumunsalted butter25gvegetable stock200mlbay leaves2, fresh if you can get themunwaxed lemonzest of 1thyme8-10 sprigsflaky sea salt and freshly ground black pepperbrill fillet4 x 200g piecesolive oil2 tbsp of your bestPreheat the oven to 190C fan/gas mark 6-6½.Trim the leeks but leave them whole, then wash them as best you can by letting cold water run down into their tops and giving them a good old shake. If there is any earth or grit in there, you want to try to get it out. Now cut each leek in half.Arrange the leeks in a suitably sized roasting tin and dot over the butter. Add the vegetable stock, bay leaves, lemon zest and thyme sprigs, and season well with salt and pepper. Use a large sheet of kitchen foil to cover the leeks, making sure you crimp the edges well to seal in all the steam. Pop the dish in the oven and bake the leeks for 35-40 minutes, until they are nice and tender.Season the brill with salt and pepper and lay the pieces down on top of the leeks.Cover the leeks and fish with the foil and return to the oven for a further 10-12 minutes. The exact cooking time will depend on how thick the pieces of fish are. To check, insert the tip of a knife into the fish – the flakes should part with ease and appear nice and glossy.When you’re happy that the fish is cooked just right, squeeze over the lemon juice and trickle over the olive oil. Bring the whole dish to the table and tuck in.Salt cod dauphinoiseView image in fullscreenSalt cod dauphinoise. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverSalt cod has a unique flavour. It’s incredibly savoury and adds a lot of depth and character (in the same way salted anchovies do) to what is a fairly classic dauphinoise recipe. Sometimes I replace half the potatoes with thinly sliced celeriac and pep things up with a generous pinch of dried chilli flakes. Either way, this is a delicious all-in-one pan supper, and just the thing for a cold winter’s night. You’ll need to start this recipe two days ahead.Serves 4-6salt cod250g, sustainably sourcedpotatoes1kg, white floury, such as desiree or maris piperonion1 medium, thinly slicedgarlic4 cloves, peeled and thinly slicedmarjoram2 tbsp, choppedrosemary1 sprig, leaves stripped and choppedsea salt and freshly ground black pepperwhole milk200mldouble cream300mlI like to give the salt fish plenty of time to soak. So, 48 hours before you intend to make the recipe, take the salt cod, place it in a large bowl and cover with plenty of fresh cold water. Pop it in the fridge and leave the fish to soak, changing the water a couple of times during this period. After 48 hours it should be ready to use.Preheat the oven to 160C fan/gas mark 4.Cut the fish into thin 1-2cm pieces, trimming away any skin and little bones you might come across.Peel and slice the potatoes thinly into 2-3mm rounds and give them a rinse in plenty of cold water. Drain the potatoes and place the slices in a large bowl with the sliced onions, slivered garlic, marjoram and rosemary, and plenty of black pepper (it may not need salt as the fish will bring this to the mix). Pour over the milk and cream and give everything a really good mix.Arrange a nice neat layer of overlapping potatoes and onions in the bottom of an ovenproof dish, about 20-25cm square and 5cm deep. Scatter over some of the sliced fish, then make a second layer of overlapping potatoes and onions. Continue until you have used up the fish, finishing with a layer of potato on top. Pour over all the remaining herby cream from the bowl and let it trickle down through the layers.Place the dish in the middle of the hot oven (you can place it on a baking tray to avoid cream bubbling on to the oven floor) and bake for 1-1½ hours, pressing the potatoes down firmly once or twice during cooking using a spatula, until the potatoes are tender, the top layer is golden and the sauce is bubbling. If the top is looking like it’s getting too dark at any point, lay a piece of parchment or foil over the top.Remove the dish from the oven and allow it time to settle. It will be much better, and still nice and hot, after 20 minutes of sitting.Lamb chops with chickpeas, apricots and saffronView image in fullscreenLamb chops with chickpeas, apricots and saffron. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverThere’s so much flavour to be found in good lamb chops, but it’s worth looking for nice thick ones, with a touch of fat on them, as they’ll be even better. If you’re not a big fan of saffron, you can leave it out, or replace it with 1-2 teaspoons of cracked, toasted coriander seeds.In the autumn, I like to do something very similar with pork chops. I swap the chickpeas for butter beans and the chewy apricots for rich, dark prunes. Everything else stays more or less the same.Serves 4chickpeas1 x 700g jar (I like Bold Bean Co)red onions1 medium or 2 smaller, peeled, halved and slicedgarlic4 cloves, thinly slicedchilli flakes½ tspdried apricots175g, unsulphuredsaffron1 pinchcider vinegar½ tbsprosemary2 sprigs, leaves torn from the stemssmoked paprika½ tspolive oil3 tbspsea salt and freshly ground black pepperlamb chops8Preheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7.Drain the chickpeas and place them in a large mixing bowl with the sliced onions, garlic, chilli, apricots, saffron, vinegar, rosemary, smoked paprika and 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season well with salt and pepper, then tumble everything together to combine.Scatter the chickpeas, onions and apricots across a large roasting tray measuring about 35cm x 25cm.Give the tray a little shake to even everything out then pop it into the middle of the hot oven for 15 minutes to roast.Meanwhile, take the lamb chops out of the fridge and arrange them over a plate or board. Drizzle them with the remaining olive oil and then season generously with sea salt and black pepper. Massage the seasoning and oil into the chops.Carefully remove the tray from the oven and, using a spatula, turn the onions and chickpeas several times. Arrange the lamb chops in a single layer over the top and return the tray to the oven.Roast the chops for 10 minutes then open the oven, turn the lamb chops over and give them another 8-10 minutes. Ideally the lamb chops should begin to crisp slightly round their edges and remain a little pink within.When the chops are ready, remove the tray from the oven and cover loosely with foil or parchment. Let everything rest for 6-8 minutes before bringing to the table.One-pan buttery chicken curryView image in fullscreenOne-pan buttery chicken curry. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-Wilson.Photograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverI prefer buying a whole chicken for this recipe and portioning it up myself. It’s easy to do at home, or a friendly butcher should do this for you. Each breast gets halved, and the legs get split into the drumsticks and thighs. The wings can go into the curry just as they are, or you can freeze them for another day. Alternatively, chicken thighs alone will be excellent too. And if you’re keen on game, this recipe works superbly with pheasant as well.Serves 4cardamom pods6cumin seeds½ tbspcoriander seeds½ tbspcinnamon stick2-3cmfennel seeds2 tspfenugreek seeds2 tspblack peppercorns2 tspfree-range or organic chicken1, jointed into 8 pieces, or 8 good-sized chicken thighsbutter50g, meltedturmeric1 tspgaram masala2 tspblack onion seeds2 tspsea saltonions2, finely dicedgarlic4 cloves, thinly slicedginger1 thumb-sized piece, peeled and very thinly slicedmedium-hot chillies2, dried or freshbay leaves4curry leaves8-10hot chicken or vegetable stock600mlPreheat the oven to 200C fan/gas mark 7.Take a large, heavy roasting tray or ovenproof dish. Scatter in the cardamom pods, cumin and coriander seeds, cinnamon stick, fennel seeds, fenugreek seeds and peppercorns and pop the dish in the oven. Toast the spices for about 5 minutes.Tip the toasted spices into a pestle and mortar or spice mill and grind to a relatively fine texture. You can discard the papery cardamom husk if you like.Place the chicken pieces into a mixing bowl. Pour over the melted butter and scatter over the warm, ground spices. Sprinkle in the turmeric, garam masala, black onion seeds and sea salt then tumble the chicken through the spices and butter to coat.Tip the spiced chicken portions (and all the buttery spices) out into the roasting tin. I like to organise the chicken pieces so they’re all skin side up, and make sure there aren’t too many spices sticking to the skin itself, or they could burn.Pop the tray back into the middle of the hot oven and bake for 18-20 minutes or until the chicken is lovely and golden.Now add the diced onions to the roasting tray, along with the sliced garlic, ginger, chillies, bay leaves and curry leaves. Use tongs to stir the onions into the chicken juices and rearrange the chicken so it’s sitting over the onions.Turn down the oven to 180C fan/gas mark 6. Pour in the stock or water and give the dish a gentle shake to settle everything down. Pop the tray into the oven and cook uncovered for 45-50 minutes, basting the chicken with the buttery juice once or twice.Carefully take the tray out of the oven and taste the sauce. It may need a touch of salt. You can either transfer the chicken to a large serving platter and spoon round the onions and sauce or simply bring the whole tray to the table, just the way it is.Serve with rice and naan bread for mopping up the sauce.Orange, coriander seed and honey polenta cakeView image in fullscreenOrange, coriander seed and honey polenta cake. Food and prop styling: Polly Webb-WilsonPhotograph: Romas Foord/The ObserverHere’s a trio I never seem to tire of: orange, honey and coriander seed. They were made for each other. You may not have thought of using coriander seed in a cake, but it’s something I’ve done many times before. On this occasion I thought I’d make a gluten-free version, using ground almonds and polenta instead of spelt flour.The polenta gives the cake a really interesting texture and the ground almonds keep it nice and moist.Serves 6-9unsalted butter200g, softenedcaster sugar225gcoriander seeds1 tbsp, toasted and coarsely crushedorange1 large, finely zested and juicedeggs3 largeground almonds225gfine polenta125gbaking powder1 tspsea salta good pinchrunny honey75gPreheat the oven to 150C fan/gas mark 3½. Grease and line a 23cm tray or springform cake tin (I used a square one, but a round one will be fine too).Beat the soft butter, caster sugar, half the crushed coriander and the orange zest and juice together until pale and light. You can do this by hand, but it’s somewhat easier in a stand mixer or with an electric whisk.Beat in the eggs one at a time. If the mixture begins to split, add a spoonful of ground almonds before you work in the next egg. Once the eggs are in continue to mix for 2-3 minutes.Combine the ground almonds with the fine polenta, baking powder and salt, and fold this mixture into the creamed butter and sugar nice and gently.Spoon the batter into the prepared tin and level it off roughly. Scatter over the remaining crushed coriander seeds and bake in the preheated oven for 45-50 minutes or until it is set.While the cake is still hot, prick its surface here and there with a toothpick or similar, then trickle over the runny honey. Let it soak into the cake as it cools.This cake will keep for several days in a tin.Gill Meller is a chef and food writer.

Fat bunches of true spinach so fresh they stood up by themselves, their leaves as sharp as a Stone Age arrow, tied up with rubber bands. The sort of crisp-stemmed spinach that would laugh in the face of those flabby, round-ended leaves incarcerated in cellophane at the supermarket. I bought four bunches.It was a sausage-and-beans kind of night. Fat sausages from a traditional butcher, coarse-textured and freckled with thyme and black pepper.I cooked them slowly, turning them over and over as their tight skins burnished in the pan. The beans were cannellini from a tin, simmered with chicken stock, tarragon leaves and garlic, the ivory sauce marbled green with the spinach.Greens aside, the majority of the best seasonal vegetables are still those grown underground. This week was the turn of Jerusalem artichokes, only the second time I have cooked them this winter. They pair well with small potatoes and this I did in a cheese-crowned gratin, the sauce enriched with stock and cider. The leftovers heated up well, too, and we ate them as a side dish with grilled chicken. I’m thinking now that I could have used the spinach in the gratin as well, some of the blanched leaves tucked in among the creamy white tubers.Sausages with spinach and cannellini beansUse whatever spinach you can get hold of. The young heart-shaped leaves need very little cooking. Small and tender, they are really meant for salad, but sometimes that is the only sort available. A minute or two, still wet from washing and in a saucepan with a tight-fitting lid, will steam them in no time. The larger-leaved true spinach will take a minute or two longer and you may have to trim the stems. I like to lift the cooked leaves from the pan with a sieve and plunge them immediately and briefly into iced water. The cold stops them cooking and sets the colour to a luminous green.Serves 3spinach leaves250gsausageslarge, 6groundnut or vegetable oil3 tbspFor the beans:garlic3 clovesolive oil2 tbspcannellini beans2 x 400g canschicken stock250mltarragon leaves2 tbsp, choppeddouble cream150mlparsleya handful, choppedlemon1buttera thin slice (optional)Wash the spinach leaves and discard any thick stems. Put the leaves, still dripping wet, in a deep pan covered by a tight lid, over a moderate heat. Let them steam for 3 or 4 minutes, then turn the leaves over with kitchen tongs and steam for a further minute until they are collapsed and bright green. Remove from the heat and rinse the spinach briefly in ice-cold water, squeeze firmly to remove any water, then roughly chop and leave to cool.Cook the sausages: put a large frying pan over a moderate heat. Warm the oil in a shallow pan to which you have a lid over a low to moderate heat. Place the sausages in the pan and brown. Keep a close eye on them, turning when the underside is a glossy, golden brown and continuing to cook until done to your liking.Peel and squash flat the garlic cloves. You only want a mere hint of the clove. Warm the olive oil in a deep pan and add the garlic. Drain the cannellini beans and stir into the pan. Pour in the chicken stock, add the tarragon, a little salt, turn up the heat and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and let the beans simmer for about 5 minutes until the stock has reduced by half.Introduce the cream and spinach into the beans and stir for a minute or two till bubbling. Stir in the parsley. Correct the seasoning with salt and pepper, and a little lemon juice to brighten the flavours. At this point I sometimes stir in a thin slice of butter to enrich the sauce. Serve with the sausages.Artichokes, potatoes, cheese and ciderView image in fullscreen‘Jerusalem artichokes pair well with small potatoes’: artichokes, potatoes, cheese and cider.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverKnobbly artichokes are the very devil to peel. I don’t think we have to be too pernickety about it, though.

Warm the olive oil in a wide, shallow pan, add the shallots and let them soften and colour to a pale gold, turning them over from time to time. Remove them from the pan, leaving the oil in place. (You will need the pan again.) Pour the stock into a saucepan and warm over a moderate heat.Peel the artichokes, slice them thinly, no thicker than a pound coin, then add them to the empty shallot pan over a moderate heat. Allow them to colour lightly. (You may need to do this in two batches, depending on the size of your pan.) Cut the potatoes into thick coins and stir them in, lower the heat, cover with a lid in then cook for a further 10 minutes. Scatter the flour over the vegetables and continue cooking for a couple of minutes, then pour in the cider and stock and bring to the boil.Stir in the grain mustard, shallots, thyme and parsley, season generously with salt and black pepper and continue to simmer, partially covered with a lid, for a few minutes, adding a little more stock or cider as necessary, until you have a sauce of medium thickness. Stir in half the grated cheese.Heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Transfer the potato mixture to a shallow baking dish, scatter over the remaining cheese and breadcrumbs and bake for 20 minutes.Follow Nigel on Instagram@NigelSlaterExplore more on these topicsSausagesNigel Slater recipesVegetablesFoodrecipesShareReuse this content"
