At least 18 councils have warned explicitly that the debts put them at risk of insolvency unless the government intervenes, with council estimates suggesting even more could go bust.“The deficits are pushing councils all over England to the financial brink. The clock is ticking, and councils are being left in limbo with significant uncertainty over the future of services,” said William Burns, social care policy adviser for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa).Mass defaults on Send deficits would cause chaos and damage other local services, said Cipfa, because councils that declare effective bankruptcy would be forced to drastically rein in spending in all areas, not just local schools. It estimates that as many as 75 councils are at risk.The spiralling debts were kept off council books by Tory ministers using an accounting fix called a “statutory override” but this ends on 31 March 2026, when the debt returns to town hall balance sheets. Ministers must now decide whether to clear the debt, or extend the override until the deficits can be cleared safely..The Send deficit ballooned under the last government, triggered by rapid increases in the cost of meeting education and health care plans (EHCPs) which give children and young people up to the age of 25 the legal right to school support from local authorities for conditions such as autism, and speech and language difficulty.In 2015, 240,000 EHCPs were in place in England, more than doubling to 576,000 in 2024, according to Department for Education (DfE) statistics. Insufficient special needs capacity in state schools, and the high costs of Send placements in private specialist schools, have been driving overspends.A government insider said: “Those [council] forecasts can only have been based on the failing Tory system that we will change. Tackling the chaos that the Tories left in our Send system is a major priority for [the education secretary] Bridget Phillipson, so we can give every child the opportunity to get a brilliant education.”A Guardian investigation shows at least 101 English councils – over two-thirds of the total – spent more than their allocated Send budget during the past year, with 18 councils breaching their annual allocations by evermore than £30m.Nearly nine out of 10 English upper-tier councils – of the 131 that responded in full to the FoI – will have an accumulated deficit on their high needs budgets by the end of next March, with one in four (32 out of the 131 who responded in full) now predicting debts of more than £50m and 15 debts of £100m or more..Leeds city council, which covers the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s Leeds West and Pudsey constituency, has forecast its accumulated Send deficit will soar from £17.5m to £50m by the end of the next financial year, and warned the increase will put it at “serious financial risk”.Hampshire county council, which has England’s largest forecast deficit at £312m, is projecting its debt to rise by £111m over the next year. In its budget reports, the council said that if the override was removed and the debt became a part of the organisation’s deficit, “a section 114 notice would become inevitable”.Middlesbrough, one of England’s most deprived authorities, said its forecast Send deficit will rise by more than a quarter to £26m over the next 12 months. In council papers last month, it called this “a critical risk to the council’s financial viability, given that it will wipe out the council’s general fund reserves”.The average forecast accumulated deficit across the councils covered by the analysis is £40m by the end of March 2026, with 112 forecasting their accumulated high needs deficit will worsen over the next 12 months.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The evidence is clear that the Send system has been on its knees for years – with too many children not having their needs met and parents forced to fight for support.“It will take time, but as part of our Plan for Change we are thinking differently about what the Send system should look like, to spread opportunity, restore the confidence of families up and down the country and deliver the improvement they are crying out for.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was 90.Chamberlain died on Saturday night in Waimānalo, Hawaii of complications after a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement: “Our beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.”Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known: that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, Shattered Love.The actor became known as “king of the TV miniseries” in 1978 when he landed the starring role in Centennial, an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener’s sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with Shōgun, another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell’s period piece about an American visitor to Japan.View image in fullscreenChamberlain with Yoko Shimada in Shōgun.Photograph: Ronald GrantHe scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, The Thorn Birds, based on Colleen McCullough’s bestseller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work on Shōgun and The Thorn Birds. Years earlier, he received one for Dr Kildare.View image in fullscreenChamberlain with Rachel Ward in The Thorn Birds.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhen the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theatre, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of My Fair Lady and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of The Sound of Music.He reprised the role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.He also appeared in numerous films, including The Music Lovers (as Tchaikovsky), The Madwoman of Chaillot, The Towering Inferno and The Three Musketeers and its sequels.Dr Kildare was based on a string of successful 1930s and 1940s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.Chamberlain’s hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, Ben Casey, was also a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.The so-called “Ben Casey shirt” became a fashion item, both shows’ theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called Dr Kildare! Dr Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.But in his autobiography, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous female colleagues to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters’ questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: “Getting married would be great, but I’m awfully busy now.”“When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,” he said in an NBC interview. “I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.”The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.“I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,” said Chamberlain, who for years was involved with fellow actor Martin Rabbett.Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on 31 March 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean war, Chamberlain decided to try acting.He studied voice and drama, appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film The Secret of the Purple Reef, and ultimately won the Dr Kildare role.When Dr Kildare was cancelled, he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.View image in fullscreenRichard Chamberlain with the titular characters, played by Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, in Will & Grace, 2005.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesHe moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester’s films: Petulia (1968), The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974). He reunited with Lester in 1989 for The Return of the Musketeers, once more playing Aramis.In 1969, Chamberlain played the title role in Hamlet at England’s Birmingham Repertory Company and repeated it in a TV adaptation that appeared on NBC in the United States. He also appeared as Octavius in a film version of Julius Caesar, which co-starred Charlton Heston and Jason Robards.He continued to act well into the 21st century, appearing on such television shows as Will & Grace, The Drew Carey Show and Touched by an Angel.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTheatrenewsShareReuse this content"

This increases the number of birds available to be shot for sport.But, in part as a result of burning,80% of England’s peatlandsare now degraded. These rare habitats store carbon when they are in good condition, ‘locking in’ an estimated 3.2 billion tonnes in the UK alone. But, when they dry out from burning or draining, they emit rather than store carbon. Burning the peat can also kill wildlife, such as adders, toads, and ground-nesting birds.‘A symbol of hope’: environmentalists choose their favourite invertebratesRead moreThe previous Conservative government announced rules to ban the burning of some peatland areas. But experts argued the rules werenot fit for purposeand left precious habitats and carbon sinks vulnerable to destruction.The legislation banned the burning of vegetation on areas of deep peat (more than 40cm depth) on a site of special scientific interest (SSSI) that is also a special area of conservation or a special protection area unless a licence has been granted or the land is steep or rocky. This left many areas of deep peat unprotected. Countryside groupscomplainedat the time that the government was “attacking grouse shooting” and the Countryside Alliance haslobbied againsta ban.Labour’s plans tighten the legislation, counting 30cm of peat as deep peat rather than 40cm, and they would protect all deep peat rather than only that in SSSIs. These changes would increase the area currently protected from 222,000 to more than 368,000 hectares of England’s total 677,250 hectares of deep peat. The approach is being supported by evidence provided by Natural England. Any prescribed burning would need to be carried out under strict licence, issued where there is a clear need; for example, to reduce wildfire risk.Nature minister Mary Creagh said: “Our peatlands are this country’s Amazon rainforest – home to our most precious wildlife, storing carbon and reducing flooding risk.“The UK has 13% of the world’s blanket bog. A rare global habitat, it is a precious part of our national heritage, and that is why we’re announcing a consultation on these measures, to ensure deep peat is better protected.“These changes will benefit communities by improving air and water quality, and protect homes and businesses from flood damage, which supports economic stability and security under our plan for change.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

His family and friends have not heard from him since, despite issuing an efit of what he might look like in his late 20s when the police investigation was reopened in 2019.At the time of his disappearance Sloley was described as a “light-skinned black male”, 5ft 5in tall and of medium build. He is reported to have “striking” blue eyes.Previously, police said he had little money, no wallet and no bag with extra clothes on him to indicate he was planning to run away, adding there was no proof that Sloley had been harmed and there was no evidence his case was linked to any others.DCI Sarb Kaur, who is leading the investigation, said: “Alex was reported missing to police on 8 August 2008. Since then there have been extensive inquiries made by police but sadly Alex has not yet been found.“We are now offering a reward of up to £10,000 for anyone who has information relating to Alex’s whereabouts.“This remains an active missing person investigation, subject to regular review by senior officers, with the aim of locating Alex and bringing some comfort to his family.“We have recently met with Alex’s mother to outline how we intend to progress our investigation to find him.“I would ask anyone with information who could help to please get in contact immediately, no matter how insignificant you think this could be.”In 2023, research by the charity Missing People found that missing persons cases involving black and Asian people areless likely to be resolved by policethan those involving white people. Black and Asian children are also likely to be missing for longer,the report found.Only 16% of incidents related to black children and 19% related to Asian children were concluded with the person being found by the police, compared with 23% of incidents related to white children.In 2019, when the efit was issued, Sloley’s mother, Nerissa Tivy, said it was a great picture of him, adding that she tries to imagine what her son might look like and how he might dress. “He was quite a slick dresser, my son; he wasn’t scruffy.”She added: “There’s no closure to this and, with all the appeals and knowing your child would not just run away, you start thinking something terrible has happened to him,” she said at the time.“I would love to see him walk through the door.”Explore more on these topicsLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

In the 30 forces providing only one week full pay, 60% of officers returned to work after seven days. In the five forces that provided data and offered two weeks’ fully paid leave, only 12% of officers went back to work after a week.More than 50 testimonies from officers and their families raised concerns about the treatment of fathers, with officers describing a culture where involved fathers were “mocked”, “slagged off” or “ostracised”.One former officer, who said the strain of his family was one of the biggest reasons he left the force, said he was “treated very poorly” and “slagged off behind his back” for taking two weeks’ unpaid leave to care for his partner after an emergency caesarean.“Overall the police service doesn’t support fathers fairly at all,” he said. “[The] culture makes men feel like they need to be back at work asap. If you’re not, you’re looked down on or treated differently.”In another example, a firearms officer was not allowed to adjust the dates of his paternity leave when his baby arrived three weeks early, meaning that on the day his wife and baby came out of hospital he did a night shift carrying a firearm.The Met police, the largest force in England and Wales, offers civilian staff – in roles such as administration or 999 call handling – three weeks of paternity leave at full pay. However, frontline officers get one fully paid week, with the second paid at the statutory rate of £184.03 a week, a quarter of thestarting salary for a Met officer.The Met said in a statement: “Officers and staff have different terms and conditions, set separately. For officers, these are governed nationally via police regulations and for staff, set by the Met. Fair terms and conditions are important to everyone.”Paternityleave for police officers is governedby police regulations, set by the Home Office, a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said. Forces have to offer one week at full pay and one week at statutory pay for qualifying officers.However, at least nine forces across England and Wales now offer a second week of paternity leave on full pay. British TransportPoliceand the Civil Nuclear constabulary give officers three weeks’ leave on full pay, while Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands give two weeks’ full pay.A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said the increase in paternity pay, made last year, reflected “the changing nature of modern families”. They added: “It’s important to us that we do our utmost to support our officers and staff as they enter their journey into parenthood.”A survey from the Police Federation found that more than one in five officers were ready to quit the service in 2023 – up from 18% in 2022 and 12% in 2021. Of 2,654 officers who left the police between 2017 and 2024,27% resigned before they reached pension age, with 63% saying the impact on their family life was a critical factor.Alex Lloyd Hunter, a cofounder of the Dad Shift, urged Yvette Cooper to improve paternity pay for officers and speak to the Met commissioner to tackle its “grossly unfair policy”.“The home secretary has done a lot to ensure the police are doing better to protect women and girls,” he said. “Supporting dads in the force properly, so they can be involved caregivers, is part of that same equality agenda.”A Home Office spokesperson said police bodies made recommendations on pay, and that the government recognised that support for officers was “vital, as a healthy and engaged police workforce will be better able to tackle crime and protect the public”.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaternity & paternity rightsMetropolitan policeParents and parentingChildrenEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The raid was condemned by the Quakers as “an aggressive violation”.However, Youth Demand said the publicity surrounding the raid had had the effect of increasing awareness of their activities and as many as 200 people had since expressed interest in joining protests starting this Tuesday to highlight Israel’s actions in Gaza.One of the women arrested and later released without charge told the Guardian on Sunday of how they and others at the venue, including a life-drawing class with a naked model, were shocked when police entered.“These are welcome talks run every week and they are completely open to the public, so anyone who has seen a poster and is interested can come in and learn more. The police could have literally come along and sat down,” she said.“Instead, we could see them gathering at the window and their little hats were tapping on the glass. Then they forced the door open and burst into a room with a group of women sitting in a circle. There was a life-drawing class in another room – with a model in the middle – and an elderly woman was in the toilet at the time.”A student who was arrested at the talk said police had released her in the middle of the night and that she was still waiting for them to return a laptop, which she needed for exams, and a notebook containing French notes from her coursework.The group, whose activists include young veterans of the Just Stop Oil movement, said it was planning to “shut down London” on a daily basis starting from Tuesday, when it is due to hold a rally at 6.30pm on Malet Street, Bloomsbury.It said police had carried out raids on the homes of activists across London and in locations outside the city in recent days, which it took as a sign that the authorities were worried about its potency.Eddie Whittingham, who was arrested at his house in Exeter last week, said: “I had taken part in a 10-minute blockade of a road and we had made it known we were going to be doing the same again in London.“To the best of my knowledge, stepping out into the road for 10 minutes is not something you could be pre-emptively arrested for, yet here we are.“It’s kind of baffling but also affirming that the police believe a bunch of young people taking actions like this are worth the sort of resources they are devoting to these raids.”The Metropolitan police said it had arrested six people at the Quaker meeting house on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.The force said those arrested were part of Youth Demand and it claimed those attending the meeting were planning direct action in the capital next month.“Youth Demand have stated an intention to ‘shut down’ London over the month of April using tactics including ‘swarming’ and road blocks,” police said.“While we absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

On the one hand, it crushes Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities, and on the other hand, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages.”Netanyahu said on Saturday night “the security cabinet convened and decided to increase the pressure, which had already increased, in order to further pound Hamas and create the optimal conditions for releasing our hostages”.View image in fullscreenTens of thousands in Tel Aviv protesting on Saturday against Netanyahu’s government and demanding the return of hostages.Photograph: Yair Palti/Anadolu/Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people who rallied in Tel Aviv and throughout Israel on Saturday night accused the prime minister of deprioritising a deal to free those still held captive inGaza.Speaking to protesters at Habima Square in central Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, the mother ofMatan Zangauker, who is still held captive by Hamas, accused Netanyahu of carrying out a “targeted assassination” against her son after the Israel Defense Forces launched an aerial attack on Gaza last week.“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to bomb Matan instead of saving him and bringing him home,” she said.Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 who, the Israeli military says, are dead.Under pressure at international and domestic level, Netanyahu stressed that “Hamas must lay down its arms”, adding that its leaders would be allowed to leave after they did so, and Israel was also willing to talk about “the final stage” of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with the militant group.“We are ready,” he said. “Hamas will lay down its weapons. Its leaders will be allowed to leave. We will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan.”Days after taking office, the US president, Donald Trump,announced a planthat would relocate Gaza’s more than 2 million inhabitants to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, an announcement that was condemned by much of the international community, including allies across Europe and the Middle East.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold photos of the hostages Ariel and David Cunio, who are being held in the Gaza Strip, during a demonstration in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesNetanyahu’s remarks came as mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US continued efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of the Israeli hostages.On Saturday, Hamas allegedlyoffered to free five living Israeli hostagesin exchange for a 50-day ceasefire, and released a video of a hostage making an appeal for his freedom.Hamas’s chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said on Saturday that the militant group expressed willingness to release the five hostages over the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, which begins on Sunday, after a proposal it received two days ago from Egypt and Qatar, Reuters has reported.“Two days ago, we received a proposal from the mediators in Egypt and Qatar. We dealt with it positively and accepted it,” Hayya, who leads the Hamas negotiating team, said in a televised speech. “We hope that the [Israeli] occupation will not undermine [it].”Hamas stated on Saturday that the group had approved a new ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators, and urged Israel to support it. Netanyahu’s office confirmed receipt of the proposal and said Israel had submitted a counterproposal.The details of the latest mediation efforts remain undisclosed, although, according to media reports in Israel, Netanyahu’s government insists on the release of 10 of the 24 hostages.Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s office said he would visit Hungary on 2 April for a multi-day trip in defiance of an arrest warrant from the international criminal court against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, publicly extended an invitation to Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued the warrant.In a separate development on Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the bodies of 14 rescuers, including a UN employee, had been found in Rafah in southern Gaza, a week after its ambulances came under heavy fire from Israeli forces.Three PRCS first responders and one civil defence paramedic are still missing.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Israel’s military admitted on Saturday thatit had fired on ambulances in the Gaza Stripafter identifying them as “suspicious vehicles”.The incident occurred in Rafah city’s Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood just days into a renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border. The military resumed its wider bombardments of Gaza on 18 March, breaking a ceasefire that had lasted almost two months.The PRCS president, Younis al-Khatib, condemned Israel for targeting its paramedics as they were fulfilling their humanitarian mission.He said a rescue team had been able to reach the scene where the crew members went missing two days ago and had retrieved the body of a crew member, which had been buried.“There are a number of scenarios for what happened … After more than one week of losing communication with our crew either they have been killed or detained by the Israeli occupation forces,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

I have documentation. There were board meetings where members of the executive team and external strategic advisers were sending me messages saying: ‘Should I interrupt? Should I stop this? Oh my gosh, this is so bad.’“In fact, our strategic adviser for fundraising then sent me a message saying she wouldn’t want to ever attend any more board meetings or bring her colleagues because of the treatment.The interview, trailed on Saturday and aired in full on Sunday morning, included allegations of“harassment and bullying at scale” from the prince towards the chair, after Harry and several others quit the organisation earlier this week.Though Harry has not commented specifically on the bullying and harassment allegations, sources close to the prince said the claims were “completely baseless”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They added they “remain firm in their resignation, for the good of the charity, and look forward to the adjudication of the truth”.Two named former trustees have come out in support of the prince, with Kelello Lerotholi, who resigned from the charity this week, telling Sky News he did not recognise the allegations: “I can honestly say, in the meetings I was present in, there was never even a hint of such.”Chandauka said the prince, who she said had not been to Africa for five years, had made moves against her, adding further trustees to the charity’s board in efforts to bolster his control. In a separate interview with theFinancial Times, she said there was noticeable friction between the UK staff and those based in Lesotho, where most of the charity’s 500-plus workforce is based. She said the board felt “a loss of power and control and influence … ‘Oh my goodness, the Africans are taking over.’”When Harry could not have her removed through a vote, because of a legal challenge, she alleges, he aimed to sabotage the charity, which he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.Chandauka, who appeared on Sky News with another board member, the investment banker Iain Rawlinson, claimed the rift became public with the prince’s “unleashing of the Sussex machine” against her.The Conservative peer Lynda Chalker, who served as a trustee for nearly two decades until November, described Chandauka as having an “almost dictatorial” style.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryCharitiesAfricaAids and HIVMonarchyLesothoVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

Some of London’s top clubs including fabric and Fold have already enforced similar bans, and it has long been standard practice in Berlin, the clubbing mecca of Europe.“We understand that people might want to capture footage to remember the night, but we have a team that roam around the venue, and we’ll be able to create content from that,” Abbott, who is also one of the club’s resident DJs, said.“We also want DJs to be able to express themselves to everyone, to feel that they’re part of a special experience, and in our case, we think that phones on the dance floor kind of detract from that.”The first time people were seen filming or taking photographs once, they would be asked to put their phone away, Abbott said. If they did it twice theywould be asked to leave, but staff hadn’t had to do much in the way of enforcement, he said.View image in fullscreenDJ Ayy Den at Amber’s nightclub in Manchester.Photograph: Amber’s“The response has been great so far,” he said. “People have really respected the concept and kept their phones away, and it has contributed to a much better vibe on the dancefloor.”BBC Radio’s 6 Music festival returned toManchesterthis weekend, with Amber’s hosting the festival’s Rave Forever club night.“As the newest venue in town, Amber’s is already well-loved by clubbers and DJs for being phone-free, encouraging connection and immersion rather than clubbing becoming a disjointed spectator sport,” said Kath McDermott, a producer on the 6 Music music team and a prominent Manchester DJ.“Clubbing has changedin Manchester immeasurably over the decades but Manchester, and increasingly Salford, have maintained the reputation as the home of rave. The energy and community here has always felt unique.“It’s particularly positive to see the strong return of underground, grassroots parties and promoters who are interested in promoting unity over profit as the next generation of clubbers and DJs come through.”View image in fullscreenThe Haçienda nightclub in Manchester, circa 1995.Photograph: Clive Hunte/RedfernsAt festivals, gigs, and club nights, the view of the stage is often obscured by a sea of phones held aloft in the air. Smaller, more underground nightclubs have closed, giving way to day parties and superclubs such as Manchester’s Warehouse Project.The 6 Music DJ Jamz Supernova said this was likely to be down to the rise in social media.“I’ve always loved the grittiness, and the clubs that are grimy, sticky floors, but I guess that doesn’t serve the Instagram generation,” she said. “Because it’s dark, it’s smoky, you’re not going to get the best images.“I think that’s what has kind of given way to the rise of, obviously, festivals, but then, outside day parties and things like that, or more gigs that feel more like a show rather than a club.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There “wasn’t this kind of pressure to look maintained all the way through, to maintain an image all the way through.View image in fullscreenThe crowd at Amber’s nightclub in Manchester.Photograph: Amber’s“And I think that’s probably why, a lot of people kind of feel a bit more self-conscious nowadays,” she said, “because there are so many phones on the dancefloor.”Jamz Supernova also notices agenerational dividewhen playing to younger clubbers. “I think the way we use phones has changed our attention span,” she said. “So if you are playing to a younger audience who are waiting for that drop, often it’s kind of like an instant grat[ification].What if you never come down?

Now “the crowd look after each other a lot more, that’s been a really cool thing to see”.In a similar way, she thinks clubbers may adapt to keeping their phones away on a night out, particularly young people who may only just be turning 18.“You’ll have a different appreciation of raving because that’ll be the status quo, you won’t know any different,” she said.“So I think [a no phones policy] is driven towards a better future.

Since the inauguration of Donald Trump in January, after which the US president’s top adviser and the world’s richest man, Elon Musk, gave twofascist-style salutes, there has been a rise in children using the Nazi salute in schools in Värmland.“They don’t do it as a type of homage to Hitler – they do it because Musk did it,” says the sociologist, who works to counter violent extremism in the county where the Swedish Nazi party was founded 100 years ago. There is, he adds, “a lot of attention around Musk’s salute”, which some boys see as “a bit cool”.While he says that the number of children engaging in this behaviour is small and by no means mainstream, it is evidence of the need for early intervention when it comes to the recruitment of young boys into far-right groups. “It is a ­violent ­message, and it can also be very serious if they’re drawn in. It should definitely be taken seriously.”Far-right extremism has long been present in Sweden, but – as in other parts ofEuropeand the US – the last few years have seen a dramatic shift in the dominant groups, their structure, activities and recruitment.The number of active groups in the Swedish far right are at their highest level since 2008, according to a new report by Expo, a Swedish anti-racism institute. After several years in decline, last year saw an increase in the number of groups “attracting a new generation of young men who have lost faith in democracy”. Violence, it reports, plays an increasingly important role – “both rhetorically and in actual acts of violence”.Sweden’s largest neo-Nazi group, the Nordic Resistance Movement (known in Sweden asNordiska motståndsrörelsen, or NMR), is not the force it once was. Its activities were heavily impacted by beingdesignated a terror groupby the US last year, meaning any US-based assets were frozen and it was blocked from the US financial system. It was also affected by changes in leadership and has struggled to recruit younger men within an aging membership.But in its shadow a multitude of new, smaller, more agile and, to many, more invisible groups have emerged, using racist memes and violent videos to fish for new members on platforms like TikTok before the conversation moves on to other, private platforms.Among the most successful is Aktivklubb Sverige, which acts as an umbrella organisation in Sweden for five smaller groups across the country, including White Boys Stockholm. The homegrown Gym XIV, which focuses on physical training and preparing for violence, has also played a key role in the development of Sweden’s active club movement. Both Aktivklubb and Gym XIV have developed extensive international links across Europe and the US – Aktivklubb is part of the international Active Club network founded in 2020 by the US far-right extremistRobert Rundo.Stiernelöf, who works for Agera Värmland, a group that helps people to leave violent extremism, says one of the most notable changes is how the age of those being pulled in has plummeted. Some of the boys being recruited, he says, are now as young as 10.The other notable change is the profile of the types of people who are attracted. “Ten to 15 years ago, it was about the strong, expressive guys who wanted to be seen,” he says. “Today, it is about young, vulnerable guys who often spend their time online and maybe miss social contact. That is a very big difference.”This change, he adds, is also apparent in the types of “lone actor” males involved in acts of terror and mass violence. In February, a gunman killed 10 people,most of whomhad an immigrant background, at an education centre in Örebro before killing himself. While the shooter’s motive is not known, he was a “classic lone actor”, says Stiernelöf.The rise in membership of violent far-right groups is not happening in a vacuum. The far-right Sweden Democrats won the second highest number of seats in the 2022 general election after blaming rising gang crime onimmigration. Its leader, Jimmie Åkesson, has also spoken in support offolkutbyte, the far-right “great replacement” conspiracy theory.View image in fullscreenLudvig Delin of the NMR in a clash with police in 2019.Photograph: Marc Fermenia/ExpoDeje is a relatively small community of just a few thousand in Värmland but in recent years it has become a hub of far-right activity. Overlooking a river, among wooden houses painted in traditional colours and above a car workshop, is the Swedish headquarters of the white supremacist Hammerskins. The US Nazi group has beenbanned in Germany, but in Deje has been met with a “tense acceptance” by the community, says Stiernelöf.Although its membership is relatively small – estimated at eight to 10 people, mostly men in their 40s and 50s – the venue has become a meeting place for other far-right groups, including NMR, and an international site of pilgrimage for groups including the Proud Boys, which visited last summer.In the centre of Deje, close to the grocery store and community football pitch used by local children, lies the site of what was until fairly recently a Gym XIV clubhouse. Until it was pulled down by local authorities, it was used for about a year and a half, says Stiernelöf, with a fighting cage visible outside.Where the group is based now is not known, but it is believed to be relatively close by. These clubs are focused on violence – training for what they claim is a forthcoming race war.View image in fullscreenHammerskins HQ in Deje, Värmland, where a Gym XIV fight club was also located.Photograph: Miranda Bryant/the Observer“It is white young men. They talk a lot about the ‘white genocide’, ‘white lives matter’. They see a threat to the white man’s power,” he says. Role models includefigures from the manospheresuch as Andrew Tate and Marcus Follin, a Swedish white-nationalist YouTuber known as “the golden one”, whose Instagram feed is full of bodybuilding pictures.As well as racism, hatred in these far-right groups is also directed at LGBTQ+ people and women.The home lives of those who are recruited is “very mixed”, he says. But the trademark warning sign for vulnerability is those who are outsiders and do not feel that they belong.Trump’s re-election bolstered the far right inSweden, says Stiernelöf, even among those who are not open Trump supporters, because there is a sense that “we have a leader in the White House who supports our thing”.At Expo’s office in Stockholm, researcher Jonathan Leman says extreme rightwing groups “feel closer to the mainstream now” – in part because of Trump. “The previous administration saw the worldwide movement of far-right extremism as a threat. ” The Trump administration, he says, “sends the opposite signals” with Musk’s public support of far-right groups and “expressing support for extreme-right core ideology”. NMR, he says, has even expressed hope that its US terror designation could be revoked.In its most recent annual report, Säpo, the Swedish security service, paints a worrying picture of how the overlap of active clubs and online radicalisation could result in increasing violence in the future.It warned that terrorist groups are using digital platforms and gaming environment to reach younger target groups in order to radicalise and mobilise them at an accelerating pace. “The security service handles cases involving children who have not even reached adolescence,” says the report, with young people “often attracted to violence as an ideology”.It adds: “In addition to the online problem, active clubs within rightwing extremism are also a growing phenomenon in Europe that primarily attracts younger people.”In Sweden, a far-right assault on the media is undermining the Nordic model | Martin GelinRead moreViolent extremism, anti-establishment movements and conspiracy theories are overlapping in a way that risks making ideologically motivated violence more common, it warns. “Increased polarisation in Sweden could mean increased acceptance of threats, hatred and violence while creating a breeding ground for violent extremism.”A former member of far-right groups in Sweden over a 10-year period, who spoke to theObserveron condition of anonymity, became involved before turning 13. He left the movement entirely a few years ago but was initially attracted by the “close community. It was cool”.The movement has changed dramatically in recent years, he said, from being relatively public-facing to having more secrecy. “Nowadays the movement is very fluid, not so open, but with a lot of outward-facing propaganda online. It is very organised, very tight and tied together. But the outside has much less insight into how it works, how it reacts and who the actors are.”Explore more on these topicsThe far rightThe ObserverSwedenEuropeMenDonald TrumpfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The provincial fire department was among the building destroyed, damaging all the rescue machinery and vehicles inside.There are not enough rescue teams to retrieve the dead bodies, nor is there sufficient equipment to sift through debris.“It’s been two days, and the smell is starting to emanate,” said Ma Ei, who has helped in the humanitarian efforts. “We haven’t received any help because of the internet and phone connection outages. At the moment, only the residents are involved in the rescue work, and we urgently need more rescue workers.”They also need dry food, drinking water and medicines, she said.Sagaing’s hospital has also been damaged, forcing patients outside into the searing heat. Until Sunday there were no tents to protect them from the sun, said Ma Ei.0:33Before and after satellite images show devastation caused by Myanmar earthquake – videoShe saw about 200 patients who arrived at Sagaing hospital in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake. “There may be more patients than this,” she said. Most have broken limbs and head injuries. “Some patients with pre-existing chronic diseases are suffering even more,” she added.Ko Doe, a member of a local rescue team in Sagaing, said equipment had been damaged in the quake, but that his team began work “as soon as we received some machinery from the government and did not stop until yesterday morning”. Even with the extra supplies, however, they only have four cranes for the whole township.Rescue teams are battling with supply shortages, power outages, connection disruptions and broken roads. They are also working under a repressive military junta. Generals seized power in a coup in 2021, triggering a spiralling conflict. The military has suffered humiliating losses in its fight against an armed resistance made up of civilian groups that formed after the coup to fight for the return of democracy, and ethnic armed groups that have long sought independence.Quake mapAirstrikes, a daily occurrence as the regime tries to stamp out opposition, continued even after the earthquake on Friday. In military-controlled areas, the junta routinely arrests anyone it suspects of opposing its rule, and people live in fear of being rounded up or forcibly conscripted to fight for it.“Some rescue workers do not dare to give help because they are afraid of being arrested,” said a local person in Sagaing town who asked not to be named.The man added that his friend had been admitted to a military hospital, a prospect many civilians would want to avoid. The public hospital was overrun. “He could have died if he was not sent because gangrene had set in in his wound,” the person said.View image in fullscreenPeople stand next to a damaged building in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesSagaing patients who require more complex treatment would be normally be sent to Mandalay, Myanmar’s second city, which has the largest hospital in the region. Roads and bridges have been badly damaged, however, and even if they make it, the city’s general hospital is badly overstretched.“I am middle-aged and I’ve experienced a lot of incidents, but never been busy like this before. This is very severe,” said a doctor at Mandalay general hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He remembers standing in the city centre after the quake: “Wherever I looked, east, west, south, north, I saw collapsed buildings and only dust,” he said. One medic was knocked off their feet while doing surgery because the shaking was so violent.1:24Rescue operations underway in Thailand and Myanmar after earthquake – videoAll patients at Mandalay hospital have been evacuated and are being treated outside. Those unable to manage the intense heat have been placed near an entrance, so they can be easily moved. Some patients have been sent home because they are too traumatised to stay near the hospital building, fearing the collapsed ceilings and broken tiles, he said.The UN has warned of “a severe shortage of medical supplies” including trauma kits, blood bags, anaesthetics, assistive devices, essential medicines and tents for health workers.The doctor at Mandalay hospital said supplies had not run out yet. “We can provide necessary IV drips and injections,” he said, adding they also had blood supplies. But it was less clear the hospital had enough resources for the surgeries needed by patients, he said.View image in fullscreenDoctors and medics teams treat a victim trapped under the rubble of the destroyed Sky Villa development in Mandalay.Photograph: Sai Aung Main/AFP/Getty ImagesIn areas outside the main cities, the situation appears worse. In Sagaing, Ei Hnin Phway said aid had yet to arrive. “We can’t even post updates on Facebook about what happening,” she said, citing the bad connections.Ko Doe said his team had recovered 190 bodies so far, but he believed many more remained trapped. Work continued urgently on Sunday, he said. His team was due to attend a monastery, a Buddhist summer school, a private school and a nunnery school, where bodies remained trapped, he said. Many were children.“The chances of survival are very low,” he said.Explore more on these topicsMyanmarEarthquakesAidSouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s still absolutely classic tellyJack SealeSun 30 Mar 2025 17.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 17.12 EDTShareIt is, scarily, 20 years since Bruce Parry first brought Tribe to the BBC. The diffident but determined former Royal Marine visited Indigenous people in the world’s most remote places and, by living as one of them, earned a level of trust that previous documentary-makers had struggled to achieve. Parry was more patient, more respectful and more physically courageous than other white interlopers had been. He gained valuable insights into tribal life and the threats to it posed by modernity. Tribe itself was simply cracking entertainment, as involving as it was educational.Television’s sausage machine has a way of turning the most exotic ingredients into familiar comfort food and, although it took us to the farthest corners of the planet, Tribe soon established a reliable format. Parry’s return follows the winning formula as he travels to meet the 600-strong Waimaha people, deep in the Colombian Amazon rainforest.First, there is the journey in, via small plane and tiny boat, the camera snagging on a branch as the canoe weaves through foliage. Then it is the tentative first meeting with the village elder, a friendly man named Pedro who is nevertheless upfront about why Parry is getting funny looks: “We don’t think much of the white man. When we see you it brings back memories.” The Waimaha have been here for 2,000 years, having been brought upriver, legend has it, in the belly of an anaconda; a century ago they were massacred by invading rubber tappers, and as recently as the 1970s their children were forcibly taken and re-educated by Catholic missionaries.Soon, though, Parry is ensconced with a family and winning favour by showcasing his wood-chopping skills on a trip out to find protein. He joins them in feasting on mojojoy, the fat white larvae of the palm weevil, which are eaten raw and, indeed, alive. “It’s got a lot of flavour!” says Parry, politely. “It’s like a custard that … isn’t that sweet.” Later on, Pedro, who is the local physician, finds a plant with medicinal qualities. He picks a lush leaf, squeezes it into a ball and dispenses a drop of green juice into each of Parry’s eyes. “Yeah, that … stings,” says Parry, fighting to maintain his gratitude. Pedro says this is a sign there is something wrong with his eyes.Before long, Parry’s willingness to help with any domestic task has endeared him to the womenfolk, and he is making progress with the training he has to undergo before he will be allowed to join the villagers at a ceremony for the forest spirits, fuelled by the hallucinogenic plant extract yage, AKA ayahuasca. His sinuses are cleared by snorting ground chilli; his stomach is purged by drinking emetic leaf-water, a process that ends with him neck-deep in a river in the middle of the night, manfully hurling up gallons of green goo.It is classic Parry, and there is a very funny moment where the more experienced Pedro shows off his refined spewing technique: while Parry urges and spits, Pedro leans forward and lets it all flow smoothly out of him in one go, as if has turned on a dirty tap.Before the big night in the deeply impressive village hall – Parry helps with the efficient collective effort to re-roof it, trying his best to match the locals’ skill in weaving leaves and reeds around wood – there are serious issues to confront. Outsiders are no longer killing or kidnapping the Waimaha, but they are tempting young villagers with a different way of life: children leave the rainforest and travel to school, where they are taught the Colombian national curriculum rather than the ways of the tribe.As always, Tribe asks difficult questions about what western concepts such as progress and enlightenment really mean. Are the Waimaha who choose to leave their old life behind really better off for having greater access to tarmac, plastic, burgers, money and elections? An initiative to give Indigenous people educational autonomy within a wider system of governance looks like a decent compromise.What we are really here for, however, is Parry losing his mind on drugs. At the community gathering, the Waimaha dance endlessly in circles, pounding the ground to send everyone into a trance-like state. The effect of this when combined with large quantities of yage, taken on an empty stomach, is something we don’t see much of, beyond Parry looking a bit peaky and leaning his forehead on a stick for support. But as he always does, he speaks lucidly about the new understanding the experience has given him of the forest way of life, and how precious is the place in which these people live. It is the same old same old, but it feels good to reconnect.Tribe With Bruce Parry aired on BBC Two and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Labour MP for Bolsover will spend the day in her constituency, surrounded by her children, her daughter’s newborn baby, her husband, mother and sister.Fleet is only 40 years old. Her eldest daughter, now 24, was conceived when Fleet was a teenager after she was groomed by a much older man. “To have a child conceived at 15 felt as bad as it could get. Being a nana at 40 feels like I’ve won the jackpot,” Fleet says. “So I’ll spend my first Mother’s Day as a nana with the baby… just enjoying the fact that she exists, that my daughter could choose who the dad was. It’s something every woman should have.”Last summer, a few weeks after being elected as an MP for the first time, Fleet spoke publicly about her grooming ordeal, and revealed that her eldest daughter was the product of statutory rape, where the victim is too young to consent. She is now campaigning for a change in the law to prevent rapists from having access to the children conceived as a result of an attack, which she says would remove one of the barriers to women speaking out when they become pregnant and offer greater protections for mothers.This week, she will meet home secretary Yvette Cooper to make the case. She said: “How can we let children be the only proceed of crime that the criminal can have full access to?”Since speaking out, Fleet says many people have called her brave. “I don’t want this to be brave,” she says. “I want this to be normal.” She wants to ensure rape is spoken about more openly so we can end what she describes as a “he did it, she hid it” culture. Fleet believes the perpetrators’ existing parental rights mean some women are too scared to say they’ve been raped. Some women have told her that their rapist threatened them that if they revealed what had happened, he would demand access to the child.The Centre for Women’s Justice estimated that in England and Wales alone, between 2,080 and 3,356 children could have beenconceived by rapein 2021. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that in April 2024, 3,100 households in the UK declared “non-consensual conception” on official child benefit forms.Fleet took Bolsover, the East Midlands seat held for years by Dennis Skinner, in the Labour landslide in July. She grew up on a council estate in Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, not far from her constituency. Her family experienced homelessness as well as domestic violence. “That is something that has definitely scarred me. It was difficult to grow up like that,” she said. “I was a vulnerable child.”When she became pregnant aged 15, “nobody ever asked me about the dad, the fact that he was much older than me. The fact that it was statutory rape just wasn’t spoken about. It was happening so widely.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Fleet speaks in parliament on International Women’s Day.Photograph: House of CommonsFleet credits the then Labour government for supporting her as a teenage mother. A SureStart centre, a maternity grant and university scholarship changed her life, she says. “I felt like the state saw me and wrapped its arms around me so I could fulfil my potential.” It was this that motivated her to become a Labour MP.Until last year she hadn’t used terms such as “grooming” and “statutory rape” to discuss her own experience. As she prepared to enter parliament, she spoke to her daughter, who was by then pregnant. Fleet sought support online, searching for resources for parents wanting to disclose this difficult truth to their children, and support for the children in question. She couldn’t find anything.“As part of my role on the women and equalities select committee, I asked about some guidance on [conception] via rape [to be] put on the NHS website,” she says. She also believes women and children in these circumstances need a dedicated charity “where there’s a helpline where women can call to have these conversations, and it can be a voice for these women, to advocate for things like the law change”.On International Women’s Day she told the House of Commons that football had been discussed more often than rape in the previous parliament.Fleet has been open with her daughter about the circumstances of her conception. Her daughter has been “really supportive”. “It must be so hard for her, and my other children – nobody wants to hear your mum say those things. But that’s why I’ve got to normalise it.”Bringing up a child conceived by rape poses serious challenges for victims. “I look back and remember there was a time when I struggled that she didn’t have the same hair as me, I struggled with the way that she looked,” Fleet says. “I just wish there had been someone to tell me: that’s OK, you can be her mum and love her, and you could also think the circumstances that she was conceived under were horrendous.”She is concerned about the apparent increase in misogyny, particularly among young men. Debates prompted by the recent TV showAdolescence, which tells the story of a teenage boy driven to murder after being radicalised by misogynistic content online, are encouraging. But more needs to be done.“I am really scared by misogyny and how widespread it seems to be,” says Fleet. “As a woman in politics, I had to have an acceptance that I was going to receive a huge amount of misogyny. One family member said, ‘I wish you could post a picture of you and your newborn granddaughter without someone commenting that they’d like to murder you both.’ I wish that too.”Fleet says the more she speaks out about rape, the more abuse she receives. “There is a backlash from men … [but] that’s another reason to keep going. I have been accosted on the street. I’m having to take a lot of precautions around safety.”The main people she wants to reach with her message are women who find themselves in the situation she was in 24 years ago. “My hope is that other women will hear me on Mother’s Day and think: ‘What happened to me was dodgy too.’ If we can have those conversations, we can start to get that societal change we desperately need, where shame does finally change sides.”Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultThe ObserverViolence against women and girlsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Duke of Sussex was one of a number of trustees of the Lesotho-based HIV and Aids charity Sentebale to resign over what he called “untenable” leadership. Here is what we know about what occurred.What happened?On Tuesday night, Harry issued a joint statementsaying he was “in shock” and “truly heartbroken”to be resigning as a trustee of the charity he founded in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, with his co-founder Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, over a dispute with the organisation’s chair, Sophie Chandauka, a Zimbabwean lawyer.In response, Chandaukahit back, saying they had unsuccessfully tried to oust her because she “dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir – and the cover-up that ensued”.Who else resigned?The trustees Timothy Boucher, Harry’s former aide Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, who runs Botswana-based public health organisations, Dr Kelello Lerotholi, who was responsible for local funding, and Damian West, a schoolmate of Seeiso’s from Ampleforth college in North Yorkshire who has worked as a consultant in Africa.What is the row about?It appears a division emerged in the board when Chandauka wanted to modernise Sentebale and diversify its income away from being dependent on the prince and the trustees’ wealthy friends. While the charity was successful, it was a kind of pet project for Harry, relying on the annual Sentebale polo cup and surviving the Covid pandemic largely through a pro bono performance by the pop star James Blunt, a friend of the previous chair Johnny Hornby,according to one account.Chandauka, who said decisions were made collectively with the board, hired the expensive strategy firm Lebec to shift the charity’s fundraising focus away from what a source described as “a bunch of white blokes”. When donations were reportedly weaker than expected, Harry and other board members asked Chandauka to step down. She refused, taking legal action to stay in her post and reporting them to the Charity Commission. She blamed the drop in donations on the Duke of Sussex’s “toxic brand”, as a result of his public spat with the royal family, and said there was a “significant correlation” with when he left the UK.How did it escalate?After the princes’ statement, Chandauka accused Harry of an “unleashing of the Sussex machine” – in other words, engaging his powerful PR team – without telling the charity he had resigned. In a statement, she said: “There are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct.”She accused the prince and the former trustees of making moves against her because they felt “a loss of power and control and influence … ‘Oh my goodness, the Africans are taking over.’” She said she had previously had a “great relationship” with Harry, whose involvement she said she welcomed, but he had caused problems such as inviting a Netflix crew to a polo tournament in Miami last year without clearing it properly, which led to a new venue needing to be found, and bringing his wife, the Duchess of Sussex, along with no notice, resulting in negative press the charity was unprepared for.What is Harry saying?The prince has stayed tight-lipped about the allegations and has not responded to any specific claims. A source close to the resigned trustees and patrons said they “fully expected this publicity stunt and reached their collective decision with this in mind”.What happens next?Appearing on Sky News with a current board member, the investment banker Iain Rawlinson, Chandauka said she had “documentation” relating to months of bullying and harassment.An investigation by the Charity Commission will be carried out. A commission spokesperson said: “We are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.”On the future of the charity, Chandauka pointed to the 500-plus staff who worked there, mostly in Lesotho, saying: “Sentebale will live, Sentebale will live on because of the people.”Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryCharitiesVoluntary sectorAids and HIVMonarchyLesothoexplainersShareReuse this content"

Where’s the debauchery?Where other teen shows ramp up the sex, drugs and scandal, this Leeds-set saga about rivalries in a dance school keeps it real – so real it almost refuses to be entertainingRachel AroestiSun 30 Mar 2025 17.30 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 17.32 EDTShareThe implausibility of the teen drama may well be the genre’s defining feature. In the 00s, we were subjected to untold glamour and relentless wisecracking by US imports such asThe OCand Gossip Girl. The UK equivalent was Skins, in which a group of Bristolian party animals managed to make practically every personal problem known to man look intimidatingly cool. More recently, we’ve had mind-blowing levels of debauchery fromEuphoria, mind-blowing levels of sexual literacy and candour from Sex Education and mind-blowing levels of heartwarming niceness fromHeartstopper. All of it is ludicrous in its own way.Dreamers is different. It is realistic – jarringly so. That’s both a pro and a con for this Channel 4 drama about a group of teenage dancers living in Leeds. The series – written by Lisa Holdsworth (Waterloo Road) and Gem Copping (EastEnders), and directed by Sara Dunlop – is filmed in a meticulously naturalistic way. The camera tends to linger, documentary-style, on characters, whether they are doing something interesting or not: chatting aimlessly, walking to work, getting a glass of water. It’s very kitchen sink, not least in the sense that there are multiple shots of actual kitchen sinks. (The show’s original title wasDanceSchool, which captures the no-frills, matter-of-fact mode far better than Dreamers.) The dialogue is sparse, underwrought and unusually true to life; the teen banter is believably awkward and sometimes people respond to questions with “I don’t know” and the conversation just sort of ends. Combined with the deluge of dancing footage – which looks brilliant and beautiful for the most part – the Dreamers aesthetic is strong and soothing: dynamic movement punctuated by shots of shabby normalcy, like a Martin Parr photograph brought to life.View image in fullscreenDance rival … Demarkus Marks as Koby in Dreamers.Photograph: Channel 4Our protagonist – as much as there is one – is Puppy (Princess Nelia Mubaiwa), whose mother, Erica, runs the Chapeltown dance collective. Puppy is talented but shy, and unsure if she wants to become a professional dancer or has simply internalised her mum’s dreams. At first, it seems like the star of the collective is her funny yet self-obsessed friend Koby (Demarkus Marks). But it turns out he’s not much of a friend at all: as soon as Puppy also begins attracting the attention of scouts and choreographers, Koby gets very cross indeed.The above is pretty much the entire plot of Dreamers. Aside from Puppy and Koby’s rivalry (if you could even call it that; all Puppy tries to do is defuse the situation), there is only one other narrative thread – the plight of their fellow dancer Liam, whose letdown of a mum keeps leaving him to look after his younger sisters. If you thought the dance element might just be a backdrop for a heavier story about love or sex or drugs or social capital or anything else, you will be disappointed: this show is very much about dancing.View image in fullscreenThe Chapeltown dance collective in Dreamers.Photograph: Channel 4Sometimes, the subject is treated with compelling insiderishness – at a video shoot for theLeedsrapper Graft, Koby and Puppy are first praised then emotionally pummelled by the choreography team in an example of treatment that appears to be the industry standard – and the show is good at immersing the audience in a specific strata of the amateur dance world without overexplaining things. But that also means the stakes can be very vague. For most of the series, I was under the impression the collective had qualified for some kind of competition, but in the end we don’t even see the event, let alone find out its significance. Pretty much all plot developments are conveyed with that kind of understatement; there is nothing as crass as climactic revelation here. Only a lack of profundity or peril prevents Dreamers from resembling an impressionistic indie film.It’s not exactly boring. In fact, this is an easy show to binge, and the more I watch, the more I find myself drawn in by the languid vibe and Puppy’s steely sweetness. It’s also a treat to see a group of predominantly Black British characters living somewhere other than London (a special mention, too, for the addictively earwormy theme song from Leeds musicianNtantu). Yet, at times this makes you crave the ridiculously high-stakes plotting and comical caricatures of teen dramas past; for all its authenticity, I’m not sure there’s enough here to grab hold of the flighty attention spans of its target audience. Dreamers is a pleasingly low-key antidote to the worst excesses of its genre – yet it also has something to learn from its more ruthlessly entertaining peers.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionYoung peopleLeedsDancereviewsShareReuse this content"

It took falling for someone in the sober light of day to realise what love wasAnna BeecherSun 30 Mar 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 06.30 EDTShareI first got drunk at 13 in the upstairs room of a cheap Italian restaurant, sip by sip on other people’s wine. I giggled as the floor lurched, telling my companions,It’s like being on a boat.I first got paralytic at 13, a few months on. Remembering the pleasant, silly sensation I’d experienced, I went to a party and drank a pint of gin. Slipping in and out of consciousness, I was vaguely aware of piss seeping through my trousers and the kids around me debating whether or not to call an ambulance.By 14, I drank vodka, never gin. A friend and I would slip into a secret space behind a church at the end of my road with a bottle, then let the spirit travel down our throats, sharp and straight as a blade. Then we’d run, feral and clumsy, down one steep hill and up another to meet the rest of our crowd, the running magically easy, our lungs so much stronger than when we were sober.We would stand around the swings where we had flown as children, sailing out beyond our bodies for one suspended moment before we fell back into our bones. We drank to exit childhood and to hold on to it, to slip out of our terrible self-consciousness and play a little longer in the park. Night over us, we stumbled through that other gateway into adulthood, the one marked: sex. There were drunk kisses. The bravery to lean towards another person, to try for contact. The blot of shame when it wasn’t reciprocated blurred away by the next morning’s headache. There was drunk touch and drunk sex – was there any other type of sex to be had?There was drunk touch and drunk sex – was there any other type of sex to be had?At 15, my body made a bolt for womanhood. Suddenly, grown men looked at me differently and I was the one sent into the off-licence. Subtle knots formed in me between freedom and danger, joy only to be granted with a loss of control, all the lovely, awful things that happened in the dark.There I am, drunk with my friends at the drained reservoir on the edge of town. Night has come and licked our shadows from the grass. We’re on a makeshift beach surrounded by woods. Through our talk and singing we begin to hear a sound in the dark: the steady beat of a drum. Our confusion becomes fear as the beat grows louder and louder, closer and closer, until we scream and scatter between the trees. And then there is young men’s laughter and the horror movie ends. Slipping out from our hiding places, we find the boys from the year above, all beauty and menace. And what pleasure there was in being chosen to be menaced, the warm moment after the chill of fear.I hoped to be chosen. And to escape the exposure of making choices. Drink created a second self to blame if you did something embarrassing or prohibited and in this way you never had to account for your desire.There I am on holiday at 15, waking naked in a tent with a man in his 20s, the line of a sleeping-bag zip pressed into my skin, and only vague, swirling images of the night before.There I am inside the metal train in the children’s playground, drink erasing the world beyond us so this small, cold space feels private, a body on top of mine and me still new to this, bunching my top in my hands against the pain.There I am, the lovely dark nipple of another girl in my mouth, in love but never naming it, falling asleep with our legs interlocked.When I moved to London at 16, the friends I found there sometimes shared a bottle of cheap pink wine, but it was not the urgent, obliterative sort of drinking I had gone along with before. What a relief. Yet our sexuality still shone brightest when we ordered Smirnoff Ices in tawdry nightclubs, pulling the disguise of confidence over our faces, hoping not to be IDed. I look back and cringe and love us for all those nights spent at Soho gay bars, grinding on each other with awkward exuberance to the sound of Britney Spears.Then I was an adult, being photographed by my dad on my 18th birthday buying my first legal pint.Around this time,I broke up with my first boyfriend and he drank an entire bottle of Cointreau and stained my parents’ sofa with orange vomit. What an idiot, I thought. But I understood the romance in the impulse to make things loose and grand – cinematic, rather than just sad.I knew I wasn’ta drinker; my life wasn’t bound to the rhythm of big nights and rough mornings and two beers were often enough to send me to sleep. But I did fall in love with a drinker. Our first date was in a wood-panelled pub, the chatter rising around us so we had to lean in closer to hear each other’s voices. I remember seeing my face in the scratched mirror in the toilets, that moment of confirmation –Girl, you are drunk– before we ducked out for cigarettes, then kissed for the first time on the pavement.He bought beers at Waterloo station afterwards and said, “Carling, darling?” as he pulled me a can from the six-pack. I stayed with him for seven years.Throughout our relationship, Carling Darling would disappear. Once we lived together, he would occasionally leave our flat on a Friday and not return until late on Sunday night, blank and twitchy, smelling vinegary with booze and stale sweat, his phone long dead. All our holidays were marked by his absences. He’d stay out,just for one more, and I would lie awake as the hours unfurled in a hostel in some warmer part of the world, thinking, I hope he is alive. Compared to him, I barely drank at all.And yet, at 26, when I walked into a party and saw someone else, it was intoxication, the pink glow of it, the feeling of slipping from my usual skin, that allowed me to kiss that stranger, a dark-haired man from Streatham Common. I became besotted with him: a word that once meant drunk and now means blindly adoring. Soon after that night, I left Carling Darling and our whole imagined shared future.View image in fullscreen‘People talk about drink taking the edge off, but I have also found it to sharpen things.’Photograph: Leah O’ConnellNewly single, I entered a second adolescence of sorts, another chance at exploration, want suddenly awake in me once more.There I am, the alcohol-scent of hairspray in a cloud about my face, perfume on my wrists, out to meet the man from Streatham Common, of course at a pub.And there I am, drinking whisky with a different stranger, a crackle of electricity when his knuckles graze the backs of my fingers.There I am at the Edinburgh Fringe, with a woman I have flirted with all year, bold enough at last to bring her back to my single bed at the end of a raucous night.Drink was a quieter companion now than it had been in my teens. Because I never ended the night vomiting over the side of a bridge, it never occurred to me that it was always there.People talk about drink taking the edge off, but I have also found it to sharpen things, making desire a bright-rimmed object one might reach out and grab.Yet there is sadness in this magic. Things happened that my sober self would not have wanted to happen. Once with a woman – in the toilets of a theatre, a wine glass smashing into the sink, a mouth on my body I did not ask for – and once with a man. Old enough to know better, I drank some luminous knock-off absinthe and woke with my head stormy and a friend in my bed. Gone, as if removed from my brain in a perfect orb with an ice-cream scoop, was the memory of how we had got there. That day I sobbed to my mum like a child.But this is the cliché of mixing sex and alcohol: girl gets too drunk; regrets.The loneliest moments,I think, are the ones that, in a 3am sort of way, seem to be something like love. The New Year’s Eve when that man from Streatham Common with whom I had become so besotted arrived on my doorstep, his mouth at last full of “I love you.” I had ached to hear it. But in the morning he was in pain, hurt by the light that came in through my window, too nauseated to be touched. And he couldn’t remember a word he’d said.The night with another boyfriend when we came home from a party dressed as pirates, blasted doowop songs and yelled all theI Love Yous into each other’s faces. Like a fool, I mistook it for something really being said. But all he loved was waking the neighbours. When I realised this, my heart broke, again.It is not that situations augmented with alcohol aren’t real, it is that they come with get-out clauses: I don’t recall, I didn’t mean it. The old excuses of the second self.Situations augmented with alcohol come with get-out clauses: I don’t recall, I didn’t mean itIt is such an embarrassment, longing. I see it all clearly now. In my teens, as I yanked myself gracelessly out of childhood, alcohol freed and masked my desire. I could pretend that sex just happened to me; it was not a product of my own curiosity, my want. In my 20s, it offered me flashes of intimacy which felt like strange, blurry accidents: shadow tenderness that vanished when the light changed. The need to disguise my desire for sex had transformed into a need to disguise my desire for love.I never exactly decided to stop meeting lovers at parties or bars, possibility glinting along the edge of the phrase,Do you want another drink?I just stopped going out. I was tired. Men had disappointed me and with women I had disappointed myself, never been sure-footed enough.I snapped at my mother in the park when she said, “You just know when you meet the one.” Everyone who said that, I told her, had met their spouse by 25.Bored of love’s messy conclusions, I hid away for a summer, dog-sitting at a friend’s apartment.Six months before I had met a man called Luke at a Hanukkah party – a cold night in a crowded room, candles doubling in the rain-spattered windows. By chance, I discovered that he lived close to the dog’s owners, making us temporary neighbours. Somehow, we decided that he should come along on my next dog walk.It did not feel momentous to come out of the apartment on that first afternoon and see him waiting a little way down the street for us in a dip between hills. The dog strained on her leash and down we went to meet him. As we walked, we passed a burned-out house, tall and torn open, its blackened insides essentialised by fire. We looped streets and weedy alleyways, until the dog abruptly threw herself down on the ground, panting, refusing to move. And now the heavy symbol, which really was there: someone had painted a huge white love heart on the grass. Luke and I sat above it, talking with a rare kind of ease, which I should have taken note of.Still, the words from that afternoon in my notebook:It is interesting to make a completely platonic friend. We kept taking walks, just the two of us, after the dog’s owners returned. And without considering what it meant, I began to feel like I wanted to see him every day.View image in fullscreen‘Without considering what it meant, I began to feel like I wanted to see him every day’: Anna and Luke.Photograph: PRThe verbs of falling in love speak of a tricking sort of magic. We arebeguiledorcharmedorbesotted. I did not recognise this unfamiliar thing, this drawing closer unaided, no change in state but each other, the instinct to reach for his hand.One afternoon my housemate found me singing and joyfully leaping about in our living room as I waited for Luke to arrive to take me swimming in a pool in the woods. Anna, if this isn’t a date, she asked, why are you so excited? That night, sitting beside a stream, Luke and I kissed for the first time. Because we were sober, we did not crash together. My excitement did not feel laced with confusion or threat. I had always thought of flirting as the casting of a spell, a sequence of gestures, phrases and tricks, to make one’s dull self momentarily gorgeous. By this definition we had not been flirting. And yet, something between us had become undeniable. We moved through the gateway of our first kiss, slightly awkwardly, at least one of us with bad breath.I did not know that I was falling in love with Luke until it had already, irrevocably happened, altering forever the course of my life. After that kiss, we could not easily turn back. Whatever came next, the moment could not be cleared away – I don’t remember, I didn’t mean it – like bottles at the end of a night.There can be beauty in intoxication, revelling, human and ancient, slipping out of the daily self and staggering a little against the spin of the Earth. But beautiful, too, is reality. A first kiss after a swim in cold water. Senses sharp and the skin singing, utterly awake.We All Come Home Alive by Anna Beecher is published by Weidenfeld & Nicolson at £20.

James is a young-looking 10 in knee-length shorts decorated with stars. Ian Hunter of 1970s rock band Mott the Hoople stands beside him, a hand gently around his shoulder. “Sixty-nine years separate them,” Harris writes. “Here is proof of how songs and their creators find fans in the most unlikely of places.”Maybe I’m Amazedis the story of a growing child’s love of music, but it’s more than that: it’s also about how songs provided a whole world for James, and his family, after his autism diagnosis. It marks a departure for Harris, whose previous journalism, aside from his political work for theGuardian, has involved editing magazines and writing columns, reviews and other books about music.Books exploring personal connections to music have boomed in recent years (I’m primed to notice, having written a music memoir myself,The Sound of Being Human, in 2022). Like mine and many others, Harris’s is structured around a playlist, but this skeleton (of James’s favourite songs) only provides a loose frame. The book is more of an outlet for a father navigating an unexpected relationship with his child, in which music brings a welcome means of communication, cohesion and comfort.View image in fullscreenJohn and James Harris in their Sgt Pepper suits.Photograph: Pal Hansen/The GuardianHarris writes movingly about his son’s early years, in which music was ever-present, partly because of his parents’ enthusiasms (Harris points out that his first gig was Level 42 aged 13, while James’s was Chuck Berry at Camp Bestival just before he was two; Harris’s wife, Ginny, also works in the music business). Harris notices how intensely James responds to songs from this age, loving his dad playing cyclical chord sequences on his guitar, hammering rhythms along to them in perfect time on his tiny toy piano. Elsewhere, he is often quiet and withdrawn, and repeats streams of words, a common characteristic of autism, known as echolalia.James’s diagnosis comes before he turns three. You feel for Harris as he theorises why certain music moves his son, as he can’t do it himself: “In a lot of the Beatles’s early music, there is an irresistible optimism, everything seemingly going at 100 miles an hour, thanks to an energy that the music could barely contain.” His early chapters read like a cathartic outpouring about the hurdles and obstacles his family has had to face, but his forays into neuroscience get deeper by the page, which is where this book’s real power lies.Harris is brave enough to consider the issues of neurodiversity and the music-loving brain in accessible ways. After noting Mozart’s many early prodigious achievements, he writes: “Whether any of this allows anyone to definitely say he was autistic is a question that probably answers itself … [but] “his talent clearly came with a sharp sense of difference and his brief life was lived outside all kinds of norms and conventions”.We’re reminded of how music cuts through the chaotic, noisy distractions of everyday life for those with autism spectrum disorderIn other examples of behaviours that it’s possible to see on the autism spectrum – although Harris is at pains to not impose labels on anyone –we’re told how Mariah Carey and Elton John played piano pieces by ear aged three, and a line from Nick Drake’s Hazey Jane II speaks volumes about that artist’s own struggles (“If songs were lines in a conversation/ The situation would be fine”). Harris also recalls how his father-in-law, a BBC recording engineer, once sat in on a Beatles interview. His main memory was of John Lennon sitting in a corner, ordering a Rolls-Royce from a car dealer, painstakingly listing his precise specifications.A2011Guardianprofile of psychiatrist Lorna Wing, who defined the idea of the autism spectrum, is also quoted; she believed autistic traits were required “for real success” in the arts. This idea lingers in passages about inherited traits between generations, and Harris recognises his own obsessions in his son’s genetic makeup. This also introduces some funny moments, when he looks back at his own younger years: “When I was 13, a kid at school wrote an elegantly mocking poem about our class, which contained the line ‘Harris brings in another tape’.”There are arresting moments throughout too. We’re reminded of how music cuts through the chaotic, noisy distractions of everyday life for those with autism spectrum disorder, and Harris recounts the tragic death in an NHS care unit ofConnor Sparrowhawk, an autistic 18-year-old obsessed with David Bowie and the Beatles, as he wonders what support there will be for his child, who will soon be an adult.“Autistic people are part of a neurological family that includes millions of other human beings,” he reminds us. His book also underlines for us how music, in so many magical ways, can powerfully bring very different people together.Maybe I’m Amazed: A Story of Love and Connection in 10 Songsby John Harris is published by John Murray Press (£16.99).

As part of the agreement, each model would be able book her twin on shoots for other brands – meaning they could, in image anyway, be in two places at the same time. Speaking to The Business of Fashion, Gvarliani described her replica as “like me, without the jet-lag”. Images of AI and human, side by side, look scarily lifelike.The news has been greeted with dismay by the wider industry, which fears this could be the start of a shift. It mirrors the concerns of Hollywood workers whowent on strike in 2023over the use of AI in film and TV. This is not the first time a major fashion company has explored AI models –Levisand Hugo Boss have also experimented with the technology.Bectu, the union that represents the creative industries, explained the concerns. “Even if models are compensated for the use of their image, it is hard to see how using technology will not have a significant detriment to other fashion creatives and industry workers, from make-up and hair, to rigging and lights,” said the head of the union, Philippa Childs. A survey found that 54% of Bectu workers believed AI would have a negative impact on the fashion industry.Those advocating for models have also raised concerns. Sara Ziff, the founder of Model Alliance, says: “There are a lot of open questions, and one of them is about compensation. What does fair compensation for a digital twin look like?” H&M has said each model would be paid when their twin was used, with the fee negotiated with their agency.In 2020, the model and founder of technology education company WAYE, Sinead Bovell, wrote an article in Vogue titled‘I Am a Model and I Know That Artificial Intelligence Will Eventually Take My Job’. She raises the issue of the lack of regulation. “If a model gives their consent to use their likeness somewhere, it can enhance the actual AI model, the data centre that the company uses, which could accelerate automation,” she says. “There’s all these nuanced ways that models may get even more exploited.”Guard rails are being built. The Model Alliance’sFashion Workers’ Actcomes into law in June – a piece of legislation which requires consent from models for AI usage, when working with agencies based in the state. “It couldn’t be more timely,” says Ziff. “With H&M’s announcement, it gives a lot of other industry players licence to move forward in a way that could be very reckless and damaging.”In addition to this, the AI Actwill be introduced in the EU in 2026, requiring AI images to be labelled as such (H&M said it would use a watermark on images featuring AI).Ziff is clear that she is not “anti-tech” and there are big players in fashion who have embraced advances in technology.The former Harpers Bazaar editor Lucy Yeomans founded Drest in 2019, a game that allows players to dress up avatars in designer brands. However, the use of AI is limited. “It would be lovely if AI could create all the looks,” says Yeomans, “but if JW Anderson decides he is going to put a belt halfway down the skirt, AI says: ‘Belts don’t go halfway down skirts’.”High-profile models such as Sjöberg and Gvarliani will likely be compensated well – casting agent Chloe Rosolek estimates they would be paid “millions” – but AI is likely to directly threaten models who more typically feature in e-commerce shoots that showcase products on brands’ websites. “Most models have had to deal with job loss already and this is a whole other frightening thing for them,” says Rosolek.Ingo Nolden, who is Gvarliani’s agent in Germany, agrees: “There is the erosion of human work especially at the entry level,” he says. He had negotiated a deal for an AI version of a model he works with in 2023, only to back out “because I felt it was giving the licence out to a third party I have no control of”.Lalaland AI creates AI models, and has clients including Zalando and Levis. Michael Musandu, the founder, says the technology allows consumers to see a more diverse “casting” when they look at a website. “As a person of colour, I never got to see models that represented this diversity or inclusion perspective,” he says.He argues the amount of shoots that big brands produce means it would be difficult to implement this change using real models.AI is not always a tool for inclusivity, of course – in 2023, Shereen Wu, a Taiwanese-American modelposted on social mediathat her image had been changed so she looked white.While Musandu says criticism of AI models is “warranted”, he downplays its impact. “Brands are going to continue to use real models,” he says. “This is supplementing … there is a cost-saving element, you can produce this content at a much more affordable price.”Rosolek describes H&M’s AI shoots as “another capitalistic approach to cut people, to cut their costs and increase their profits”. Profit may be on the company’s mind. In financial results for the first quarter of 2025, they missed expected growth, withReuters describingits start to the year as “sluggish”.An H&M spokesperson responded to concerns with the following statement: “While we understand that this will spark opinions, discussions, and uncertainty, we are humble in acknowledging that we do not hold all the answers at this point.“We will continue to explore with other creatives within the industry to see what generative AI can bring to any creative process, while ensuring we maintain our human-centric approach.”Rosolek hopes the development “is a massive flop” with consumers. “Models make an image incredible and I don’t think that can be replicated through AI,” she says.Yeomans agrees. “If you think of someone like [photographer] Steven Meisel, he was always discovering that next model, and everyone would ask, ‘Oh my gosh, is that beautiful?’ ‘Oh yes, it is beautiful’,” she says. “I’m not sure whether AI will be able to look around the corner and predict what might be next.”Explore more on these topicsModelsArtificial intelligence (AI)H&MfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is there anything I could do to soothe her? I consulted the expertsDaniel LavelleSun 30 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTShareMy cat Lucy, a blue Burmese, is the fluffiest, most adorable little feline in the world. She’s also the cattiest of all cats, an ill-tempered spawn of the underworld who takes arbitrary swipes at my other cats for having the temerity to exist.Lucy recently had a litter of three kittens. I don’t have kids of my own, but while helping with raising Lucy’s offspring, I have since realised the high stakes of shaping young minds – and how different siblings can be. Lucy’s kittens may have come from the same womb and suckled from the same teats in the same basket, but they have markedly different personalities: one of them is chilled and curious, another chases anything that moves and the third is skittish in the extreme.After a few weeks, however, they all embody Lucy’s dark side. The kittens have opened their eyes and have just enough strength to stagger about, so I pick them up to inspect them. Immediately, their claws spring out, and they hiss and spit like angry snakes until Lucy emerges from her basket, staring me down until I hand her them back to her. I get it. If a giant suddenly plucked me from my bed at night and started talking to me in a creepy baby voice, I’d be a bit spitty, too.View image in fullscreen‘The most adorable little feline in the world and the cattiest of all cats’ … Lucy.Photograph: Courtesy of Danny LavelleHowever, as these kittens need their forever homes, my job in the coming weeks is to gradually acclimatise them to humans. But is it possible to train a cat – of any age – to be sociable, less angry and generally happier in the presence of humans?Dr Saho Takagi of Kyoto University in Japan has published several studies into cat behaviour. She says it is “important for kittens to have as much contact with people as possible during their socialisation period”, which is up to seven weeks of age. “If the kitten is young, you can probably build a bond by repeatedly offering food.” She is right. Two of the three kittens come around once they realise I am serving a better menu than their mother (Dreamies treats, mainly).Also, it has been eight weeks, and Lucy is now completely over motherhood. She went from Mother Teresa to Miss Trunchbull overnight, treating her progeny like any other cat unlucky enough to be in her vicinity, with a deep growl and a swift swipe. After this rejection, the kittens are on the road to becoming more human-friendly. But one kitten has remained skittish.A fluffy boy, who I decided to call Split because that’s what he does whenever I’m around, will not get close to me.View image in fullscreen‘I have no idea what made him so jumpy’ … Split.Photograph: Courtesy of Danny LavelleAt feeding time Split hides until he is confident it’s only him and his siblings in the area, then he tentatively approaches his bowl, eyes whizzing around as if looking out for an eagle that might swoop down. I’ve tried everything with Split: creepy baby voice, normal human voice, Dalek voice, prolonged eye contact, no eye contact, hugs, pats, kisses, soft toys, hard toys, string, laser pen, titbits, cat nip, talk therapy, aversion therapy, music, muzak, silence, disco, balls, baubles, buttons and bits of bacon; nothing has worked.One frosty morning, I pick him up while he is snoozing next to the radiator. I hold on to him, lightly stroking his forehead until he stops wriggling, scratching and biting. Half an hour later, I slowly release him from my bloody hands, optimistic he will stay put because I’ve doused him with enough love to teach him he can trust me, but split is what he does.I’m worried he may be like this forever unless I help him. I call Lucy Hoile, who has been a cat behaviourist for 15 years. Her interest in the subject began as a hobby and blossomed into a full-time job as more and more people needed her advice. I tell Hoile all about Split, his nervousness compared to his chilled siblings, and my failed attempts to put him at ease. Hoile says that the period between the ages of two and eight weeks are crucial in a kitten’s development. “If something significant happens during that window – such as someone accidentally stepping on their tail or dropping a frying pan near them, they might become fearful of noises and wary of people. That one experience will be enough to shape their behaviour for the rest of their life.”I have no idea what made Split so jumpy. Hoile explains that he is not a lost cause, but I must let him take the lead. “Everything has to be on their terms. If you approach them, you’ll probably find that they will run and hide. So, what he needs is someone to sit with him and just spend lots of time with him in a really calm and gentle way.”View image in fullscreenA cuddly companion?Photograph: Piter Lenk/AlamyHoile adds that this quiet, calm and gentle approach applies to nervous adult cats, too. The only difference is that if you manage to help a kitten get used to humans during their first eight-to-nine weeks, then they’re usually set for life: “Whereas with an adult, if they are already nervous about people and didn’t have those nice experiences with people before eight to nine weeks, taming them tends to happen on an individual basis – they will trust that one person who takes the time to build a relationship with them, but it won’t mean they are happy with all people.”I think this is where I have been going wrong. My approach amounted to dangling string in front of Split’s face, waiting for him to get close enough to pet and then spooking him with my descending hand.According to Anita Kelsey, cat behaviourist and author of Claws: Confessions of a Professional Cat Groomer, patience is key. Instead of getting in its face, build up trust over time. “Not all cats are naturally confident and affectionate lap cats. Some are naturally more timid and that’s OK. The best approach is to lower your expectations, respect their fears and allow them to retreat when they feel the need.”Following Kelsey and Hoile’s advice to take a more equanimous approach to taming Split, one morning, I sit on my kitchen floor with a book and a bag of treats. Sure enough, Lucy and Rupert, her more outgoing kitten, approach and stare expectantly at me. Split hides behind a chair leg.I turn a few pages of my book and dole out treats to Lucy and Rupert as they approach. Split licks his lips from behind the chair. I know he wants a treat, all he needs is the courage to come and get one. I carry on reading and Split is on the move – beginning a circuitous route under the dining table towards the treats in my lap. He is a foot away. The closest he has ever voluntarily been. I avoid eye contact. After dropping a few treats in front of him, which he gobbles up greedily, I test to see if he will take one from my hand. He is nervous, but I can see temptation getting the better of him. Suddenly, he lunges and plucks the treat from my thumb and forefinger. Over the next week, I have more treat sessions with him like this. Split is now nuzzling my hand and purring.View image in fullscreenDoes the nuzzling have an ulterior motive?Photograph: IvanJekic/Getty ImagesIs it all about food in the end? “Food can be a useful tool in building trust, but it shouldn’t be the only approach,” says Kelsey. “Other positive reinforcements, such as toys and catnip, can also help. The best thing you can do is sit quietly and let your cat come to you without expecting anything in return.”But isn’t that the point of having a pet? You feed and shelter them and get to stroke their adorable heads in return? I worry that none of my cats love me, that all the nuzzling, sitting in my lap and purring has an ulterior motive: food.“No, it’s definitely love and affection,” reassures Hoile. “They normally get positive attention from you when they’re in your lap. And it is love when it comes down to it, to be fair. If they want food from you, normally, they’ll be meowing. They’ll be rubbing around your ankles and it’s more active.”It’s time for Split to split for good, as a family has agreed to adopt him. He still hates being held and remains suspicious of giants, so I don’t know if he will ever become a lap cat, but that’s OK. Some people just don’t like being touched, and apparently, cats are of the same disposition. “True hope lies in appreciating your cat as they are, allowing them space and time to grow, and accepting them even if they never become the cuddly companion you might have envisioned,” says Kelsey. Maybe cat owners just have to come to terms with this. For some, your relationship with your little fur ball will always be at arm’s length.

We saw a lot of images [from the game] that were not in our standard, nowhere near. There are minimum requirements that we have to show, respect for your mate, you have to make the effort. And today we did it.“This season we have played more games like the one against Bournemouth, which is why we have not deserved more. The most important thing today was that the players have learned the lesson.“I told them we cannot accept a performance like the one here in the league when people have travelled down for five hours. What we missed this season was heart, soul; the desire from how we’d done it for many, many years. For a manager the most important thing is to recover this passion. After Bournemouth, we started to make incredible mistakes and as a team we didn’t have heart. That’s the most important thing we have to recover at the end of the season and in the future.”Guardiola was asked why the heart had been missing during what has been the toughest season of his nine at City. “I will write it in my memoirs,” he said. “It was many things. Not just one. And put Pep first on the list. I should have taken decisions I didn’t take in the right moment.“I adore to play like today. If Bournemouth go through, congratulations. But I like to lose this way and we didn’t lose many times this way. A few weeks agoat Nottingham Forest[in the 1-0 league defeat], did the team play like today? No. Hopefully at the end [of the season] we can change, learn and prepare for next season.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Poundbakery doesn’t do butter pie, but try Greenhalgh’s on the corner. Greenhalgh’s: closed on Sundays. The chip shop on Market Street does meat pie, meat and potato, steak, steak and kidney, chicken and mushroom, cheese and onion. Butter pie? A shake of the head.You’ve got to try the butter pie. That’s what everyone says the first time you visit Preston. It was created in industrial times, for the largely Catholic working population to eat on Fridays when meat was forbidden. Often you hear it described as a “delicacy”, but even this is to overstate its intensely yeoman nature. It’s layers of potatoes, onions and butter in a pie. It’s cheap. It’s hearty. It’s unpretentious. It exists to be consumed and then immediately forgotten. It is – with deepest apologies – the very embodiment ofPreston North Endin comestible form.Marcus Rashford ends drought as Aston Villa sink Preston to reach semi-finalsRead moreAre Preston really the most boring club in the Football League, as a fan group dubbed them earlier this season? Let’s examine the evidence. Nine consecutive seasons of mid-table finishes: tick. Drawn 45% of their league games this season: tick. Sponsored by a local rubber company: tick. Managed by Paul Heckingbottom: tick. Signature snack entirely comprising yellow and beige foodstuffs: tick.What Preston do better than anyone else is nostalgia. The world’s oldest continually used football stadium. The record win in English football. The first winners of the Double. The first Invincibles. Bill Shankly, Tom Finney, Alan Kelly, David Moyes. The same old facts, the same old tales, regurgitated ad infinitum. And in this context, reaching an FA Cup quarter-final againstAston Villaranks as comfortably the most interesting thing to have happened to Preston in years.Of course it should be patently obvious to everyone that Preston are not actually going to win this quarter-final and get to Wembley. That would be too interesting by far. What happens instead is that Heckingbottom sends a depleted Preston out in a cagey spoiling formation, Villa are frustrated for almost an hour and then score three goals with the minimum of fuss.View image in fullscreenPaul Heckingbottom seems the ideal manager for Preston.Photograph: Dave Howarth/CameraSport/Getty ImagesThe first 20 minutes essentially consist of players trying to pop balloons with their studs. Marcus Rashford keeps trying to score from free-kicks. Marco Asensio keeps trying to score from corners. Preston sit in a kind of rugged 5‑1‑4‑0. Then, after being frustrated for almost an hour, Preston submit without ever quite subsiding. Rashford pillages a couple. Jacob Ramsey makes sure.Briefly an embarrassing rout is on the cards. But of course this too would also be unsustainably interesting. Not for nothing are Preston one of only two teams in the top four divisions to have neither scored nor conceded more than three goals in the league this season. (Sheffield United, another Heckingbottom masterpiece, are the other.) Stuffed with competent but never spectacular players, they carry on running and fighting without ever remotely threatening.Ollie Watkins misses an elementary chance. The Villa fans toss a giant inflatable penis around the Bill Shankly Stand. Coming soon for them: Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Next for Preston: Derby in midweek, and the eight games that will define whether they finish in the top half, drop into the bottom six, or – and here’s the smart money – finish about where they are.The temptation here is to chide Preston for their apparent lack of ambition, their allergy to jeopardy, their refusal to spend stupid money, or go into administration for the bantz, or take their long-suffering fans on “a journey”, or appoint some 34-year-old Basque with a soul patch to impose a whole new footballing identity.

Preston will not provide an American hedge fund with an inflation-busting return on investment. They will not generate Hollywood content or Wembley showpieces. They are neither good nor bad. But they provide thousands of people with a ritual and routine. It’s cheap, it’s hearty, it’s local and it’s real. Will the market allow something this radical to survive?Finally, after hours of fruitless trekking, in a chip shop just off Friargate, amid a forest of bubble tea emporia and fried chicken joints, a butter pie is located, ordered and proffered. It costs £2.90. The pastry gives way just a little too easily. The filling oozes without conviction. It looks beige, smells beige and tastes beige. It is neither good nor bad. But we should all be heartened that it still exists.Explore more on these topicsFA CupPreston North EndAston VillaanalysisShareReuse this content"

There could have been as many as 11 points between Leicester and Saracens here come full time and, with Mark McCall’s side without a league victory since 4 January, it was not an exaggeration to suggest their season was on the line.Defeat would have not made it mathematically impossible to reach the playoffs, but statistically improbable. When the pressure was at its highest,Saracenssurvived to claim a victory that not only shapes their season but perhaps influences the fate of several other teams, including the side they defeated in the spring sunshine.Rugby union rebels Ealing left in limbo with Premiership door still shutRead moreThere are now five teams separated by just four points with five rounds to go:Leicester, Gloucester, Sale, Saracens and Harlequins are now all within a victory of one another. But it could have easily been so different had the Tigers held their nerve.The game’s decisive moment – and one that could have huge ramifications on it all come May – was an error by the home side.Leicester’s lineout had been poor all afternoon and when Julián Montoya’s throw sailed over everyone and, with the aid of some disruption from the outstanding Maro Itoje, into the hands of Theo Dan to give him a free run to the line, the whole complexion of both the Tigers’ and Saracens’ seasons shifted. Until that point, Leicester had seemed more likely to win but one thing McCall’s team have historically shown is that if you give them a chance they cannot be written off.Dan’s try gave the visitors a seven‑point advantage and, despite some nervy moments late on, they held on for victory. Ultimately, they found a way and the reactions at full time from their players underlined how significant a day this was. They knew what the consequences were if they slipped up at this juncture. But after the disappointment of a “home”defeat by Harlequinsat Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last week, they held their nerve.“We felt like a team again, and that’s the feeling we want to chase all year,” McCall said. “We had to do a lot of defending but we did it with huge energy and we found a way. We’re back in the fight.”View image in fullscreenAngus Hall’s one-handed finish levels the game.Photograph: David Davies/PALeicester will look back on this as a missed opportunity. After falling behind to early tries from Jamie George and Juan Martín González, they responded magnificently before that late mistake.Their early pressure initially came to little but you always felt the Tigers would score points at some stage. That proved to be the case when Freddie Steward finished a fine move, before Handré Pollard and Alex Lozowski – who left the field late on with an ankle problem – exchanged drop goals. That made it 17-10 to the visitors but two tries in three minutes either side of half-time firmly swung the contest on its head.They were both scored by Hanro Liebenberg; his first coming in added time at the end of the first half before Sarries inexplicably turned over possession close to their own line shortly after the restart. That gave Leicester the platform to work it left and allow the South African the space to finish well. Pollard missed the first conversion attempt but nailed the second and suddenly Leicester were 22-17 ahead.Given how below-par McCall’s team have been of late, not least last week, you wondered if their early sluggishness in the second half was a hint towards another disappointing outcome looming on the horizon. But instead of crumbling under the pressure, Saracens thrived. Spearheaded by another imperious display from Itoje, who is due a well-earned rest in the coming weeks, Sarries responded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was third time lucky for the 22-year-old, who won bronze at the event in 2021 and silver in 2023.“I feel amazing, I’m world champion,” Atkin said. “I’m going to go celebrate, I’m going to eat all the Swiss chocolate I have in my bedroom. I’m going to have a drink out on the patio. I’m just so excited.”Atkin fell at the end of her first run, which landed her in ninth place, and she was well behind China’s Li Fanghui, who took the early lead with a score of 90.25 points. But Atkin rebuffed the disappointment and her phenomenal second and final attempt, which contained the highest altitude of the day, landed her a 93.50.Fear and Gibson claim emotional bronze to end Britain’s 31-year medal droughtRead moreThe score was surely going to be enough to put her on the podium but Atkin was made to wait to see what colour medal she would be taking home. The fight for gold came down to the Briton and Li, the two top skiers this season. Li, also 22, fell agonisingly short, receiving a 93.00 to finish 0.5 behind Atkin. Canada’s Cassie Sharpe took bronze with a score of 88.00.“I was so nervous going into my second run,” Atkin said. “So to be able to put it down when the pressure was on felt so good, and to come back after I got third at my first world championship and second at my second championship, it just feels so good.“This season I was like: ‘You know what? I want to go for the gold.’ So I put a lot of work in this season to try my new trick in there.”Earlier this month Atkin and Li shared the overall freeski halfpipe World Cup after both claimed one win, two second-place finishes and a fifth place during the season.

It drives standards’Taha HashimOpening batter on playing his shots and a star-studded team pushing for a fourth successive County Championship titleSun 30 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 07.52 EDTShareYou can sort through all sorts of numbers when discussing Surrey’s recent hold on theCounty Championship. There is the obvious one: three consecutive titles, a feat that had not been accomplished since Yorkshire’s run in the late-1960s. They have lost just one match at home across those three seasons, and the numbers on the accounts are pretty, too – though that is no guarantee of on-field success. But this one works best: of the 26 players they used in the championship last season, 16 have international caps, 13 with Test pedigree.Dom Sibley watches the rotating cast come and go, be it the England red-ball lot who start their summers in south London or the Indian Premier League crew who return for its end. Sibley and Rory Burns were the only two ever-presents in Surrey’s 2024 campaign, their opening partnership, previously seen with England, kicking off a county batting lineup featuring Ollie Pope, Jamie Smith and Dan Lawrence.“It’s an unbelievable side,” says Sibley. “You look around the dressing room, I don’t know how many international players we have in the squad.It drives the standards up and keeps everyone wanting to push harder.When you’re training with guys who are high quality, the young lads get up to that level quicker.”Yorkshire’s fresh start: ‘It will be tough, but we’ve got everything in place’Read moreThere is a template to how they have done it in the last few years. A well-rotated, high-quality group of quicks get to work on a lively home surface, with no real need for a specialist spinner – despite the head coach being the former England off-spinner Gareth Batty.“They’re not quite the same as the Oval pitches back in the day,”says Sibley. “But I’m happy to sacrifice a few runs off the average as long as we keep winning.”Daniel Worrall, once of Australia and potentially England’s soon, is out in front with the ball, 52 wickets last year at 16.15, and clearly in possession of Test attributes. “He can bowl quick when he wants to,” says Sibley, who has watched closely from the slip cordon. “He can go through the gears, he can swing it. Even when the pitches are flat and the Kookaburra’s come out, he’s been a point of difference at times.”Jordan Clark is their uncapped and vital all-rounder. “The fact he takes the new ball for us when we’ve got lads that play for England just shows how much of a high regard people hold him in here.”Then there is Sibley himself, four years approaching since his last Test appearance but with his game undergoing a bit of a rebrand. The scrutiny of international cricket got to him by the end of his two-year stint with England, both mind and method worked over. He has been solid since making the switch back to his boyhood county from Warwickshire before the 2023 season, averaging 41.5 in the championship over two years, with three hundreds in 2024.However, while known for his patience in the middle – and at times, judged harshly for it – Sibley is now giving it more of a whack, his presence in Surrey’s Blast team last summer ending a four-year absence from Twenty20 cricket. His first-class strike rate last year was 47, not electric but still a 10-point jump on the previous season.View image in fullscreenSurrey’s Rory Burns holds the County Championship trophy at a pre-season photo shoot.Photograph: John Walton/PA“Last year, when I came back in the nets, I was like: ‘I’m just going to play shots,’” Sibley says.“‘I want to just have fun, try and enjoy it more.’Having that bravery to be a bit more expansive in the nets and then keep being persistent with it has helped. Luckily that led to getting into the T20 team.”His match-winning 67 in the Blast quarter-final win over Durham was followed by a 36-ball 48 in the semi-final defeat by Somerset. Cue an opportunity in January with Khulna Tigers in the Bangladesh Premier League. An eight-ball three on debut was quickly followed by an injury in training to end Sibley’s tournament, but he clearly wants to have a proper go at the short-form world and to change perceptions around his game.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When I played against Durham, my mates were sending me tweets, people saying that they’re serving hallucinogenic beers because I reverse-scooped someone for six.”Sonny Baker: ‘I want to be the guy where people are coming out of the bar to watch you bowl’Read moreThis liberated version of Sibley isn’t because England want aggression, it’s a response to where things were, a desire to enjoy time out in the middle. “I wouldn’t say the England environment has made me change my game,” he says. “I just needed to change it because it was not going well.”When asked about international aspirations, he replies:“It’s not something I pine for, but at the same time it would be great to get another opportunity. But I wouldn’t say that I’m desperate for it. Just as much as doing that, I’d love to play in the leagues around the world.”The red-ball expert wants the white-ball high – that’s just how the game works now.The championship will have to be Sibley’s focus for the next little while. Surrey’s season begins at Chelmsford on Friday, a fourth title in succession not at all unfeasible. Alec Stewart is no longer director of men’s cricket but is still surveying his empire in a stripped-back advisory role. Matt Fisher, from Yorkshire, and New Zealand’s Nathan Smith are fresh additions to the pace group, while you would expect Lawrence and Ben Foakes – both recent omissions from the England Test team – to play significant roles. Then there is Sibley, who may well thump a few through the covers.Explore more on these topicsSurreyThe ObserverCounty ChampionshipCounty Championship Division OneCricketinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Fabio Di Giannantonio of VR46 Racing tried to catch up to Álex but ran out of laps as he finished third to give Ducati another clean sweep of the podium.“I’m super happy, I’m already without (my) voice, I screamed out loud,” Bagnaia said after he had a celebratory hotdog in the paddock. “What a fantastic feeling, to be back on the top step of the podium after such a difficult period.”Even before the race began, there was chaos when the sun briefly came out and riders who had opted for wet tyres sprinted back to the pits to swap their bikes, opting for slicks on a drying track, leading to a red flag. When the 19-lap race got under way, Marc Márquez had a perfect launch off the line and established a lead of over a second by the end of the opening lap. Bagnaia had been finishing behind the Márquez brothers in previous races and sprints, and the Italian was determined to finish higher, using Álex’s slipstream to overtake the Gresini rider and take second place on lap four.Marc looked to be in cruise control as he set a race lap record but the Spaniard suddenly slid off the track on lap nine. Bagnaia grabbed the opportunity to close the gap to his teammate in the championship, extending his lead over Alex as the race wore on. Marc attempted to ride on without a foot peg and a screen but less than five laps later, he gave up and nursed his bike back into the pits to retire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Just ask KevinJohn HarrisThe anxiety and horror of these sweeping cuts are a matter of deliberate policy. How did the party of Bevan come to this?Sun 30 Mar 2025 08.01 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 10.06 EDTShareWhat has just happened, and where are we now? Three long weeks ago, the governmentbegan to announce all those cutsto disability and sickness benefits – aimed, they said, at saving£5bn by the end of this decade. Then, only hours before Rachel Reeves’s emergency financial “update”, the seemingly omnipotent Office for Budget Responsibility said that the clawbackswould total significantly less, which prompted the Treasury to notonly halve the money paidto new claimants of the incapacity benefit element of universal credit, but freeze its current levels until 2030. Cruelty had followed cruelty: by last Thursday, when it became clear that a record 4.5 million children in the UK are living in poverty, Oxfam was calling these moves “morally repugnant”.In some quarters, pundits and politicians have moved on from the controversy all this has caused, and are busy speculating about whether the chancellorwill soon have to put up taxes. But at the heart of our politics, there is now an inescapable certainty, which will flare up spectacularly when some of the cuts to benefits areput to a parliamentary vote: the fact that Reeves, Keir Starmer and their colleagues are set on immiserating millions of disabled people.The suffering their decisions are going to cause will materialise soon enough. For now, what the government has triggered is a huge outbreak of the kind of awful fear I heard first-hand last week, when I spoke to someone whose next official benefits assessment might send their family’s income plummeting.I was put in touch with Kevin by the disability charity Scope. He is 60 years old, and lives in the Croxteth area of Liverpool. In 1994, he was working in a factory that made rubber tubing, where he broke his back. He then found work in the hospitality trade, followed by a job recovering crashed cars, before a benign tumor was discovered in and around his spine, which cannot be removed. “I’ve got nerve compression on my spine,” he told me. “My left leg doesn’t work properly. I’m in pain 24 hours a day. I can’t stand up or sit down for more than five minutes.”He now receives what official speak calls the enhanced rate of the daily living component of personal independence payment (or Pip), which is about torise to £110.40 per week. When we first spoke, he said he was terrified that the government’s sudden drive to “tighten” eligibility could drop him to the lower rate of £73.90 – a loss of almost £160 a month. “That’d be a disaster for us,” he said. He already has to make ends meet by regularly borrowing money from relatives.View image in fullscreenProtest against welfare cuts in Westminster, London, 26 March 2025.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockIn fact, he has even more to worry about. His anxiety is focused on the scores awarded inludicrously bureaucratic Pip assessmentson the basis of such “descriptors” as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” or “needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to wash or bathe”. Before we had our second conversation, he had discovered that in thenew system, people will have to score a minimum of four points in one of the official categories to receive either rate of the daily living component. “I get threes and twos,” he told me. He is also worried about his 21-year-old autistic son – who also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy – and receives the enhanced rate of Pip, but may also not satisfy the new criteria. “I’m terrified,” he said. “My mental health is in the gutter. How do these people sleep at night?”In a town far from Whitehall, I saw how devastating Labour’s cuts will be. When will ministers wake up? | John HarrisRead moreWhat Kevin’s predicament most vividly highlights is something everybody well knows: that a lot of the new cuts drive is not about getting people into jobs, but rather the cold imperative to slash money from the so-called welfare budget so that Reeves can meet her fiscal rules. The same callousness is evident in plans tomake people under 22– such as Kevin’s son – completely ineligible for the incapacity benefit part of universal credit, paid to people who have very limited ability to work.To make things even more wretched, the Pip cuts may actually fly in the face of the employment drive the government insists it wants to pursue, by making it much harder for thesixth of Pip claimants who workto carry on doing so. “If you want to work, the government should support you, not stop you,”Starmer recently said. But tightening entitlements will hack away at the basic economic foundations that disabled people who can work need if they want to enter the labour market. In 15 years of social reporting, one certainty has hit me again and again: that penury and worry make people less likely to get a job, not more. This government is the latest to ignore that fact.And listen to all the mood music. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, compared the benefit changes to taking some of his children’s pocket money to push them into getting a Saturday job, beforeadmitting that what he said was “tactless”. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has endorsed the fashionable idea that mental illness is “overdiagnosed”. In the right company, that might be the subject of a nuanced and careful conversation, but from a senior minister in the midst of this political moment, it sounds more like a nasty justification for the cuts: an implied suggestion that it’s OK to take sickness and disability payments away from people, because they may not actually be as sick and disabled as they say.Meanwhile, a real crisis of public health – manifested in conditions such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and all the rest – festers away. So does a national emergency centred on a genuine epidemic of anxiety and depression, not to mention long Covid. To enduringly save money, the government could take the ambitious and strategic option of trying to turn these things around. It might also think hard about the deep social issues that keep people out of employment, and look at an idea recentlyfloated by the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham: turning jobcentres into “live well centres”, dedicated to practical help with debt and poor housing, and their effects on people’s health.Instead, we get what looks like the worst domestic policy decision made by any postwar Labour government. I wonder how many of the party’s MPs have recently cast their minds back to a rather different kind of thinking, and a book of essays written by that great Labour god, Aneurin Bevan. Published in 1952, it was titledIn Place of Fear, and its text was full of observations that sound discomfitingly relevant right now. “Financial anxiety in time of sickness,”wrote Bevan, “is a serious hindrance to recovery, apart from its unnecessary cruelty.” He was making the case for the NHS, but the same point applies to other parts of the welfare state.And now look: the people in charge of the party Bevan once served are sowing anxiety and horror as a matter of deliberate policy. Which brings us back to the first couple of questions, not so much in the sense of fiscal maths and parliamentary intrigue, but the bleak moral journeyLabourhas set out on: what just happened, and where are we now?John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

She is almost completely friendless in the media. Rightwing outlets blame the paucity of growth on higher business taxes while voices of the left decry reductions to incapacity benefits as balancing the books on the backs of the poor. The public mood is grim. The Opinium poll that is published today suggests that only half of those who voted Labour in 2024 think this government is handling the economy better than the Conservative one that the country evicted last July. Thinktank world reckons thatlast week’s spring statementwas a can-kicking exercise that leaves the fiscal position fragile and the government at the mercy of events. Planned reductions to welfare payments are generating asulphurous atmosphere among Labour backbenchersand this will not dissipate anytime soon. Implementing these cuts requires putting them into law. This means that horrified disability charities and other appalled groups will have many weeks to campaign against the legislation while venting their outrage at Labour parliamentarians. “This is not what Labour MPs came into politics to do,” says one of their number who would normally be counted as a loyalist.Can the chancellor survive so much opprobrium and opposition? Yes she can, so long as she still has a friend at Number 10. The opinion that matters to her most is that held by the prime minister. He may be no economist, but he will be the ultimate decider when, and if, her number is up. In the early 80s, Sir Geoffrey Howe had a much grimmer stretch of his chancellorship than she is enduring now, but he got through to the other side because his strategy had a fully paid-up subscriber in Margaret Thatcher. George Osborne’s humiliatingly awful“omnishambles” budgetin 2012 might have done for him had he not been best mates with David Cameron.The dynamic between the current duo is interesting. Cabinet colleagues generally portray their relationship as “rock solid”. There is certainly no sign of the festering resentments and bitter rivalries that disfigured dealings between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when those frenemies were the neighbours of Downing Street. On the other hand, the Starmer-Reeves pairing is not as chummy as Cameron-Osborne who were godfathers to each other’s children. It is worth noting that the relative statures of Sir Keir and Ms Reeves have shifted with time and circumstance. In the early phase of this government, it was she who radiated the power. The Treasury looked extremely dominant, while Number 10 was debilitated by theinternal strugglesbetween Sue Gray and Morgan McSweeney’s gang. Officials were surprised by how little and late the prime minister’s involvement was inlast October’s budget; they were even more startled that Sir Keir seemed content to almost entirely delegate economic policymaking to the chancellor. More recently, his star has been in the ascendant as have his priorities. While the chancellor has been besieged, the prime minister’s efforts to handle Donald Trump and give succour to Ukraine have drawn widespread plaudits.His ratingshave had a boost, albeit from a low base.Her unpopularity is perilously close to the depths plumbed by Kwasi Kwarteng during his calamitous stint at the TreasuryThey have maintained a front of unity for public consumption, but there have been disagreements behind the scenes. She was initially resistant to extra funding for defence. That contrasted with the prime minister who was quick to heed the argument that more had to be spent on the military in response to Trump’s return to the White House. Sir Keir has been very struck by surveys suggesting that global uncertainty is shooting up as a concern among voters. But this is about much more than polling. He regards it as a personal mission of the highest importance to persuade the US president to keep America bound into Nato’s security guarantees. He will be pleased if one of the things said about his prime ministership in years to come is that he played an essential role in ensuring the future of the Atlantic alliance. It was when she appreciated the strength of his feeling that the chancellor pivoted to a more accommodative position on defence spending. She has taken to talking up additional investment and jobs in defence manufacturing as a potential engine of prosperity. Once Labour’s growth ambitions were concentrated around becoming a “clean energy superpower”; now the chancellor wants to be a “defence industrial superpower”. Khaki is the new green.The Office for Budget Responsibility is increasingly controversial in Labour’s ranks where there is regret that the chancellor championed the legislation elevating the status and clout of the fiscal invigilators. TheOBR has cheered the governmentby judging that planning reforms will result in a permanent improvement to GDP over the longer-term. But the watchdog also made life difficult for the chancellor in the short-term by telling her that she’d bust her rules unless she made additional spending reductions. The complaint is that policymaking has become too subservient to satisfying OBR guesstimates about what growth and debt might be in five years. I have it on exceedingly good authority that the prime minister himself has come to the view that it is unhelpful, to the point of being barmy, that the government has to live in dread of an OBR report card every six months, rather than face an annual verdict at budget time.It remains hard to detect significant differences between him and the chancellor on the fundamentals.I remarked back in Januarythat their fates were entwined because they were lashed to the same mast and they are tighter bound as the headwinds howl with increased ferocity. Both have made improved growth the centrepiece of strategy, so both will pay a continuing political price unless and until it materialises. Both believe the world has become a darker place since the new year without being able to say explicitly that the principal author of this turbulence lives in the White House. Both share the dread of the damage to the economy and the government’s finances that isthreatened by the US president. Though his big reveal on tariffs is supposed to be coming this Wednesday, cabinet members and officials tell me they don’t have any certainty about what might be in store. Even if the UK manages tododge the worst of the Trumpian tariffs, we will still suffer from the fallout of a global trade war.Yet prime minister and chancellor remain as one in believing that there is no alternative to doubling down on toughing it out in the hope that it will ultimately galvanise growth and generate respect.Faced with crunchy decisions they’d rather not have to make, many Labour people, including a significant number of the cabinet, think life could be made a lot easier by relaxing the fiscal rules, which thechancellor declares to be “non-negotiable”. Some of these critics describe it as a terrible mistake to strap Labour into a self-imposed straitjacket. This argument has no traction among her supporters, one of whom retorts: “We all know Labour governments have to work harder to sustain credibility. Borrowing is right at the limit of what the market will tolerate. If the government cannot prove that it can stick to fiscal discipline, it will be shot to pieces.” In this, the chancellor has, so far, had a steadfast ally in her nextdoor neighbour. When Sir Keir encounters ministers who argue for easing the fiscal rules, he has been heard to contemptuously dismiss it as “classic Labour” to seek a reality-swerving refuge from facing difficult challenges.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather than soften his resolve on cuts to incapacity benefits in the name of getting people into work, his background appears to have strengthened the conviction that bearing down on the rising cost of the welfare budget is the right thing to do. He is at least as adamant as his chancellor about this.It looks like a coin toss on as to whether or not Ms Reeves will be meeting her fiscal rules in time for her autumn budget. In bad case scenarios, she will have to further tighten spending and/or introduce more tax increases.

The experts were not impressed: “The dumbest thing I’ve ever heard”; “Over my cold dead body”; “This is not just a bad rule, it’s an act of terrorism.”Although entertaining, I’m not sure how useful this is at the moment. Have you seen how expensive eating out is now? When a fancy croissant costs £6 – in York! – most of us aren’t wondering whether or not a seven-course tasting menu is likely to deliver on its promises. We’re mostly eating in these days, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t rules to argue over. Here are mine – I expect, and hope, you’ll disagree.Soup is a drink, not a meal. Yes, however “hearty”; yes, even with bread.Toast, however, is totally a meal.“What’s for dinner?” is a despicable question. Come with realistic suggestions or for ever hold your peace.Similarly, if you claim you “don’t mind” what you eat, you can’t then criticise what is presented to you by someone who has taken on the mental load of planning and preparing dinner.You can have one special mug (or bowl, or plate) that no one else can use, but just one.Pointy-ended spoons can go to hell.So (this is my best friend’s rule, not mine) can kitchen roll. “It’s toilet paper for the kitchen,” she says, with the devastating finality ofNicky Haslam. “Everyone should have napkins.” I’m a heavy kitchen roll user, but took this on the chin and am currently on eBay buying 12 vintage napkins for the price of a single croissant.If I am preparing vegetables, it is NOT cute to cruise by, cheekily steal a handful and pop them in your mouth; it just means I have to chop more carrots. Rude.Backseat cooking is never acceptable, unless the cook is causing imminent danger to life or health. Back off, or take over entirely.A supermarket packet of fresh pasta serves one, not two.As an adult guest, unless you’re allergic to, genuinely intolerant of, helplessly revolted by, or religiously or philosophically prohibited from eating a certain food, you should try some of what you have been served. Yes, even if it messes with your “macros”, or you’re “avoiding refined sugar” or “doing keto”. I was so shocked byanother Financial Times articlein 2023 that said it was OK to upset people in the pursuit of thinness (“The worst outcome is that someone resents you for a bit. You aren’t a teenager in a California high school drama.”), I’ve been brooding on it ever since. Collective eating is a sacred social ritual, and sometimes making your granny happy trumps your wellness goals.But, if you’re the host, no food you serve should become a referendum on your worth or lovability. Get over it – worst-case scenario, there will be leftovers, which are the best reason for having people round to eat in the first place.Speaking of leftovers, it’s finders keepers: all little bowls in the fridge are fair game.Conversely, if you put something into the fridge, it is your responsibility to dispose of it. Don’t make me tackle your putrid prawns.Home working couples should not have weekday lunch together. Relationships need what my husband calls “un jardin secret” – a certain mystique. For me, that’s never letting him witness the sell-by-date-defying garbage I shovel into my face at 1pm.Never judge someone else’s condiment and seasoning choices; you don’t know what is going on in their mouth.“One person cuts, the other chooses” is not just for kids sharing cake, it’s a lifelong, universal principle.The maximum amount of time you can claim a dirty dish to be “soaking” is overnight (eight hours at most). Any more is gross dereliction of duty.Hiding food is acceptable only if: 1) Society has broken down completely and it’s a survival scenario; or 2) You live with teenagers.Everything goes in the oven at 180C.

Inferior parents should note that help is available: Sabrina Carpenter returns to the UK this summer, seats available for £191 each (VIP £364).Keir Starmer once said that, under him, Britain would be the party of the family and the “best place to grow up in”: we can already feel confident that, thanks to his approach to dynamic sponging, no child of a Labour minister need be denied their essential football or concert outing, regardless of ticket price or scarcity. Starmer leads the way with his non-negotiable visits to theArsenal directors’ box, a perk that Sky Sports at Chequers cannot be expected to replace. “It means I can continue to do something which is really special to me,” he said (after his free specs and outfits scandal), “which is to go to football with my boy.”Leave aside the ethical complexities that would, if poncing free stuff is virtuous, make Boris Johnson a living saintBut as Reeves said last week, risking a furtherLabourmasterclass in tin-eared entitlement, Sabrina Carpenter is not special to her. She obtained reportedly £600 worth of tickets on a more sacrificial basis for her daughter, for whom, we are invited to believe, no other companion was available. Plus Reeves would have loved to be “in normal seats”. Anyway, she eventually conceded, after repeated freebie questions had disrupted post-Statement interviews: “I wouldn’t do it again, I felt I was doing the right thing, but I do understand perceptions.”Leave aside the ethical complexities that would, if poncing free stuff is virtuous, make Boris Johnson a living saint – why did she do it in the first place? It might be standard among Starmer favourites butpolling confirms, unsurprisingly, that the public deplores parliamentary freeloading, just as it doesMPs having second jobs. Last week, the housing minister, Matthew Pennycook (“If I want to go to a concert, I’ll pay”), spoke for decent MPs who have to live with the loss of public respect generated by less scrupulous colleagues. As with the recent discovery that the speaker Lindsay Hoyle’s “working trips”, sometimes undertaken with his employee Lady Hoyle, have cost £250,000 since October 2022, the public’s disappointment is arguably more acute when inflicted by supposedly evolved politicians given to effusions about “working people”, than by Tory degenerates with a known specialism in lushery. If principle alone is not enough to stop Starmer allowing elite freeloading to contaminate his deliberate, former-prosecutor’s, son-of-a-toolmaker, opposite-of-Johnson projection of decency, how come pragmatism has also failed?Last November, it’s true, Starmer, then recently embarrassed for acceptingmore freebies than any other MP, “tightened up” the ministerial code. His sententious introduction (with its ritual homage to “working people”) began – as well it might after his consignments of Lord Alli’s “multiple” free specs (£2,435.00) and “work clothing” (£26,200) – “Restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era”. Bafflingly, at least to this working person, hisrevised version, which couldsimply have put a stop to undue gifts, has instead preserved the fault that facilitates the exact opposite. As with personal judgment on second jobs for MPs (a flourishing affront to constituents thatStarmer once opposed), the acceptance of gifts was left to individual ministers, as opposed to straightforwardly banned.Beneficiaries must now, the code blithers, consider before taking gifts the “need to maintain the public’s confidence in the standards of propriety”. So, pre-Carpenter, Reeves presumably gave that her intensest consideration. For as long as meeting this requirement depends on the ethics or wisdom of the takers, you gather that parliament’s long-overdue protection from greedy and entitled members is an outcome that does not interest the current possessor of a massive Labour majority. The new code need not have discouraged 11 MPs from accepting £17,000 worth of Taylor Swift tickets, it still indulges Starmer and colleagues’ off-duty access to free VIP football and other sports tickets, a benefit not everywhere considered more endearing than Johnson’s infamous, magnate-subsidised lifestyle. One thinks, in particular, of those individualsonce advised by Starmer, that “handouts from the state do not nurture the same sense of self-reliant dignity as a fair wage”.View image in fullscreenSabrina Carpenter performs at the Brit Awards 2025 at the O2 Arena on 1 March, 2025.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesBut Starmer is not, thankfully, done with safeguarding parliament’s reputation. His new “modernisation committee” will consider, among other things, “how to restore public trust in politics”. Older voters may register, among 14 members selected by party whips, the Tory and Viktor Orbán sympathiser, Christopher Chope. Prior to the expenses revelations of 2009, theTelegraphreported, he “drove a Chesterfield sofa 85 miles to have it reupholstered for £881 at taxpayers’ expense”. Parliament also employs his consort, Mrs Chope.It may further comfort our keenest parliamentary freeloaders that the person heading this body is Lucy Powell MP, leader of the Commons and most recent runner-up to Starmer in the freebie acceptance league,with £40,289 of declared gifts. As much as Powell prizes high standards,telling theGuardian, “We need to make sure we’re meeting that public smell test”, both the Register of Interests and herdefence of giftsonQuestion Timehave suggested personal olfactory organs highly adapted to the current parliamentary environment. Powell’s impressive haul has included, along with sports and cultural events purportedly justified by her old, shadow Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport job, pairs of tickets to watch tennis (£564), the Ashes (£600) and the Silverstone Grand Prix (£464).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll tell you why I think that’s nonsense – but please don’t pull up a chairSun 30 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 16.28 EDTShareIonce told a colleague that I was going to Amsterdam on a solo trip to wine and dine alone. “Do you not have any friends to go with?” she replied. She was joking, but I think she also meant it. Her comment was tinged with pity. Why would youchooseto eat a three-course meal with a good view or order room service in a nice hotel on your own? What’s the point? Wouldn’t you want to share that with someone?Eating alone often gets a bad rap. It’s getting an even worse rap now that the World Happiness Report moved Americans down the ranking in part because they are, apparently,eating alone too much. The picture doesn’t look good: too many people have no one to eat with, they lack community, and are clearly rather isolated and lonely. Community is incredibly important – especially now, when the world feels increasingly unstable and unpredictable. We all know that at the end of your life you will think about the people you love and how you spent time with them. Sharing a meal, especially in candlelight, is an intimate experience and makes us feel closer to one another. Historically, people gathered around open campfires – it was around these flickering flames that we first learned to share stories.And yet there is also a huge number of people who really enjoy spending time alone at a table too. Solo dining in restaurants in the US hasrisen by a staggering 64%since 2019, according to OpenTable.I am one of these people (I’ve even written an entire novel calledTable for One, about a woman rekindling her relationship with herself after a breakup). I’m always looking for new solo experiences to book. But it’s not easy being a solo diner – the world is set up for couples. There are two-for-one deals and sharing platters, and I’ve noticed that many nice restaurants don’t offer wine by the glass, only a full bottle. And it’s not just single people who love being solo diners: I am married and have been with my partner for 13 years, yet one of the biggest pleasures of my life is taking myself out for a solo date.When it’s good, it’s good. Just this morning I had breakfast alone in a nice hotel and three other women were also sitting alone, reading their books (two out of three had opted for Joan Didion). It felt surprisingly communal. But restaurants don’t always love a solo customer in the evening. In New York, I am usually shoved awkwardly at the end of the bar on an uncomfortably high bar stool, offered a snack menu and not treated to a full dining experience. In several restaurants in London, I’ve been told they would need the table back within 45 minutes and I wasn’t given the full dining foreplay: no specials board, just a quick in-and-out job. The assumption perhaps being that I was there for convenience – on a business trip perhaps? – rather than on an enjoyable evening out to spend time with myself.‘Table for one? Yes, please’ – the joy of eating aloneRead moreSomeone who lives in Tuscany recently told me that solo dining is not as widely accepted there: “People would think you were strange.” Dining in Italy, he added, is all about big groups of people, family, laughter, and sharing food. As much as I love a hearty group meal (I’m not that much of a loner), I’m also a raging introvert, so I couldn’t help but feel defensive that anything other than dining at a big table is labelled “strange”.I don’t always want a big, raucous dining experience. Sometimes I just want to eat slowly and silently while chewing over my thoughts. Tasting the food, reading a book, looking out of a window, thinking, maybe even with a friendly podcast in my ears for company instead (they talk and you don’t need to talk back). Some countries have solo dining baked into their DNA – in Japan, it’s encouraged and respected. There is even a famous ramen chain, Ichiran, that offers individual booths where people canenjoy their dinner in privacywithout needing to interact. (And it has now expanded into the US.) Some people might think this is sad and too antisocial, but what about if it’s chosen as an occasional treat? Life is busy and stressful: what’s wrong with wanting to eat a meal in privacy every now and again?It’s beenfive yearssince the pandemic began. Many of us were either stuck inside a house full of people with no escape or desperately alone, craving company and conversation. I wonder if those people who were cooped up with others without any personal space are behind this rise in people eating alone, seeking out alonement and travel and savouring every morsel of hard-won peace. I wonder if chosen solitude can one day be openly celebrated – especially for women, who often forget to prioritise their pleasure in a world of endless to-do lists for other people. Eating alone doesn’t always mean misery. There’s room for nuance at my table for one.Emma Gannon is an author and journalist.

The mythic Welsh warrior Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who appears to have been bigger on brawn than brain, once came home to find his wife, the flower-maiden Blodeuwedd, weeping with fear over premonitions of his death. She begged Lleu to prove that he was, as rumoured, invincible.Lleu, who had clearly not read the story of Delilah, thought it was a good idea to reveal to his wife each of the unlikely and incongruous conditions that would make it possible for a rival to kill him: among other kinks, they required him to be caught outdoors on a riverbank with one foot straddling a thatched cauldron and one on a wriggling goat. Lo and behold, in one year’s time Lleu found himself being struck down in exactly that pose by Blodeuwedd and her lover, the hunter Gronw Pebr. The story is still told to explain the peculiar shape of the Stone of Gronw, sitting to this day on the banks of the River Cynfal in Blaenau Ffestiniog.Blodeuwedd may have been a tricksy wife, but she is one of eight magical creatures celebrated on Royal Mail’scollection of stamps, which revive folkloric traditions from regions across the UK. None is fully human: Blodeuwedd herself was reportedly moulded from flowers by two magicians for their friend, Lleu, after a curse doomed him never to find a bride from among his own people.View image in fullscreen‘Blodeuwedd, weeping with fear at over premonitions of his death, begged Lleu to prove that he was invincible.’Photograph: Royal Mail/PAThe subjects of these stamps are all deeply rooted in regional landscape. They include Cornish Piskies (not to be confused with Devonian Pixies); the shapeshifting selkies of Orkney and Shetland (part seal, part woman); and of course, Loch Ness’ most famous resident, Nessie. They provide a rare reminder that England has magical creatures to match the smaller home nations. Norfolk is represented by the Black Shuck, the demonic black dog of East Anglia; Lancashire and Yorkshire by the Grindylow, a river monster that drags children into the reeds. They’d deserve attention if only thanks to the lyrical designs by the artist Adam Simpson, packed with mobile storytelling detail in each still image. They are also, in their own quiet way, deeply patriotic.Patriotism gets a bad rap in modern Britain. The left often struggles to accept that patriotism can be distinguished from nationalist chauvinism, or that there can be any place for it. Liberals of the centre, meanwhile, have a dangerous tendency to vest pride only in institutions that flatter our ideological preferences, forgetting that France, Germany and even Italy make their own claims to have invented Enlightenment values. Secular patriotism – and by that, I mean a patriotism devoid of emotion or aesthetic – can only ever be transactional. If your love of country is conditional upon its strict adherence to the separation of powers, the secret ballot or even the NHS, it will crumble the first time those institutions come under successful attack.Blodeuwedd was reportedly moulded from flowers by two magicians for Lleu, after a curse doomed him never to find a bride among his own peopleIt is almost 20 years since Gordon Brown, as chancellor, staked out this territory as a personal project. Brown had remarkable foresight: in a speech at the 2006 Fabian Society conference, he foresaw the risks that the lack of a confident and coherent British identity posed to the union and Britain’s place in Europe. Three years later, Brown commissionedBeing British, a collection of essays edited by then-Spectatoreditor Matthew d’Ancona, and wrote the introduction.In an accompanying BBC radio programme, he identified the dangers of leaving British patriotism to be defined by the hard right. “I think everybody wants to be rooted. Everybody wants to feel a sense of belonging,” he told D’Ancona. But when progressives and liberals fail to cater for that need, “we define ourselves by race or ethnicity – which would be a disaster for a country that has many people with different backgrounds as part of it.” The result, as Brown foresaw, is the anti-immigrant provocation of Tommy Robinson and the racist violence of theSouthport riots.It is possible to celebrate aspects of Britain that everyone who lives here can share; that are not co-authored by our peers in Europe; that stimulate our senses with a materiality more enduring than the abstract precepts of a civics lecture. (And I’m not talking, like the wretched “Life in the UK” test, about fish and chips.) A new set of stamps for Royal Mail is not going to transform a nation’s self-image, but it should inspire us. What we have in common with each other, and with every other human being who has set foot on these islands, is no more and no less than our experience of place.Take the selkie. Coastal nations the world over have stories of water-nymphs who come and go from human husbands: the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, a categorisation system used by folklorists to define tale types, classes the selkie myth as a subsection of ATU 400, “The Man on a Quest for His Lost Wife”. (Nothing takes the joy out of fairy stories like reducing them to numbered index cards.) Versions of seal-maiden can be found well beyond the legal boundaries of the UK, in the Faroe Islands and across Scandinavia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But only in the Shetlands is the motif so closely linked to the geographic challenges of the sea-swells in the Ve Skerries. The folklorist Walter Traill Dennison claimed to have found a different selkie tale shaped around the landscape of each Orkney island. The thrill of these stories is the local detail woven into the universal.Just as regional folklore can build new communities, it can stoke ethnic conflict. Royal Mail’s stamps take a provocative risk by locating Fionn mac Cumhaill, the Gaelic giant also known as Finn McCool, in Northern Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway, thus inveigling him into a set celebrating the United Kingdom. Yet they also do a brilliant job of reminding us that Britain’s legends are everywhere you look in our landscape.You don’t have to share any DNA with the previous generations who have told these tales.

That line was to have appeared on screen at the beginning of the film. It didn’t, on orders from the studio, Warner Bros. “It was all on account of the word ‘labor’,” John Huston later reflected. “That word looks dangerous in print, I guess.”It was a relatively insignificant moment in the drama of America’s postwar red scare. McCarthyism proper had still to take flight. Yet, so deep ran the fear already that a single, everyday word could create consternation in Hollywood.McCarthyism, the historian Ellen Schrecker has observed, “was a peculiarly American style of repression – nonviolent and consensual. Only two people were killed; only a few hundred went to jail.” Yet it constituted “one of the most severe episodes of political repression the United States ever experienced”.Sackings and legal sanctions created such fear that, in the words of the political philosopher Corey Robin, society was put “on lockdown”, with people so “petrified of being punished for their political beliefs” that “they drew in their political limbs”.It was not just communists who were silenced. “If someone insists that there is discrimination against Negroes in this country, or that there is an inequality of wealth,” claimed the chair of one state committee on un-American activities, “there is every reason to believe that person is a communist.” This at a time when Jim Crow still held the south in its grip. The red scare paused the civil rights movement for more than a decade and drew the teeth of union radicalism.Fear has always been a means of enforcing social order, most obviously in authoritarian states, from China to Saudi Arabia, Turkey to Russia, where repression becomes the foundation of political rule. In liberal democracies, order rests more on consensus than overt brutality. But here, too, fear plays its role. The worker’s fear of being sacked, the claimant’s of being sanctioned, the renter’s of being made homeless, the fear of the working-class mother facing a social worker or of the black teenager walking past a policeman – relations of power are also relations of fear, but fears usually so sublimated that we simply accept that that’s the way the system works.It is when consensus ruptures, when social conflict erupts, or when the authorities need to assert their power, that liberal democracies begin wielding fear more overtly as a political tool to quieten dissent or impose authority. Think of how the British state treated Irish people in the 1970s and 1980s, or miners during the great strike of 1984/85.Many of those who previously so vigorously upheld the importance of free speech have suddenly lost their voiceSeventy years on from McCarthyism, America seems to be entering such a moment. Over the past month, we have seen themass deportationto a notorious foreign jail of hundreds of people declared to be illegal immigrants and gang members, without evidence or due process; the arrest, detention andthreatened deportation of foreign students, includingMahmoud Khalil,Rumeysa Ozturk,Momodou TaalandYunseo Chung, for protesting about the war in Gaza; the blacklisting of law firms representing clients of whom DonaldTrump does not approve; the mass sackings of federal workers.Fear works here in two ways. The targets of repression are groups about whom it is easier to create fear, and so easier to deprive of rights and due process. Doing so then creates a wider climate of fear in which people become less willing to speak out, and not just about Palestine. Already, “whole segments of American society [are] running scared”, asone observer put it.Institutions such as universities, Schrecker concluded about the 1950s, “did not fight McCarthyism” but “contributed to it”, not only through dismissals and blacklists but also through accepting “the legitimacy of what the congressional committees and other official investigators were doing”, thereby conferring “respectability upon the most repressive elements” of the process.It’s a process repeating itself today. Earlier this month, after cancelling $400m (£310m) in federal grants and contracts, Trump made aseries of demands of Columbia University, including that it change its disciplinary rules, place the Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies department under “academic receivership” and adopt thecontested International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definitionof antisemitism that its own lead drafter, Kenneth Stern, condemns as having been “weaponised” into “a blunt instrument tolabel anyone an antisemite” and to “go after pro-Palestinian speech”.

Cowardice, though, has become the defining trait, most university leaders “just happy thatColumbia is the whipping boy”. Columbia may be the first university in Trump’s crosshairs, but it won’t be the last. Keeping silent won’t save them.In his incendiary speech in Munich in February, the US vice-president,JD Vance, harangued European leaders to worry less about Russia than “the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values”, especially free speech. The same, it would seem, applies to America, too. Many of those who previously so vigorously upheld the importance of free speech have suddenly lost their voice or now believe that speech should be free only for those with the right kinds of views. The brazen hypocrisy of Vance, and of the fair-weather supporters of free speech, should nevertheless not lead us to ignore the fact that, from more intrusive policing of social media to greater restrictions on our ability to protest to the disciplining, even sacking, of workers holding “gender-critical views”, these are issues to which we urgently need to attend.“I live in an age of fear,” lamented the essayist and author EB White in 1947, after theNew York Heraldhad suggested that all employees be forced to declare their political beliefs to retain their jobs. He was, he insisted, less worried “that there were communists in Hollywood” than to “read your editorial in praise of loyalty testing and thought control”. It is a perspective as vital now as it was then, and as necessary on this side of the Atlantic as in America.Kenan Malik is an Observer columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionFreedom of speechUS universitiesUS politicsJD VanceTrump administrationCensorshipcommentShareReuse this content"

That is why lawyers are targeted – with harassment, disbarment from the profession or even jail – by repressive regimes.Russia’s attempts to suppress the voice of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny did not end with his death in an Arctic prison colony. In a bleak coda, three of his lawyershave been jailedfor several years. Vadim  Kobzev, Alexei Liptser and Igor Sergunin were found guilty of participating in an “extremist organisation” for relaying his messages to the outside world.The Center for Human Rights in Iran warned earlier this year that Iranian lawyers were beingkicked out of the profession, arrested and jailed for representing protesters and dissidents. As its executive director, Hadi Ghaemi, noted: “Every lawyer imprisoned or disbarred represents many defendants whose rights have been trampled and now lack legal defence.”In China, where more than 300 human rights lawyers who had dared to take on sensitive cases were detained in 2015’s“709” crackdown, the pressurecontinues. As agrim jokehad it at the height of the campaign, “even lawyers’ lawyers need lawyers” – those who represented arrested friends were then seized themselves.The unrelenting nature of the clampdown is particularly striking when, as one Chinese lawyer, Liang Xiaojun, observed:“We know we can’t win.”When the verdict is clear before a case has started, lawyers can only offer solidarity, spread their clients’ stories, and highlight the gulf between legal theory and reality. But in doing so, they challenge the official narrative. Targeting these lawyers didn’t just signal that resistance only invites further trouble. It attacked the concept of the rule of law itself, which lawyers had attempted to assert, hammering home the message that the party’s power was unassailable.The Council of Europewarned earlier this monththat there are increasing reports of harassment, threats and other attacks on the practice of law internationally. The human rights body has adopted the first international treaty aiming to protect the profession of lawyer. Member states should now ratify this. Lawyers must be defended, as they defend others and the concepts of rules and justice.That message is more important than ever as the Trump administration turns on lawyers and judges as part of its broader assault on the institutions of US democracy and the principles that underpin them. The sanctioning of staff at the international criminal court is only the most flagrant example. William R Bay, president of the American Bar Association, told members in arecent letter: “Government actions evidence a clear and disconcerting pattern. If a court issues a decision this administration does not agree with, the judge is targeted. If a lawyer represents parties in a dispute with the administration, or … represents parties the administration does not like, lawyers are targeted.” Government lawyers too have faced “personal attacks, intimidation, firings and demotions for simply fulfilling their professional responsibilities”.Democratic governments and civil society must speak up for the law wherever it is threatened. Mr Bay is right to urge those in the profession to stand up and be counted. “If we don’t speak now, when will we speak?” he asks. The law still counts – both materially and culturally – in the US. Those who practise it need some of the courage in resisting abuses that their counterparts have shown elsewhere.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The chancellor, Rachel Reeves, regards rules that protect these nocturnal mammalsas a nuisance. Nevertheless, the rareBechstein’s bat, as well as the pine marten and various fungi, are expected to be among species that benefit from the multiyear project, to which central government has so far committed £7.5m.Like England’s only existingnational forest, in the Midlands, this one will be broken up across a wide area, featuring grassland, farmland, towns and villages as well as densely planted, closed-canopy woodland. John Everitt, who heads the National Forest organisation (which is both a charity and a government arm’s length body), describes this type of landscape as “forest in the medieval sense with a mosaic of habitats”.Stretching from Gloucester in the north to Salisbury in the south and Weston-super-Mare in the west, the new project will span three counties and the city of Bristol. The aim is to combine the environmental benefits of tree planting with social and economic gains, such as new opportunities for tourism and leisure. Unlike in the Midlands, where the forest was established in a post-industrial landscape scarred by mining and clay pits, the western forest includes prime agricultural land. This means that while the Midlands is the model, this is in some ways a very different scheme. The hope is that it will demonstrate how forestry and agriculture can be combined – and counteract the view held in some rural communities that tree planting is anti-farming.The UK is underforested relative to the rest of Europe, and also among themost nature-depleted nationsin the world. While tree cover in Scotland has substantially increased, in England it isestimated to be just 12.8%by Friends of the Earth, compared with an EU average of 38%. Increasing this figure is a pillar of climate change and biodiversity policies. The government’s target is 16.5% by 2050, to support the transition to net zero and boost wildlife. In the Midlands forest area, tree cover has increased from about 6% to about 26% over 30 years – with bats among the beneficiaries.When that forest was established, it was a regeneration project as much as an environmental one. Initially championed by two Tories well known for their commitment to nature – John Gummer (who went on to chair the UK’s Climate Change Committee) and Michael Heseltine (whoowns an arboretum) – the scheme has since attracted cross-party support. The western forest is the first of three that were promised in Labour’s manifesto. In the Midlands there are plans to plant another 8m trees.The gains attributed to the forest there include higher property prices – a mixed blessing in any area, given their impact on lower-income renters and first-time buyers. As yet, reliable estimates of the scheme’s overall impact on carbon emissions (with tree planting offsetting emissions from development) do not exist. But the forest is working towards a net zero target. There is a vibrant outdoor learning programme in local schools. New jobs have been created in tourism, leisure and green industry. Given that local economies and landscapes change anyway, it is far better for public authorities with an interest in nature, as well as profit-seeking businesses, to be involved in overseeing this. The promise of a new forest in the west of England is a hopeful one.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Plus letters fromCaroline Airsand another readerSun 30 Mar 2025 12.31 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 12.33 EDTShareNels Abbey’s article raises an important debate about the use of racial slurs and how they are interpreted in legal and social contexts (A racist screaming the N-word and a Black person using it in conversation are poles apart. Why can’t the CPS see it?, 24 March). While I understand that intent and context matter, I firmly believe that racial slurs should not be used in public spaces and platforms – regardless of who is saying them.I am a black woman. But the idea that because I belong to that ethnic group it would be acceptable for another black person to refer to me using the N-word – regardless of context – is wrong. I would be offended. That word is derogatory to me, and its history is rooted in oppression and dehumanisation.The concept of intracommunal language refers to linguistic practices used in a specific community. Some argue that racial slurs, when used among black people, fall under this category and carry a different meaning. But does this truly apply to words that originated as tools of oppression? Can a slur ever be fully reclaimed when its historical weight remains unchanged? I don’t believe so. Normalising the word in a community does not erase its painful history or prevent others from weaponising it.On social media, where context is often lost, racial slurs can lead to conflict and division. A total ban on them across public platforms would provide a clear and enforceable standard. It would eliminate debates over intent and ensure that no one is subject to the harm these words can cause. This isn’t about censorship, it’s about creating a more respectful society. If the goal is to reduce racism, we should stop giving power to racial slurs by removing them from public spaces altogether.Sherri DavisLondonI found Nels Abbey’s use of the example of Marieha Hussain and her placard depicting Rishi Sunak and Suella Braverman as “coconuts”, and saying that the word was a “satirical critique”, deeply offensive. As a British Asian who has spent their life being called a coconut by community and family members, I know how hurtful and offensive it can be. To be called this by someone in your community is to be excluded by the community you were born into and grew up in. I’m not saying the judge wasn’t right to throw out the case, but I found the minimising of this offensive word troubling.Name and address suppliedNels Abbey raises interesting points about hate crime legislation. The underlying problem is a persistent misunderstanding. Equality does not mean treating everyone the same. It means taking positive steps to level the playing field. The first steps being to acknowledge that the playing field is far from level and to understand structural inequalities of power such as institutional racism and misogyny, disadvantages based on class, and the unrelenting barriers faced by disabled people.Of course, those who benefit from inequalities of power are generally resistant to challenges to those inequalities. The liberal state tries to be fair to everyone, so hate crime legislation, while recognising that some groups require additional protection, then offers the same protection to the more powerful groups.Vociferous (groundless) complaints about two-tier policing, combined with a lack of understanding of the context of inequality, result in the police andCrown Prosecution Servicebending over backwards to be seen as fair and impartial. As Nels says, it is time for a conversation about what is fair and what is in the public interest.Finally, Nels and others should remember that many lesbians and gay men object to being called “queer”. That term too should only be used by those who identify with it, and only to describe or refer to others who identify with it.Caroline AirsNewcastleuponTyneDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

One day, I visited a gentleman who was terrified of losing his Pip. Despite his fear, he offered me tea, but only had a tiny amount of milk in his fridge. He was ashamed and started to cry. I called the local food bank to help him.Now, I am an occupational therapist. On my to-do list is an appeal letter for a patient with Huntington’s disease, a complex, incurable condition. He scored zero on his Pip assessment, yet his neurological apathy and cognitive impairment affect his daily function. Proposed welfare cuts by Rachel Reeves and Liz Kendall (Report, 26 March) will severely impact his access to vital support.The cuts will have unintended consequences on the health and social care system. Rehabilitation initiatives face budget cuts, reflecting a lack of understanding about rehabilitation and its commissioning. Key issues include a reduction in access to essential care and rehabilitation; community staff, including GPs, being overwhelmed with report production; claimants dealing with impersonal, ineffective support from faceless organisations; and employers misunderstanding health impacts on function, ignoring the Equality Act.I am particularly concerned about the “right to try” work initiative lacking safeguards for those who cannot work, and so cannot take part. If rushed through, the health and social care system will degrade further.

Superbloom spectacle eludes California after dry winterRiot of native wildflowers that enthralled visitors in the past several years have failed to sprout due to too little rainKatharine Gammonin Los AngelesSun 30 Mar 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 11.01 EDTShareIt’s one of the best known rites of spring in California: extraordinary displays known as “superblooms” that coat the hillsides in an abundance of color. Some years the blooms are massive enough to draw tourists from around the world to revel in the fields, such as in 2023 when more than 100,000 people showed up on a weekend to gawk at the poppies in Lake Elsinore, a small city about an hour outside Los Angeles.But this year, not so much. Thanks to a brutally dry winter, the hills around the usual southern California superbloom hotspots have been conspicuously bare. Callista Turner, a state park ranger, could count the number of blooms on two hands as she surveyed the 8 miles of rolling hills at the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in the final week of March, which is typically when superbloom season peaks. “We’re still waiting to see what kind of season we have,” she says. “It’s a very slow start.”It’s a similar situation in other parts of southern California. That’s because the native wildflowers have a precise recipe they need to follow to bloom. And this year, rainfall came – but too little and too late to germinate the seeds that lay dormant below the ground. The poppy reserve has received less than an inch of rain this winter, a remarkably low amount compared to years like 2017 and 2019 when sections of the park saw an extraordinary bloom.The dazzling, troubling history of California superbloom tourismRead moreFor poppies, Turner says, rainfall matters – 6in per year is the lowest amount needed, and above 14 inches is too much. But it’s also about the amount of water that each storm drops. The flowers need a significant amount of rainfall at once – usually over half an inch. Wind also matters as do too cold or hot temperatures – when it is cold, the plants can grow, but they don’t produce buds or flowers. If it’s too hot, the flowers don’t pop either. Turner advises anyone who wants to see what the flowers are doing to check thepoppy live cam.Usually super blooms happen once or twice in a decade, she says. And there’s a stronger likelihood of a massive bloom if a wet winter occurs after a few years of drought.But the calculus about when the flowers are going to be the best is also becoming murkier with the climate crisis: “All of the data that we used to look at in the past about when was a good time to come for a wildflower bloom aren’t reliable now,” she said, “because the conditions are changing so rapidly and there hasn’t been enough time for us to really get good data with these new climate conditions.”View image in fullscreenVisitors pose for photos in a field of blooming flowers near the Antelope Valley California Poppy Reserve in 2023.Photograph: Marcio José Sánchez/APThere’s another ingredient in knowingwhere the wildflowers are blooming, said Katie Tilford, with the Theodore Payne foundation, which focuses on native plants in California – people. Federal funding cuts mean fewer people are out in the fields collecting wildflower reports. “So there might be flowers out there, but there’s not as much information getting out there to the public because those employees aren’t there.”The foundation has a hotline as well as a weekly illustratedreportabout what is blooming.Poppy seeds can hang out for years under the soil in what’s known as a seed bank. Seeds can live for a decade – some up to 60 years – and wait for just the right conditions to pop open in a splash of color. Once flowered, their entire life cycle lasts just three months.The lack of a superbloom isa double-edged swordforthe small townsthatcan be overrun by tourismin boom years. When there is a wildflower event, sometimesit can feel a bit overwhelming, said Brianna Fordem with the Anza-Borrego Foundation, a non-profit which supports the desert state park with the same name. She has to make sure there are enough supplies, enough road signs, enough maps and volunteers.“Not having that feels like, ‘OK, we don’t have to ramp up for this,’” she said. “But there’s also a big lost opportunity to teach more people about the desert. The wildflowers are definitely an opportunity to bring new people to understand more.“Wildflower years are always a boon for the economics of our small community, and so when we have no wild flowers, people certainly still do come out and visit, but our businesses do suffer,” says Fordem.View image in fullscreenPeople take photos in a field of Yellow Desert Sunflowers as wildflowers begin to bloom in Anza-Borrego desert state park in California in 20 March 2024.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersOther parts of the region feel similarly. In Lake Elsinore, where a superbloom event happened in 2023, the absence of flowers this year has resulted in little to no visitor traffic, providing relief to the local community and infrastructure, says Jovanny Rivera Huerta, a public information officer with the City of Lake Elsinore. “During previous superblooms, the overwhelming number of tourists posed challenges, including traffic congestion, safety concerns and environmental impact,” says Huerta. “However, local businesses that benefited from the influx of visitors may feel their absence this year.”“The annuals that everybody goes crazy about, they’re very ephemeral,” Tilford says. “The seeds are lying dormant in the soil, and then if they get exactly the right conditions, the blooms that just blanket the hillsides look amazing. But that’s pretty rare.When that’s not happening, like this year, there is still plenty of color in woody shrubs, like the California lilac, as well as sunflowers, sages, and even trees like elderberry. “You see all these other things still putting on a display, just every year, again and again.”Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaWest CoastWild flowersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

So we are reviewing this area to make sure that the immigration and asylum system works effectively in the way that parliament intended it to and make sure that there is a proper sense of control in the system.”Article eight has been at the centre of a number of controversial asylum cases, including one earlier this year when a Palestinian family was allowed to remain in the UK having first made their application through the Ukrainian Family Scheme.The prime minister, Keir Starmer,said in Februarythat Cooper was looking at how this part of human rights law interacted with the immigration system, calling it a “loophole”. Neither Starmer nor Cooper have said how they want to change the system to stop such cases in the future however.The home secretary is looking for ways to bring down the number of arrivals bysmall boats, whichreached 5,000 earlier this month– quicker than in any of the previous three years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The law would be brief and limited in its scope, according to people close to the process, with ministers hoping to pass it through both the Commons and the Lords in as little as 24 hours.The law was unlikely to be passed in time to stop the guidelines before they take effect, officials said, but Mahmood is hoping to introduce it to the Commons as soon as Tuesday.The guidelines from the Sentencing Council for England and Waleswould requiremagistrates and judges to consult a pre-sentence report before deciding whether to imprison someone of an ethnic or religious minority, or a young adult, abuse survivor or pregnant woman.The council proposed the guidelines in an attempt to reduce bias and reoffending, but has since been criticised by ministers and the opposition for allowing the introduction of “two-tier justice”.Earlier this month Mahmood wrote to the chair of the council, Lord Justice Davis, calling for the change to be scrapped and insisting there would “never be a two-tier sentencing approach under my watch”.Davis defied that pressure on Friday, however, saying the council had concluded “the guideline did not require revision” and blaming a “widespread misunderstanding” for the backlash.He addedin a letter to Mahmood: “The rule of law requires that all offenders are treated fairly and justly by judges and magistrates who are fully informed about the offences, the effect on the victims and the offenders. The section of the guideline relating to pre-sentence reports is directed to the issue of information about offenders, no more and no less.”Mahmood reacted sharply to the council’s letter, calling the move “unacceptable” and promising to legislate if necessary. Keir Starmer, the prime minister, saidhe was “disappointed”by the council’s response, adding: “All options are on the table.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mahmoodhas ordered a reviewinto the role and powers of the council and sources say she is looking for ways to give parliament and the government more say over its recommendations.Such a plan would require new legislation, which could be included in this summer’s sentencing bill. That bill is due to be published after the publication of a sentencing review by the former Conservative justice secretary David Gauke.Explore more on these topicsSentencingUK criminal justiceShabana MahmoodEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

I think if he was alive and I saw him, but it’s not me he’s abused.“He’s abused the victims and survivors. So whether I forgive or not is, to a large extent, irrelevant.”Reacting to Welby’s comments, a survivor of Smyth’s abuse told Kuenssberg: “I came forward 13 years ago and what the church has put me through makes the historic abuse pale into insignificance. It has been the most extraordinary traumatic journey trying to get answers. I don’t care about Smyth.”Theindependent reviewby Keith Makin – in which he highlighted significant failings and proposed recommendations to improve safeguarding practices in the church – concluded that Smyth could have been brought to justice had the archbishop formally reported allegations to the police a decade ago.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It prompted anger from abuse victims and others.The former archbishop said he “wasn’t in a good space at the time” and should not have made the speech at all. “It did cause profound upset and I am profoundly ashamed of that, and I apologised within 24 hours and I remain deeply ashamed,” he said.Welby also used the interview to say his failure to take effective action over a serial sadistic abuser was becausehe had been overwhelmedby the scale of the abuse crisis in the church“Every day more cases were coming across the desk that had been in the past, hadn’t been dealt with adequately, and this was just, it was another case. It was an absolutely overwhelming few weeks.”The survivor of Smyth’s abuse who gave his reaction to Kuenssberg questioned why it had not been a priority for Welby. “You may be swamped by other cases, but if this one wasn’t fairly close to the top of the pile, then what was?” he asked.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismJustin WelbyChristianityReligionEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Two white men fled the scene. WhenMetropolitan policeofficers arrived seconds later, Richards pointed out the suspects’ directions. He said that, instead of pursuing them, an officer began shouting at him to get the ground and pointed a pepper spray at him.He recalled telling the officers: “‘I’m not part of this. I’m a performer. I’ve just done Hairspray, I’m Seaweed.’ I tried to give him as much information about myself: ‘I’m an actor, I’ve been in Sex Education.’”He also told them he lived across the street with his mother, pointing to the flat. But the officer, Richards said, “saw me as a Black boy that is a part of this”. The actor said he began backing against a wall with his hands raised, and continued pleading, until two more officers arrived.“I’m saying, ‘I’m a performer. My name is Reece Richards.’ I’m trying to do everything to humanise myself.”Manchester’s radical Black female activists: ‘We didn’t define ourselves as feminists’Read moreHe said officers shouted: “Get on the fucking floor!” and tackled him to the ground. “Three people on top of me, they’re pummelling my hands into my back, pushing my head into the floor.” He said he was then pepper-sprayed in the face and handcuffed.His mother rushed outside and told officers he lived with her in the flat across the street. As a crowd gathered, Richards heard people questioning his treatment. “I could hear my mum … I begged [them], ‘My mum has got high blood pressure. I don’t care what happens to me. Just make sure that she’s OK.’ I lost my dad last year and I’m not trying to lose anyone else.”Richards said he remains shaken months later. As a Black man in the UK, he explained the great lengths he goes to not be perceived as dangerous. “You look at things that are traps and you try to navigate away from them … I won’t make sure that my voice is as deep as it actually is, just so I can get through things without being judged … But, in this situation, I couldn’t get out.”Richards was de-arrested at the scene. He filed a complaint with theIndependent Office for Police Conduct(IOPC), but it said it found no indication of racial discrimination in the way that Richards was treated. But it is investigating the use of excessive force.A report is expected this week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s saddening, it’s distrusting.”His lawyer, Jessica Webster of Bindmans LLP, said: “For Mr Richards, the IOPC’s new discrimination guidelines seem little more than a public relations exercise, with the investigators in his case failing to follow or even appear to understand them.”She said: “The Met’s institutional racism will persist while the police watchdog fails to hold officers to account.”The incident also aggravated a prior injury, forcing Richards to stop working for three months, he said. It also left deep emotional scars.“It’s difficult to have the capacity to fully immerse myself in work now because things take me back,” he said. “This happened where I live. Home represents a safe space, but now it’s tainted massively.”A spokesperson for the IOPC confirmed an officer would not be investigated for racial bias.They said one officer was investigated for potential gross misconduct, while a second officer faced a misconduct investigation for their use of force and discreditable conduct.The IOPC said it would also rule on complaints from Richards and his mother regarding use of force, conduct and alleged racial discrimination during the incident.The spokesperson said: “Our investigation is in its final stages, and we are making our initial decisions on whether any officers should face disciplinary proceedings. As required by law, we will then share our report and decisions with the Met which will provide its view, which we must consider before making our final decisions.”Explore more on these topicsIndependent Office for Police ConductMetropolitan policePoliceLondonRaceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

But during the pandemic they became the norm and have remained so ever since.Actors are spending hours, even days, creating them, often paying for equipment or studios to film in – and generally never hearing back.A spokesperson for Equity, which described self-tapes as “unpaid labour”, said: “This is reinforcing the class issue and elitism within the industry.”Equity says that itsguidelineson self-tapes are “not being heeded by the industry and it is having a huge impact on performers’ lives”. The guidelines state that actors should not be expected to learn more than six pages for a first self-tape and should not be asked to “rearrange their home as though it were a set”.Hywel Morgan, an actor and Equity councillor, who has appeared inGentleman JackandSlow Horses, said he knows of performers who have had to memorise as many as 12 pages of dialogue for self-tapes.One actor was asked for a self-tape even though the part involved just 16 words, and another was asked to tape themselves nodding because that was all that was required for the role.Morgan added: “This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to bad practice in the industry. Now, the first round [of auditions] is all being done as self-tapes, and casting directors are requesting upwards of 200 self-tapes for a single part.”He argued that it is unreasonable to send actors “six huge scenes with loads of dialogue” and expect them to learn them for an initial audition.One actor, who asked to remain anonymous, said she had made 50 self-tapes in the past year alone. Not one led to any work, despite her track record of roles in major productions.“It’s soul-destroying,” she said. “The industry is a beast, but this is actually adding insult to injury.”Another actor spoke of devoting between six and eight hours to each self-tape, adding: “Over the past 12 months, I’ve done 280 hours of unpaid work. It’s totally unfair, but it has become standard for casting directors to submit a wide range of self-tapes for producers.”Some actors who lack technical skills on lighting and editing, or live with noisy children or flatmates, are paying up to £150 for professional help with self-tapes. Morgan is among actors who have spent thousands on eqipment and has turned his small garage into a makeshift studio. He self-taped forSlow HorsesandGentleman Jack.The volume of self-tapes is also a concern for actors, who do not believe all the tapes are being watched. There is often no way to tell if a tape has been watched, and follow-up calls are generally fruitless. One actor said: “Why are they making us do all this work when we know they’re possibly not going to watch more than two minutes? I’ve seen casting directors on social media say: ‘I’ve had such a tough day. I looked at 150 self-tapes for a role.’”UK unions call for action to protect creative industry workers as AI developsRead moreSince last year, Equity has been negotiating TV and film contracts with Pact, the trade association representing independent UK producers.Cathy Sweet, Equity’s head of film and TV, said it raised the self-taping problem with Pact in May 2024, adding: “We hoped Pact would have been quicker to resolve this and are putting pressure on it to come back to us.”Max Rumney, Pact’s deputy chief executive, said producers are sympathetic to actors’ concerns and that a “scattergun approach” to casting does not benefit anyone.The Casting Directors’ Guild said: “Our self-tape guidelines align with Equity, who we are in regular contact with. We have been working very hard to make sure that actors are not sent lengthy audition scenes, with as much time to prepare as possible and given feedback on progress. We respect the process of the actor hugely and continue to encourage our members to closely follow the guidelines.”Explore more on these topicsTelevision industryThe ObservernewsShareReuse this content"

InGreater Manchester, about two-thirds do not pursue the traditional university route.The rise in the number of neets is causing increasing concern among MPs at Westminster and educationists, with senior figures in government also growing ever-more alarmed by the loss of a potentially huge skill base to the economy.The Policy Connect thinktank and the independentSkills Commissionlast month launched a new inquiry, to be chaired by a cross-party group of MPs, aimed at developing policies to ensure that, by 2050, the UK has the lowest percentage of young people who are not in education, employment or training in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.The neets rate has remained at 12% or higher for several decades. According tolabour market statisticspublished by the Office for National Statistics in February, the UK unemployment rate for young people aged 16 to 24 was 14.8%, up from 11.9% the year before.The problems is bound up with ethnic inequalities, with young people from Black Caribbean backgrounds having a neet rate more than double that of young people with white British backgrounds. Regional inequalities are also substantial, with neet rates of 15% in the north-east of England, compared with 9.4% in the south-west.Results from a recent survey of schools in the Greater Manchester region based on 100,000 students reveal that many young people are losing their sense of connection with school as they progress. While 67% of pupils told the #BeeWell survey that they felt a sense of belonging in year 7, this dropped to 51% by year 10. About 64% of pupils reported “good” wellbeing in year 7, compared with 55% in year 10.In a speech to the Institute for Government on Wednesday, Burnham will say: “Whitehall is simply not hearing the voices of these young people who need something very different from the education system. It is clear from the BeeWell survey that too many get to the end of secondary school and feel that the system has disinvested from them. Too many are leaving without hope and a clear path for the future.”He will call on the DfE to change schools policy and bring in a principle of parity between academic and technical education and the devolution of responsibility for the post-16 technical system. He will say: “Different regions of England have different economies and therefore it stands to reason that post-16 technical education is a prime candidate for devolution. The Department for Education’s long-running resistance to this is a significant barrier to growth.”To balance the EBacc, Burnham and his team have developed a Greater Manchester baccalaureate, or MBacc – a selection of subjects linked to seven sectoral gateways to the Greater Manchester economy. The ambition, by 2030, is to provide a high-quality 45-day work placement for every young person who wants one, linked toT-levelsand BTecs.The mayor will say that the country’s failure to tackle longstanding problems such as the rise in neets is a reflection of the top-down way in which it has been run. Burnham will call for radical change in the architecture and culture of the British state, with the new devolved bodies across England being given a much greater role in setting direction.He will say: “As a former minister, I have great respect for Whitehall and for the people who work within it. But it is not wired for growth. By definition, growth can’t be ordered from the top down by individual silos but has to be nurtured from the bottom up, linking education to transport, employment, planning and housing.“I give credit to the civil servants in government who have driven England’s devolution journey to this point but the truth is that all now need to get with the programme. Devolution needs to go much deeper and faster if we are to get the growth we need.”A DfE spokesperson said: “Getting young people into education, employment or training is key for our mission to grow the economy under our Plan for Change.“Through our new Youth Guarantee, every 18- to 21-year-old in England will have help to access an apprenticeship, quality training and education opportunities or help to find a job.“To give all young people the foundations they need to achieve and thrive, we’re also recruiting 6,500 new teachers, rolling out careers advice, increasing opportunities through Skills England, widening access to apprenticeships, improving mental health support in schools and delivering a cutting-edge curriculum to ensure pupils are set up for life, work and the future.”Explore more on these topicsYoung peopleThe ObserverManchesterAndy BurnhamGreater ManchesterSchoolsDepartment for EducationEnglish baccalaureatenewsShareReuse this content"

There is hardly any risk. It is easy, low cost and quite rewarding. We are calling on politicians around the globe to give law enforcement more charter – more resources.”He had earlier told GASA’s London conference on Wednesday that scams are a “penalty-free crime”.Rocio Concha,director of policy and advocacy at the consumer protection campaigner Which?, added: “Law enforcement has a crucial role to play in stopping the UK’s fraud epidemic and deterring scammers. Police, the government and businesses – such as telecoms firms, banks and online platforms – need to work together to share information about criminals and stop scams appearing in the first place.“However, we also need to be realistic about what UK law enforcement agencies can do to tackle organised criminal gangs who are often operating complex online scam operations outside the UK. An effective enforcement action by regulators is also needed to hit businesses with financial penalties when they fail to put the right systems in place to prevent scams.”Launching the government’s new initiative last week, UK fraud minister Lord Hanson told the GASA conference: “We need to hold criminals to account for actions, pursue them relentlessly and make sure we get outcomes … for victims.”He added that money lost to fraud is “going into other crime enterprises”.The $35m Georgian scam operation targeted people living in the UK more than any other country, with British residents accounting for a third – about £9m – of the money taken. Of about 2,000 victims globally who were persuaded to part with the largest sums, 652 were based in the UK – with the worst hit victims losing more than £100,000 each.While the Georgian prosecutors havelaunched a criminal investigation into a Tbilisi-based operation, it is not clear if they are receiving any support from international colleagues.When asked by the Guardian last week, the UK’s National Crime Agency did not say if it was collaborating with international agencies to investigate the call centre. The City of London police, which is the UK’slead police force for fraud, declined to answer when asked if it had offered Georgian authorities assistance.Explore more on these topicsScamsConsumer affairsInvestmentsCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

The sooner that emergency contraception is used, the more effective it is.As the NHS notes, the copper coil, or intrauterine device, can be accessed for nothing and is the more effective of the two options, but it must be fitted by a trained medical professional within five days.By contrast, the morning-after pill can be taken at home but must be used within three to five days, and theNHSwarns it may not be suitable for women who need to take steroid medicines for asthma or are overweight. The medication works by preventing or delaying the release of an egg, and does not cause an abortion.Scientists develop injection for long-lasting contraceptive implantRead moreThe new announcement aims to increase access to the morning-after pill; while it is already available for nothing from most GP surgeries, most sexual health clinics and some NHS walk-in centres, not all pharmacies offer it for nothing, with some women paying up to £30 for the medication.The health minister Stephen Kinnock said: “Equal access to safe and effective contraception is crucial to women’s healthcare and a cornerstone of a fair society.“Women across England face an unfair postcode lottery when seeking emergency contraception, with access varying dramatically depending on where they live. By making this available at community pharmacies, we will ensure all women can access this essential healthcare when they need it, regardless of where they live or their ability to pay.”The Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) said the move, in addition to reducing inequalities, was also expected to free up GP appointments. The DHSC noted that routine contraception was already available for nothing from pharmacies, GPs and local sexual and reproductive health services.Nick Kaye, the chair of the National Pharmacy Association, which represents about 6,000 independent pharmacies across the UK, welcomed the announcement.“We’ve long called for national commissioning of emergency contraception, so this is good news for patients and pharmacies alike,” he said.“For too long, access to free services has been a postcode lottery for patients, with local arrangements only existing in certain parts of the country and often being underfunded. Pharmacies are under enormous pressure amid the impact of record cuts to their budgets, so it is important any scheme fully reimburses them for this work.”Dr Janet Barter, President of the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health said, “This is tremendous news and something we’ve long been calling for. For too long, too many women have struggled to get access to emergency contraception just because they don’t live in the right postcode. By making it uniformly available at community pharmacies we’ll be removing the cost, stigma and access issues that have been a real barrier for women.”The announcement is part of wider efforts by the government to reform community pharmacies as part of its “plan for change”, with the aim of increasing services and reducing pressure on hospitals, with the DHSC revealing it has agreed an additional £617m in funding with Community Pharmacy England worth an extra £617m over two years. The government is also writing off £193m of debt for community pharmacy owners.As well as the expansion of free access to the morning-after pill, the DHSC said people with depression would be offered support at pharmacies when they were prescribed antidepressants, with more of the pharmacy team able to offer services such as medicines and prescriptions advice.Kinnock said: “Community pharmacists are at the heart of local healthcare, and we want them to play a bigger role as we shift care out of hospitals and into the community through our plan for change.”Kaye said: “Pharmacies will be relieved to have certainty about their financial position and news of the first increase in their funding for 11 years. After a decade of 40% cuts to their funding that has left the pharmacy network on its knees, it is good to see a concrete sign that ministers want to support pharmacies, which have so much potential to achieve the government’s vision of care closer to communities.“No one wants to reduce services through protest action so we’ll look carefully at the detail and consult our members, who are facing substantial cost increases from 1 April, to understand what this means for the future of their services so we can recommend next steps.”Explore more on these topicsContraception and family planningNHSEnglandHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

British pubs, restaurants and hospitality firms brace for rise in NICsAn increase in national insurance and a rising living wage is leading to predictions of a hiring freeze across the sector. But not every economist agreesRichard PartingtonEconomics correspondentSun 30 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTShare‘It’s very tough. We’re really being forced to question whether this is viable,” says Dan Brod, who has spent the past 16 years building his small chain of luxury pubs and restaurants in England’s idyllic south-west.From next weekend, the owner of the Beckford Group, alongsidealmost one million other businesses, will be hit with a combined£25bn rise in employer national insurance contributions(NICs) as Rachel Reeves’s autumn budget measures come into effect. With a worsening economic backdrop, the fear is the change will only make matters worse.“My personal politics are slightly left of centre, but it seems odd the government is asking us to raise prices and employ less people. There is no other answer than that,” Brod says.Last week at thespring statement, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) said Reeves’s tax changes were contributing to falling recruitment and rising redundancies. Coupled with a 6.7% increase in the national living wage from Tuesday, to £12.21 per hour for those aged 21 and over, theBank of England has also warnedemployers are freezing hiring plans.The chancellor argues the money is badly needed to plug a shortfall in the government finances left by the Conservatives – with the position made significantly worse by soaring borrowing costs and a weak economic outlook – while providing sufficient cash to fix Britain’s battered public services. Her critics, however, say taxing employment could be a counterproductive solution.“It was a cardinal error. I understand the thinking, but it is a case of the politics overtaking the economics,” says Charlie Bean, an ex-OBR board member and former Bank of England deputy governor.Graph showing fall in vacancies“There has been enough pushback from business and it’s becoming clear what the adverse effects are. But any chance of U-turn? From an economic point of view that would be sensible, and raise the money elsewhere.”Bean would have preferred a rise in income tax, employee NICs, or VAT. Reeves had, though, ruled that out to help Labour cruise to a crushing general election victory last July.From 6 April, the rate of employer NICs will rise from 13.8% to 15%, underplans announced by Reeves last October. The threshold for the tax being levied will also be slashed from £9,100 to £5,000 a year, in a part of the plan which business leaders warn will hit temporary and low-paid jobs particularly hard.While 250,000 employers will benefit from an offsetting tax relief, as many as 940,000 – including major high street retailers, small firms, care providers, charities, and councils – will lose out, according to HMRC.Alongside sounding the alarm on redundancies, business leaders warn their profits will be hit, pay increases for staff will be less generous, and they will be forced to pass on the higher costs of employment to customers – threatening to add to already bubbling inflationary pressures.Hospitality, leisure and retail will be hit particularly hard, largely as these sectors employ more low-paid workers and temporary staff, where slashing the NICs threshold will have the biggest impact. “It is the most regressive tax change I have seen in 30 years in hospitality,” says Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UKHospitality. “The government points to tough choices, but it belies that tough choices are being made by businesses about this.”Mike Gavin, director of Arc Hospitality Recruitment, a Merseyside-based agency specialising in hospitality, hires 9,000 workers each year. These include waiters, bar staff, chefs and kitchen porters for Premier League football clubs including Liverpool, Everton, Manchester United and Arsenal.“We’re likely to see an effective doubling in our employer NI bill,” he says. His company has moved offices to save money, and is negotiating with clients on splitting the cost. “It goes right down the wire until we get to April. There is going to be a financial impact and it won’t be an insignificant one.”Reeves has faced down business complaints by challenging her opponents for alternative ideas. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats have sought to label the changes as a “jobs tax”. But the chancellor told the Commons last week: “They cannot object to the tax increases and support the money we have invested in our public services. To say otherwise, I am afraid, is fairytales and the magic money tree – it just does not add up.”Graph showing falling employmentPart of Labour’s plan is likely to rest on the idea that Britain’s economy, for too long, has been fuelled by low-paid and insecure work. Ministers are pushing ahead with the biggest shake-up ofworkers’ rightsin decades, to the dismay of many business groups who say it only adds to their costs and will further hit hiring.But some experts say the changes will incentivise employers to invest in technology, rather than resorting to low-paid, unskilled work. The fashion retailer Next says it does not plan to cut jobs, but willuse more mechanisationin warehouses and shops to offset rising costs. Greggs says a rising living wage will putmore money in customers’ pocketsto spend on its sausage rolls and pasties. Meanwhile, Andy Haldane, the former Bank of England chief economist, reckons Reeves’s budget was “pro-growth” becausefunding public servicesprovides employers with a healthier, better-educated, and more mobile workforce. “You can’t have it both ways. If you want to build the right business environment you require investment in those things, and that requires us to pay for those things,” he told theGuardianlast year.Official jobs market data also showsemployment is holding upfar better than the business community suggests – confounding recent business surveys suggesting thefastest pace of job shedding since the 2008 financial crisis, excluding the pandemic.Even with reliability issues with the headline employment figures, other data – including for vacancies and HMRC payroll information – suggests the industry has over-egged the scale of the problem.It helps that the policy comes in a tight jobs market, with wage growth running at among the highest rates in decades, as many employers struggle to find staff amid the loss of readily available EU labour after Brexit, and thesurge in working-age adults leaving the jobs marketdue to ill health.A sudden stop, though, was never really on the cards. Firms have known about the 6 April NICs increase for the past five months, and are spreading out their response over time; a slow-puncture effect is more likely.View image in fullscreenDan Brod, founder of Beckford Group, says his employment and investment plans will take a hit.Photograph: Millie Pilkington/The GuardianStill, vacancy rates are falling faster in hospitality than for other industries, while business leaders say the tax changes will undermine Labour’s main goal: to grow the economy.“It has knocked business confidence and make it harder for firms to hire, invest and grow,” says Louise Hellem, chief economist at the CBI. “Firms are squarely behind this government’s growth mission and want them to succeed. But it’s the capacity for businesses to invest that will decide whether we grow or not. They need a boost in confidence.”Growth has come close to stagnation in recent months; withzero progressin the third quarter of last year and a nugatory 0.1% in the final three months of 2024. Things have not improved much: the economy shrank by 0.1% in January.Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, says the tax changes will make turning this around harder. “The government should be in no doubt that hiking the cost of doing business is causing pubs to reassess decisions around investment, prices and hiring.”As the operator of one of the country’s biggest pub chains, employing 40,000 staff, Mackenzie would normally spend about £200m each year on its estate of 2,600 pubs, restaurants and hotels. However – as for many operators – less could be spent on refurbishment projects, new bars, and garden refurbs in future.Some pub operators are closing earlier during the week to save costs. Shepherd Neame, the UK’s oldest brewer, isputting up its prices, while the British Beer and Pub Association blames tax rises for the nationwide average price of a pinthitting £5. “We want to be able to invest more and keep prices low, but the ­government needs to reduce these spiralling costs to allow us to do so,” Mackenzie says.Graph showing number of ‘NEETS” has reached 0.9mChoking off recruitment in hospitality could also hit another of the government’s most important priorities: getting more people into work. Ministers want to hit an employment rate of 80%, up from 75% at present, with a focus on helping young adults and those with health conditions in particular.Youth unemployment has risen sharply, with the number of 16- to 24-year-oldsnot in employment, education or training (Neet) at almost one million, the highest level for more than a decade. Reeves’s spring statement benefit cuts were also justified by the argument that they would help more people to find work.Nicholls says the tax changes will dent progress. “Unfortunately, the cost of creating new roles has substantially increased. Employers are much less likely to take a risk on somebody who might not be able to work full-time – those are the opportunities that will get cut first.”Bean agrees. “Someone on disability benefit is unlikely to transfer straight into a middle-management job in a big company or something. They’re likely to go for more entry-level, flexible jobs. It is particularly shortsighted.”With more than 240 staff at his restaurants in Bath, and boutique pubs in rural Somerset and Wiltshire, Brod says he is putting his hiring plans on ice. Already barely turning a profit, with wage costs taking up 40% of turnover, he says price rises are tough when consumers have been stretched by the cost of living crisis – meaning his employment and investment plans will take the hit.“Not everyone can become an AI programmer. Not all our young staff, looking for a first job, can go and work in tech or engineering. A, those jobs don’t exist yet, and B, we’re not suddenly going to build loads of factories.“The clue should be in the name: ‘Labour’. It seems to be anti-labour, anti-jobs That is a really weird thing for me. I can see why they did it, but I don’t think it was the right thing to go for.”Explore more on these topicsHospitality industryThe ObserverNational insuranceUnemploymentPubsAutumn budget 2024featuresShareReuse this content"

Mahmoud Khalil – our colleague, our classmate, our friend – was unjustly arrested with the active complicity of Sipa’s administration, which has chosen surveillance and collaboration with federal agencies and law enforcement over protecting its students.”US academic groups sue White House over planned deportations of pro-Gaza studentsRead moreOutside of campus Saturday, several alumni held their diplomas while others held signs that read “Shame on SIPA”.Speaking at the protest, Amali Tower, a 2009 Sipa alum, ripped her diploma andsaid: “It’s not easy to do this, with none of us doing this lightly. There’s no joy in this.”Tower went on to add: “I’m not a proud alumni at all, and instead I want to stand with the students, and I want to stand with Palestinians, and I want to stand with immigrants who are being rounded up and harassed, oppressed and deported as we speak.”Another student, Hannah, who only provided her first name to media outlets due to concerns for her safety, also ripped her diploma andsaid: “I’m here today because I’m Jewish, and my Jewish beliefs tell me to show up for communities that are being oppressed, that are being targeted.”She criticized the university’s former president Minouche Shafik who oversaw the police crackdowns on student protesters in the spring of 2024, as well as Shafik’s successors Katrina Armstrong and incoming president, Claire Shipman.“I think Minouche Shafik did an awful job. I think the interim president Armstrong did an awful job,” Hannah said. “I think Shipman is going to do an awful job because they’re not listening to their students. They’re listening to the board of trustees.”Jasmine Sarryeh, a current student at Sipa and a friend of Khalil’s,said: “Students are terrified to set foot on campus. I’m one of them, so just the fact that I’m here is scary because [of] the way that our colleagues have disappeared.”She added: “Mahmoud is a very loved community member, and the fact that he was taken away from his eight months’ pregnant wife and from all of us here at Sipa is devastating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Le Pen appointed Jordan Bardella, 29, as RN president in 2021 but a senior party member said there was “no plan B” if Le Pen was ruled immediately ineligible to stand in 2027, and accused the party of sticking its head in the sand.Marc de Fleurian, the RN MP for Pas-de-Calais, said: “The question of ineligibility doesn’t arise. It’s not taboo, but as long as we’ve said that such injustice cannot happen, it won’t.”Le Pen and 24 others from RN, including party officials, employees, MEPs and assistants, were tried last November on charges of taking money from the European parliament as part of an alleged fake jobs scam. Instead of the money being spent on EU staff, they were accused of having used it to pay party staff in France. The European parliament estimated the allegedly embezzled funds amounted to about €7m. Le Pen and the others have denied the charges.Any verdict that does not clear Le Pen of wrongdoing will leave her political future in grave doubt. If she is found guilty of embezzlement she will almost certainly appeal, which will require a new trial to be held, and any prison sentence or fine will be postponed until the appeal hearing is judged. If she is given a five-year bar on standing for public office with immediate effect it will be unlikely she can enter the 2027 presidential race unless the appeal process is speeded up and she is cleared in time to stand. If the judges decide the bar on standing should be postponed, she will still have what one RN member described as a “Damoclean sword” hanging over her political campaign.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are methods – there are methods which you could do it, as you know.”Welker alluded to a purported loophole some Trump supporters have fantasized about finding in which he could be the running mate to his vice-president, JD Vance, or someone else in the 2028 election. The person to whom Trump would be the running mate in that scenario could then immediately resign after winning and being sworn in as president, letting Trump take over by succession.Their argument would be that the constitution’s 22nd amendment only explicitly bans being “elected” to more than two presidential terms without saying anything about becoming the commander-in-chief on an additional occasion through succession.Vance has not indicated he is interested in participating in such a plan. And an election law professor at Notre Dame, Derek Muller,toldthe Associated Press that the constitution’s 12th amendment says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for the vice-presidency, either.“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.Nonetheless, Welker theorized that Vance could somehow “pass the baton” to Trump.Trump replied, “Well, that’s one.”“But there are others too. There are others.”When pushed to detail those methods, Trump said, “No.”Trump then said it was “far too early to think about” trying to defy the two presidential term limit in the constitution to stay in office and that he was “focused on the current”. But asked if being president a third time would be too much work, he said: “I like working.”And asked if he was just joking, as he and his supporters like to say whenever he floats anti-constitutional ideas, he said: “No, no, I’m not joking. I’m not joking.”Trump’s comments came after he previously likened himself to a “king” – the royal title without term limits – on social media.In February, he prompted widespreadoutcrywhen he took to Truth Social following his executive order for New York City to rescind its congestion pricing program and wrote: “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all ofNew York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”The White House then proceeded toshareTrump’s quote on social media, accompanied with a computer-generated image of the president grinning on a fake Time magazine cover while wearing a golden crown, behind him the skyline of New York City.Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Andy Ogles of Tennesseeintroduceda resolution in January expressing support for amending the constitution into allowing a president to serve up to three terms – under the condition that they did not serve two consecutive terms.Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W Bush – who all served two consecutive terms – could not seek a third term under an amendment like the one posited by Ogles, which would stand virtually no chance of passing. Only Trump would be eligible for a third term because he won the presidency in 2016 and in November 2024 but lost in 2020 to Joe Biden.Nevertheless, not all members of the Trump-led Republican party are on board with the idea of changing the constitution to let the president stay in power beyond the end of his second term in early 2029. After Trump’s “King” comments in February, the Republican US senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahomasaidhe would not back an unconstitutional third term under Trump.“I’m not changing the constitution, first of all, unless the American people chose to do that,” Mullin told NBC.To modify presidential term limits wouldrequiretwo-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country’s state legislatures. Trump’s enablers do not have the numbers required in those various contexts to easily get that approval democratically.The 22nd amendment was ratified after Franklin D Roosevelt served two terms following his election in 1932 – and was then re-elected in 1940 and 1944 amid the second world war. He died as president in 1945, and the 22nd amendment was ratified in 1951.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Images were broadcast live on YouTube.The uncrewed rocket was billed as the first attempt at an orbital flight to originate from Europe, where several countries, including Sweden and Britain, have said they want a share of the growing market for commercial space missions.Orbital rockets are designed to place loads such as satellites into or beyond Earth’s orbit.View image in fullscreenThe rocket explodes.Photograph: APIsar Aerospace, which had warned the initial launch could end prematurely, said the test produced extensive data that its team could learn from.The rocket lifted off from the pad at 12.30pm local time (11.30am BST) on Sunday and flew for about half a minute before the flight was terminated, Isar said.“This allowed the company to gather a substantial amount of flight data and experience to apply on future missions,” Isar said in a statement. “After the flight was terminated at T+30 seconds, the launch vehicle fell into the sea in a controlled manner.”The European Space Agency’s director general, Josef Aschbacher, posted on X: “Success to get off the pad, and lots of data already obtained. I am sure @isaraerospace will learn a lot. Rocket launch is hard. Never give up, move forward with even more energy!”The Spectrum is designed for small- and medium-sized satellites weighing up to one metric tonne, although it did not carry a payload on its maiden voyage from the spaceport inNorway.The mission was intended to collect data on Isar Aerospace’s launch vehicle in a first integrated test of all its systems, the Bavarian company said last week.View image in fullscreenThe Spectrum awaits on a launchpad at the Andøya spaceport in Nordmela, on Andøya island, Norway.Photograph: Simon Fischer/Isar Aerospace/Photo Wingmen Media/APThe company, headquartered in Munich, had previously said it would consider a 30-second flight a success. While not intended to reach orbit on its first mission, the test marked the first commercial orbital flight from a launchpad on the European continent, excluding Russia.European countries have long relied on paying for launches from Russian space stations but the relationship has broken down since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.US companies, notably SpaceX, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are emerging as big players in a budding industry to send satellites, such as broadband internet or observation equipment, into space for governments and private businesses. Chinese companies are also seeking to capitalise on the new sector.Many estimates suggest the global space industry could generate revenues of more than $1tn (£770bn) within the next two decades.‘We’re in a new era’: the 21st-century space race takes offRead moreIsar Aerospace intends Spectrum to be able to launch up to 1,000kg into low-Earth orbit, an area of space up to about 1,200 miles high where most satellites shoot around the globe. Founded in 2018, the startup developed its rocket almost entirely in-house.View image in fullscreenThe Spectrum did not carry a payload on its intended maiden voyage.Photograph: Simon Fischer/Isar Aerospace/Photo Wingmen Media/APBefore the test flight, Aschbacher had said: “Whatever the outcome, Isar Aerospace’s upcoming Spectrum launch will be historic: the first commercial orbital launch from mainland Europe. The support and co-funding the European Space Agency has given Isar Aerospace and other launch service provider startups is paying off for increased autonomy in Europe.”Last year, a report by Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president and former prime minister of Italy, recommended Europe could boost its economic growth by recognising space as a key sector. Independent access to space is also increasingly seen as a geopolitical and security issue.Nasa’s new Spherex telescope lifts off to map cosmos in unprecedented detailRead moreEurope’s space industry has experienced delays in the development of the Ariane 6 rocket and the suspension of the European Vega-C satellite launcher after an accident.In addition to Isar Aerospace, Europe is home to Germany’s HyImpulse and Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), the French groups Latitude and MaiaSpace, andSpain’s PLD Space.Several destinations around Europe have been marked for spaceport projects, includingthe British Shetland Islands, the Portuguese Azores, and Esrange in Sweden. Coastal areas near stretches of open water are considered ideal spots for launch sites, as rockets do not have to fly over heavily populated land areas.Britain has had mixed success as a launch destination.

It acts as the parent company for more than 200 restaurants and popular entertainment spots, including Soho House Istanbul.The star of its restaurant portfolio is a chain owned by the Turkish chef and restaurateur Nusret Gökçe, better known as Salt Bae, who parlayed his status as an internet meme about sprinkling salt on meat into a businesscharging up to £700 for a steakat its London outpost.“We do not buy products of those who advertise on NTV. We do not watch NTV … We do not pass through Nusr-Et’s door,” said Özel, naming Gökçe’s eponymous brand of steakhouses.Turkey’s young ‘hope of millions’ held in jail as Erdoğan cracks down on protestsRead moreThe CHP leader also called on Turkish companies not to advertise on pro-government media channels that have broadcast limited news of the protests, often hewing closely to Erdoğan’s depiction of the demonstrations as “a movement of violence”.1:14Hundreds of thousands join protest in defence of Erdoğan rival jailed in Turkey – videoThe detention of İmamoğlu sparked Turkey’s largest anti-government protests in years, with people gathering nightly around Istanbul city hall and frequently clashing with police. But with the opposition calling for an end to the nightly demonstrations, the burgeoning protest movement is at a crossroads.The CHP is attempting to shepherd a nationwide protest movement that quickly grew to include demands far beyond İmamoğlu’s freedom, with demonstrators calling for an end to the democratic backsliding that has occurred under Erdoğan’s rule, as well as the liberation of the Kurdish former presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtaş.Despite the CHP taking the lead by calling for the initial demonstrations, the protest movement includes other political parties, students and other groups with their own agendas and concerns. These include calls for a halt to a years-long cost of living crisis, increased judicial independence, and freedom for hundreds of student protest leaders detained in the past 10 days.Small pockets of protest have continued across Istanbul after Özel called a halt to demonstrations at city hall, with crowds gathering primarily in opposition strongholds to protest against the government. Demonstrators also gathered outside the headquarters of Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog, RTÜK, in Ankara, furious at the live broadcast bans handed down to channels aligned to the opposition.These protests were often swarmed by police, who detained more than 1,900 people in the 12 days since İmamoğlu was seized in a dawn raid, accused of corruption. The opposition has claimed that prisons in Istanbul are filled with protesters, with many now taken to facilities outside Turkey’s largest city.Turkey says Swedish journalist detained on terror charges and for ‘insulting the president’Read moreSome organisers believe security forces targeted student leaders for arrest, in an effort to stifle street protests. Members of a teaching union and another for textile workers have been subject to house arrest, according to rights groups.As the protests entered their second week and the CHP held rallies in Istanbul, the government declared an extended public holiday for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr.View image in fullscreenPeople wave flags and chant slogans during a mass protest in support of Ekrem İmamoğlu in Istanbul on Saturday.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesTalya Aydın, a 28-year-old protester, said the government had “miscalculated” in thinking the break would cool the protests that have surged across university campuses, hoping students in urban centres would leave for the holiday.“They’re so disconnected from the public that they’re not grasping just how expensive they’ve made bus and train tickets to get back home for these students,” she said. “Plus the students do not want to leave, to yield these streets.”The students, she added, had never known a leader other than Erdoğan or his Justice and Development party, which has overseen recent changes that have caused the cost of living to rise.“So of course, for them it’s about change, but it’s also about the austerity measures that they’ve been forced to accept,” she said.The CHP has directed its supporters’ ire towards a growing list of products and services to boycott, including Turkey’s most popular chocolate brand, the coffee chain Espressolab, a home appliances company and a chain of malls.The boycott has drawn members of Turkey’s urban middle class into the anti-government movement, including many who said they were previously unable to attend the protests. Serkan, a pilates teacher who declined to give his full name, said he was forgoing his regular trips to Espressolab with his son, despite his enthusiasm for their Americanos.“I love it there, but it’s on the boycott list now, so I’m not going,” he said. “Usually the one I pass is full of students, but right now it’s empty.”The result has been nothing short of a culture war, with supporters of the government photographing themselves lining up at branches of Espressolab, many clutching bags from a bookshop chain also on the boycott list. A website listing companies included in the boycott call was blocked by regulators soon after it launched.Erdoğan has made his displeasure at the boycotts clear, accusing the protest movement of trying to weaken the Turkish economy. “We will not give credit to reckless politicians who seek to disrupt traders, bankrupt industrialists and sabotage entrepreneurs with irresponsible boycott calls,” he said.Aydın, a member of the Workers’ party of Turkey, said she viewed the boycott as the first step towards a general strike, amid growing participation from trade unions and the Turkish labour movement.“The trade unions are in talks, developments are happening as we speak. So I think when people aren’t at work next week due to the extended holiday, things are going to snowball,” she said.“I think the boycotts have worked. We’ve seen these absurd scenes where riot police are protecting branches of Espressolab.”She added that the growing wave of arrests had done little to quell people’s fear of demonstrating. “It is not a deterrent. There is no atmosphere of fear,” said Aydın. “Instead, people are saying: ‘We have already given 2,000 of our youth to these arrests … there is no turning back from this.’”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropePress freedomProtestConstruction industryHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Universities and media are targeted in a clampdown on free expression.A widely revered cultural institution undergoes a government takeover and is given a conservative makeover.Wrongfooted opposition politicians try to recover ground by highlighting the rising cost of dietary staples and the failure to address the kitchen-table issues that voters elected the president to solve.Fitting as all this might be as a summary of the helter-skelter opening phase of Trump’s second presidency, it also describes events that followed the election ofMahmoud Ahmadinejadas president of Iran 20 years ago.Ahmadinejad emerged as anarch-nemesis of the westafter rising to power from obscurity in 2005. His offensive diatribes against Israel – which he suggested should beerased from the map– and repeateddenials of the Holocaustwere the stuff of cartoon villainy, sharpened further by his hawkish championing of Iran’s nuclear programme.He was also an electoral populist in the Trump mould, as adept at drawing vast crowds with his message of championing the left-behinds and dispossessed as he was at riling his opponents.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump: ‘much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding’, according to Steven Levitsky.Photograph: Francis Chung/EPAIranians have noticed the matching personas. “There was a joke inIranduring Trump’s first term that when he became president, Iran finally managed to export its revolution,” said Vali Nasr, an Iranian-born international affairs scholar at Johns Hopkins University. “Trump was basically Ahmadinejad in the US.”In a striking twist,Ahmadinejad even addressed Columbia University– an institution nowthreatened with grant cuts by the Trump administrationover an alleged failure to combat campus antisemitism by tolerating pro-Palestinian protesters – in a 2007 visit to New York. The university’s then president, Lee Bollinger, assailed him to his face for his Holocaust denial and called him a “cruel and petty dictator”, a description that seemed to presage the criticisms of many of Trump’s opponents.The parallels, however, are superficial – and the differences just as significant.Ahmadinejad, remembered for his trademark man-of-the-people white jacket, defined himself by his frugality and surrounded himself with like types; Trump flaunts his wealth and seems to have space in his inner circle for billionaires, for whom he favours huge tax cuts.Ahmadinejad took what was already a seven on the repression scale and made it a nineKarim SadjadpourMoreover, any comparison between Iran and the US must come with a health warning.Iran, under the stifling religious regime that seized power after the1979 revolutionthat toppled the country’s former pro-western monarch, Shah Mohammad Pahlavi, was hardly a flourishing democracy before Ahmadinejad’s presidency – even after a period of relatively liberal reform under his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami.“He came to power in an already deeply authoritarian regime,” said Karim Sadjadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, who was in Iran when Ahmadinejad became president. “He took what was already a seven on the repression scale and made it a nine.”Yet the fact that any analogy can be drawn at all attests to the uncharted territory the US has entered under Trump.In recent weeks, as the president and his allies have assailed judges and hinted that they could flout court rulings, commentators and experts have warned of a looming constitutional crisis andlurch towards authoritarianism and even dictatorship.Scholars have touted a variety of global precedents in a quest for a parallel that might act as a guide for where US democracy is headed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The ascents of all three are often viewed as instances of democracies and once-independent institutions being emasculated and elections gamed to sustain the incumbent.More encouraging portents are seen in Poland and the Czech Republic, where rightwing populist nationalist forces lost power in the most recent elections to parties or presidential candidates committed to the liberal democratic mainstream and to international institutions such as the EU and Nato.Yet none seem to rival the sheer ferocity with which Trump has eviscerated federal agencies, denounced judges and churned out landscape-changing executive orders.The problem was summed up by Steven Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and author of books on democracy’s decline and autocracy’s rise, whotold the New York Timesthat he had seen nothing like Trump’s assault on democratic institutions.The best parallel I can see is the collapse of the Soviet UnionNader HashemiThe first two months under Trump had been “much more aggressively authoritarian than almost any other comparable case I know of democratic backsliding”, he said. “Erdoğan, [Venezuelan leader Hugo] Chávez, Orbán – they hid it.”Other observers agree that Trump’s moves are of greater magnitude than those seen in other democracies turned autocracies.“The best parallel that I can see is the collapse of the Soviet Union,” said Nader Hashemi, professor of Middle East and Islamic studies at Georgetown University and another academic of Iranian origin.“A political order that everyone thought had a long shelf life rapidly collapses, is completely disorienting, and people are trying to figure out what comes next.“We don’t really have precedents similar to this moment where you have a longstanding existing democracy that’s a major power that collapses so rapidly and quickly and is moving in the direction of authoritarianism. I think its impact will also be felt globally.”View image in fullscreenKing Henry VIII of England.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesNasr said Trump confounded comparisons with previous democracy-subverting authoritarians, likening the current White House to the court of King Henry VIII, the 16th-century monarch recalled for his six wives and for triggering the English reformation.“The way he’s setting up authority in the White House looks more like a Tudor monarchy than modern authoritarianism,” he said. “The White House looks more like an imperial court.”Trump, argued Nasr, “has a theory of rapid, massive change” that recalled the approach of military coup leaders in the third world who judged that their agenda was incompatible with democracy.The common bond between Trump and Ahmadinejad may be the forces that brought them to power.It created a class in Iran much like the people who voted for Brexit or people who voted for TrumpVali Nasr“One could say that the very first kind of backlash in our era against what economic liberalisation can do to a society happened in Iran,” said Nasr.Under Ahmadinejad’s two presidential predecessors, Khatami and Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, liberal economic reforms intended to generate prosperity after years of post-revolutionary austerity produced an affluent, consumerist middle class – but left behind a disaffected population group that felt it had lost out.“It created a class in Iran much like the people who voted for Brexit [in Britain] or people who voted for Trump,” Nasr said. “So [Ahmadinejad] was anti-establishment in the way Boris Johnson was during Brexit, or Trump was during his two campaigns. There is definitely a parallel there.”Hashemi saw another parallel in Trump’s attacks on universities and the media – a trend which Iran witnessed (accompanied with much greater repression) even before Ahmadinejad took power, as hardliners tried to snuff out the freedoms that reformists had introduced.“Then Ahmadinejad comes and continues in an authoritarian direction,” he said. “The parallel between that period and now in the United States is that authoritarian regimes hate independent institutions, the press and particularly universities, because they foster free thinking, they hold power to account. That’s why we’re seeing this attack on Columbia University and other universities.”Ahmadinejad, having stoked inflation with populist cash handouts and facilitated the Revolutionary Guards’ takeover of the economy, was ultimately thwarted by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s supreme leader and most powerful cleric, who marginalised him while using Ahmadinejad’s authoritarian impulses to accrue more autocratic powers to himself.Trump – having subjugated the Republican-ruled Congress, and who is now limited only by a constitutional bar on seeking a third term that some of his supporters are already clamouring to amend – is subject to no such constraints.“In a way, Trump’s conduct is more sinister because he’s trying to turn a democracy into an autocracy,” said Sadjadpour. Given the odium in which Ahmadinejad’s detractors once held him, it seems a particularly ominous verdict.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpMahmoud AhmadinejadIranUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a hope, say officials at the Frick Collection in New York, which reopens next month after a five-year, $220m (£170m) renovation.Axel Rüger, the director of the museum, which began with a trove of European masterpieces including Rembrandt and Vermeer, hopes that its art could be a reminder of US-European ties in these turbulent political times.“We are approaching a time when culture and education are not seen as priorities,” said Xavier Salomon, the Frick’s deputy director, at a preview of the renovated museum last week. “It’s a huge mistake, in my opinion, and I hope a place like this gives people a chance to think about the role of culture in our lives.”The Frick, which started with the collection of Henry Clay Frick, the Robber Baron-era industrialist, has long been an oasis from the intensity of the city – a home in a grand style but domestic in overall feel. Now it could be something more – a reminder that European culture and leadership was once held in high esteem by the ringmasters of US power.Reluctance by European travellers to visit the US has yet to show in official figures, as it has for Canadian visitors, but Eric Dresin, the secretary general of theEuropean Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations,told theNew York Timeslast week that “turbulent times” are anticipated.The museum’s old-world charm, updated by architect Annabelle Selldorf, now comes with additional galleries on an upper floor. It includes Ingres’s portrait of the Comtesse d’Haussonville and George Romney’s 1785 paintingLady Hamiltonas “Nature”, as well as François Boucher’s wall panels of frolicking children.“The whole collection, ultimately, comes from Europe,” said Rüger, newly installed as director of the Frick after serving as the secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the curator of Dutch painting at the National Gallery in London.Rüger notes that Frick, a Mennonite from Pennsylvania who made his fortune in steel, “first gravitated to English art and the aesthetic of the English country houses. It was not as intentional as it sounds now, but Americans looked to their ancestors, and a lot came from Europe.”View image in fullscreenAxel Rüger, the new director of the Frick Collection, pictured at at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam when he was the director.Photograph: Sabine Joosten/Press Association ImagesThe museum reopens as reciprocal tariffs, while not specifically targeting art, loom over a market already depressed by high interest rates, inflation, geopolitical instability and a shift in tastes. Global dealers are this weekend in Hong Kong, at Art Basel, hoping to lure Chinese and Asian buyers back into the market dominated by US sales.At the same time, the Trump administration is threatening to gut theInstitute of Museum and Library Services, which provides funding for museums and libraries across the US. Keith Sonderling, acting director of the agency, said he plans to steer it toward promoting “American exceptionalism” and cultivating “love of country”.Last Thursday Trump issued an executive order – “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” – promising to eliminate “divisive narratives” from the Smithsonian Institution’s museums and National Zoo, and restore “monuments, memorials, statues, markers” that have been removed over the past five years. A fact sheet describing the order said it will focus on removing “anti-American ideology”.In June the Frick will unveil Vermeer’s Love Letters – the Frick’sMistress and Maidand two loans,The Love Letterfrom the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, andWoman Writing a Letter, with Her Maidfrom the National Gallery of Ireland.Salomon said no one is sure the ladies are writing or receiving love letters, per se, but the themes of letter writing and epistolary exchange in 17th century domestic settings are intact nonetheless. “They may be shopping lists, who knows?”“Art from the past is always relevant, and as history changes around these works they assume a different significance,” Salomon said, pointing to Rembrandt’sThe Polish Rider, in the Frick collection, which acquired the title long after it was painted. It became a symbol of Polish freedom fighting and more recently, on loan to Poland, a symbol of support of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsThe ObserverArtnewsShareReuse this content"

He talks about why he would never have made it as a live action movieSun 30 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen the acclaimed French film-maker Michel Hazanavicius was approached by his parents’ best friend, the author and playwright Jean-Claude Grumberg, to adapt his fairytaleThe Most Precious of Cargoes(2019) into an animated film, hehesitated. The short book is a fable about the Holocaust, and the extraordinary acts of kindness that people are capable of. Although moved by it, Hazanavicius was initially reluctant: he had never made an animated film, and he thought he would never make a film about the Holocaust. The grandson of eastern European immigrants who came to France from Lithuania and Poland in the 1920s, Hazanavicius, 58, had felt that the subject was not his to tell. “It was more my grandparents’ and my parents’ story, not mine,” he says, speaking from his home in the 10th arrondissement, Paris, the sunlight streaming through the window behind him. “I was born in Paris in the late 1960s, and I had a wonderful, very happy childhood.” That period, however, coincidedwith when Holocaust denial began and survivors, who had until then remained silent, started to speak out about their experiences in the camps. “For many years, the priority [of those seeking to preserve the memory] was hearing testimony from witnesses. And I thought fiction on the subject was not appropriate.”It was Hazanavicius’s wife, the actor Bérénice Bejo – who starred as Peppy Miller, an ambitious young actress inThe Artist, Hazanavicius’s Academy Award-winning film about Hollywood’s black-and-white silent era – who changed his mind. Bejo told him he had not explained enough about his family’s Jewish history to his four children, now aged 26, 23, 16 and 13, and she persuaded Hazanavicius to take on the project, not only for them, but also for other people’s children. “[I realised] that if I hadn’t told my kids stories about my family–how they came to France and what happened during the war – it was likely that other [Jewish parents] hadn’tpassed on [their heritage] either.”It’s impossible to show the lives, loves and dreams of 6 million people, and the cruelty or evilness of how they diedThe Most Precious of Cargoesfollows a poor woodcutter’s wife (voiced in the film by Dominique Blanc) who rescues a baby girl from the snow, thrown by her father from one of the many trains bound for Auschwitz that pass through the forest where she lives with her husband (Grégory Gadebois). The woman has lost her own child and, aware that the baby might be Jewish – she is wrapped in a tallit (Jewish prayer shawl) – she manages to convince her reluctant husband that they should look after her, despite the risks. As the circumstances and fate of the baby’s family become known, the little girl transforms the lives of the couple, as well as those whose path she crosses.Hazanavicius has described the story as ultra fiction. “To me, Grumberg’s story felt as if it had always existed, and I wanted the film to be in keeping with that.” It begins with, “Once upon a time…” (narrated by the late Jean-Louis Trintignant) and employs another device of the fairytale in not naming characters. “By doing so, it makes it universal,” says Hazanavicius. The film then gradually subverts the form by introducing historical reality into the story.View image in fullscreenFor The Most Precious of Cargoes, Hazanavicius drew all the main characters himself.Photograph: Ex NihiloThe Most Precious of Cargoes, which took more than five years to make, premiered at Cannes last year where it was nominated for the Palme d’Or. The critic Leila Latif, writing inIndieWire, said that the film was an “unflinching but elegant Holocaust fable”.The previous year at Cannes,The Zone of Interestwon the Grand Prix and the Fipresci prize for director Jonathan Glazer. Both films approach their subject indirectly. “It’s impossible to show the lives, loves and dreams of about 6 million people, and the cruelty or the evilness of how they died,” says Hazanavicius. Glazer’s technique is to convey the atrocities off-screen through the exclusive use of sound; Hazanavicius’s differs. “I try to activate the imagination or the knowledge of the audience through suggestion.”For their film, it was obvious to Grumberg and Hazanavicius that it would be an animated feature and not live action. “I would never have made it with live actors because of the subject matter,” Hazanavicius says emphatically. “We all know that Brad Pitt is not a spy, for example, but we suspend our incredulity. When representing theHolocauston screen this can be very uncomfortable, even obscene.If I make a shot with a deported man on a train going to Auschwitz, we all know that out of frame, if he [the actor] is hungry he’ll have some chocolate, and if he’s thirsty he’ll have some water. That is a problem for me.” The advantage of animation is nothing is real, he says. “The drawings do not lie. There’s nothing out of frame. The drawings are an evocation of something. Paradoxically, the drawings that are very far from reality might be more realistic.”View image in fullscreenJean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo in The Artist (2011).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarAn art school graduate, Hazanavicius drew all the main characters, “as an artist, not an animator. I draw in a very traditional way, using pencil and paper,” he explains, disappearing briefly to find examples of his black-and-white drawings, which include headshots of the woodcutter’s wife. “As I thought the book was a classic tale, the idea was to have classical animation, not 3D or Japanese style.”His initial vision was not dissimilar to early Disney films, but the rounded, childlike images did not seem appropriate for the story. He turned to French and Russian painting and was also inspired by the 19th-century Japanese artist Hiroshige’s use of heavy, black outlines and blocks of colour in his portrayal of people and nature. Eventually, Hazanavicius and his team of animators combined bold lines and colour with the engraving style of illustration, used by the artist Henri Rivière, one of the leading proponents of 19th-century Japonisme.There is little dialogue and what there is has been taken from Grumberg’s book, including the naming of Jews as “the Heartless”. At first, the gruff, antisemitic woodcutter wants nothing to do with the baby, even refusing to have her in his house. Eventually, when he touches her and feels her heart beating, he realises that the Heartless have a heart and he starts to discover his own compassion.I’ve done a lot of screenings with teenagers from a variety of backgrounds, and they have all been moved by itThe Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat created the original score. “The music is a very important voice: it really contributes to the soul of the movie,” saysHazanavicius, adding that sound is also vital in telling the story. Is it a substitute for dialogue? “Oh yeah. Usually, as a director, for important things, I prefer to use silence,” he replies with a smile, a nod toThe Artist. Yet here sound is a mechanism for introducing real life: the crunch of footsteps in the snow, birdsong, the rustle of wind in the trees or the baby’s laughter. But there is something pragmatic too. “The woodcutters are simple men and women. They don’t speak much. And I didn’t want the deported man, the father of the baby, to speak. I mean, there’s nothing to say.”Hazanavicius grew up in Paris. After art school, he worked as a director on commercials and TV series, and in 1999 released his first feature,Mes Amis.Two spy parody films,OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of SpiesandOSS 117: Lost in Rio,followed, but it wasThe Artistthat catapulted him to global acclaim, winning five Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. He is currently adapting another book,The Third Hand, set during the first world war and the early 1920s.Watch a trailer for The Most Precious of Cargoes.Although work began onThe Most Precious of Cargoesprior to the Israel-Gaza war, it is being released during a time of global unrest and rising antisemitism. Have these factors affected viewers’ responses? “I don’t think so. I’ve done a lot of screenings with teenagers from a variety of backgrounds, and they have all been moved by it.” The only repercussion he has experienced is difficulty finding a US distributor, and discussions are ongoing. “Businessmen are not as clever as teenagers,” he says wryly.For Havanavicius, the message of the film is a very simple one. “It’s about the Righteous Among the Nations: the men and women who risked their lives to help others, who did the right thing. It says, we can all make that choice.”The Most Precious of Cargoesis in UK and Irish cinemas on Friday.

But while the movie itself became a cult classic, perhaps its biggest legacy is its soundtrack, which went platinum, won a Grammy and became a cultural touchstone among a certain subset of the American population.So it was no surprise that, when Braff announced a 20th-anniversary concert celebrating the album, at which each of its dozen or so artists would perform, tickets were going for hundreds of dollars. This was Woodstock for elder millennials – at least a certain swath of us who, when the soundtrack came out in 2004, found an outlet for our big teenage feelings in bands like the Shins, Frou Frou and Iron and Wine. All three were among the performers at Los Angeles’s Greek Theater on Saturday evening (technically nearly 21 years after the album’s release). The concert raised money for the Midnight Mission, a century-old LA charity fighting homelessness.One of the film’smost memorable scenesfeatures Natalie Portman handing Braff a pair of headphones, telling him the music he’s about to hear “will change your life, I swear”. At the show on Saturday, it was clear her words hadn’t just applied to Braff’s character. The Greek was packed with fans, including a strong contingent of cool-dad types; there were beanies, graying sideburns and jeans whose width would make gen Z shudder. Several people were wearing trash bags in honor of another of the film’s best-known scenes.View image in fullscreenNatalie Portman speaks onstagePhotograph: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Garden StateBraff, who curated the soundtrack and organized the concert, began the night by lamenting Portman’s absence – she couldn’t make it from her home in Paris, he said, as she joined him on stage. She was one of a host of surprise guests, who also included Danny DeVito, Sarah Paulson, and Donald Faison and Sarah Chalke of Scrubs, where Braff got his start. Taylor Swift was not there, but she contributed a signed guitar to be auctioned for the cause.The first performance was the last track on the album: Winding Road, an acoustic pop song by Bonnie Somerville. Then came Sophie Barker with In the Waiting Line, Zero 7’s mellow contribution, and Cary Brothers with a robust rendition of his song Blue Eyes. Clips from the film and behind-the-scenes footage played as the stage was rearranged between artists.The Birmingham, Alabama, alternative band Remy Zero reunited for the first time in 15 years to play Fair, from the film’s soundtrack, as well as Save Me, which didn’t appear in the film. “The only person in this world that could get us together is Zach Braff,” said the band’s singer, August Cinjun Tate. Thievery Corporation followed with an infectious performance of the sitar-led Lebanese Blond.View image in fullscreenFans watch Remy Zero at the Garden State 20th anniversary concertPhotograph: Matthew Cantor/The GuardianThe evening wasn’t without its technical difficulties; there were a few false starts to songs, occasional random audio feedback, and at one point the videos stopped working, so Braff came on stage and did a little dance to fill time. But the minor slip-ups only enhanced the relaxed, casual atmosphere; despite the 6,000-seat outdoor venue, it felt a bit like we were all in Braff’s living room as his favorite artists performed, not out of a sense of duty but for the joy of it. That joy extended to the crowd, who gave standing ovations to virtually every musician. I’d known that people loved the soundtrack in 2004, but I hadn’t been prepared for how that enthusiasm had endured.Among the evening’s highlights was Colin Hay’s performance of the heartbreaking I Just Don’t Think I’ll Ever Get Over You on a booming 12-string guitar. At 71, he performs with a particular gravitas, and his voice is as powerful as ever. Simon and Garfunkel were shockingly unavailable to play The Only Living Boy in New York, so the Milk Carton Kids covered it, with Braff noting that its chorus, about being gone without knowing where, felt appropriate: “I suppose that’s what I was really trying to write about in my early 20s, this abyss that I felt in my chest.” He added: “I couldn’t see it at the time, but 20 years later I think I can. Writing this story was definitely a callout to the universe … I was looking for like-minded souls who know that sometimes it helps if you can manage to laugh through some of those tears.” He applauded the community that had formed around the film, the tattoos and wedding proposals he’d witnessed, “the babies that were made – you know that you had sex to this soundtrack.”View image in fullscreenFrom left, Aimee Gatchalian, Alana Riddle Lantz, Kate Cochran, and Andy Lantz wearing trash bagsPhotograph: Matthew Cantor/The GuardianNext came Iron and Wine’s Sam Beam with his cover of the Postal Service’s Such Great Heights, followed by another of the night’s high points: a duet with Madison Cunningham on Nick Drake’s One of These Things First, with a tease of the Sesame Street theme song that fit oddly well.Imogen Heapand Guy Sigsworth, AKA Frou Frou, reunited for Let Go, as well as an improvised piece based on a melody provided by the audience. But perhaps the most striking performance of the night was another cover: the jazz musician Laufey’s version of Coldplay’s Don’t Panic, with just piano and vocals. Building from a delicate introduction to a powerful chorus, she transformed the two-minute song into a sweeping, dynamic piece that deserves its own release.Of course, the Shins were saved for last, performing New Slang – as heard in Portman’s headphones – and Caring Is Creepy. The soundtrack helped launch the band’s career; as the singer, James Mercer, said: “It changedmylife, I’ll tell you that.”Reflecting on that line, I found myself unexpectedly moved. Garden State came out at a moment when music was transitioning from physical to digital – it was a brief period in which songs were increasingly accessible, but there was still work involved in tracking them down, and a sense of pride in thinking you’d found an artist your friends might not know about. There was value in obscurity, or the perception of it.Or maybe that’s just how everyone feels at age 19. Either way, the soundtrack offered many listeners that crate-digging experience – an introduction to artists like the Shins, or even Nick Drake, whose posthumous star was rising – and an invitation to seek out more music that would change their lives.It’s hard to imagine a film character saying that line today; it’s too fluffy, too idealistic, too 2004. But I’d almost forgotten the feeling existed at all. On Saturday night, for a few hours, it came back.Explore more on these topicsFilmLos AngelesImogen HeapThe ShinsZach BraffNatalie PortmanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A decade later, in her mid-80s, her sons put this cognitively and physically enfeebled woman into a state-run nursing home, whose French name –établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes– makes it sound nicer than it was.After only two months in this institution near Reims, swollen legs preventing her leaving her bed, still less her room, her mind ailing and her sons’ answering machines filled with tearful late-night messages from a bewildered woman, she died.Eribon contests the idea that his mother’s death was what was called “unconscious suicide”. For him it was willed. “She could herself see this diminishment and she surely knew that it was irreversible… And yet she went on repeating, ‘When I’m feeling better’ or ‘When I’m well again’.” Eribon, a sociology professor at the University of Amiens, is alert to what his peers call the “ritual drama of mutual pretence” that neither speaker nor hearer really believe.In truth, hers was a death foretold. The admitting doctor had warned Eribon that for new arrivals there was a high risk that, uprooted and alienated, they would quickly die. The French speak ofun syndrome de glissement, a slide to death prompted by utter hopelessness.It’s not true, though, that his mother’s life was entirely unhappy. In widowed dotage, she took a lover called André. But André ended the affair because, perhaps understandably, he could not handle her evident decline. Alone again, she took respite in mad fantasy. “I don’t remember if I told you that I’m expecting a baby,” she tells Eribon one day. “I don’t think that’s possible at your age,” he replies. “That’s what I thought, but in any case I’m not going to keep it.”Although I was often in tears reading this heartbreaking account of his mother’s decline, Eribon often writes drily, obliquely. I’m not even sure what his mother’s first name was. He comes sidelong at his grief and guilt. He quotes writers – Beckett, Ernaux, Solzhenitsyn, Coetzee – and his great philosophical mentors – Foucault, Sartre, De Beauvoir, Bourdieu – to comprehend his loss.This method has the virtue of underlining the unbearably universal nature of one woman’s death and its meaning for those who live on. After leaving his mother at her new home, he recalls the opening lines of Beckett’s novelMolloy. “I am in in my mother’s room. It is I who live there now. I don’t know how I got there. Perhaps in an ambulance…” Eribon doesn’t draw the moral but it’s clear: we know that when our parents die, we’re next.Deploying his own wide reading has another purpose: it honours his mother. After all, she paid for his education, doing overtime for pin money so that this internationally celebrated intellectual could do something she was never allowed to do: flourish.Eribon is wonderful when he directly expresses his anger. He rages over his mother’s treatment in that nursing home“I am fully aware that it is both in opposition to her and thanks to her that I became who I am,” Eribon writes. “I have been ashamed, obviously, and for a long time now, of the selfishness and ingratitude I displayed.” It’s not obvious: others would be more shameless.And yet this is a finely nuanced portrait, not least when he visits his ailing mother and struggles to confront her habitual racism. In her toxically lucid moments, he recognises, she expresses hateful views to wind up her liberal intellectual son. But how can an oppressed woman from a working-class background be so hateful to persecuted minorities, he asks himself. He finds the answer in Pierre Bourdieu’s law of conservation of social violence: people who experience violence reproduce it against others. Nigel Farage’s electoral success, I thought reading this, exploits this law.Much of the book echoed for me that of another sociologist, Richard Hoggart, who, in The Uses of Literacy, described scholarship boys who went to grammar school as eternally “uprooted and anxious”, cut off from their class, guilty about their self-perceived social betrayal. Eribon is their kin, with an additional turn of the screw: as a gay boy discovering his sexuality cruising Reims parks, he became doubly removed from his heteronormative proletarian roots. His earlier memoir,Returning to Reims, was a theatrically adapted bestseller, but figures here as a source of guilt: perhaps what he wrote was class betrayal by a deracinated intellectual exploiting a world that he had, by the skin of his teeth and the toil of his mother, avoided.For all the obliquity, Eribon is wonderful when he directly expresses his anger. He rages over his mother’s treatment in that nursing home. The civilisation of western Europe, after all, is indicted by the barbarism of overrun, understaffed nursing homes. Eribon finds staff so overworked that they are unable to care effectively for residents who, for their part, feel like prisoners deprived of rights or tenderness. “It is question of abuse,” he writes. “There is a profoundimmoralityin the whole system. That is the word that needs to be used over and over:immorality.”While his mother lies dying in a nursing home, Eribon’s inbox fills with messages predicated on his recent search history, inviting him to invest in private care homes. “Cynical advisers who talk about this ‘market’ use the term ‘grey gold’. Each time I come across one of these images, I feel sick to my stomach.”The great virtue of Eribon’s memoir is that it compels us to confront our fixation on youth, our sweeping of elderly people to the margins, how we treat them not as humans but as business opportunities. All of these bespeak a blind, narcissistic and callous society. He asks profound questions that are at once philosophical, deeply personal and topical: can the completely dependent speak for themselves – and if not, who can speak for them? How does our society treat the elderly? Shabbily is Eribon’s answer to the last of these.The Life, Old Age and Death of a Working-Class Womanby Didier Eribon (translated by Michael Lucey) is published by Allen Lane (£22).

The painting depicts Thomas Coram, founder of the Foundling Hospital in London’s Bloomsbury district. A shipbuilder by trade, he is portrayed in full baroque garb, a style usually reserved for the aristocracy. But amid the classical architecture and rich fabrics, he is shown as he was: the thread veins on his face, his feet not quite touching the ground. The setting is apt for Dacus’s disquisitions on life and love, and the ways they can exceed, or fall short of, the expectations we place upon them: the moments that feel exalted, idealised, as well as the times when reality intrudes on the fantasy.TheFoundling Museum, the setting of tonight’s intimate show, also holds a deeper meaning for the singer-songwriter, who was raised in Mechanicsville, Virginia by adoptive parents; the mother who raised her was herself adopted from an orphanage at a young age. “I had nothing like this growing up,” says Dacus to the assembled crowd. “We don’t have the concept of a foundling in the US. It would have been cool if the other kids at school had known that was fine.” The previous day, after her photoshoot in the museum’s grand-looking court room, she is visibly moved upon learning about the building’s history, and its current work training care-experienced young people. She asks the organisers about inviting some of the trainees to the concert: it would, she says, be a way of showing them “hey, I’m doing cool shit – you can do cool shit.”The cool shit in question is the kind of life most teenagers dream of. Signed to Matador in 2016, aged 21, Dacus has been crafting sumptuous, emotionally astute music straddling folk and indie rock since the release of her debut,No Burden. Two critically acclaimed albums followed, producing singles such as immaculate breakup anthemNight Shiftand the yearning, Springsteen-esqueHot & Heavy. A through-line of her discography is the arresting interplay between her agile, velvety voice and often unsettling lyrics: on the quietly devastating Thumbs, inspired by the time she accompanied a friend to meet her estranged, abusive father, Dacus imagines placing her thumbs on the man’s eyes, “pressing in until they burst”.View image in fullscreenDacus with Phoebe Bridgers (left) and Julien Baker of Boygenius as they accept the best rock performance award at the Grammys in 2024.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APIn 2018, she joined forces with Californian Phoebe Bridgers and Tennessee-born Julien Baker, two songwriters who share her enthusiasm for 90s alternative music, ethereal harmonies and dry internet humour, to form supergroupBoygenius. After a self-titled EP, their chart-topping 2023 debutThe Recordwas nominated for seven Grammys, winning three of them; the group made history as the first all-female band to win best rock song and best rock performance. The group also won a Brit, and the band’s first UK gig, a sold-out25,000-capacity showat London’s Gunnersbury Park, has also been their biggest to date. They replicated Nirvana’s historic 1994 cover shoot for aRolling Stoneinterview, in which the magazine called them “the world’s most exciting indie band”. They are currently on hiatus. “The goal is not a repeat of that experience,” says Dacus, sipping green tea in a room downstairs, under a different Hogarth painting. “The reception toThe Recordoutpaced what any of us expected. Then the time since then – thank God we’ve stopped. It’s nice to chill a little bit.” A later question about the band is met with: “Let’s skip it. Because it’s not about them.”Dacus’s focus today is firmly on her accomplished new solo album,Forever Is a Feeling, an intensely personal record that should crystallise her reputation as an important artist in her own right. In the run-up to its release, Dacus has deliberately scaled things down, playing a selection of tiny gigs in boutique, atmospheric venues: the neo-gothic Vondelkerk in Amsterdam; a candle-lit show at the Église Saint-Eustache in Paris, where she dedicated a song to her girlfriend (“I wonder if that has never been done in this building,” shemused, eliciting cheers). For the first time, she has had the money and resources to invest in an elaborate aesthetic for the album, which centres largely around classical art. The cover is a Renaissance-style oil painting of Dacus by artist Will St John; in the video for lead singleAnkles, she is a portrait who has come to life and escaped from her frame, wandering around Paris in a custom-made Rodarte gown.The portrait imagery reminded many of Céline Sciamma’s film about forbidden love,Portrait of a Lady on Fire, but it may also be a reference to a key part of Boygenius lore: the time that Baker found Dacus reading Henry James’sThe Portrait of a Ladybackstage at a show they played together in 2016. Fans have fervently speculated about Dacus and Baker’s relationship, which, while not exactly kept secret, has until now never been confirmed or denied. Several lyrics onForever Is a Feelingcorroborate what many had long suspected: “You knew when you caught me reading at your show”, goes Big Deal; elsewhere, the “most wanted man in West Tennessee” nods to Baker’s hometown of Memphis.I was feeling all aspects of falling in love and out of love and moving and missing people and finally admitting the truthWe meet on the day the news goes public, in the narrow window between the publication of aNew Yorkerprofile, in which Dacus confirmed she and Baker are “in a committed relationship”, and the story being picked up by gossip sites and social media. Before long, memes had been spawned, as well as a portmanteau (“Jucy”). Was it a difficult decision to write about her personal life on the album, knowing how invested many people would feel? “It wasn’t a choice to write the songs – that’s just what I have to give, though I guess it’s a choice to share them,” she says. “There’s this vague uneasiness to opening up that much. I can never tell why it feels scary, because ultimately, I feel secure in my relationships … I don’t love being perceived.” She looks down, slightly shrinking in on herself. “I hope the record speaks for itself, and that people will find it. That will matter more than anything I can say.”Fans excited by the announcement might be alarmed by some of the lyrics. There is good sex in hotels and wrists in zip ties, but also minor betrayals and possibly bigger ones; faces are contorted in anger before tender gestures are exchanged. Both parties make mistakes: “I’m not sorry, not certain, not perfect, not good,” sings Dacus on Lost Time. The excellent, spiky singleTalkis about a relationship that may or may not be in its death throes: “We run out of conversation / Day runs out of light”. Written and recorded between 2022 and 2024, the songs show relationships at various stages, encompassing the rush of first love as well as the meaner, darker moments not usually aired in public. “I was just feeling all aspects of falling in love and falling out of love and moving and missing people and revelling and finally admitting the truth. It’s all very big things.”The central thesis of the album is that, even if a relationship does not last forever, the feelings experienced in the moment are of immense value. “I love your body / I love your mind / They will change / So will mine,” Dacus sings on Best Guess, acknowledging that the future is unknown; throughout, the lyrics reconfigure the conventional wisdom of “till death do us part” into something more modern and realistic, based on choice rather than obligation. “Life is non-consensual,” she says. “You get brought into this world. You did not ask to be. You learn whatever language you’re hearing, you usually take on the religion you’re raised in. That’s part of why I think love is so powerful later in life, because you basically get to bind by choice with people; you share enough experience that there’s a bedrock that makes it enjoyable or rich. Love with a partner – that’s like saying, we are family now, and I choose these obligations to you, and I happily take on whatever that requires of me.”This concept also extends to her family arrangements. Growing up, her schoolmates’ reference points for adoption were tales of tragic orphans, likeOliver TwistorAnnie, but she never saw it that way. “I felt very special, because the emphasis was not on the fact somebody didn’t want me, it was that somebody was honest that they couldn’t take care of me.” After meeting her birth parents aged 19, she is now good friends with her birth mother; they recently went to a Heart concert in LA together. She is close to her adoptive parents, a pianist and music teacher and a graphic designer. “You can build a family by choice and not just blood. Societally, maybe people look down on it, but I am my parents’ child – the parents who raised me. We are family, and there’s no second best or diminutive follow-up to that. It’s just a good thing. I wish more people considered it an option for their lives.”In person, Dacus emanates a sense of calm that belies the analytical self-excoriation in her songs. Emotions and relationships are discussed with reverence, but a sharp sense of humour often lurks beneath the surface (when I ask what body part she’ll write a song about next, after Thumbs and Ankles, she deadpans: “Head”). The care that has gone into every aspect of the album is apparent in the way she talks about it. There is a new intricacy to the arrangements, greater introspection in the lyrics; from the cover art to the cinematic music videos, there is an increased emphasis on artistry and detail. “I’m a bit burnt out on all the digital art that is happening,” she says. “I wanted to work with people who have high skill levels and craftsmanship. It’s connected me back to why people make art in the first place.”I wanted to work with people who have high skill levels and craftsmanship. It’s connected me back to why people make artShe is frustrated by mounting pressure to incorporate AI elements into creative processes. “I don’t care, basically, whether AI would or wouldn’t create good art,” she says with an exasperated eye-roll. “The environmental impact alone should be enough to have people stop. And also – you want a shortcut to art? You want to have made a product, you don’t want the internal process. That’s the entire reason for me. I would never be able to sing a song that a robot wrote. It breaks my heart that some people would forgo the chance to actually get to know what they have to say.”On the album, she sings about feeling alienated by the music industry: “I was in a boardroom / Full of old men guessing what the kids are getting into… I don’t belong here, nobody does” (Come Out). She recalls being in rooms with people who have no interest in her music, but view her as a potential paycheque: “Sometimes people are upfront about their want to make money off of you. Some people try to disguise it.” Putting out music now, compared with when she started, “is a lot less fun. And I love fun – I take fun seriously. Life should be bringing you joy.” The heightened cynicism and negativity on the internet can sometimes take its toll. Although her fans are generally “really sweet”, the increased visibility brought by Boygenius has made her a bit more guarded. “Other people do expect performance from you. It doesn’t feel good sometimes if you’re having a personal moment, and people basically make it a professional moment by wanting to film you.”View image in fullscreenThe cover art for Lucy Dacus’s latest album, Forever Is a Feeling.Photograph: UMusicLast year, her friend Chappell Roanspoke outabout fans’ intrusive behaviour. Has it made a difference? “One hundred per cent. We were in New York one time, and that was the least I’ve ever been talked to in New York – it was with her. So I think people are really listening.” Dacus believes we should start to think about fandom in a new way. “I have abstract care for the fans, and I genuinely feel that they care about me, even though we don’t know each other at all. That doesn’t even mean we know how to have a conversation when we’re together, but still, there’s something sweet there. Most people have good intentions.”Many of Dacus’s values, she says, stem from her upbringing in the church. “There was a huge emphasis on service: painting fences, babysitting, making food for people. There’s a lot about growing up in the church that made it hard to get to know myself, but that was a really good part of it.” These days, though she no longer considers herself religious, she still has “a lot of reverence and curiosity”. One lesson Christianity taught her is the importance of not giving in to hatred, something that can feel increasingly difficult. “I do think it’s important to try for love. Maybe a useful distinction is hate versus anger. I’m extremely angry and frustrated and disgusted, with lots of people in power and bigots in general. But hate to me feels like it’d be more of the same if I just hated them back.” (When I ask about the 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she had apublic falling out withafter he tweeted an offensive joke about her band’s name, she says simply, “We’re not in touch.”)I have friends whose passports are being ‘corrected’, and people whose IDs are being held so they can’t get out of the countryOne of the topics Dacus has been vocal about is the situation in Gaza: Boygenius woreArtists4Ceasefire badgesto the 2024 Grammys and have attended pro-Palestinerallies, which has led to some backlash. “Sure, but it doesn’t matter. There are some opportunities that I’ve lost, but the idea that I would take them anyway… I don’t want them. You have to look back on your life one day and try to be proud of yourself.” Two days after Trump’s inauguration, she announced she would begiving away$10,000 for trans people’s surgery costs. “I currently have friends whose passports are being ‘corrected’, and people whose IDs are being held so they can’t get out of the country. I fear for the physical safety of the trans people in my life, particularly non-white trans people – I fear for immigrants getting deported. It’s just so heartless. What are you trying to defend? What is this country you speak of?”Watch the video to Best Guess by Lucy Dacus.At the start of May, Dacus will turn 30 – a decade she’s looking forward to, whatever it holds. If her 20-year-old self could see her life now, she says, she’d be “really weirded out. If I was given the choice, I would have to really think about it.” If she could give herself a piece of advice at that age, it would be: “Don’t be so loyal that you bring assholes along for the ride. Get real about people who don’t treat you well enough.” Her main ambition for the future is to keep doing things she is proud of, not necessarily in music but “other fields and art forms, including farming and cooking”. She hopes to spend more time in LA, where she moved in 2023, despite the “apocalyptic” fires earlier this year. “I want to plant a seed and then see it become something. I want my life to be still enough and reliable enough that I can do that.”Later this summer, she’ll be playing Glastonbury, another experience to add to her “cool shit” portfolio. “That, I guess, is a bucket-list thing. I hear it’s kind of a dirty experience: a muddy, weird time. I’m sure I’ll be dripping sweat and it’ll be a riot.”Forever Is a Feelingis out now via Interscope.

The time for conversations about the weather andI like your shoeshas passed – now, she says, is a time for talk that is large and unwieldy and circles the question she finds herself asking people a lot which is (she leans in): “What are you afraid of?”She’s at home in New York, in front of a grey screen set up to shoot her nanny’s audition tapes. Her nanny acts, her husband (Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts) acts, their little kids, well, act up – this is a house of love and drama, in which Coon mothers and frets and contemplates the end of the world. She grew up in Ohio, one of five kids – her parents adopted her sister, Morena, when Coon was three. Her father had almost become a Catholic priest before returning to run an auto parts store and her mother was a nurse who worked nights, so Coon babysat her brothers, did the laundry, played football, excelled. In 2010, she was cast in a Steppenwolf Theatre Company production ofWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolfthat transferred to Broadway. Though not usually a story associated with happy marriages, it was here she met Letts, 15 years her senior, and in 2013, following his emergency gallbladder surgery, they got married in an Illinois hospital. “Tracy’s hospital gown was off his shoulder. He was so high. My family kept saying the only way to get him to marry me was to drug him.” She chuckles. “It was a great wedding. The vows really put life and death just square in their middle.”At 44, following pivotal roles in prestige TV dramas, includingThe Leftovers,The Gilded AgeandFargo, plus films like Azazel Jacobs’sHis Three Daughters,The Nestwith Jude Law, and blockbusters including theAvengersandGhostbustersfranchises, she’s currently starring inThe White Lotus. And yet, she admits happily, most people have no idea who she is.View image in fullscreen‘I have a shape-shifting quality’: in the latest series of The White Lotus with Leslie Bibb and Michelle Monaghan.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/PR IMAGE“There is a precision in her that does not feel robotic,” Jacobs tells me, “but as a person on a real quest.” The women she plays often appear ordinary and competent, their cool beauty only occasionally cracking to reveal somebody tiptoeing right up to the edge of sanity. “There’s no vanity,” Law says over email. “There’s a joy and a thrill to the challenge in the moment, and a playfulness which makes it light and fun, even if the subject matter is hard and dark.” In a recent interview forTown & Countrymagazine, director David Fincher (who gave Coon her first feature film role inGone Girl) said: “It’s not that you remember Carrie Coon, but that you remember Carrie Coon was fucking great.”Memes abound of Coon’sWhite Lotuscharacter, Laurie, one of a trio of old blonde friends on a girls trip to Thailand, laundering their bitchiness through tight compliments and loudly slurping their drinks. It has ignited conversations about friendship, rivalry and a deeply feminine brand of toxic positivity. “One of the things all of my projects seem to be reinforcing this year – and I do find that the universe puts projects in your way when you have something to examine – is how, as we age, friendship is very difficult to maintain.” The show asks, she says, “not only ‘Are new friends better than old friends?’, but also the question of, ‘Are you willing to see past your ideas about a person to see the person who’s right in front of you?’”She can do that with her children, sometimes with her friends, but finds it trickier with her siblings. “I think that it would be probably wise for me, as an adult, to remember to always re-encounter someone and try to see them for where they are.”View image in fullscreenBlonde ambition: Carrie Coon wears jacket by Willy Chavarria for Adidas Originals; shorts and belt by Rochas.Photograph: Andrew Yee/The ObserverHer sister’s adoption was a long and expensive process, and while Coon was excited to have a sister, a four-year-old who had been selling sweets on the streets of El Salvador, the transition was complicated, and little psychological support was offered. In adulthood, “My sister was in the navy, she’s a veteran now – she has some mental health issues, and she’s in a system which is very overextended, and will be more so because of the cuts being made.” JD Vance is from Coon’s state, a fact that sharpens her response to him: “A completely unprincipled and power-hungry sell-out.” She pauses to elaborate, with precision: “They’re fascists.” In a very white town, growing up with a Latin American sister, an immigrant, “shaped all of my siblings as much as we shaped her”. It made Coon a more open-minded person and helped her become, she says, an artist. “I was a middle child and always really aware of how everyone was feeling. I was very sensitive about Morena and how she was moving through the world.” She became the go-between when her sister and mother fought, “and so that kind of adaptability, I think, lends itself well to being an actor. There’s a shape-shifting quality that comes naturally. Plus, I’m a good listener, and that’s definitely part of being an artist, or this kind of artist that I am.”Wait, let’s just talk quickly about Coon’s voice. This is a voice that is low and serious, and sounds like it comes not just from deep within her body but perhaps deep within the earth. Says Jacobs: “I witnessed something our first day of shooting I’m still trying to get my head around.” They shotHis Three Daughtersin script order, beginning with a monologue from Coon to camera, a long, unbroken take. “I saw an energy or spirit spill from her, spread to the other actors facing her, past the camera and, as I turned my head, I watched it hit each surrounding crew person, one after the other. People’s spines straightened. The overwhelming feeling was: this was real, what we are doing could matter, that we all needed to do our best to reach what Carrie had begun.”View image in fullscreenArresting performance: in Fargo, 2017.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhen did Coon find her voice? She worked hard on it, she says, first at graduate school, then at the experimental Roy Hart Theatre, where they told her humans can make any sound an animal can make. “You do all this wild creature work!” she says. It’s a subject that energises her, she waves around a glass of green juice. “In young people, you hear that vocal fry,” her voice thins and rises as if Paris Hilton has entered the room, “and what’s happening is people are cut off from their bodies.” Did I know, she asks, “babies can cry all night and not lose their voices, people who are dying can scream and not lose their voices. And yet our voices feel very fragile and precious when we have to use them in performance.” It’s important to really breathe, she says. “I’ve modelled that for my kids, so now I have really loud kids. But I wanted them to be able to feel their capacity, because it’s really liberating. And for women, in particular, that is power – to be in a room, to take up space.” Can she share a voice exercise with me? She straightens in her chair. “OK”.Together we put our hands on to our chests, and open our mouths very wide and round, and say, almost sing, Oh – My – Soul. “Feel it,” she says, serious now. “Shake your chest.” I’m not quite changed, but I am sitting taller.Coon first found her voice in herLeftoverscharacter Nora Durst, a woman enduring the loss of her family. “She was so unapologetic, which frankly, I’m still working on, so it taught me how to drop my voice into my body and have really fast emotional access.” Both in her work, and her life. A corner of the internet got excited recently, when on a podcast Coon described her marriage as open. In fact what she said (she clarifies, wearily) was, they were “open-minded” about monogamy. Less scandalous perhaps, but just as interesting.View image in fullscreen‘I had been taught that I had to control information to protect other people’: Carrie Coon wears overcoat by Patou; leather dress by Tod’s; shoes by Altuzarra; and earrings by Briony Raymond.Photograph: Andrew Yee/The Observer“If you are willing to talk to your partner about these very natural biological impulses, willing to have those conversations without feeling that your ego is threatened, everything changes.” What happens? “What’s on the other side of that is the fact that those opportunities and impulses often lose their charge entirely. Freedom is actually the most titillating and interesting offering there is to me.” It’s foolish not to acknowledge that our bodies are operating somewhere with an engine that’s not always conscious, she says lightly. “And I find that willingness just thrilling and arguably it makes my marriage much more stable.” The internet will be disappointed, I sigh, with this clarity about one of theatre’s premier power couples. “Join us for movie night, hey, who knows? I’ve always maintained I would love to have a second wife.”To shoot White Lotusshe moved to Thailand, away from her family, for six months. But, “when you get to step away from your life as a mother you get to appreciate it in a new way”. With every sunset swim, every leisurely meal, she was aware of the gift she was being given. “I got to just be the artist in the ivory tower, the thing men have done for centuries. Because of motherhood, women’s creative lives are often lived in fits and spurts. We are always being interrupted.” She discovered that, “having children feels like a deeply creative act that actually deepens my well of creativity. The act of producing a child – the depth of that is something that no male artist will ever really sufficiently have access to. So it is profoundly creative in that way.” But the “juggle” means she is regularly giving up opportunities in order to be with her kids, and compromising share space with Letts’s career.“My husband’s almost 60, entering this third act of his life and the kind of artist he wants to be. So I have to be compassionate about whatever that transformation will be.” How does that work within the relationship? Well, she says, “Tracy and I both are in recovery. He’s been sober for over 30 years, I’m now coming up on five, and the shared language is really helpful.” During the pandemic, when their eldest child was three, Letts would write, but Coon had little structure to her day. “It was wonderful to spend all that time with my son, and also very easy to have a glass of wine at three and then maybe the next day at 12…” She chose sobriety when she recognised this “inclination” that ran in her family, and while she’d never been interested in drugs and alcohol growing up, “I did go through some pathological lying, some compulsive skin picking. I had my own version of how I was not dealing with my feelings.”View image in fullscreenTriple threat: in His Three Daughters with Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyIt was something she’d investigated at university, when a therapist helped her see that her skin picking was an “authenticity alarm”. “When you’re a kid, those impulse-control things are about self-soothing. We all have them. They’re just varying degrees of damage.” Eventually, she was able to confront why she was self-soothing. “And so I found that when my skin picking was really out of control, it was because I was either not living according to my values, or I was living my life in relationship to another person, having remade myself in the image that I thought they wanted from me. It wasn’t until I found myself in my own life, that that started to subside.” When was that? She winces bashfully. “When I met Tracy. I realised I hadn’t really trusted anyone before. I had been taught that I had to control information to protect other people, when in fact what I was doing was protecting my own ego. And I had to start to unpack that problem.” She could see that Letts could handle whatever she threw at him. “There was nothing I could say to Tracy that would make him mistake my behaviour for my morality. He saw me. He respected me as an artist and he respected me as a person. And he recognised in me a great potential, I think, to live a good life.” It was, she smiles, “satisfying”.Part of gettingolder, she says, is about the integration of self – as we understand all our different impulses and experiences they come together, and as an actor you can bring that knowledge to the work. “That’s why it was previously unfortunate that women were pushed out of the industry when they got to 40, because we were still in the process of that illuminating feedback loop that was just creating more energy and creativity and self-awareness, which would mean we had more to give as artists just when we were being cut out of the whole game!”Is that not the case any more? “Well, I think it’s shifting.” She reels off actors like Jean Smart and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Plus, “Women are often now the breadwinners in their homes, we are consuming art and art should be made for us!”The White Lotusalways features a clutch of older women, including, in this series, Coon’s group of wealthy friends, “who are forging connections by criticising the person who’s not there. And each one feels left out. This epidemic of loneliness is about feeling fundamentally left out and like you don’t know how to conduct yourself in order to belong. It’s always about not being, I think, totally honest about our feelings.” Why is that honesty so tricky? “Mostly it’s fear – fear of being judged, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being excommunicated. It’s always fear.”So, what is she afraid of? “I think about death a lot. Our complete denial of the climate catastrophe we’re in the middle of right now and what the implications are for our children. I don’t know how to prepare them for the world they will be living in, or dying in. The time for mitigation is over. We’ve blown past it. And now we’re facing either adaptation or suffering.” She’s travelled a long way from the Catholicism she was brought up with, and she’s unclear quite how to prepare her children for, “What comes to all of us, which is that everything you love will die and pass away. But I do feel like that’s part of my responsibility as a parent.”She’s preparing for uncomfortable conversations. She’ll tell them she insulated their house. She got heat pumps. “But we’re actually pacified by being preoccupied with our phones. It’s keeping us all exactly where they want us. We don’t have a way to fundamentally agree on the truth. Republicans are trying to take away education of history, so people have even less context for this information. And they’re then therefore really easily manipulated. It’s terrifying.” This is what scares her.We’ve gone over our allotted hour, of course, and Coon apologises (“You can imagine what fun I am at parties”), but we can’t just leave it there, the world smouldering, the self destroyed, phones eating our memories, so we reach for some small talk. In her deep, liquid voice she offers, “I like your scarf,” and suddenly, everything’s fine.The White Lotus, season three, is on SKY Atlantic and NOWStylist Alicia Lombardini; photograher’s assistant Hele Ho; stylist’s assistant Cyrenae Tademy at Chanelncrocs and Kayla Stephenson; set design by Shari Anlauf at Atelier Management; hair by Ben Skervin at Walter Schupfer Management using Color Wow; makeup by Rebecca Restrepo at Walter Schupfer Management; nails by Marie Barokas using Zoya; shot at Pier59 StudiosExplore more on these topicsThe White LotusThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it was the death of my beloved colleague and friendHisham al-Hashimithat led me into the world of standup comedy. I knew it would trash my hard-won career in international security, but I didn’t care any more.Hisham had run a workshop with me in Iraq six months prior to his death, and I’d taken everything so seriously, marching around the hotel yelling about how everything was going wrong.But Hisham always had a lightness in his step, a smile on his face. Every evening, he’d take me to a café, order me my favourite shisha and proceed to tell the most disgusting jokes.One morning, a group of tribal leaders we’d convened refused to check out of the hotel unless we paid them. I freaked out, called head office, read compliance regulations, tried jamming my own credit card into ATMs, while Hisham laughed until tears streamed down his face. “I warned you about the Anbaris,” he cackled. “They make love to money!” I could hardly conceive of a worse nightmare than this, but Hisham had lived the life of a real Iraqi. He’d witnessed Saddam’s crimes, the invasion, the civil war, then Islamic State. Hundreds of thousands of people killed every few years. And I was worried about an awkward end to my workshop, when Hisham had survived all that.He was shot outside his home in July 2020, while his wife and young children were inside. He’d been receiving threats for months from militias who were angry about his journalism. But he refused to be cowed, wouldn’t stop telling the truth, gave up multiple opportunities to move abroad. Even with the pressure bearing down on him, he still found joy everywhere and was able to excavate the humour from the bleakest of situations. I partied in his honour the night after his death, a wake he would have adored, toasting him as I danced with my friends, crying the entire time. He would have been thrilled to see me finally let loose.I’d been so uptight until that moment. I was a brown woman from a completely average home in the north of England, and forging a career in international security felt like a relentless fight. I studied insanely hard and wore my academic accolades like a suit of armour: Oxford, a PhD, Harvard. Still, I was constantly undermined and disrespected. At the age of just 28, I’d made it to a senior fellowship at a thinktank in Washington DC. Soon I was running my own projects on the ground in Iraq.By the time I was working in Iraq, I was using every spare moment to watch standupBut there was another side to me, one that I kept hidden. I loved comedy.Popworld, presented by the hilarious Miquita Oliver and Simon Amstell, was appointment television for me when I was growing up. The first time I was dumped, I watched Monty Python’sLife of Brian, and laughed so hard I couldn’t summon a shred of sadness for my ex. I readScoopby Evelyn Waugh,Lucky Jimby Kingsley Amis,Heartburnby Nora Ephron and wondered why anyone bothered writing if they couldn’t write humour. By the time I was working in Iraq, I was using every spare moment to watch standup. In passport control at Baghdad airport, I’d plug in my headphones and watch clips of Sara Pascoe, Sindhu Vee and Ali Wong, choking down my laughter as armed guards cast wary glances in my direction.I vividly remember one trip to Iraq in 2018 when I was investigating a disputed election. A close Iraqi friend and former student of mine had been working in his political party’s offices when it had been shot at by an opposing party. I visited the offices, photographing bullet holes, my friend hyperventilating beside the shattered glass. When I returned to my hotel that night, scared and overwhelmed, I searched for comedy to watch. It had become my coping mechanism. I found videos of Michelle Wolf’s comedy routine at the White House Correspondent’s Dinner and fell in love with her, this whip-smart woman eviscerating the Trump administration while they were forced to watch. Though much of the comedy I’d enjoyed had been political, this was the most overt and it got me thinking about other ways I could make an impact with my life, perhaps one that integrated my love of comedy.After Hisham’s death,I began to face up to the reality of how dangerous my work was in Iraq and I stopped dismissing my interest in comedy. In between trips to Iraq, I signed up for a standup course at the Bill Murray in London. It’s a comedy club I had an abiding affection for, a place where established comedians come to try out new material on small crowds and where I’d watched comedy geniuses like Kevin Bridges and Jessica Fostekew perform to groups of less than 100 people. I began spending Sunday afternoons at the beginners’ standup class where we were given prompts and asked to immediately perform jokes to one another. I absolutely loved it.The first joke I told was about sleeping with someone from Tinder in Iraq and finding out, post-coital, that he was an IS fighter. It wasn’t true, but having worked in Iraq I could paint a very convincing picture. A choked, shocked laughter emerged from the class and I enjoyed the simultaneous sensations of mirth and discomfort I’d evoked. I realised that my unusual profession as a peacebuilding practitioner was a brilliant source of material, and I started searching for humour on my work trips to Iraq. And it was everywhere. The farcical Iraqi bureaucracy, the moronic expectations of Brussels-based donors, the absurdity of foreign efforts to build peace in a country we’d so recently destroyed. I’d fill the notes app on my phone with observations, then come back to London and perform them to my class.I missed the end-of-course showcase event. A meeting with the Iraqi president won out and I sat in the presidential palace in Baghdad wistfully thinking about my classmates performing their tight-fives to a packed audience of family and friends.There is an electricity to performing standup that is unlike any other feeling. When you make an audience laugh, your victory is so immediate, the thrill drenches you like an upturned bucket of dopamine and adrenaline. I can understand why standups find it addictive.Though my classmates protested that I always looked composed and confident, I slightly dreaded getting on stageBut it’s also nerve-racking. When a joke fails to land, the silence feels oppressive and humiliating. My knees would shake so hard sometimes I could feel them knocking together. Though my classmates protested that I always looked composed and confident, I slightly dreaded getting on stage. I’d known before I started that my comedy would find its ultimate outlet in a novel. My life had given me a big story to tell: from my devout Muslim upbringing to my search for meaning through aid work and then my efforts to build a programme to rehabilitate IS brides. I wanted to take my time with the story, to tell it in its richest and most nuanced form. More importantly, I wanted my jokes to land or fail without having to be in the room to witness it. But taking the standup course was crucial to my novel. It helped me write a tonne of properly funny, laugh-out-loud jokes and set-piece comic scenes that formed the backbone of my story.I did worry, when writing the novel, that focusing so much on humour would make literary critics sneer, that it wouldn’t be considered a serious work. I forged ahead anyway; it would’ve been dishonest to write any other way and I was done with forcing myself to fit into a mould. The comedy turned out to be the novel’s secret weapon, with people from all ends of the political spectrum unexpectedly engaging with – and enjoying – a story about IS brides.Since publication, my training as a standup has come into its own. As I sit in bookshops and libraries talking to audiences, I find myself performing a set, rather than boring everyone with talk of my writing process. It has been a lot of fun making an audience laugh again, though nervousness sometimes rears its head. Oddly, it’s the novel that has made some of my longest-held comedy dreams come true. My all-time favourite comedian, Sara Pascoe, interviewed me on her podcast and I was invited to speak on a Radio 4 Friday night comedy show.But best of all, my Instagram DMs are filled with readers quoting jokes from the novel back to me, followed by strings of crying-face emojis. Perhaps this is my favourite way to be a comic. Safely behind my keyboard, enjoying the laughter of others, mediated through a screen.Fundamentally by Nussaibah Younis is published by W&N at £16.99.

Berlin is the place to goThe city’s tattoo studios are booming while the art world flounders. Under a new initiative, buyers receive exclusive rights to an artist’s new design, and the artist receives 50% of the profitPhilip OltermannEuropean culture editorSun 30 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTShareIt may be the oldest art form in the world, practised 5,000 years ago by Ötzi the iceman and his fellow copper age Europeans. But with its more recent associations with red-light entertainment and gangland crime, modern tattooing has long been shunned by the galleries that turn lines on canvas into financial assets.A new initiative in Berlin concedes that the tables have turned. With tattoo studios in the German capital booming but many artists struggling to make a living, the Works on Skin project specialises in selling works by established and emerging contemporary artists that are not to be hung on a wall but to be etched on the human body.“The art market has frozen up and many studios are suffering,” said the scheme’s initiator, Holm Friebe. “So we tried to think about how we can unlock new fields for artistic practitioners and thus repair a broken market.”Via itswebsite, Works on Skin sells artwork in numbered limited editions of 100, initially for €100 each but reaching up to €2,000 for the last remaining numbers.View image in fullscreenAndreas Hachulla’s tattoo artwork, based on the Berghain sound system.Photograph: Andreas HachullaWith their purchase, buyers acquire a signed fine-art print of the artwork and a certificate that gives them the one-off right to have it tattooed on their skin, thus “realising” an artwork that until that point is considered “work in limbo”.Instead of familiar designs such as swallows, butterflies or Samoan tribal patterns, customers can grace their skin with a drawing of the old sound system at the nightclub Berghain by artist Andreas Hachulla, or a faux-naïf neon doodle of a wine-drinking woman by Anna Nezhnaya or a sketch of a female clown by concept art duoEva & Adele.While most works can be placed anywhere on the body at any size, others come with specific instructions. Pop artist Jim Avignon’s cartoonish humanoid flame has to be placed in such a way as to ensure “that a muscle underneath moves the fire”, while Via Lewandowsky’s planet-blue dot must be scaled to the buyer’s height to represent the size ratio of the sun to the Earth, thus highlighting “the marginality of human existence in the universe”.“We are doing something very new and at the same time very old,” said Friebe, a trained economist and nonfiction author. “Because art on skin was the beginning of art history – before work on stone, wood, canvas or paper.”With 150 editions sold since the launch of Works on Skin last summer, a new set of designs will be released on 17 April.The initiative is being received with a healthy degree of scepticism in the world of tattooing proper. Fatih Köker set up Berlin-based tattoo studio Noia in 2015, recruiting many artists who were schooled at prestigious German art academies. Unlike the artists represented by Works on Skin, however, those working at Noia do not just create the designs but are also able to do the tattooing themselves.View image in fullscreen‘We respect tattooists, but ultimately we work in different fields’ … Holm Friebe (right) of Works on Skin.Photograph: Mathias Voelzke Völzke info@mathiasvoelzke.com www.mathiasvoelzke.com/© Mathias_Voelzke“It’s quite funny to see how things change,” said Köker. “We were ignored by the art world for ages, and now they are trying to play at our game.”Traditionally, tattoo artists are approached directly by their clients, without an agency as a go-between taking a cut of their earnings. Works on Skin, by contrast, takes a 50% cut, paying out profits every three months. “Our whole idea is to offer artist studios long-term and sustainable income streams,” said Friebe.There is also the thorny question of copyright. The certificates issued by Works on Skin stipulate that while the work can, in principle, be passed on to another possessor when the current human canvas dies, there can “only ever exist one valid version”.View image in fullscreenVia Lewandowsky’s blue dot design represents ‘the marginality of human existence in the universe’.Photograph: Via LewandowskySuch notions of exclusivity appear to sit awkwardly with the conventions of what art historian Matt Lodder calls a “magpie art”. “Tattooists have long been copy­ing and adapting works of fine art,” said Lodder, a senior lecturer at the University of Essex and author ofTattoos: the Untold History of a Modern Art. “In 1890s London, for example, what people often wanted on their bodies were copies of fine-art prints.”Until now, the law has mostly been on tattooists’ side. In January 2024, a court in Los Angelessided with tattoo artist Kat Von Din a dispute over whether her tattoo of jazz musician Miles Davis had violated the copyright of the photographer on whose image it was based.“The thing with copyright infringements in tattooing is that they are hard to remedy anyway,” said Lodder. “You can’t force someone to remove a tattoo off their body.”What if someone were to simply get a tattoo based on the images on Works on Skin’s website without paying the €100 or more to acquire the certificate of authenticity? Friebe would be fine with that. “Go ahead,” he said. “But then you would be looking at a tattoo tribute, not an artwork in its own right.”Established tattooists should not worry that artist studios are about to steal their clients, Friebe believes. “We respect tattooists, but ultimately we work in different fields,” he said. “We sell tattoos by artists who don’t usually make tattoos to people who don’t usually have tattoos.”Explore more on these topicsTattoosThe ObserverArtGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For weeks, on the news, as a series of riots broke out across cities in England, Russell had been inundated with images of young people in hoodies looting, pillaging and setting buildings on fire.Now, standing in front of her at her local post office counter in Deptford, south London, was a young man in a hoodie.“He must have been in his late teens or early 20s,” she says, “and I remember thinking: ‘Oh gosh, I bet people might be judging you, because you look like the images we’ve been seeing on TV. I wonder if you’ve been having a hard time.’” Then she overheard him say he didn’t have enough money to pay for his stamp. “So I just said: ‘I can pay it for you.’”It was a tiny, split-second decision that would have a profound and long-lasting impact on her life. Before he left, he thanked her “quite a few times, more than he needed to. That felt quite significant and a little bit sad really.”She never saw that young man again. Yet her interaction with him, and the smiles of the other people who witnessed it, lit a flame inside her that would burn and burn. Russell had gone into that post office feeling “overwhelmed about the sheer volume of bad news and the enormity of problems in the world, that I had absolutely no power to do anything about”. But on the bus, on her way home, she felt different; empowered. “It made me think about how maybe some people are more likely to receive kindness than others and how one way to respond to unkindness is with kindness.”For days, she had been concerned that people who lived in neighbourhoods like hers were being demonised. “There was a particular atmosphere in London in the aftermath of all the unrest; a kind of sadness, of fear. And so our interaction seemed impactful, not just for us, but for the other people who saw it as well.”The moment the idea of carrying out one kind act a day for a year entered her mind, she decided to do it. “It was quite spontaneous. I thought: ‘I’ll see what difference this makes,’” she says. “I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. I’m not sure if I’d known what was coming, I would have started it so impulsively.”At the time, she was a jobbing actor who was working part-time as a picture researcher to make ends meet. “I had a longstanding general reluctance – a refusal, even – to see the world as this dark, shadowy place full of people doing awful things. But I wasn’t in a position of power.”It was a surprise to discover that the more kindness she showed others the more she noticed other people being kind to each otherThe daily acts of kindness, which she documented on social media, gave her a new purpose in life and a new position of influence. Now, she is a playwright, a storyteller, an artist and an author whose latest book,Conversations on Kindness, is about to be published. “Across all my creative projects, at the beating heart, is kindness,” she says.The kind acts she carried out during the year ranged from quirky (giving a stranger at a bus stop a packet of Love Hearts, placing a bookmark with a kind message inside a book in a charity shop) to commonplace (showing tourists the way to a train platform or helping an old man who was struggling with his bags). Not all of them went down well – three days into the project, she tried to give a stranger in a tube station a cheering card she had spent a long time making: “He didn’t want it and even though I promised him it wasn’t weird, he kept saying no… So I just threw it at him and ran down the escalator.”Realising she had not, in fact, been kind, she left £1 on the tube for someone to find that day instead. Looking back, she thinks she learned a lot from the experience. “What ‘kind’ means to you, might not be what it means to someone else.”Her favourite act of kindness was the time she gave a friend’s grandad a ukulele lesson. “He hadn’t played it since he was a young man, so I reminded him how to play. Then we just hung out and played the ukulele together.”It was a surprise to discover that the more kindness she tried to show others, the more she noticed other people being kind to each other. “I was choosing to see the world differently and it shifted my perspective, as though I was seeing everything through a kindness filter.” In a way she hadn’t previously, she would notice people helping carry buggies up the stairs or putting suitcases on luggage racks. “I noticed kindness was happening all around me.”There was another side-effect, too: “I started becoming aware of how often I received kindness – which was often.”At the end of the year, she decided to carry on doing daily kind acts. Nearly 13 years later, she has never stopped – although she no longer puts all of her kind deeds on social media, to allow her recipients more privacy. Her practice of noticing kindness has also continued, and has given her more faith in the world, in human beings and in herself. “It’s made me stronger, more resilient and less prone to melancholy.” For example, watching the news doesn’t get her down as much as it used to – even on bad days, she reminds herself “that every day, every moment, there are countless kind things going on and being done”.Kindness, she firmly believes, has the potential to change the world. “I think if kindness is at the heart of every action and thought – for example, the practices of compassion in politics or world farming – I think it has truly radical, world-changing and life-changing power.”View image in fullscreen‘Progress might include having deep conversations with people who, for example, support Trump. And putting compassion at the centre of that.’Illustration: Tom Gauld/The ObserverSometimes, being kindmeans being in an uncomfortable place. “Obviously, there are some people in positions of power in the world at the moment who it is hard to think of as placing kindness at the centre of what they are doing. But I think if you want progress, that might include having deep, profound conversations with people who, for example, support Trump. And listening to them – the people who believe he’s helping – and putting compassion at the centre of that.”This kind of kindness, she has come to realise, is different from “little acts” of generosity, like giving strangers a jar of sweets. “That kind of kindness is lovely and charming. But kindness has a radical, sinewy, strong muscular side as well, which is about speaking truth to power and challenging things – it’s about finding a way of doing that gently, and in a way that is connected to empathy and peace.”InConversations on Kindness, she reflects on the kind acts she carried out over the year of her experiment and the responses people had, as well as interviewing different types of experts about how they understand kindness and what they have learned about it. These range from neuroscientists and psychologists who research kindness for a living to a vicar and Billy Bragg, who tells her what inspired him to write his song The Milkman of Human Kindness. “Empathy,” he says, “is what underpins socialism”.At first, having conversations – and making connections – with strangers during her year of kindness was a big challenge for Russell, which may be one of the reasons she struggled with the man who rejected her card. “I’m an introvert, so the idea of interacting with strangers was a little bit horrible and scary,” she says. “But I quickly found that, if I said: ‘I’m doing a good deed every day,’ they understood what I meant. And I ended up having all these amazing conversations with strangers.”One of the most moving encounters, which she recounts in her book, happened when she began chatting to a man who was experiencing homelessness while waiting for a friend in central London. After her friend texted to say she would be late, Russell decided to invite the man to have a coffee with her at a chain coffee shop nearby. “He said he hadn’t been ‘inside’ before.” But they were sitting outside. “What he meant was: he hadn’t felt included.”It was a novel experience for her, too – although she had often spoken to rough sleepers before, she had never invited any of them out for a coffee. “We had a really deep conversation, because he was generous enough to share his story with me.” She talked to him for 40 minutes, and was moved to discover the man slept standing up in a wardrobe in an abandoned building, to keep himself safe from the dangerous drug addicts who lived there. “I still think about that. I can’t imagine what that’s like.”I made a choice not to believe that the world is full of monstersHis shame at being homeless hit her hard. “He was ashamed of having a bit of a dirty jacket and not having any money, and of ending up so low.” Yet despite his own struggles, he expressed compassion for others. “He said he understood why the people who might endanger him were like that, because of their addiction problems.”The experience made her believe even more strongly that “small acts of kindness can be really impactful” – and not just to others. She had suffered abuse as a child, which she touches on in the book and, after completing her year of kindness, felt able to write a forgiving letter to her estranged stepfather, letting go of her anger and pain. “My experiences have been really healing. I don’t think that means that everyone who has suffered abuse and trauma has to forgive everything, but what I did, what I tried, it did work for me and it is working.”When she discovered her stepfather was dead, she took the letter and burned it on Southsea beach. “I imagined breathing it out, the hurt, the rage. I felt deep relief and peace in that moment. I said goodbye to him. I went home,” she writes in a beautiful passage in her book.In a way, Russell thinks her quest to see the world as a kind place began when the abuse began. “As a child, I just would not accept that the world was full of monsters. I made a choice not to believe that and, to this day, I keep making that choice. I keep re-committing to kindness. I keep believing there is more good than bad, more hope than fear.”Suffering, she has come to understand, can give you a deep understanding of what it is to be human and a strong sense of solidarity with others who have suffered. “I feel hugely compassionate towards everyone,” she says. “I understand what it’s like to live in fear, to be endangered and experience violence.”View image in fullscreen‘Anyone can do something kind, even if it’s just saying good morning or smiling at someone.’Illustration: Tom Gauld/The ObserverShe sometimes imagines how the world would change if every single person “consciously did a small act of kindness every day, consciously noticed when kindness happened to them or they witnessed it. I hope that everyone who reads my book or listens to one of my talks will know that they can make a difference through kindness. And I hope that by modelling small daily acts, I’m showing that anyone – whatever their circumstances – can do something kind, even if it’s just saying good morning or smiling at someone.”Yet, at the same time, she thinks it’s important to practice self-kindness – and that includes forgiving yourself on the occasions when you fail to be kind. “I think people have so much to contend with, so many personal worries, and then there’s the huge background of climate change and war. Sometimes when we see people suffering, it’s frightening and it creates distance, because feeling empathy for them is so terrifying.”She also knows, firsthand, how hard it can be to be kind to people who have been unkind. “I’ve been kind to people who, in the course of a conversation, have told me they have done pretty dreadful things.” For example, she met one man, who was sleeping rough, who told her he had been violent towards women, which made her feel very conflicted as a victim of domestic violence herself. “He felt able to say that to me because I had been kind to him. I stayed in that conversation – and that was difficult.”Russell did it because she believes that people who are treated with love, kindness, forgiveness and compassion can change. “You just have to have faith that an act of kindness, however small, will be powerful. You have to have the courage to do it. And you have to have hope.”Conversations in Kindness by Bernadette Russell is published by Elliott & Thompson at £16.99.

For the celebrated sculptor, artist and designer, whose whimsical creations have captivated the design world, this sanctuary is both a refuge and a continuous source of inspiration.“When I first visited the land, I was struck by its natural beauty,” he recalls. “The terrain had a peculiar shape – an almost perfectly rectangular hilltop. As I explored, two roe deer wandered past, an almost magical encounter. That was the moment I knew I would build my home-atelier right here.”View image in fullscreenThe illustrator and the sculptor: Alessandra Bruni and Marcantonio Raimondi Malerba at home.Photograph: Helenio Barbetta/Living InsideThis connection to nature is woven into every aspect of his house, a cluster of minimalist white volumes that rise organically from the landscape. “I wanted a home that resonated with the environment, rather than imposing itself,” he explains. “At the same time, I wanted it to reflect my work, like a sculpture.” The result? A structure of pure, essential forms, where the architecture itself is a study in balance and restraint. White concrete-tile roofs blend into the walls, creating a monolithic effect, while expansive glass surfaces welcome in amazing views.The layout, too, is unconventional. The interior is designed not as a singular mass, but as a series of interconnected spaces, reminiscent of a small village. “I loved the idea of multiple small houses, rather than one large entity. This created a series of intimate, picturesque corners, each with its own play of light and shadow,” he says.View image in fullscreenA glass passageway connects the private residence to the studio.Photograph: Helenio Barbetta/Living InsideA glass passageway connects the private residence to his studio, offering a liminal space between work and life, contemplation and creation. From the terrace, the view spills on to the Romagna countryside. “Living here is a constant dialogue with nature,” says Marcantonio. “I even placed an outdoor bathtub and shower on the terrace, inspired by my travels in Indonesia, so I never lose the feeling of being outside.”The surrounding garden is another of his passions: “I don’t want it to feel too designed. Nature should have its own say,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘Every object has meaning’: the stark white interiors allow the furniture and art pieces to stand out.Photograph: Helenio Barbetta/Living InsideStepping inside the home he shares with his partner, the illustrator Alessandra Bruni, one immediately notices how the interiors reflect his artistic philosophy: a space where raw, sculptural simplicity meets curated eclecticism. “I’ve always been drawn to the stark, sun-drenched interiors of Puglia and Greece, where white dominates and objects are chosen with artistic intent,” he says. His own home follows this ethos, acting as an extension of his creative universe. Here, white walls become blank canvases, punctuated by pieces that tell stories: a Gorilla Chair and pouf fromScarlet Splendour, the Comfy sofa and Sending Pig storage chest fromSeletti, a handcrafted wooden flower table. “Every object has meaning, whether it’s a piece I designed or something I found in a flea market. I see them as characters in a collective narrative.”“What I love is the magical object, a special and unique piece that carries a story, an idea and an intrinsic meaning,” he says. “An object that, for those who own it or for those who can truly see it, holds a value far beyond its market worth. I don’t make a strong distinction between art and design; rather, what I do is search for the artistic aspect within design and make functional what I contemplate.”View image in fullscreen‘There’s no single style, just layers of memories and artistic contaminations’: the dining room with the table made by a friend.Photograph: Helenio Barbetta/Living InsideThe dining area is a study in contrasts: a robust oak table built by a friend, surrounded by traditional Romagnolo osteria chairs and an African stool. Above, in the living area, theKarman Plancton lampcasts an ethereal glow. “I love the mix of influences, from local craftsmanship to global inspirations. There’s no single style, just layers of memories and artistic contaminations.”Perhaps the most personal piece in the house is an old wooden bench from his childhood bedroom, now repurposed as part of the decor. “Each object has a history, a presence. That’s what ties everything together,” he reflects. “Design, for me, is never just about aesthetics, it’s about storytelling.” And so, in this white sculptural haven, Marcantonio continues to craft, dream, and play – surrounded by nature, memory, and the quiet, boundless space where art and life intertwine.For more information, go tomarcantonio.itExplore more on these topicsInteriorsThe ObserverHomesDesignArchitectureSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Looking quietly seems the best way to let a piece of art work its magic. I’m not saying a gallery should be as hushed as a library, but I prefer a contemplative atmosphere where the works can be studied. You can go to the cafe and chat afterwards. Worse than loudly talking, though, is taking selfies in front of an artwork, especially when not bothering to spend time looking at it first!BRArt, aura and the doomed search for the perfect selfie | Rhiannon Lucy CosslettRead moreViewing art is like a conversation between the viewer and the artist. It requires quiet observation and a degree of concentration leading to contemplation. For me, there is an emotional response to some art that I cannot explain, but one work of art “speaks” to me while another does not. It is harder to achieve all this when “influencers” are capering about showing off.MartyWolfIt’s a control thing. I was at a public gallery recently when a “guard” told me, presumably on pain of being evicted, not to point at the art. (I was discussing with a friend the quality of brush work in a landscape painting; I am, for my sins, a painter.) You would have thought that lively discussion would have been welcomed, but no. The gallery space is viewed as an area of privilege that should not be taken for granted by art “lovers”. Loving art is not to be accompanied by too much enthusiasm. The gallery, with its high priests and uniformed enforcers, is a shrine to what art is deemed to be worth, not what art stands for (creative freedom).Peter GregoryBeing quiet is different from being silent. No one should enforce silence on anyone, but if a gallery is not quiet, then meaningful, concentrated reflection is much more difficult. It is also a matter of respect. Why are people expected to be more quieton public transportor in waiting rooms? It shows consideration to those around us. I think discussing what you are viewing in galleries is incredibly important and can make you appreciate things in ways you wouldn’t if you were in total silence. I also think that children shouldn’t be taught to view galleries as oppressive areas designed for adults – this is exclusionary and simply does not promote art to do what it should do, which is inspire and evoke emotion.Silence is golden – but is the railway’s quiet zone on its way out? | Joel SnapeRead moreIt is a nuanced “rule” that should be followed on the understanding that it is not meant to exclude people, but to make galleries places of reflection and tranquility. In a world where many of us wear headphones all day long, noise pollution is the norm and quietness is almost seen as something to be avoided, being expected to be quiet in galleries can be interpreted as a gift.LivWhile the majority of professionals are rethinking the codes of access to art galleries to diversify their audience and attract younger visitors, more and more voices are being raised to attribute a certain snobbism, even a distasteful elitism, to this request of quietness. As a graduate in art history from a working-class background, brought up by self-taught parents who saw galleries and museums as spaces for growth, this position has always intrigued me.I have never heard of a cinema, a public library or a hospital being called snobbish, elitist places. Yet in these buildings, too, a few murmurs are tolerated, if not outright silence and restraint demanded. Why are you expected to be quiet in these places? It is a given that cinema-goers want to enjoy the plot of their film without surrounding noise. Studying or reading in a library is justified by a need to concentrate away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the world. As for hospitals, they are a place of rest for people experiencing different levels of pain. These three places have a lot in common with art galleries, so why should we behave differently inside them?In any public space, you are bound to a social contract with others, one that demands that you respect their space and their peace: this is what the quietness of an art space implies. Asking about the logic of quietness in these spaces without acknowledging the rest of the patrons denotes a certain selfishness that seems so fashionable in our modern society. For a moment, just a moment, you can dispense with being the main character in a film, entitled to your loud lines and your actions in the foreground, neglecting the extras in the background? Because, in fact, you are just the annoying person in their reality.Jennifer GoriHave you been in an art gallery recently?

I’m so impressed with her through the years. To me, she’s sort of like a femaleDonald Trump,” Holt Kramer said of Australia’s richest person.Friends with benefits: Gina Rinehart and Peter Dutton’s ideological love-inRead more“She has the right values for me … She thinks so normally, so intelligently, and she’s only for the betterment of Australia. She loves Australia with her heart and soul.“I have no doubt she’d be a great ambassador.

The plans also include a plaque etched with a quote from Elon Musk on freedom.Rinehart has long had strong views on government overreach and she is now pushing for a Maga-like crusade in Australia, calling on the country’s leaders to follow in the US president’s footsteps.She has beenopenly cultivating her relationshipwith the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, since the 2022 election, and has also hosted multiple fundraisers for his campaign. Her company, Hancock Prospecting, is now the Coalition’s second-largest donor.At an event at her national mining day last November, Rinehart said Australia should learn from the success of Trump.“As I have repeatedly stated, we need to cut government tape, regulations, governments’ wastage and tax burdens across Australia,” Rinehart said.“We need a USA-style Doge [Department of Government Efficiency] that delivers action, one that helps to return dollars to our pockets and investment back to Australia.“Don’t be frightened to call for ‘make our bank accounts great again’,” she said.Gina: Becoming Mrs Rinehart – episode 1 - podcastRead moreRinehart said she wanted to cut the company tax rate and abandon and end subsidies for green energy.Holt Kramer, who describes the Trumpettes as an “awareness group” that has campaigned for Trump over the past decade, said she believed Rinehart would be successful in her campaign to bring similar policies to Australia.View image in fullscreenRinehart spent the 2024 US election night with Teena McQueen, Holt Kramer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage.Photograph: Toni Holt Kramer/Trumpettes USAThe pair sat together on the night of the US election in Mar-a-Lago last November, and were pictured alongside Nigel Farage. They also celebrated Trump’s inauguration together at an event in January.“I think she has her own great ideas. I think she’s inspired by Trump, but I think Gina herself has a lot of great ideas,” Kramer said.“She too has that force that Trump has. Her belief is part of her blood. It’s part of her brain. She didn’t all of a sudden become a believer in the better things for Australia.”Rinehart’s ties to Trump and the US have deepened since he was first elected in 2016, when she first met with his campaign team in Washington. At this year’s inauguration, Rinehart appeared at several official events attended by the new president and took out full-page ads in US papers congratulating him on his victory.One event was a “candlelight dinner” with Trump, which she attended with Hancock Prospecting chief executive, Garry Korte. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and X’s Elon Musk – whom Rinehart has also met and expressed admiration for – were also there.Rinehart also attended theStarlight Ball the night after the inauguration, at which many major donors were present.Trump thanked attenders at the ball for their support, saying: “You believed in us very early.”GinaGina episode 1: Becoming Mrs RinehartSorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen $https://audio.guim.co.uk/2025/03/30-36333-GINA_EP_1_MRS_RINEHART.mp300:00:0000:48:12Australia’s richest person has also increased her investments in the US, with the Australian Financial Reviewreporting she now owns a $1.3bn portfolio in US stocks. This includes shares in Murdoch’s Fox Corp, Musk’s Tesla and the president’s Trump Media & Technology Group, which runs Truth Social.She has also flagged other potential investments under theTrump administration, including in mining, oil and gas and agriculture.Rinehart has spoken personally with Trump since he assumed office.In a speech to her staff at Hancock Prospecting last month to mark her birthday and to acknowledge long-serving staff, Rinehart said she spoke to the new president in early February.“By the time I was able to chat to President Trump [on] Friday night almost two weeks after his inauguration, the president told me more than $3tn dollars had flowed into the USA,” she said.“It will take much more than a tiny tinkering around a few edges to start bank accounts opening and returning the investment flow to Australia. Somehow, we need to get this message to the out-of-touch Canberra cocoon.”She also spoke about her “inspiring” attendance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) in Maryland in February and included a 15-minute extract of a speech from the Argentinian president, Javier Milei.She said the sculpture of Peanut the squirrel and the plaque with the etched quote from Elon Musk would hang in a new teppan-yaki area at her Perth company headquarters.The quote from Musk selected by Rinehart was:The larger government gets, the less individual freedoms you have … Your freedoms have just been eroded year after year with more and more government, laws and regulations and regulatory authorities.Rinehart’s speech also referenced an image of a kangaroo wearing a Driza-Bone – an Australian fashion brandacquired by Rinehartin 2023 – with a sign saying “drain the billabong”. She said she was “borrowing from President Trump’s successful policy, much welcomed by American taxpayers, to drain the swamp”.Listen to the first episode of our new narrative podcast series: GinaDo you know more?

It’s back.”What Trump did not mention was that less than three weeks earlier he hadbarred Associated Press journalistsfrom the Oval Office, because the news agency refused to use his preferred nomenclature for the Gulf of Mexico. He did not mention that he was waging lawsuits against ABC and CBS, nor that the man he appointed chair of the Federal Communications Commission had ordereda flurry of investigationsinto NBC News, NPR and PBS.The president ignored entirely what has become an all out attack on the media and other institutions, something that media experts have described as a “broad, systematic assault” on free speech, a vendetta that threatens “the essential fundamental freedoms of a democracy”.Since that speech the situation has only got worse. The anti-media rhetoric has ramped up from Trump officials, Trump hassuggestedsome media groups should be “illegal”, funding has been cut fromorganisationslike Voice of America and last week the White House lambasted journalist Jeffrey Goldberg and the Atlantic magazine for breaking a scoop about national security lapses on a Signal messaging app.“Revenge is Trump’s number one motivation for anything in this second term of office, and he believes he has been treated unfairly by the media, and he is going to strike out against those in the media who he considers his enemies,” said Bill Press, a longtime liberal political commentator and host ofThe Bill Press Pod.“He’s going in the direction of really curtailing the freedom of the press, following the pattern of every autocrat ever on the planet: they need to shut down a free and independent press in order to get away with their unlimited use of power.”Trump was critical of the media in his first term. But as Press pointed out, that was more verbal attacks: the never-ending accusations of “fake news”, the encouragement of anti-CNN chants at rallies. Two months into Trump’s second term, he has already taken it further. Associated Press, one of the world’s premier news agencies which is relied upon by thousands of news outlets, remains banned from the Oval Office and Air Force one: the president angered by the agency’s refusal to use the term “Gulf of America” to refer to the Gulf of Mexico.Trump issuing the ownerof CBS News for $10bn, alleging the channel selectively edited an interview with Kamala Harris, which the network denies,and the Des Moines Registernewspaper, which he accuses of “election interference” over a poll from before the election that showed Kamala Harris leading Trump in Iowa.The FCC investigations, led by the hardline Trump appointee and Project 2025 author Brendan Carr,are ongoing, while in February Trumpejected a HuffPost reporterfrom the press pool – which refers to a rotating group of reporters allowed close access to the White House – anddenied reportersfrom the news agency Reuters access to a cabinet meeting.View image in fullscreenChairman James Comer speaks in front of posters of NPR headlines during a House oversight and government reform committee hearing on 26 March 2025 in Washington DC.Photograph: Andrew Harnik/Getty ImagesAt various times Trump andrightwing groupshave accused each of the outlets of bias or of presenting negative coverage of his presidency. By contrast, the White House has allowed rightwing news outlets,including Real America’s Voiceand Blaze Media and Newsmax,to be includedin the press pool.“It’s designed to shut down criticism, and I think that the danger of that is that there is this effort to make it look like everyone approves of the government and of theTrump administration,” said Katie Fallow, deputy litigation director at the Knight First Amendment Institute, a non-profit which seeks to preserve and advance first amendment freedom rights.“It’s a threat to the ability of the of the press to critically cover the president, but perhaps more importantly, the function of the press is to inform the public about the workings of government, and allow the public to decide whether or not it wants to vote for these people again, or whether it approves. And so it’s more than just its effect on the media, its effect on the general public.”In recent days the Trump administration’s attack-the-media playbook has been on show in the way senior officials have sought to discredit Goldberg, the editor in chief of the Atlantic who was invited into a secret Signal group where a coming US attack on Yemen’s Houthi militia was being discussed.The defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, the national security adviser, Mike Waltz, and Trump himself have criticized Goldberg: Waltzdescribed himas “the bottom scum of journalists”, while Trump called the reporting “a witch-hunt” and described the Atlantic as a “failed magazine”.Trump has also appeared to flirt with using law enforcement to target the media, includinga speechto federal law enforcement officials in March. “As the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred,” Trump said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Trump’s efforts have increasingly also focussed on areas including education, law and charitable organizations, as the government seeks to bring key aspects of society into line.“You have to look at this as part of a broad, systematic assault that the president and his administration have been waging since he returned to office on every other power center that impacts politics in any way,” said Matthew Gertz, a senior fellow at Media Matters, a watchdog group.“All the sort of liberal, civil society institutions: big law firms, universities, the government itself, the courts and the press have come under fire, and as part of that, we have this really unprecedented multifront attack on media institutions.”Trump has been aided in this endeavor by the owners of some media organizations. Jeff Bezos, the Amazon co-founder and owner of the Washington Post, pulled an editorial endorsing Kamala Harris during the campaign andrecently overhauledthe newspaper’s opinion pages.Amazon donated a million dollars to Trump’s inauguration, and Bezos’ space company Blue Origin competes for federal government contracts. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, also blocked the newspaper from endorsing Harris, while Mark Zuckerbergdismantled Facebook’s factchecking networkafter Trump won the presidency. (Like Bezos, Zuckerberg donated to, and attended, Trump’s inauguration.)“What makes the situation so worrying is that for the last several years, Donald Trump himself and the leading lights of the rightwing media and political movement: from Tucker Carlson to Kevin Roberts at the Heritage Foundation, have cited as their exemplar Viktor Orbán of Hungary. That’s what they want to accomplish,” Gertz said.“And what Orbán did with the press was squeeze different media corporation owners until they agreed to either make their press more palatable to him, or sell their outlets to someone who would. I think that is basically, by their own admission, what the Trump administration is trying to bring about in this country.“I think the hope is that we have more guardrails than Hungary did to prevent that from happening. But it’s unnerving that the president of the United States is trying to follow in those footsteps.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS press and publishingUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After almost three decades working as a nurse, the 68-year-old invested her retirement savings in a two-storey house in San Agustín, a working-class suburb of the Mexican resort town of Acapulco.Montejo’s retirement dream was shortlived. Not long after moving into her newly remodelled home,Hurricane Johndumpedrecord levels of rainfall on Acapulco, triggering landslides and flash floods after calm creeks turned into roaring rivers.In San Agustín, almost 50 homes along a tributary of La Sabana River collapsed after five consecutive days of nonstop rain broke the riverbank. Another 250 homes in the barrio were later condemned as uninhabitable due to the risk of further flooding.View image in fullscreenFlora Montejo shows the damage to her home. She is worried that her house is exposed and unsafe as the rainy season approaches.Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianOne wall of Montejo’s home crumbled after the houses separating hers from the San Agustín River collapsed and floated away. The neighbourhood has been declared a high-risk zone and residents have been told to relocate.“I was looking forward to enjoying my retirement after a stressful career but got only six months in my dream home before disaster struck. I still can’t absorb what has happened,” says Montejo, who is now living at a neighbour’s house with her daughter.I love this mountain and the home we built. But it’s no longer safeFederico Cuenca“My house is exposed and unsafe, and the rainy season is coming. But until the government sends engineers to stabilise the river, I won’t know if my house will be salvageable.”Hurricane Johnbattered the state of Guerreroat a powerful category-3 strength twice over one week last September, dissipating inland before rapidly intensifying again off the coast – in a phenomenon meteorologists have called a“zombie” storm. The slow-moving Pacific storm dumped about a metre (40in) of rain over south-west Mexico,killing at least 29 people– mainly in Guerrero – in flash floods and landslides.View image in fullscreenMuch of the working-class San Agustín area was wrecked by Hurricane John.Photograph: Francisco Robles/GuardianThe record rainfall came less than a year after category-5Hurricane Otis struck Acapulcowith 165mph winds that killedmore than 50 peopleand caused widespread damage to infrastructure – devastating the city’s tourism industry.Otis also upended thousands of trees, leaving parts of the coastline, mountains and riverbanks eroded and exposed. The destruction further increased the region’s vulnerability to wildfires, flooding and landslides.It will take several years for the tourist industry to recover fully, according to Rodolfo Escobar Ávila, a local union leader, in part due to labour shortages caused by forced migration after the storms, as well as insurance disputes that have delayed some hotel and apartment repairs.Map of area of Mexico around AcapulcoStill, the tourist hub of Acapulco is mainly fixed and back in business, while working-class communities around the coastal city feel forgotten and highly vulnerable as another hurricane season approaches.“The government has told us that it’s not safe here, but we have nowhere to go,” says Wendy Silva, 33, a homeowner in San Agustín who worries about her two young children living in a house that is damp and full of cracks.“The river was full of debris and the riverbank was weak from previous storms when John hit. We should not have been so exposed.We’ve never been a priority, and now we feel abandoned.”View image in fullscreenWendy Silva’s claim for compensation was denied. The writing behind her says ‘Caution! High-risk zone.’Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianSix months after Hurricane John flooded San Agustín with mud and rocks, engineering work to stop further riverbank erosion and reduce the risk of future floods and landslides has yet to begin. Residents do not know where or when they will be relocated.Few households, if any, had private home insurance, which is rare among working- and middle-class Mexicans. Many homeowners received about 40,000 pesos (£1,550) in one-off payments from the federal government. However, this was barely enough to cover the clean-up, basic repairs and day-to-day expenses after the storm destroyed jobs and crops. The cost of building materials has also soared since Otis, which caused an estimated$12bn to $16bn(£9.2bn-£12.37bn) in damage.Silva’s mortgage and insurance are part of a federal government programme for low-income workers unable to get private credit. Still, her claim was denied because the house was not damaged enough. “It’s absurd,” says Silva, who is part of the neighbourhood committee that meets government agencies regularly. “We can’t afford to leave.”Renters, such as Magdalena Nieto, 51, and her 81-year-old mother, María, did not qualify for any financial aid, nor did homeowners without individual land titles. “I feel traumatised by what we went through. We get anxious every time I see a cloud,” says Nieto. “I can’t live like this.”View image in fullscreenNearly 50 homes in San Agustín collapsed.Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianAcapulco is a port and beach resort city on Mexico’s Pacific coast, flanked by high-rise hotels and theSierra Madre del Sur mountains. The city’s location and geology make its 1 million inhabitants vulnerable to natural disasters, including earthquakes and tropical storms.Yet construction has expanded largely unchecked in high-risk areas, including entire neighbourhoods built on mountainsides and close to waterways. Some of them, such as the San Agustín River, were redirected to enable government-backed housing developments to be built.The climate crisis is now supercharging the wind and rain in hurricanes such as Otis and John. These storms rapidly intensified due tohigher ocean and atmospheric temperatures,driven by theburning of fossil fuels.Climate change will continue to provoke migration because there will be places where the land can no longer produce foodMayor Abelina López RodríguezOtis was the strongest known hurricane to make landfall in Mexico – and among the most rapidly intensifying cyclones in the world,according to ClimaMeter. After the rains stopped, there were a record number ofwildfires around Acapulco last year, fuelled by the upended trees that acted like kindling, according to the state’s civil protection agency. Then John hit, and there were even fewer trees to absorb the storm water.Climate scientists warn that the severity of such storms and fireswill probably continue to increaseas the planet continues to warm. And asclimate breakdown intensifiesin Guerrero and other regions of Mexico where organised crime is pervasive, climate shocks such as drought, sea-level rises and floods could also worsen forced migration and conflicts over access to land and water.“We are vulnerable in Acapulco because of our location, but human beings don’t care enough about the environment or climate change. We’re mostly to blame,” says Carlos Manuel Nino, 22, a builder in San Agustín whose parents’ home was severely damaged by Otis. The family’s income dropped after his mother stopped selling tamarind sweets in the hotel district after extortion demands.View image in fullscreenCarlos Manuel Nino carries out repairs on a building damaged in the hurricane.Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianLarge swathes of Mexico arehighly vulnerableto global heating. Sandwiched between two oceans, the increased risks from rising sea levels, floods, drought and extreme temperatures threaten food production, biodiversity and scarce water supplies.Yet Mexico contributes onlyabout 1.5%of global greenhouse gas emissions. The top four emitters, China, the US, India and Russia, combined account formore than 57% of global CO2emissions.The city’s mayor, Abelina López Rodríguez, says: “Latin America and the Caribbean are very vulnerable to climate change, but what happened in Acapulco should be a point of reflection internationally.“The president of the United States should stop threatening us with tariffs and, as one of the world’s biggest emitters, focus on mitigation and reducing emissions rather than just telling us to adapt,” she says. “If not, climate change will continue to provoke migration because there will be places where the land can no longer produce food.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Families had to sell animals, spend their meagre savings to buy maize and find extra money on top of the federal compensation to pay for repairs.“We are rushing to get the repairs done before the rains come, trying to make the house a bit stronger and safer than before,” says Reina García, 37, who has a collection of containers to catch the water leaking through the cracks caused by the storms.View image in fullscreenReina García points out some of the leaks in her home.Photograph: Francisco Robles/GuardianAfter each hurricane, the city administration went from house to house in affected communities to carry out a census for the federal government to allocate compensation.Our vulnerability to storms, floods, heat and fires has increased because of climate change and over-developmentBrenda Jiménez says no one was home when the census workers came to El Campanario, so the family received no financial aid. Otis destroyed their wooden supports and roofing panels, devastating the family’s outdoor cooking area and bathroom. The main house also lost its metal roof, leaving unprotected concrete slabs.“We have no privacy. I have to keep watch for people coming down the mountain when my children go to the bathroom,” says Jiménez, 33. “I don’t know what we’ll do if another hurricane hits.”Her father-in-law, Mario García, 66, did receive government help after Otis and is trying to improve on his tiny one-room wooden home, which blew away entirely. But he ran out of money, leaving an unfinished roofless shell of concrete blocks. “We’re so isolated on this mountain; if another storm comes, I worry we might die,” he says.View image in fullscreenRebuilding in Acapulco. Only wealthier households in Mexico have private home insurance.Photograph: David Guzman/EPAIn Acapulco, some experts fear that the city is not investing adequately in climate resilience – or taking difficult political decisions to reduce the risk of future devastation by restricting new development in areas at high risk of floods, landslides and fires.“This has always been a high-risk area, but our vulnerability to storms, floods, heat and fires has increased because of climate change and over-development, which have reduced our natural protection,” says one scientist, who asked not to be named.“We know the lessons, but the decision-makers are not willing to change building regulations or invest the money needed in adaptation and resilience.”View image in fullscreenSoldiers patrol the streets of Acapulco. After a brief truce between the two big cartels, residents face renewed violence and extortion.Photograph: Francisco Robles/AFP/GettyExtreme-weather events expose and exacerbate existing inequalities and challenges, including organised crime. Acapulco has long been a conduit for cocaine arriving from South America en route to the US. Violence, including murders, has flared up amid fights over territory and, more recently, extortion rackets.‘The children screamed for hours’: horrors of Hurricane Otis leave devastation for Acapulco’s poorestRead moreAccording to informal reports, Otis led to a brief truce between the city’s two main organised crime groups, mostly due to widespread power and communications blackouts and road closures. However, looting, extortion and attacks on public transport then surged again,despite 25,000 troops being deployedto the area after the storm.Several thousand troops are still in the area, but violence and extortion continue to heap pressure on people as they try to recover from the hurricanes.“Otis and John demonstrated how the presence of organised crime and narco-politics weakens the state’s ability to prevent and respond to disasters,” says Erubiel Tirado, an expert in organised crime and human rights atMexicoCity’s Ibero University.“As Mexico experiences more climate impacts, weak governance and the lack of development could generate even more social conflict and insecurity.”Another community designated as high-risk and uninhabitable is La Libertad, where a landslide killed two residents on the fifth day of rain from Hurricane John. On one mountain road, more than a dozen houses were flattened or swept away by a landslide – in an area rumoured to be dotted with clandestine graves.View image in fullscreenGiant boulders were swept down a mountain road through La Libertad by landslides after the last hurricane.Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianResidents extracted some vehicles from the muddy debris but others remained stuck along the route of the landslide, which left a snaking scar visible from miles away.Six months on, partially crushed houses, trees and debris still dangle precariously off the unpaved road as rocks continue to fall. Residents recently pooled resources to build a small wall, bridge and drainage system, but these makeshift structures may offer little protection once the rains begin in May.Federico Cuenca, 63, who has lived in this informal settlement for 40 years, says: “Many agencies came here after John and made a lot of promises, but six months on, we’re in the same risky situation. Civil protection told us this mountain might collapse; we’re scared for our lives and want answers.”View image in fullscreenMuch of Federico Cuenca’s workshop was damaged or swept away, but he does not want to leave La Libertad.Photograph: Francisco Robles/The GuardianThe mud ruined Cuenca’s vehicles, and much of his metal workshop was damaged or swept away. His son, daughter-in-law and grandson have moved out, too scared to remain, but Cuenca and his wife, Luz María, do not want to leave.“We are working on a plan B, and maybe we leave for the rainy season each year,” says Cuenca. “I love this mountain and the home we built.

But organizers can learn from the movement’s lossesCarter ShermanSun 30 Mar 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 09.22 EDTShareView image in fullscreenDressed in his trademark sunglasses and a skintight black T-shirt, Andrew Tate strode into a Las Vegas arena like a returning king. He was there to watch Power Slap, a UFC offshoot where people slap each other in the face with such force thatdoctors sayit could lead to brain damage and death.Days earlier, Tate and his brother Tristan had been in Romania, their assets seized, awaiting trial on human trafficking charges. But followingreported conversationsbetween Romanian officials and the Trump administration, the Romanian government lifted a travel ban on the brothers. Now, as a heavily male crowd watched men slap one another so hard they collapsed, the UFC president, Dana White, warmly embraced the Tates. White, a Trump ally andMeta board member who was once caught on camera slapping his own wife, smiled at the Tates, looked them in the eyes, and told them: “Welcome to the States, boys.”The next day, the Tates were back for a mixed martial arts fight night. This time, they were joined in the crowd by the FBI director, Kash Patel, and Mel Gibson–another Trump ally, who once pled no contest to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge.It was a show of manpower, in every sense of the word.And it’s the kind of head-spinning display that has become a fixture ofUS politics.Eight years ago, the words “#MeToo” was thumbed out more than 19m times on Twitter. Pundits feared that a single, unproven allegation could vaporize a man’s career. Now, theTrump administrationseems to treat such allegations as a job requirement.Twomembersof Trump’s cabinet stand accused of sexual assault, whileanotherallegedly enabled the sexual abuse of children.Elon Musk, whose “department of government efficiency” is now shredding federal agencies, has beensaid to treat womenlike sex objects “to be evaluated on their bra size”. And, of course, there’s Trump himself: a man who has gloried in “grabbing ‘em by the pussy”, been found liable for the sexual abuse of one woman and faced accusations of sexual misconduct fromdozens more. (All of these people deny wrongdoing, except White, who hasadmitted to slapping his wife.)Meanwhile, famous women who say they were hurt aretorn apart on the internet. Even Twitter is gone, cannibalized by Musk into X.How did this happen? How could the United States, so recently the beating heart of a global movement to stop sexual violence, go so thoroughly – and brutishly – backwards?Over years of interviewing sex and sexual violence researchers, educators, activists, pollsters and scores of ordinary Americans under 30, I have heard all kinds of thoughts and theories about sex and gender relations in the post-#MeToo US. Overall, people agreed, there is far more cultural awareness of sexual misconduct. Dozens of states have moved to protect people from workplace harassment, while nearly 30 have loosened their statutes of limitation around allegations of sex abuse, allowing people to pursue lawsuits that would have once been off-limits.These are not small victories, but they are limited ones. Many of the #MeToo movement’s demands were never cemented into policy.But those demands, and the cultural strides that accompanied them, have proved enough to spark a revenge campaign that is not only setting fire to hard-won rights for women, LGBTQ+ folks and people of color but also sending young men careening to the right. These men are finding a home in the manosphere, that burgeoning online realm that is at best uninterested in women and at worst interested in violating them. The sweeping nature of the backlash to #MeToo – playing out in our federal government, on our screens, in our communities – can feel so all-encompassing as to be overwhelming.Did it have to be this way? As Americans struggle to respond to the whiplash, the #MeToo movement’s legacy reveals some much needed lessons about how progressives and feminists may move forward in a deeply uncertain time. For starters: talk about class, and talk to men. Indeed, these may be the same lesson.View image in fullscreen‘The backlash is out in the open’The activist Tarana Burke started the Me Too movement in 2006, but #MeToo did not explode into the public consciousness until October 2017, when the New York Times broke the news of workplace sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the actor Alyssa Milano urged her followers to tweet “me too” if they had endured sexual misconduct. What followed was nothing short of a worldwide reckoning:hundreds of high-profile men lost their jobsand untold numbers of people grasped for the first time that they, too, had survived sexual violence.Some reprisal to #MeToo’s progress might be expected, given that feminist organizing has a history of unleashing anti-women sentiments, as the journalistSusan Faludichronicled in her seminal 1991 book Backlash. After first-wave feminists launched the fight for women’s suffrage in the mid-1800s, states rushed to curb access to divorce, birth control and abortion. After the second-wave feminists of the 1960s and 70s fought to improve access to the very same resources, as well as better workplace conditions, Ronald Reagan’s administration pushed women out of government, shut down initiatives for domestic violence survivors and gutted the only federal program dedicated to expanding equal education for girls.Yet the 1980s backlash, in Faludi’s view, now looks “tame in comparison” to today’s.“In the 80s, the media and popular culture framed the backlash message as one of concern for women: Feminism was making these poor liberated ladies unhappy, unwed, barren and bonkers,” Faludi wrote in an email. “If you want to be Pollyanna about it, I guess you could say at least now the backlash is out in the open – the wolf’s no longer wearing sheep’s clothing.”In the weeks since taking office, Trump has launched McCarthyist campaigns tostamp out diversity, equity and inclusion initiativesand “gender ideology”, erasing evidence of contributions to history by women, people of color andLGBTQ+ folks. He haseviscerated programsthat help these groups succeed in public life, from theEqual Employment Opportunity CommissionandNational Labor Relations Boardtocivil rights officesto thenation’s oldest family planning program. His administration’s attacks on scientific research have hacked away at efforts to improvematernal mortality,intimate partner violence,access to contraceptionandsexual assault. At one major research agency, projects’ inclusion of the words “women”, “female” and “gender” have been enough totrigger intense scrutinyfor potentially violating Trump’s executive orders.But the backlash to #MeToo is not only unfolding in government corridors. It is also attempting to ruin people who live far from the halls of power.In 2021, Bay Higginbotham published a blog post about a relationship with their older boss that, they said, involved sexual abuse. The Dallas-area hairstylist felt like their career would be at stake if they turned their boss down; sometimes, the sex became so violent that Higginbotham would be in “physically unbearable pain”, cry or throw up, court documents allege.#MeToo, Higginbotham told me in an interview years later, helped them come forward. “I don’t think it would have been possible for me to even think that I could do that, without these hundreds of thousands of other people saying: ‘Yeah, I’ve experienced something too,’” Higginbotham said.Then, in April 2022, Higginbotham’s former boss sued them for defamation. In a complaint that repeatedly misgendered Higginbotham, the boss denied all wrongdoing and accused Higginbotham of waging an inexplicable “hate campaign”.“You can’t just lie about people and ruin their life’s as the woke mob with a fake sob story and no proof will slander your name,” read one erratically punctuated post from a Facebook account under the boss’s name, which was documented in court records. “Million dollar court cases is the last resort to slap some sense into these lying females who often suffer mental illness, regret, shame, infidelity, hurt feelings, didn’t get famous, didn’t become successful, embarrassed or just want to be part of drama at other peoples expense.”By silencing people who speak out about sexual misconduct, defamation lawsuits have quietly become a key feature of the #MeToo backlash. Out of the 400-plus cases supported by the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, a post-#MeToo organization that helps people who have experienced sexual harassment at work, nearly a fifth were in defense of someone who’d been sued for defamation after alleging sexual misconduct.In an interview, Higginbotham frequently and visibly trembled as they spoke about the lawsuit. “It impacted everything – work, school, my relationships,” they said. “I still feel nervous and scared to talk about my own opinions and thoughts with this. I have had those used against me a lot.”Trump has filed a defamation suit of his own: against E Jean Carroll, who had accused him of raping her and sued him for defamation when he denied it.A judge tossed Trump’s countersuit, while a jury found that Trump wasliable for sexually abusing Carroll(but stopped short of finding him liable for rape). “You’ve got to deny, deny, deny and push back on these women,”Trump reportedly once told a friend. “If you admit to anything and any culpability, then you’re dead.”View image in fullscreenBoys being boysWhile the internet once ignited the #MeToo movement, it has also helped foment the backlash – in the form of the manosphere.Once a word for the websites, blogs and forums that played home to incels, pick-up artists and other “male supremacists”, the manosphere is now sometimes believed to encompass less extremist personalities like Joe Rogan and the Nelk boys. Its denizens share a bunker mentality:Men aren’t welcome in mainstream media anymore – but here, boys can be boys.By 2024, 65% of men between the ages of 18 and 29 agreed with the statement that “guys can have their reputations destroyed just for speaking their mind”, according to polling by YouGov and the Young Men Research Initiative, which examines young men’s rightward drift. It’s a belief with profound political consequences: 85% of young men who voted for Trump agree with that statement.As the manosphere’s prominence began to grow,more people startedreporting online harassment that includes stalking, physical threats or sexual harassment. Nonconsensual image abuse, or “revenge porn”, has also skyrocketed: Between 2013 and 2023, sites that collect these intimate images grew from 40 to nearly 10,000,according to the scholar Danielle Citron.“That proliferation of online spaces really boomed post-#MeToo,” said the researcher Katie Bogen. Their growth, she suspects, constitutes another aspect of backlash thinking: “‘Women want to talk about sexual violence in online spaces? Survivors want to come forward in online spaces? Let’s set up a retaliatory mechanism to keep these people in their place.’”Musk’s X might be one of these spaces: content reported under its nonconsensual nudity policy,one pre-print paperfound, is frequently left online.#MeToo did not seem to lead men to even realize that they, too, had a stake in ending sexual violence. While women and LGBTQ+ people became more likely to report sexual violence to researchers, there was no corresponding rise in among cis, straight boys and men, one study found (even though one in three men have experienced “sexual violence involving physical contact”, according to the CDC). And in interviews with dozens of anti-sexual assault advocates, the researcher Shana Maier found that more than a quarter felt that #MeToo excluded men.“One interesting thing that I saw very early in the #MeToo movement was the backlash against men who were joining in the hashtag thing and then people telling them, ‘this is not your moment,’” one advocate told Maier. “If a man was saying ‘me too’ people were like, ‘This is about women. Why are you trying to make this about you?’”View image in fullscreen‘Let it go’Although #MeToo raised cultural awareness around sexual misconduct and helped strengthen many laws, the movement’s successes were ultimately, tragically limited.Reports of sexual violence among women and LGBTQ+ people have surged since #MeToo – but primarily, it seems, in academic research, where survivors may only be asked to check a box or confide only in researchers. Multiple studies have concluded that most survivors have not become more likely to disclose their experiences to friends, family or the police, or to seek help from victim services.“I knew it was a possibility to file a police report, but I also knew that it wasn’t really done,” a 24-year-old woman from New Jersey told meinan interview conducted as research for a forthcoming book. She said that, at 18, she had been raped on prom night by her boyfriend. The couple frequented the local DIY music scene; she knew other girls in the scene who had also endured what she called “experiences with other, older losers”. None had gone to the police.“I felt so much pressure just to let it go and let it not be a big deal,” she said. “By the time I came to my anger, I felt like it was too late.”Nor are institutions necessarily taking sexual violence more seriously.The researcher Nicole Bedera spent 2018 and 2019 – the first full school year after #MeToo washed across social media – embedded at a university, studying its processes for handling reports of sexual harassment and assault. “During my entire year in the field, I never heard a school administrator talk about #MeToo,” she said. “Unless it was to disparage it and to say that women today – their expectations of men were too high, that they were blaming men for things that in the past were fine.”An investigation of dozens of public universities found that, even when schools determined that a student should be held responsible for committing sexual misconduct,most were allowedto continue their education without disruption. In contrast,a survey of people who reported sexual violenceto school officials found that almost 40% took a leave of absence, transferred or dropped out entirely.“Sexual violence is one of the best predictors of whether or not a woman will complete her degree. The unwillingness to get it under control creates a lot of lifelong gender disparities across our society,” said Bedera,who turned her research into a book. “It is a resegregation effort to say: ‘Oh, we know that this thing leads women to exit public society, and if we keep that in place, we’re going to have a workforce and education spaces that are more male-centered.’”In an ominous sign for the future, educational efforts to address sexual violence did not take hold after #MeToo. Although state lawmakersintroduced 109 billsto advance comprehensive sex ed – which includes training about consent – in the first half of 2018, only six passed. Another six advocated for sex ed that preached abstinence. Such sex ed only teaches people to say “no” to sex; it does not help them when someone says “no” to sex and their partner doesn’t respect it. By 2024, state-level bills that propose teaching about consenthad virtually vanished(a development that also speaks to the Christian religious right’s growing power).Many of the young adults I interviewed had next to no memories of #MeToo. “I remember seeing ‘#MeToo’ everywhere,” a 19-year-old woman from Hawaii recalled. “But I honestly don’t even really know what it is.”She did, however, know what it was like to grow up in a country that treated sexual violence as normal, even expected. “Almost all of my friends in Hawaii were raped growing up,” she said. “Looking back, I definitely should have said something. But at the time, my friends were begging me not to say anything to anyone.”View image in fullscreenIt’s the economy, stupidIn the 1980s, the disappearance of manufacturing jobs and the demonization of welfare led men to scapegoat women for their economic frustrations.Menhave always been more conservative than women, but poll after poll in those years found that single young men increasingly “feared and reviled feminism”, Faludi wrote. One pollster told her: “It’s these downscale men, the ones who can’t earn as much as their fathers, who we find are the most threatened by the women’s movement.”In this moment of political peril and outright hostility towards feminism, the #MeToo movement’s triumphs and losses offer organizers a lesson: focus on class and men.Men’s economic anxieties remain inextricably tied to their feelings about masculinity, feminism and sexual violence – and women remain easy targets. A 2023 not-yet-published study authored by Annabelle Hutchinson, an assistant professor of government at New York’s Hamilton College, found that when white men are out of work, they become less likely to vote for women. They also become more likely to support statements like “women who complain about discrimination and harassment cause more problems than they solve.” (White women, Black men and Latino men were not found to react this way.)It would not have been a stretch to channel #MeToo’s momentum into a workers’ movement; after all, it broke out in response to the allegations of workplacesexual harassment against Weinstein. And some of #MeToo’s most prominent backers did attempt to incorporate economic demands into the movement. In January 2018, Hollywood actors gathered together to announce a bifurcated new initiative to support working-class people fight against sexual harassment: the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund and a separate organization known only as Time’s Up. But while the National Women’s Law Center still runs the Defense Fund, the Time’s Up organization –dogged by years of accusationsof incompetent management and lack of focus – finally collapsed after news broke that some of its (wealthy) leaders had tried to help the former New York governor Andrew Cuomo fend off sexual harassment allegations. Their allegiance to the upper class seemed to trump any notion of sisterhood.What if #MeToo’s push to oust high-profile men had been accompanied by more organizing for better conditions for workers? We’ll never know, but perhaps it could have created some cross-gender solidarity and held off one of the most powerful precursors of backlash. It could have even done something more powerful: lead men to recognize that feminism could benefit them, too.View image in fullscreenThe sex policeIn interviews with young men, Daniel Cox, director of the Survey Center on American Life at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, found that #MeToo had left men defensive. They worried they would be unjustly cancelled.“There’s a sense among a lot of young men that you need to be a little bit more on your guard and careful about what you say and what you do,” Cox said. “Because it can land you in a lot of trouble.”That attitude can understandably frustrate and exhaust feminists. Not only are men still unlikely to be held accountable for sexual misconduct, but before #MeToo, the bar for consent was so low that ants could backflip over it. A 1990s survey of thousands of Americans’ sex lives found that only 3% of men said they had sexually forced a woman, but about 22% of women said they had been sexually forced by a man. Half of these women had been forced by a man they were in love with. “Most men who forced sex did not recognize how coercive the women thought their behavior was,” researchers concluded.If the modest changes wrought by #MeToo are so destabilizing for men, then how are we ever supposed to eradicate sexual violence? (Tellingly, young women don’t seem to share their male peers’ objections to #MeToo, as experts believe the movement is one of the main reasons why theyare more progressive and politically engaged than ever.)At the same time, dismissing men’s opinion of #MeToo can lead to political ruin. Too many young men now see the Democrats as the sex police: punitive, small-minded and, frankly, not fun. Unfair or not, perceptions like these are the death knell of organizing.“The Democrats are focusing so much on what you can’t do, what’s inappropriate, what’s harmful,” Cox said. “People don’t want to feel that, at any moment, someone can look at what they’re saying or doing and publicly shame them or get them in trouble with an employer.”Shauna Daly, executive director of the Young Men Research Project, believes that Democrats can still right the ship. They need to start off, she said, by acknowledging thatyoung men are really struggling: in addition to their stagnating wages, they are today less likely than women to go to college and more likely to die of suicide.“The right has been able to weaponize that disorientation and that frustration and say that these changes and these lowered fortunes are because of women and immigrants,” Daly said. “There’s a persuasion that has to happen from the left that says: ‘It is because of systems that are rigged against you, but let’s go fix those systems. Let’s make sure that men do have better options. Let’s address the concentration of wealth that is sending money to billionaires while you’re not able to get a better job.’”View image in fullscreenA sliver of hopeMany of the men who were seemingly felled by #MeToo have returned to the public eye with minimal consequences. For example, although a state investigation found that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women and created a hostile work environment, he is now running for mayor of New York – and polling far ahead of his competitors.Yet the publicist Joanna Klonsky, at least, has not given up hope for #MeToo’s legacy. “I can point to so many survivors, who I’ve worked with, whose abusers or assaulters are no longer in a position of power over them or over other women,” said Klonsky, who helps sexual assault survivors get in touch with journalists. “For that reason, it’s impossible for me to say there’s been no positive effect from this.”The defamation case against Higginbotham finally went to trial in 2024. Higginbotham testified; so did several other witnesses. And in the end, the jury found that Higginbotham did not owe their ex-boss any money.It is no small success to convince 12 strangers, in a conservative Texas county, to back a non-binary person telling a story of sexual violence, Higginbotham’s lawyer, said Justin Wood,.“I think average people – when talking about it and dealing with it and listening to others – can come to the right conclusion,” Wood said. “I’m definitely not going to say that everyone will always win, but I wouldn’t say that it’s hopeless.”The ferocity of the #MeToo backlash is perhaps the strongest evidence that the movement was getting somewhere, that its rise and fall gave people a vocabulary to speak out about sexual misconduct and led people to take it more seriously. The cost of coming forward can still be immense. The backlash may still metastatize. But there are also still avenues for fighting back.“It’s why I spoke up in the first place,” Higginbotham said. “So that other people can hear this and feel like they can share their truth as well.”This article was amended on 30 March 2025 to reflect that Mel Gibson pledno contest to a misdemeanor domestic violence charge."

Now it’s reaching the youngest among us, and parents and teachers are grappling with the most responsible way to introduce their under-13s to a new technology that may fundamentally reshape the future. Though the terms of service for ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and other AI models specify that the tools are only meant for those over 13, parents and teachers are taking the matter of AI education into their own hands.Inspired by astory we published on parents who are teaching their children to use AIto set them up for success in school and at work, we asked Guardian readers how and why – or why not – others are doing the same. Though our original story only concerned parents, we have also included teachers in the responses published below, as preparing children for future studies and jobs is one of educators’ responsibilities as well.Some parents and teachers told us they are going full steam ahead, integrating ChatGPT into everyday interactions with their children to explain new concepts, answer incessant questions and illustrate fanciful tales. Others, wary ofthe dangers AI can pose to young people, are demonstrating it only a little at a time in closely supervised settings.Still other parents and teachers are refraining from showing their children and students how to use AI at all, concerned about harms and the impossibility of ethical use of a technology stillrife with unresolved copyright questions. We felt their responses made valuable contributions to the discussion, too.The answers below have been edited for length and clarity.‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIRead moreThe parents explaining the world with AI’s helpI swear, watching my kids discover AI has been one of those unexpected parenting joys nobody tells you about. Remember when we all used to say, ‘Let’s Google it’? Well, my nine-year-old has completely ditched that phrase. Now it’s always ‘Daddy, can we ChatGPT it?’ whenever he’s stuck on homework. The best part? He’s learning to ask for hints instead of answers – figuring things out himself but with a little AI nudge.Then there’s my six-year-old – this kid’s questions could outlast anyone’s patience! You know those evenings when your brain is completely fried but they’re still going strong? That’s when our AI buddy steps in. He will chat away for half an hour, bouncing from dinosaurs to space to ‘why is water wet?’ while I secretly recharge my mental batteries.My daughter is only three but already thinks she’s royalty. Instead of reading the same princess books for the millionth time, we now create stories where SHE’S the princess having these wild adventures.–Matt, consultant, 44, Palm Beach Gardens, FloridaI use AI as a kind of intellectual backstop when I’m having a conversation with my children and I can’t answer one of their questions. We have AI voice assistants at home and in the car so this has recently involved asking Alexa for the population of China and examples of how you can use the word ‘credential’ for homework. It fast forwards the conversation and keeps the learning flowing. My children are aware that AI can hallucinate, however, so you need to sense check responses. Alexa recently came up with some incorrect answers about the book Ann of Green Gables, which my eight year old challenged!–Graham, writer, Lamberhurst QuarterI use AI tools with my three-year-old to help explore the world. We use apps to identify birdsongs and plants on our daily walks, and ChatGPT to answer questions he has about the world (“what are bones for? Where did my bones come from?”) especially when we get new books from the library on something he hasn’t learned much about yet. I want him to feel comfortable turning to AI to augment his curiosity. At the same time, we minimize all passive play, including screen time.For now, I try to make time for us to tell stories to each other and do imaginative play for the topics he asks AI about, so he has a chance to do some generative engagement.AI is a daily part of our routine, but it’s not a particularly high priority.–Nate, data scientist, East Bay, California.I am currently introducing OpenAI’s ChatGPT to my oldest daughter, describing it as a creative helper that can be both friend or foe and teaching her basic prompts to make an AI work and benefit you. I show her my daily usage of AI in my working area, creating mails for me, optimising event planning, structuring data. I am teaching her that you have to be always sceptical when using AI and should not start to rely completely on its answers, which in fact can be wrong.–Ben, 47, entrepreneur, GermanyMy son understands Italian (my language) but speaks back in Dutch. My Dutch is very poor. I am occasionally making use of ChatGPT voice interaction tool to translate more complicated things from Italian/English into Dutch – with the upside that the output can be tailored to a six-year-old.–Name withheld, NetherlandsTo introduce them to AI, we logged into ChatGPT and generated images based on their prompts. While their understanding is still very limited, they are beginning to grasp the idea that you can create fake images and videos online.We then worked together to create a story, which we gave to ChatGPT to generate a screenplay of a news report. Taking this a step further, we used NotebookLM to convert it into a podcast, which I played through our car stereo. The podcast was formatted as a legitimate-sounding news report, but the story itself was absurd – our Shetland pony turning into a unicorn and teaming up with a toy gibbon to fight evil sheep in Co Kerry.After listening, I asked them whether we should believe the news report. We then searched online for evidence of the story and, unsurprisingly, found nothing. This helped illustrate the importance of verifying information, even when it sounds official. I have no idea how much of this lesson will stick, but it’s an ongoing conversation.My five-year-old, in particular, is starting to grasp that AI can generate fake content, and my hope is that this awareness will help him recognise or at least question misleading material in the future.–David, software developer, IrelandFor pupils struggling with writing, I encourage them to ask AI for feedback at a sentence level, requesting information about why sentences don’t parse, together with grammatical explanations.I encourage them not to use AI to produce whole essays because that’s not how they will learn. Some still ignore this advice, of course!–Jenny, English and drama teacher, Valencia, SpainI have a girl, six and a boy, 11. Both access chatGPT via myself. They know if dad does not know something they may insist he asks chatGPT. And I often do, while curating the response. The boy may also access it himself, most often to ask some questions about the world around.I want kids to understand that LLMs are a tool to be used to achieve our goals. We also talked about kids who do homework with AI. I explained that we humans, also have computers in our heads which have to be trained in order for us to be successful and own tools of our success.–Anton, fintech director, GenevaI have been frequently rendered speechless over these past two years by all the changes introduced in my profession by AI. I have an 11-yo and I am staunchly trying to ensure that the first (and possibly only) intelligence she uses must be her own; she is aware of the existence of ChatGPT, AI translation engines and the like, but does not use them for schoolwork or any other writing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Would they ask their teacher to write them an essay? No. Would they ask their teacher how to improve their essay? Yes.At the same time, I remind students that AI is inaccurate. It will lie and provide false information. They will need to exercise their critical thinking and fact-checking skills. While we do have guidelines in place to cite AI use, I tell my students they should never cite AI, similar to my guidelines around Wikipedia.–Adam, secondary English teacher, Vancouver, BC, CanadaWhenever I have used AI in the classroom it has been to spark children’s imaginations, rather than replace them. Adobe Firefly is great for encouraging descriptive writing in English, I simply type in children’s noun-phrases or lists of adjectives and AI creates an image based on the description. We can then adjust our vocabulary and take great delight in how AI interprets it quite literally. This is also a really important lesson as children can see first hand that AI has its flaws.I have also used character.AI to bring historical characters to life to generate quotations and responses for children, based on their questions.The children always ask for the website address so they can have a go at home, but I have not shared these directly. I advise the children that sometimes AI can appear so human, that children can become confused and start believing that the voice that answers is real. So AI tools and websites should always be used with an adult who can remind them and keep them safe online.–Angie, primary teacher, Tunbridge WellsI have chosen to introduce AI in generative ways – making clear that this is a tool, and it should be used. You need to know how to yield a hammer before you can use it; similarly, I see AI in the same way. Students more or less see it the same. Their teachers often don’t. I predominantly teach Māori and Pasifika students, and although they are often – and rightfully! – annoyed that their culture is sometimes misunderstood by these AI models, the technology is so inherently compelling that students take to it faster than their teachers.I have done simple things like, for example, during a speech unit, having students use it to generate a speech on a random topic, from a list of random unfamiliar topics, to get them up and talking.–Adam, 28, high school teacher, Christchurch, New ZealandThe parents using AI to help with homeworkMy 11-yo son uses it to help with homework and studying. He needs to get ideas and then reformulate the answer in his own words, so it’s not a copy and paste job.–Joanna, housewife and carer, BathI started introducing AI to my first born who is in secondary school while doing his school homework.My approach has been to show him how AI, particularly ChatGPT, can help to understand better concepts and encourage responsible use. The reason is because as ardent user of technology l believe the earlier he gets to know it will make him better since the AI revolution is here to stay–Richard, university lecturer, UgandaThe parents who are not introducing AI to their childrenMy five-year-old son barely even knows the internet exists. Computers are for video calls, games, movies, and reading the day’s temperature off the Met Office website. He definitely doesn’t need to know anything about LLMs at this stage and certainly shouldn’t use them. He needs to learn how to write his own words and draw his own pictures, not use machines for plagiarising and stunting his imagination. If LLMs come up, I would strongly encourage my son not to use them.They are built on the backs of labour and art from writers and artists who have not licensed their work for this purpose. They are plagiarism machines. They can’t create anything new.I would tell him to be suspicious of any machine wanting to write words for him, which is tantamount to thinking his thoughts for him.

And they want their leaders to get mad, too.“I wish you’d be angry,” a constituenttoldrepresentative Gil Cisneros, a Democrat of California, at a recent town hall. At an event in Minnesota featuring a panel of Democratic attorneys general, an activistvoiced a similar sentiment: “Get angry, man,” punctuating the message with a profanity.The anger roiling the party, slow to build, is now a forceful current coursing through the electorate and pulling in Americans terrified that the country isdescending into authoritarianism. Democrats – with no leader to guide them and little power to wield in Washington – are scrambling to harness the sudden fury.At rallies, town halls and protests, voters are venting their fury with Donald Trump and his empowerment ofElon Musk’s full-frontalassault on federal agencies, stoking whatprogressive activists believeare the embers of a populist backlash against the president – and the Democratic leaders they believe are not meeting the moment.Tens of thousands of left-leaning votersflockedto “Fight Oligarchy” rallies hosted by Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez across three western states last week. Democratic members of Congress spoke to packed crowds at events in House districts held by Republicans, who have been advised not to hold town hall meetings in this climate. And the Arizona senator Mark Kelly joined theTesla Takedown movement,offloading his electric carafter a public spat with Musk.View image in fullscreenAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez rallies alongside Bernie Sanders in Tempe, Arizona, on 20 March.Photograph: Calvin Stewart/Zuma Press Wire/Rex/ShutterstockDespite the rising tide of anger, Democrats still have no clear strategy to confront Trump or the chainsaw-wielding Musk, who said in aninterview on Thursdaythat his mission to slash federal spending by $1tn could be completed within weeks. Their popularity is cratering and they remain divided over policy and messaging.The deep discontent among Democrats has some wondering whether they areon the vergeof their own Tea Party-style, grassroots revolt.“What if we didn’t suck?” Kat Abughazaleh, a 26-year-old progressive TikTok star said in acampaignvideo launching her bid this week for a safely Democratic Illinois House district that is currently represented by the long-serving representative Jan Schakowsky.“This isn’t a referendum on Schakowsky,” Abughazaleh said in an interview. “We need to try something different and I am sick of waiting around for someone to do something. There is no mythical, perfect candidate that’s coming out of the woodwork to save us.”There is near universal agreement that the party needs a post-election reset. In aninterview with the Los Angeles Times​ on Friday, California governor Gavin Newsom, the Democratic leader of the largest blue state, said his party’s brand had become “toxic”.“People don’t think we make any damn sense,” he said.Recent polling reflects the grim state of affairs. Just 40% of Democrats approved of the way their leaders in Congress were handling the job, compared with 49% who disapproved, according to a Quinnipiac University poll last month. The survey, which marked what the university’s polling analyst Tim Malloy called a “sobering slap-down of historic proportions for the Democrats in Congress”, was conducted weeks before the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer provided the votes to pass the Republican-drafted government funding bill that ignited afurious backlashand led to calls for new leadership.A survey released this week by the progressive polling firm Data for Progress showed that 70% of Democratic voters gave the party’s response to Trump a “C” grade or below, with 21% assigning a failing grade.A strong majority of respondents expressed a desire for new leadership in the party, with 69% agreeing that older leaders should retire and pass the torch to the next generation: Democrats with the skill and instinct to compete in a more hostile political – and media – landscape. “What if we came out strong, metaphorical guns a-blazing?” Abughazaleh said.Anger can be a powerful electoral force, said Steven W Webster, political scientist at Indiana University and the author ofAmerican Rage: How Anger Shapes Our Politics.“An angry voter is a loyal voter,” he said, but there is a risk for Democrats if they fail to match the anger in their base, he said: “They run the risk of having their voters turn on them.”The progressive group Indivisible is leading a campaign demanding Schumer step aside as leader – though Schumer remains defiant. Leftwing groups are also ramping up efforts to challenge Democratic incumbents in next year’s midterm elections.“The thing that I’m finding, frankly, pretty disconcerting right now is Democrats sticking their heads in the sand and not responding directly to the moment that we’re in,” Ezra Levin, co-founder of Indivisible, said on an organizing call this week.Theda Skocpol, aHarvard sociologistand political scientist who studied the Tea Party, said the conservative movement was the wrong blueprint for Democrats.“What the Tea Party did to the GOP, it cannot be done to the Democrats, and if it were, it would relegate them to four decades of minority status,” she said. Skocpol, who also studied the anti-Trump resistance that emerged in response to his 2016 election, said her research showed that engagement at the state and local level helped save the Affordable Care Act and turn the tide for Democrats in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. That was a better model, she argued, and it could begin with the upcoming special elections in Wisconsin and Florida on Tuesday.Anupset victoryby the Democrat James Malone for a Pennsylvania state senate seat in a district that had voted overwhelmingly for Trump in November provided a beacon of hope for the party. Vincent Hughes, a Democratic state senator, said Malone’s victory was a “referendum on the chaos Washington Republicans have brought to our state”, adding: “Voters are fed up.”Part of the challenge Democrats face is leading a resistive movement without a clear leader.Asked in an open-ended CNN poll to name the Democratic leader they feel “best reflects the core values” of the party, 10% of the respondents said Ocasio-Cortez, followed by Kamala Harris at 9% and Sanders at 8%, while 30% did not provide a name.“No one,” one respondenttoldthe pollster, according to CNN. “That’s the problem.”Far lower on the list – or missing entirely – were the Democrats most often cited as potential presidential contenders in 2028: Gavin Newsom, JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, Josh Shapiro, Chris Murphy and Pete Buttigieg.Sarah Longwell, publisher of The Bulwark and a prominent anti-Trump Republican pollster who addressed House Democrats at their closed-door retreat in Virginia earlier this month, said she left disillusioned by the state of the opposition’s leadership.“Nobody knows what time it is. Nobody seems to be ready to meet this moment,” she told an audience in Phoenix during alive tapingof her podcast The Next Level.Among the few exceptions, ​the conservative host conceded, were Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez ​​because they were actively mobilizing overflow crowds against the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal workers, his attempts to dismantle the Department of Education and the threats to overhaul social security and cut Medicaid and Medicare.​I​f Americans continue​d to show up and speak out​, ​L​ongwell predicted, Trump’s popularity would ​eventually fall so low that Republicans would start “figuring out a way to offload him” and Democrats would “stop acting like people who are scared of their shadows”.View image in fullscreenA protest outside the New York Stock Exchange on 15 March 2025, in New York City.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/APAs their agitated base searchers for fighters, the party is still searching for answers. There is widespread agreement on the diagnosis: that the party must rebuild trust with the working class and win back the cohorts of young people, Latinos and Asian voters who defected to Trump in 2024.A post-election analysis by the pollster David Shor found that naturalized citizensswung sharplyfrom Joe Biden in 2020 to Trump in 2024, meaning they chose a candidate who promised to close the very same doors they walked through to enter the country. Perhaps most worryingly for the party was their sharp turn toward Trump among young people, especially men.A growing faction of Democrats favors a populist economic message to recapture these voters.On Capitol Hill this week, an ideologically mixed group of House Democrats called on their party to embrace a “fighting spirit of patriotic economic populism”.“Democrats need to wake up and stop defending elites and the establishment,” the representative Chris Deluzio, who represents acompetitivePennsylvania district,said in a floor speech.“This embrace of economic patriotism might sound and look different depending on where in this country and who the messenger is,” he continued. “But we agree that the era of a spineless Democratic party must end.”The speech matched the party’s fighting mood since Trump’s re-election. But the party’s identity crisis runs deeper, spanning ideology, policy and messaging.According to new data from the Republican pollster Patrick Ruffini, nearly 80% of Democrats want the party to take a more combative approach to the president, including 50% who say they want the party to be “much more” combative. It also found Democrats were twice as likely to say they wanted the party to move toward the political center – 42% – rather than to the political left – 20%.The path forward,according to Ruffini, is what he calls “combative centrism” – candidates who take on Trump and his administration but hold moderate positions on key social and economic issues.Matt Bennett, a founder of the center-left thinktank Third Way, agrees strongly that the party needs a rebrand, particularly in its approach to working-class voters. But he isn’t convinced that a billionaire-centered critique, championed by leftwing populists like Sanders, is the right approach.“It isn’t clear that a country that just elected a billionaire whose best friend is the richest guy on Earth is demanding that we fight the oligarchy,” he said. “They’re very mad at both Trump and Elon, not because they’re wealthy, but because they’re vandals that are destroying the American republic.”“That does not mean in any way that we are taking a backseat in the fight against Trump,” he added.One lesson many Democrats drew from their 2024 defeat was that opposing Trump was not enough. But showing a willingness to fight him now might be enough to start a conversation with the voters who ​t​uned them out in November.“I think there’s a lot of opportunity to step in with some fresh leadership and some fresh ideas, and to be bold and on offense,” said Rebecca Cooke, a Democrat who is running for the chance to unseat the Republican representative Derrick Van Orden in a politically competitive Wisconsin House district. “I think we play defense a little bit too much, and I think that it’s important for us to be a little bit more uninhibited as Democrats.”Rachel Leingang contributed to this report"

They don’t stay in the village. They don’t linger enough to really ingest the beauty and historic value of the place. It’s literally, I think, to take a selfie.”View image in fullscreenThe famous 14th-century houses of Arlington Row, thought to be one of the most photographed terraces of cottages in the country.Photograph: JeniFoto/ShutterstockThe number of visitors has rocketed in recent years due to the boom in travel and tourism influencers on TikTok and other social media, prompting councillors to take action to curtail the number of coaches piling into the village.I don’t believe they contribute to the village in terms of supporting pubs, restaurants, because they’re not here long enough. They’re only here for 20 minutesPlans include changing the layout of coach-parking bays to stop tour buses waiting in the layby on the B4425, next to the Swan Bridge in the centre of the village.On a midweek afternoon in March, the small car park adjacent to the Instagrammable bridge is full, with a 15-metre coach, two minibuses and half a dozen cars squeezed in door to door. Tourists get off the coach, smartphones aloft. One woman sets up a selfie tripod in the middle of the road. Twenty minutes later, they and the coach are gone.View image in fullscreenYet another photo of Arlington Row in the making.Photograph: Imgorthand/Getty ImagesIn a short walk around the village, past its treasured 14th-century Arlington Row, thought to be one of the most photographed terraces of cottages in the country, the number of tourists is underlined by the array of languages and accents overheard: from Spanish to Japanese, American to geordie.But while some in Bibury are overwhelmed, there are those who want to maintain the flow of tourists through the village.Angus Hay is director at the Bibury Trout Farm, which is directly opposite the village car park, meaning that, in addition to visitors to the farm, it hoovers up many of the tourists in its cafe and gift shop.“We would agree that something needs to be done,” Hay says. “It needs to be managed. The last few summers have definitely been getting busier and busier. More people have been coming, not just in coaches, but in cars.”Hay said the business put in a car park behind the site with capacity for about 300 cars but, in the summer, that was not enough, so they have recently applied for planning permission on land the farm leases on the edge of the village to develop a fee-paying coach park, from which they would shuttle visitors in smaller minibuses.“I think it’s all got blown out of proportion a little bit,” he adds. “We all agree there is a problem, and I’m sure there’s a solution for both businesses and residents, and I think we will get to that. And I just think it’s going kind of round the houses, and everybody’s maybe getting a bit wound up about it.”View image in fullscreenA cottage garden like this one in Bibury is what many overseas visitors think of when they imagine England.Photograph: AndyRoland/Getty Images/iStockphotoHay adds the six businesses in the village employ about 150 local people, many of whom are from the village and surrounding villages.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re only here for 20 minutes.”Sure enough, a guide from one of numerous tour operators which sweep through the village is gathering their passengers – ranging from the US, South Korea, Italy and Spain – to continue the day trip starting and finishing in London. Taking in Burford, Bourton-on-the-Water and Stow-on-the-Wold, the tour spends 30 minutes in Bibury. “We think it’s more sustainable that way,” the guide explains, a claim that raised eyebrows when relayed to the residents of the village.Storrington in West Sussex named UK’s first European stork villageRead moreVictoria Summerley, a journalist and author, has lived in the village since 2012 and previously served as a Bibury parish councillor.“The idea that it’s sustainable is almost laughable,” Summerley says, “because it’s not sustainable in terms of traffic. And it’s not sustainable because they sit and run their engines all day to keep the aircon going.”She, too, is unconvinced by the argument that tourism brings economic benefits to the village. “That’s no argument at all,” she says. “[The villagers] would say they don’t put any money into the village.”The first hint she had of the potential difficulties with tourists was when the survey for her new home was returned complete with the comment: “Tourists may prove a nuisance.”“Like a lot of other places in the world, Bibury suffers appallingly from overtourism,” Summerley says. She has witnessed confrontations between residents and tourists, including when the latter are staring at and taking photos of the former’s homes.About 300 metres up the road from the Bibury Trout Farm, the Catherine Wheel pub does feel the benefit of the influx of tourists, who will come in for food and drinks inside a bona fide English country pub. Tours of up to 50 people fill the 16th-century pub and staff are in no doubt that, without the tourists, it would not survive.But, as a number of the employees live in the village, they are also mindful of the less positive impacts, sharing stories of tourists pulling up to park on their drives and, on more than one occasion, even mistaking them for actors in a living theme park.“It’s been going on for years,” one customer says. “I can’t see it being solved for years to come.”Explore more on these topicsGloucestershireOvertourismEnglandfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It mentions a painting he’s known since his Liverpudlian childhood, still sitting above his 92-year-old father’s mantelpiece: “Dapple-bruised Welsh horses, painted in a loose herd, are imagined beneath a sky that promises rain.”From 1998, on commutes from Liverpool to the University ofWales, Newport (where he led a documentary photography degree), he noticed similar horses – completely by coincidence. “I didn’t seek them out at first, but on my drives, I soon got aware that they were there. Sometimes up a valley’s road, you’d see packs of 40 or 50.”You’re rewarded by staying with subjects over time, seeing any kinds of changes or shifts, slow dismantlings or initiationsSome were descendants of animals once used in mining; other herds would have pre-dated industry; either way, they now roam wild and free. Grant’s horses sit, lie, nuzzle each other and look directly into his lens. He became struck by the creatures’ hardiness in all seasons. “They’re beautiful, observant, built to last – they let things happen around them. They became a loose metaphor for me for thinking about communities in these areas – communities built around a particular purpose which is not active any more in any shape or form, but which carries on, having endured all those upheavals, and the shifts that have taken place in the land.”View image in fullscreen‘You’re made aware that something’s still happening’: a playground next to a former steelworks, Ebbw Vale.Photograph: Ken GrantThe horses in Cwm (the name of a mining village Grant photographs and a Welsh word for valley or steep-sided hollow at the head of a valley) act like solid anchors among images of striking environments. Harsh hills, often pillaged by industry, sit behind pale, pastel rows of terrace houses. A photography studio sits in an old building, its front wall soaked with stormwater. An old playground sits quietly alongside the site of a demolished steelworks.There are signs of development – new redbrick houses and road improvement projects – between the battered allotments and ruined buildings. “It struck me how strongly these roads are built to take people past a place,” Grant says. Moving on from Newport in 2013, he has to-and-froed between Wales and Liverpool ever since, often returning to the same places – like the village of Beaufort, named after a duke who originally owned the land, and Manmoel Common outside Ebbw Vale, high on a ridge, near abandoned quarries.View image in fullscreenMare and foal, near the ironworks, Blaenavon, 2022.Photograph: Ken GrantMid-century Czech photographer Josef Sudek inspired this approach. “There’s a lovely phrase of his – ‘rush slowly’ – about how you’re rewarded by staying with subjects over time, seeing any kinds of changes or shifts, or slow dismantlings or initiations. You’re made aware that something’s still happening, or you’re reminded to find something again.” Other influences include the American photojournalists W Eugene Smith and Robert Frank, and people closer to his experience in Wales, such as West Wales-based photographer Paul Cabuts and photographic historian Ian Walker.The book’s subtitle is a nod to Alexander Cordell’s bestselling 1959 novelRapeofthe Fair Country, about the iron-making communities of Nantyglo and Blaenavon before the Chartist uprisings in Wales. Best known as a photographer of people within places (in series such asNew Brighton RevisitedandShankly), Grant talks warmly about those he has met in these communities (“there is a beautiful temperament and decency in these people”). He’s also done a project simultaneously in the area about pub football teams (“It’s as much about football as it is about men navigating being part of something that their dads were part of”).View image in fullscreenAllotments in Cwm.Photograph: Ken GrantThe only people we see inCwmare walkers, on the edges of frames, often in startling landscapes. “People use and walk through these places just because they’ve walked through them for centuries,” Grant says. He also loves the vivid colours of the land, the saturated browns, yellows and greens that partly come from the wetness of the Welsh weather. This resilience and richness, he says, is part of everyday life.“I’ve got a lot to be thankful for in Wales,” he adds. He’s now living back in Wirral, near his father, but his daughter lives in Cardiff, so he still has a reason to take strange, cross-country diversions. “The beautiful, gentle landscapes and full-blown mountains in which people still live – it’s still incredible, even in the winter, when it’s quite tough. But in the time of year we’re in now, I love watching how everything comes alive.”Cwmspeaks to the same, startling spirit.Cwm: A Fair Countryby Ken Grant is published by RRB Photobooks (£45)Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s barefoot against a hard, cracked floor. And yet Achta Derib’s pose in this photograph by Antonio López Díaz, a finalist in the professional sports category at theSony world photography awards, suggests reserves of determination that will carry her across continents to perform at the highest levels of her sport.For Díaz, who has been documenting her journey since 2019, Derib’s story “stands as a symbol of resilience”. She was one of hundreds of girls from Chad who joined a pioneering gymnastics class at a school outside the capital, N’Djamena. Set up in 2016 by a Chadian Jesuit priest and a Spanish club president, with support from Spain’s Ramón Grosso Foundation, the class was the first of its kind in the central African country, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line. Chad lacked gymnastics facilities, and the idea of a girl becoming a professional athlete in a country where female social mobility is extremely limited – three in five women are married before the age of 18 – seemed fanciful.Nonetheless, Derib excelled in the class and in January 2020 she and three other 11-year-old girls moved to Spain to step up their training, staying on after Covid hit despite being thousands of miles away from their families. Their most ambitious goal, to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics, proved elusive but the team came fourth at last year’s African gymnastics championships in Marrakech, with Derib reaching the finals of the uneven bars and finishing ninth in the competition overall.As the maths-covered blackboard in Díaz’s photograph intimates, gymnastics was only part of the equation. Moving to Spain meant that Derib and her peers got to continue their education, a rare opportunity in Chad where the female literacy rate is below 20% and only two in five girls complete primary school. Their achievements have proved inspirational back home: Chad now has five registered gymnastics clubs and a national gymnastics federation to help other aspiring athletes reach their potential – “something unthinkable just a few years ago”, says Díaz. At a time when the world’s richest countries are slashing aid budgets, Derib’s story is a reminder of how even modest interventions can prove hugely transformative in the lives of talented young people the world over.The 2025 Sony world photography awards exhibition is at Somerset House, London from 17 April to 5 MayExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureGymnasticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have documentation. There were board meetings where members of the executive team and external strategic advisers were sending me messages saying: ‘Should I interrupt? Should I stop this? Oh my gosh, this is so bad.’“In fact, our strategic adviser for fundraising then sent me a message saying she wouldn’t want to ever attend any more board meetings or bring her colleagues because of the treatment.The interview, trailed on Saturday and aired in full on Sunday morning, included allegations of“harassment and bullying at scale” from the prince towards the chair, after Harry and several others quit the organisation earlier this week.Though Harry has not commented specifically on the bullying and harassment allegations, sources close to the prince said the claims were “completely baseless”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They added they “remain firm in their resignation, for the good of the charity, and look forward to the adjudication of the truth”.Two named former trustees have come out in support of the prince, with Kelello Lerotholi, who resigned from the charity this week, telling Sky News he did not recognise the allegations: “I can honestly say, in the meetings I was present in, there was never even a hint of such.”Chandauka said the prince, who she said had not been to Africa for five years, had made moves against her, adding further trustees to the charity’s board in efforts to bolster his control. In a separate interview with theFinancial Times, she said there was noticeable friction between the UK staff and those based in Lesotho, where most of the charity’s 500-plus workforce is based. She said the board felt “a loss of power and control and influence … ‘Oh my goodness, the Africans are taking over.’”When Harry could not have her removed through a vote, because of a legal challenge, she alleges, he aimed to sabotage the charity, which he set up in 2006 in memory of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.Chandauka, who appeared on Sky News with another board member, the investment banker Iain Rawlinson, claimed the rift became public with the prince’s “unleashing of the Sussex machine” against her.The Conservative peer Lynda Chalker, who served as a trustee for nearly two decades until November, described Chandauka as having an “almost dictatorial” style.Explore more on these topicsPrince HarryCharitiesAfricaAids and HIVMonarchyLesothoVoluntary sectornewsShareReuse this content"

We need backhoes, cranes, and heavy-duty diggers to demolish the damaged buildings and retrieve the bodies,” he said.InThailand, rescue efforts continued at the site of a collapsed 30-storey tower in the Chatuchak district of Bangkok, which fell to the floor while under construction, trapping dozens of workers. Officials from Bangkok metropolitan administration said signs of life had been detected in one area of the site early on Sunday morning. Eleven people have been confirmed dead and workers are frantically searching for 78 who remain missing.Myanmar’s ruling junta said in a statement on Saturday that at least 1,700 people were killed and more than 3,400 injured in the country, with at least 300 more missing.View image in fullscreenRescue personnel at the site of a building that collapsed in Mandalay.

The junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing, said on Sunday he called on “all military and civilian hospitals, as well as healthcare workers” to “work together in a coordinated and efficient manner”, according to state-run media.What caused Myanmar and Thailand earthquake and how big was it?Read moreThe earthquakes have compounded the crisis in Myanmar, which was plunged into war when the military seized power in a coup in 2021.It is facing an armed opposition formed of people’s defence forces, which emerged to oppose the coup, and more established ethnic armed groups, that have long demanded independence.The shadow national unity government, set up to oppose the junta, said anti-coup groups had declared a two-week partial ceasefire in quake-affected regions starting on Sunday. The military continued airstrikes following the quake, including just hours afterwards.The national unity government said it would “collaborate with the UN and NGOs to ensure security, transportation, and the establishment of temporary rescue and medical camps” in areas it controls, according to the statement, which was released on social media.Aid agencies have warned that responding to the disaster will be complex, given the conflict and the severe level of need. Even before the earthquake 15 million people – about a third of the country’s population – were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity. The conflict has displaced 3.5 million people and pushed the economy and health services into crisis.View image in fullscreenRescuers search for victims at the Sky Villa in Mandalay.Photograph: Nyein Chan Naing/EPAThe junta has been repeatedly accused of weaponising aid, blocking supplies to areas where its opponents are present.An assessment by the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said hospitals and health facilities warned of “a severe shortage of medical supplies” and said damage to infrastructure such as roads was hampering efforts to respond to the earthquake.In some of the country’s hardest-hit areas, people told Reuters that government assistance was scarce so far, leaving people to fend for themselves. The entire town of Sagaing near the quake’s epicentre was devastated, said Han Zin, a local person.“What we are seeing here is widespread destruction – many buildings have collapsed into the ground,” he said by phone, adding that much of the town had been without electricity since the disaster hit and drinking water was running out. “We have received no aid, and there are no rescue workers in sight.”0:49Water spills from Bangkok skyscraper pools as Myanmar earthquake hits – videoBut some aid and rescue personnel were beginning to arrive.

There was a pillow under the teenager’s head; there was only a small amount of blood on the tracks; and despite the muddy ground, his shoes were clean.A crashed white Holden Torana was nearby.Local police concluded the teenager had likely stolen the car, crashed, walked to the tracks and laid down either deliberately or in a daze.View image in fullscreen‘I need to hear every word and to see everything,’ says Craigie.Photograph: Simon Scott/The GuardianThe family rejected the theory outright. “[We] believed that he met with foul play and we maintain that today,” Craigie said.An autopsy found Haines died from a traumatic brain injury.An initial coronial inquest in October 1988 heard that police lost or mishandled key evidence, but was unable to draw conclusions about what led to the teenager’s death.As rumours swirled and an investigation led by Muruwari journalist Allan Clarke unearthed fresh evidence, New South Wales police reopened their investigation in 2018 andoffered a $1m rewardfor information. They sent a review of the case to the coroner and a second inquest began last April.To date, the court has heard from the retired police officers in charge of the initial investigation, forensic experts, Haines’ friends and othersrumoured to have knowledge of the events before his death.View image in fullscreenCraigie made a promise to his nephew Mark’s parents in 1988 and has held a press conference demanding answers every year ever since.

He has previously denied the allegations in court.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ll deal with this. You just get on with your lives.’”Both have since died.Hearings are expected to finish on Friday, a year after the inquest began. Initially set down for two weeks over two sittings, the inquiry was due to finish in October, but was adjourned for six months after possible new evidence emerged.The coroner is expected to deliver her findings in Tamworth later this year.By then, Craigie’s unrelenting quest for answers will have spanned nearly four decades.Has the 68-year-old has ever felt like it was all too hard?“Never,” he said.For information and support in Australiacall13YARNon 13 92 76 for a crisis support line for Indigenous Australians; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 and Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636Explore more on these topicsIndigenous AustraliansIndigenous affairs reportingAustralian police and policingNew South WalesnewsShareReuse this content"

The report investigated the conduct of 10 trustees, which are responsible for 38% of all member benefits in Australia.Asic’s chair, Joe Longo, said the report “identified a range of issues including excessive delays, poor customer service and ineffective claims handling procedures”. He called on the industry to “take ownership of the problems and flex their muscle to fix the failings”.“At the heart of this issue is leadership that doesn’t have a grip on the fund’s data, systems and processes – and ultimately it is the customers who suffer for it,” Longo said.Donald Trump’s tariffs are disrupting markets around the world – here’s why it could be hurting your superRead more“This kind of disconnect is unacceptable in any area of corporate Australia, but in the superannuation sector it is particularly serious, because super affects everyone from the boardroom to the living room.”Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailA death benefit is the amount of superannuation a person has remaining in their account after they die. This can be transferred to a family member to ensure bills and expenses can be covered. This payment may also include life insurance payments.The review of 10 superannuation funds comes after Asic lodged federal court proceedings alleging Cbus failed to process more than 10,000 claims for death and disability payments within 90 days. More than 6,000 members were forced to wait more than 12 months for payments. Cbus has apologised and promised to overhaul its processes.The 10 reviewed funds include Australian Retirement Trust, Avanteos (Colonial First State), Brighter Super, CommonwealthSuperannuationCorporation, Hesta, Hostplus, NM Super (AMP), Nulis (MLC), Rest and UniSuper. The report found some funds had performed better than others, but all needed to improve.The review found communication with First Nations claimant was “often not culturally sensitive” and that their death benefits often took longer to deliver.The report highlighted the case of a First Nations woman who lodged a claim for a death benefit after her husband died. He had a death benefit of around $100,000. According to Asic, she repeatedly told an unnamed fund she was suffering financial distress and struggling to navigate the claims process.“The trustee did not respond to the wife’s concerns about financial hardship,” the Asic report said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Asic allege the fund “took more than a year to offer the wife alternative identification options”.“The trustee finally decided to pay the wife after more than 500 days,” the report said. “However, as of the date we collected the claim file, the wife still had not received payment.”Asic commissioner Simone Constant said “grieving Australians should not have to suffer further stress because of the failure of superannuation trustees to approach claims in a timely, clear and respectful manner”.“Many of the complaints we read were distressing. We saw deep grief, vulnerability, frustration and genuine suffering,” Constant said.“The money from a death benefit can make a huge difference and each day a trustee delays that payment causes real harm to families. Trustees need to do better.”The 10 superannuation funds examined by Asic are yet to respond to the regulator’s findings but have previously outlined measures to improve their performance.In November, several of the funds mentioned in the Asic report said they had overhauled their internal processes to improve customer outcomes.Explore more on these topicsSuperannuationAsicBusinessIndigenous AustraliansnewsShareReuse this content"

He is a very good player, and we won the Men’s Member-Guest Golf Tournament at Trump International Golf Club in Palm Beach County …“President Stubb and I look forward to strengthening the partnership between the United States and Finland, and that includes the purchase and development of a large number of badly needed Icebreakers for the U.S., delivering Peace and International Security for our Countries, and the World.”Asked how he thought Trump would express his impatience with Putin, Stubb said things would be clear in a matter of days. “When you spend seven hours with someone, you at least get an intuition of the direction in which we’re going,” he said.View image in fullscreenAlexander Stubb spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskyy at a summit of European leaders in Paris last Thursday.Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty ImagesStubb – in London to see the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer – has emerged as a critical figure in the Ukraine talks process, and,like Starmer, said engagement rather than disengagement with Trump was the best way to persuade America not to abandon Ukraine.Looking sprightly after his overnight flight to London, the Finnish president said: “I think we’re probably moving into the direction where the Americans are seeing Russia for what it’s worth. In other words, the overall ceasefire has been agreed by the United States, byUkraineand by Europe, but not by Russia.“The half-ceasefire has been broken by Russia, and I think America, and my sense is also the president of the United States, is running out of patience with Russia. I think that’s good news for engagement and negotiation. So this is what I sensed over the weekend as well.”He explained: “My message in the conversations I have with the [US] president is that we need a ceasefire, and we need a deadline for the ceasefire, and then we need to pay a price for breaking a ceasefire. So number one, we need a ceasefire date, and I would prefer that to be Easter, say, 20 April, when President Trump has been in office for three months. If by then it’s not accepted or is broken by Russia, there needs to be consequences. And those consequences should be sanctions, maximum sanctions, and we continue the pressure up until the 20th and then we’ll see what happens.”He added: “I think it would be quite a useful combination at this moment to get a deadline from the president of the United States with a sanctions package coming from the Senate.”View image in fullscreenLindsey Graham, a US senator for South Carolina, has a bill in the Senate proposing sanctions on Russia if it does not accept a ceasefire.Photograph: Rex/ShutterstockStubb said it was not for him to give the US advice on the kind of sanctions it could impose, but Trump said on Sunday, after meeting Stubb, that he was considering secondary sanctions on any country that bought Russian oil.Stubb said: “We in Finland understand not to trust Putin. Don’t underestimate his capacity to delay. But we need to call his bluff. It’s typically Russian to say, ‘yes, Mr President, there’s a ceasefire’. And after that, say, ‘but the conditions are …’ That’s not the way in which I think we should negotiate with the Russians. The only thing they understand is power.”The Finnish president stressed it would be wrong for Europeto loosen its own sanctionsnow, as demanded by Putinas the price for a Black Sea peace deal, saying any European sanctions relaxation should be strictly conditions-based.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We fundamentally disagree with that approach. I personally will never, ever recognise any territorial acquisition by Russia to Ukraine.”View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff, Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, told Fox News last week: “I feel that he [Vladimir Putin] wants peace.”Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesStubb has been pressing his fellow leaders to be more specific about what they are seeking to achieve. “A ceasefire is about monitoring the line of contact and can entail some kind of coalition of the willing in the air, sea, and then also in land,” he said.“But a completely different story is the actual peace agreement. That’s when you get into traditional peacekeeping, which is usually UN mandated, and so on and so forth.”He explained: “What we are saying in Finland, from the northern flank, having the 1340-kilometre (830-mile) border ofEuropewith Russia, is that that border actually starts from northern Norway and covers all the way, and if you count Belarus as part of it, that’s 5000 kilometres (3107 miles). So that’s the border that we need to protect.“That’s why we are not probably going to provide troops in the ceasefire stage, but we can definitely do something when the peace agreement is there, if there’s an international mandate.”Either way, Stubb suggests like Starmer, there would have to be some kind of US involvement – something Trump has not yet offered. But, Stubb said: “I don’t exclude that some of the monitoring is done by Americans and American technology, because it’s non-military activity. So, there’s so many ways in which you can do this.”Like Graham, Stubb is interested in protecting Ukraine’s sovereignty in any peace agreement not by offering Nato membership, but instead through a clear political statement as part of the agreement that Ukraine would be given automatic Nato membership if Russia breached the ceasefire.The Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, at the weekend proposed a variation by which Ukraine would not be offered Nato membership but instead the protection of Nato’s article 5 security guarantee. Stubb said her ideas would be studied closely, but hinted at scepticism, saying article 5 was the essence of Nato. “We think that the core of this war is about the triangular existence of a nation state, which is independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity,” he said.He recalled how Finland lost its sovereignty afterthe winter warand the war of continuation. “In other words, world war two, we weren’t able to decide the clubs where we wanted to participate. We also lost 10% of our territory, including the areas where my grandparents, my father, were born.”Stubb, who clearly sees Ukraine as an entry-point for a wider, more formal pact with the UK on security, said: “One of the things that I’m particularly pleased about in this tragic war is that we are now seeing a Britain engaged again in Europe. And before coming here, had I had enough time, I would have written a column in the Guardian saying ‘Britain is back’.“We are now seeing British and French leadership in brokering the European position, not only here in London, but also in Paris, and in the way in which prime minister Starmer is conducting the discussions his national security team, led by Jonathan Powell. This is a great opportunity for Britain to engage with Europe again and vice versa. So if this could be now the embryo of a new British-EU relationship, I would warmly welcome that.”View image in fullscreenGolf diplomacy: Donald Trump played golf with the then Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, when he visited in 2017 during Trump’s first term in office.Photograph: Cabinet public relations office/ReutersDespite his multilingual, academic pro-European background, Stubb is in some ways an ideal conciliator with Trump since he spent three years at university in the US and was at one point considered good enough for the Finnish national golf team –something he modestly admitted was equivalent to being selected for the English ice-hockey team.“I did play [golf] seriously. And I played at the British amateur Open at Litchfield sometime in the 1980s. I missed the cut by one,” he ruefully recalled, “and then I went to study in the US with the dream of becoming a professional. But I basically quit after three months and got serious about studying.”Stubb said tactfully he would not analyse Trump’s golf game for hints of his personality, but said he was “very impressive, and I’m not only speaking because of his age, but he hit the ball very well. It was quite fun in the sense that we were on the same team, so we were playing best ball … we were alternating giving an impact for our teams.”Stubb said of their game: “It’s a good, good, good, good way of spending the better part of seven hours together with the president. So we had breakfast, and then we had a go round the course, and then we had lunch, and we had sitting with Lindsey Graham there, and then we hadlegendary Gary Player, the South African grand slam winner, at the tender age of 89. It is a good way to get to know one another.”Golf diplomacy has been seen as the entry ticket to Trump’s heart since the former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe successfully courted him in his first term by playing endless rounds. Stubb said it was feasible in golf to mix pleasure with business, so to discuss Russia’s trustworthiness “between shots”.“Anyway, for sure I prefer a golf course to meeting rooms,” he said.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUkraineFinlandVladimir PutinRussiaEuropeNatonewsShareReuse this content"

Images were broadcast live on YouTube.The uncrewed rocket was billed as the first attempt at an orbital flight to originate from Europe, where several countries, including Sweden and Britain, have said they want a share of the growing market for commercial space missions.Orbital rockets are designed to place loads such as satellites into or beyond Earth’s orbit.View image in fullscreenThe rocket explodes.Photograph: APIsar Aerospace, which had warned the initial launch could end prematurely, said the test produced extensive data that its team could learn from.The rocket lifted off from the pad at 12.30pm local time (11.30am BST) on Sunday and flew for about half a minute before the flight was terminated, Isar said.“This allowed the company to gather a substantial amount of flight data and experience to apply on future missions,” Isar said in a statement. “After the flight was terminated at T+30 seconds, the launch vehicle fell into the sea in a controlled manner.”The European Space Agency’s director general, Josef Aschbacher, posted on X: “Success to get off the pad, and lots of data already obtained. I am sure @isaraerospace will learn a lot. Rocket launch is hard. Never give up, move forward with even more energy!”The Spectrum is designed for small- and medium-sized satellites weighing up to one metric tonne, although it did not carry a payload on its maiden voyage from the spaceport inNorway.The mission was intended to collect data on Isar Aerospace’s launch vehicle in a first integrated test of all its systems, the Bavarian company said last week.View image in fullscreenThe Spectrum awaits on a launchpad at the Andøya spaceport in Nordmela, on Andøya island, Norway.Photograph: Simon Fischer/Isar Aerospace/Photo Wingmen Media/APThe company, headquartered in Munich, had previously said it would consider a 30-second flight a success. While not intended to reach orbit on its first mission, the test marked the first commercial orbital flight from a launchpad on the European continent, excluding Russia.European countries have long relied on paying for launches from Russian space stations but the relationship has broken down since Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.US companies, notably SpaceX, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are emerging as big players in a budding industry to send satellites, such as broadband internet or observation equipment, into space for governments and private businesses. Chinese companies are also seeking to capitalise on the new sector.Many estimates suggest the global space industry could generate revenues of more than $1tn (£770bn) within the next two decades.‘We’re in a new era’: the 21st-century space race takes offRead moreIsar Aerospace intends Spectrum to be able to launch up to 1,000kg into low-Earth orbit, an area of space up to about 1,200 miles high where most satellites shoot around the globe. Founded in 2018, the startup developed its rocket almost entirely in-house.View image in fullscreenThe Spectrum did not carry a payload on its intended maiden voyage.Photograph: Simon Fischer/Isar Aerospace/Photo Wingmen Media/APBefore the test flight, Aschbacher had said: “Whatever the outcome, Isar Aerospace’s upcoming Spectrum launch will be historic: the first commercial orbital launch from mainland Europe. The support and co-funding the European Space Agency has given Isar Aerospace and other launch service provider startups is paying off for increased autonomy in Europe.”Last year, a report by Mario Draghi, a former European Central Bank president and former prime minister of Italy, recommended Europe could boost its economic growth by recognising space as a key sector. Independent access to space is also increasingly seen as a geopolitical and security issue.Nasa’s new Spherex telescope lifts off to map cosmos in unprecedented detailRead moreEurope’s space industry has experienced delays in the development of the Ariane 6 rocket and the suspension of the European Vega-C satellite launcher after an accident.In addition to Isar Aerospace, Europe is home to Germany’s HyImpulse and Rocket Factory Augsburg (RFA), the French groups Latitude and MaiaSpace, andSpain’s PLD Space.Several destinations around Europe have been marked for spaceport projects, includingthe British Shetland Islands, the Portuguese Azores, and Esrange in Sweden. Coastal areas near stretches of open water are considered ideal spots for launch sites, as rockets do not have to fly over heavily populated land areas.Britain has had mixed success as a launch destination. Virgin Orbit, the satellite launch company founded by Richard Branson,filed for bankruptcy in 2023after its inaugural flight from Cornwall – with a rocket strapped to a Boeing 747 –ended in failure.Isar Aerospace has signed a contract with the Norwegian space agency to put two maritime surveillance satellites into orbit by 2028.AFP and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSpaceNorwayEuropean Space AgencyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It acts as the parent company for more than 200 restaurants and popular entertainment spots, including Soho House Istanbul.The star of its restaurant portfolio is a chain owned by the Turkish chef and restaurateur Nusret Gökçe, better known as Salt Bae, who parlayed his status as an internet meme about sprinkling salt on meat into a businesscharging up to £700 for a steakat its London outpost.“We do not buy products of those who advertise on NTV. We do not watch NTV … We do not pass through Nusr-Et’s door,” said Özel, naming Gökçe’s eponymous brand of steakhouses.Turkey’s young ‘hope of millions’ held in jail as Erdoğan cracks down on protestsRead moreThe CHP leader also called on Turkish companies not to advertise on pro-government media channels that have broadcast limited news of the protests, often hewing closely to Erdoğan’s depiction of the demonstrations as “a movement of violence”.1:14Hundreds of thousands join protest in defence of Erdoğan rival jailed in Turkey – videoThe detention of İmamoğlu sparked Turkey’s largest anti-government protests in years, with people gathering nightly around Istanbul city hall and frequently clashing with police. But with the opposition calling for an end to the nightly demonstrations, the burgeoning protest movement is at a crossroads.The CHP is attempting to shepherd a nationwide protest movement that quickly grew to include demands far beyond İmamoğlu’s freedom, with demonstrators calling for an end to the democratic backsliding that has occurred under Erdoğan’s rule, as well as the liberation of the Kurdish former presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtaş.Despite the CHP taking the lead by calling for the initial demonstrations, the protest movement includes other political parties, students and other groups with their own agendas and concerns. These include calls for a halt to a years-long cost of living crisis, increased judicial independence, and freedom for hundreds of student protest leaders detained in the past 10 days.Small pockets of protest have continued across Istanbul after Özel called a halt to demonstrations at city hall, with crowds gathering primarily in opposition strongholds to protest against the government. Demonstrators also gathered outside the headquarters of Turkey’s broadcasting watchdog, RTÜK, in Ankara, furious at the live broadcast bans handed down to channels aligned to the opposition.These protests were often swarmed by police, who detained more than 1,900 people in the 12 days since İmamoğlu was seized in a dawn raid, accused of corruption. The opposition has claimed that prisons in Istanbul are filled with protesters, with many now taken to facilities outside Turkey’s largest city.Turkey says Swedish journalist detained on terror charges and for ‘insulting the president’Read moreSome organisers believe security forces targeted student leaders for arrest, in an effort to stifle street protests. Members of a teaching union and another for textile workers have been subject to house arrest, according to rights groups.As the protests entered their second week and the CHP held rallies in Istanbul, the government declared an extended public holiday for the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr.View image in fullscreenPeople wave flags and chant slogans during a mass protest in support of Ekrem İmamoğlu in Istanbul on Saturday.Photograph: Chris McGrath/Getty ImagesTalya Aydın, a 28-year-old protester, said the government had “miscalculated” in thinking the break would cool the protests that have surged across university campuses, hoping students in urban centres would leave for the holiday.“They’re so disconnected from the public that they’re not grasping just how expensive they’ve made bus and train tickets to get back home for these students,” she said. “Plus the students do not want to leave, to yield these streets.”The students, she added, had never known a leader other than Erdoğan or his Justice and Development party, which has overseen recent changes that have caused the cost of living to rise.“So of course, for them it’s about change, but it’s also about the austerity measures that they’ve been forced to accept,” she said.The CHP has directed its supporters’ ire towards a growing list of products and services to boycott, including Turkey’s most popular chocolate brand, the coffee chain Espressolab, a home appliances company and a chain of malls.The boycott has drawn members of Turkey’s urban middle class into the anti-government movement, including many who said they were previously unable to attend the protests. Serkan, a pilates teacher who declined to give his full name, said he was forgoing his regular trips to Espressolab with his son, despite his enthusiasm for their Americanos.“I love it there, but it’s on the boycott list now, so I’m not going,” he said. “Usually the one I pass is full of students, but right now it’s empty.”The result has been nothing short of a culture war, with supporters of the government photographing themselves lining up at branches of Espressolab, many clutching bags from a bookshop chain also on the boycott list. A website listing companies included in the boycott call was blocked by regulators soon after it launched.Erdoğan has made his displeasure at the boycotts clear, accusing the protest movement of trying to weaken the Turkish economy. “We will not give credit to reckless politicians who seek to disrupt traders, bankrupt industrialists and sabotage entrepreneurs with irresponsible boycott calls,” he said.Aydın, a member of the Workers’ party of Turkey, said she viewed the boycott as the first step towards a general strike, amid growing participation from trade unions and the Turkish labour movement.“The trade unions are in talks, developments are happening as we speak. So I think when people aren’t at work next week due to the extended holiday, things are going to snowball,” she said.“I think the boycotts have worked. We’ve seen these absurd scenes where riot police are protecting branches of Espressolab.”She added that the growing wave of arrests had done little to quell people’s fear of demonstrating. “It is not a deterrent. There is no atmosphere of fear,” said Aydın. “Instead, people are saying: ‘We have already given 2,000 of our youth to these arrests … there is no turning back from this.’”Explore more on these topicsTurkeyRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropePress freedomProtestConstruction industryHospitality industrynewsShareReuse this content"

He was released on Thursday.Turkish authorities alsodeported the BBC journalist Mark Lowen, who had been covering the protests, after holding him for 17 hours on Wednesday, saying he posed “a threat to public order”, the broadcaster said.Turkey’s communications directorate said Lowen had been deported “due to a lack of accreditation”.Turkish prosecutors opened an investigation into Medin in 2023 over a protest he joined in Stockholm in which a puppet of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was hung by its feet, according to the presidency’s statement on Sunday. It said the Swedish journalist was among 15 suspects believed to have carried out, organised or publicised the demonstration.The protest infuriated Turkish authorities, who alleged it was orchestrated by PKK members and summoned Sweden’s ambassador to Ankara.Explore more on these topicsTurkeySwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

On the one hand, it crushes Hamas’s military and governmental capabilities, and on the other hand, it creates the conditions for the release of our hostages.”Netanyahu said on Saturday night “the security cabinet convened and decided to increase the pressure, which had already increased, in order to further pound Hamas and create the optimal conditions for releasing our hostages”.View image in fullscreenTens of thousands in Tel Aviv protesting on Saturday against Netanyahu’s government and demanding the return of hostages.Photograph: Yair Palti/Anadolu/Getty ImagesTens of thousands of people who rallied in Tel Aviv and throughout Israel on Saturday night accused the prime minister of deprioritising a deal to free those still held captive inGaza.Speaking to protesters at Habima Square in central Tel Aviv, Einav Zangauker, the mother ofMatan Zangauker, who is still held captive by Hamas, accused Netanyahu of carrying out a “targeted assassination” against her son after the Israel Defense Forces launched an aerial attack on Gaza last week.“Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has decided to bomb Matan instead of saving him and bringing him home,” she said.Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas’s 2023 attack on Israel, 58 remain in Gaza, including 34 who, the Israeli military says, are dead.Under pressure at international and domestic level, Netanyahu stressed that “Hamas must lay down its arms”, adding that its leaders would be allowed to leave after they did so, and Israel was also willing to talk about “the final stage” of a hostage release-ceasefire deal with the militant group.“We are ready,” he said. “Hamas will lay down its weapons. Its leaders will be allowed to leave. We will ensure general security in the Gaza Strip and enable the implementation of the Trump plan, the voluntary immigration plan.”Days after taking office, the US president, Donald Trump,announced a planthat would relocate Gaza’s more than 2 million inhabitants to neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, an announcement that was condemned by much of the international community, including allies across Europe and the Middle East.View image in fullscreenProtesters hold photos of the hostages Ariel and David Cunio, who are being held in the Gaza Strip, during a demonstration in Tel Aviv.Photograph: Amir Levy/Getty ImagesNetanyahu’s remarks came as mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US continued efforts to broker a ceasefire and secure the release of the Israeli hostages.On Saturday, Hamas allegedlyoffered to free five living Israeli hostagesin exchange for a 50-day ceasefire, and released a video of a hostage making an appeal for his freedom.Hamas’s chief, Khalil al-Hayya, said on Saturday that the militant group expressed willingness to release the five hostages over the Muslim holiday Eid al-Fitr, which begins on Sunday, after a proposal it received two days ago from Egypt and Qatar, Reuters has reported.“Two days ago, we received a proposal from the mediators in Egypt and Qatar. We dealt with it positively and accepted it,” Hayya, who leads the Hamas negotiating team, said in a televised speech. “We hope that the [Israeli] occupation will not undermine [it].”Hamas stated on Saturday that the group had approved a new ceasefire proposal put forward by mediators, and urged Israel to support it. Netanyahu’s office confirmed receipt of the proposal and said Israel had submitted a counterproposal.The details of the latest mediation efforts remain undisclosed, although, according to media reports in Israel, Netanyahu’s government insists on the release of 10 of the 24 hostages.Meanwhile, Netanyahu’s office said he would visit Hungary on 2 April for a multi-day trip in defiance of an arrest warrant from the international criminal court against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, publicly extended an invitation to Netanyahu in November shortly after the ICC issued the warrant.In a separate development on Sunday, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said the bodies of 14 rescuers, including a UN employee, had been found in Rafah in southern Gaza, a week after its ambulances came under heavy fire from Israeli forces.Three PRCS first responders and one civil defence paramedic are still missing.“The bodies were recovered with difficulty as they were buried in the sand, with some showing signs of decomposition,” the Red Crescent said.Israel’s military admitted on Saturday thatit had fired on ambulances in the Gaza Stripafter identifying them as “suspicious vehicles”.The incident occurred in Rafah city’s Tel al-Sultan neighbourhood just days into a renewed Israeli offensive in the area close to the Egyptian border. The military resumed its wider bombardments of Gaza on 18 March, breaking a ceasefire that had lasted almost two months.The PRCS president, Younis al-Khatib, condemned Israel for targeting its paramedics as they were fulfilling their humanitarian mission.He said a rescue team had been able to reach the scene where the crew members went missing two days ago and had retrieved the body of a crew member, which had been buried.“There are a number of scenarios for what happened … After more than one week of losing communication with our crew either they have been killed or detained by the Israeli occupation forces,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHamasIsrael-Gaza warIsraelGazaBenjamin NetanyahuMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

He was held incommunicado for 13 months without charge, trial, access to a lawyer, or any communication with his family. So when an Israeli shell killed Asma, 29, and their youngest daughter, three-year-old Ghina, in August 2024, there was no way to send news to him.He was released in Februaryunder the ceasefire dealafter turning 33 in prison, and was briefly overwhelmed when he saw his father and cousins waiting to welcome him home.“It was amazing to see someone I knew,” he said. The joy at being surrounded by familiar, beloved faces, after a year of hunger, torture and isolation from everyone he knew, lasted until he asked about his wife and children.Dababish’s father called up a photo on his phone to help break the unbearable news. It showed Ghina, his baby, laid out for burial beside her young cousin. “This is the moment I still cannot believe,” Dababish said, breaking down again at the memory. “It never crossed my mind that they could be killed.”As he sobbed, his two surviving children, six-year-old Muadh and eight-year-old Aisha, tried to comfort him with hugs.His tragedy is not unique. TheObserverspoke to three Palestinians fromGazawhose immediate family were killed while they were held by the Israeli military or in Israeli civilian prisons without charge or trial. They only learned about their losses when they were released months later.The three men are civilians – a nurse, a civil servant and a headteacher of a primary school – who say they have never taken up arms. They had no access to a lawyer in jail and were not allowed to communicate with their families.Legal rights groups say there are likely to be many other detainees from Gaza who have lost close family in Israeli attacks, but have not been told of their deaths.Family visits, letters or calls have been banned for Palestinians held by Israel since 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its surprise attack on Israel, and televisions and radios have been removed from cells.“They are enforcing this isolation on prisoners. They do not want them to know anything about their families and their loved ones,” said Tala Nasir of the Palestinian prisoners’ rights organisation Addameer.Prisoners who are able to secure legal representation can sometimes get news from their lawyers, but there are certainly hundreds and probably thousands of detainees from Gaza who do not have a lawyer.‘No rules’: Gaza’s doctors say they were tortured, beaten and humiliated in Israeli detentionRead moreMost are held under Israel’s unlawful combatants law, which allows indefinite detention without producing evidence. The state can hold someone for 45 days before allowing access to a lawyer or bringing them in front of a judge to authorise the detention. At the start of the war, those periods were extended to 180 and 75 days respectively.Amnesty International said the system “legalises incommunicado detention, enables enforced disappearance and must be repealed”. Despite thousands of detentions, there have been no known trials of anyone captured in Gaza since 7 October 2023.There is no government provision of lawyers to Palestinian detainees and it is impossible for legal aid groups to support prisoners on the scale now needed, said Jessica Montell, executive director of HaMoked, an Israeli group with decades of experience fighting for Palestinian rights through the Israeli courts.“I’m sure it is the case that the vast majority of Gaza detainees have not seen a lawyer,” said Montell, adding that HaMoked’s teams have visited a few dozen detainees from Gaza, out of thousands held inside Israel. “There’s nothing like a public defender’s office that is going to meet with all of them. There is no obligation on the state to provide lawyers.”Bureaucratic obstacles and the remoteness of many detention camps and prisons further limit visits. When lawyers do manage to meet detainees from Gaza, breaking painful news is a regular part of their discussions, according to Nasir.“Many of the prisoners we were following had one or two of their family members killed in Gaza and they did not know at all. It’s so heartbreaking, and it’s really hard for the lawyer to tell this information to the prisoner.”In December, the Israeli state said it was holding more than 3,400 Palestinians from Gaza under the unlawful combatants law, in response to a high court petition from campaign group the Public Committee AgainstTorturein Israel (PCATI).At least 1,000 people detained in Gaza after 7 October 2023 were released under theceasefire agreement that broke down this month, but thousands are still in jail. Tal Steiner, director of PCATI, said Israeli prisons were holding about 1,500 detainees from Gaza and that “it would be reasonable to estimate that several hundred [Palestinian] detainees are still being held in military camps.”The Israeli military declined to say how many Palestinians from Gaza it holds, or how many have met lawyers, but said it did not limit the content of legal meetings held with prisoners or what documents lawyers could bring to them. “Many detainees have already exercised their right to meet with a lawyer,” the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. “Israel rejects claims that there is a policy of isolating Palestinian detainees from the outside world.”The Israeli military, the statement added, respected national and international law in its treatment of detainees and rejected all allegations concerning systemic abuse.Civil servant Ibrahim Dawood is among those freed during the ceasefire. He said he never had access to a lawyer and was physically attacked when he asked for a chance to prove his innocence.“My friends taught me some words in Hebrew, how to ask the soldiers politely for a meeting with the officer, asking only for justice. They would beat me on the way there and back,” he said. “I kept telling them that they should listen to me and not accuse me of things I didn’t do.” He spent 13 months in prison in the Negev desert, arriving there badly injured after an Israeli attack on the school where he was sheltering with his family.Ill health, hunger and the beatings weighed on him, but just as bad was the mental pain of being separated from his family, he said. “I didn’t know anything about their fate and knew they had no information about what was happening to me.”The relief of release, when it came, was very fleeting. He found out that the family home in al-Fakhura, near Jabaliya, had been destroyed in an Israeli airstrike that killed his father, sister, his sister-in-law and her three children. The moment when he heard the news – and collapsed in grief – was captured on video and widely shared on social media.“The people who should have welcomed me home had been taken from me by the [Israeli] army. On top of the pain of injury and captivity came the pain of losing beloved relatives who I will never see again.”His surviving family is fragmented between the north and south, and he cannot find space to bring his wife, children and widowed mother together under one roof.The Israel Prison Service (IPS), which runs civilian jails, said “all prisoners are detained according to the law”. Asked about the abuse and isolation described by Dababish and Dawood, a spokesperson said: “We are not aware of the claims you described and as far as we know, no such events have occurred under IPS responsibility.”View image in fullscreenFreed Palestinian prisoners wave from a bus as they arrive in the Gaza Strip after being released from an Israeli prison following a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel in Khan Younis, Gaza, in February.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APDababish said he also never saw a lawyer and that Israeli officials had accused him of being a Hamas member because he was a nurse in a state-run hospital. Hamas has governed Gaza for nearly two decades. “I responded that I was a displaced person with my wife and children in an evacuation school, in an area the army had designated as safe.”The lack of contact with the outside world, or any due process, violates theGeneva conventions, rights groups say. Dababish said it added to the agonies of detention, deepening prisoners’ despair.‘He insisted we take him to the graves’: the Palestinian hostages coming home to catastropheRead more“It felt like we were living in a grave. You couldn’t know anything about what was happening outside, where your family was, what was going on.”His home was bombed, so he is living with his parents and two surviving children in a school turned shelter – which sparks painful memories of the night he was detained – and has little sense of security.All his family’s worst tragedies have played out in similarly repurposed schools – meant to be places of relative safety for civilians fleeing Israel’s war on Hamas. His wife and daughter were killed in another school, when a shell hit a classroom in the Sheikh Radwan district of Gaza City. “They were displaced in an evacuation shelter. They did nothing wrong,” he said.Haunted by loss and memories of detention, he is trying to keep going for his children.“I went to the hospital, registered my name again for work and am waiting for them to call me.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe ObserverPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelGazaGeneva conventionsHuman rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

He didn’t know that Ali, his brother, would be the only person waiting when he arrived in Khan Younis earlier this month: Alaa’s wife, Hala, and all five of the couple’s children had been killed in an Israeli airstrike last summer.Abu Zeid, 48, the headteacher of a primary school funded by the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Bureij in central Gaza, was arrested along with dozens of other men when Israeli troops raided the school turned shelter in December 2023. He would never see his family again.“We had no idea where he was the entire time, we were so afraid for his safety,” said Ali, speaking on Alaa’s behalf, as the UN employee is not authorised to speak to media.“Waiting for him was very difficult. We were happy but it was mixed with deep sorrow. I didn’t know how to tell him his wife and children had been killed.”Abu Zeid’s family – Hala, 49, a teacher; Nour, 25, an engineer; Alaa, 22, a dentistry student; Riyad, 20, a science student; Walaa, 15, and Mohammed, 13 – were killed in an airstrike on their house in Bureij overnight on 20 August, eight months after he was abducted.Ali and his sons tried to rescue their loved ones from the rubble, but there were no survivors: just ripped-up body parts. When morning broke, they recovered more remains and, as is Muslim tradition, buried them the same day.This horrific story is repeated all over the Gaza Strip, where according to the local health ministry, 1,400 families have been entirely wiped out by Israeli bombing, numbers deemed accurate by UN agencies. The arrival of the ceasefire and hostage detainee swaps in January has brought joy as abducted Palestinians return home to Gaza, but also the painful process of returning home to search for missing loved ones, and grappling with the scale of the territory’s collective loss.“He insisted we take him immediately to the graves,” Ali said. “He was very quiet, he didn’t cry. I think he was in shock.”Abu Zeid was released on 15 February as part of the fragile ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that paused 15 months of fighting. He maintains he had nothing to do with Hamas; like thousands of other civilian men from Gaza, he appears to have been caught up in the huge Israel Defence Forces (IDF) dragnet.Emergency legislation introduced after the Palestinian militant group’s attack on Israel in October 2023 that ignited the war allows for the detention of Palestinians from the territory without charge or trial, classing them as “unlawful combatants”. The IDF says the measure complies with international law.AGuardianinvestigation last year documentedextreme and systemic mistreatment of Palestinians held in Israeli prisonssince the conflict broke out – findings corroborated by Abu Zeid’s experience in detention. At least 60 people have died in Israeli custody since October 2023. The headteacher said he was severely beaten on several occasions and his eyesight is now impaired, necessitating surgery. The prison in the Negev desert was overcrowded and often freezing, and prisoners were not allowed to seek medical treatment or wash, leading to outbreaks of scabies and other skin problems.‘They don’t want them to know anything’: Gaza civilians held in Israel not told families had been killedRead moreAbu Zeid was given just enough food to stay alive: he lost 25kg in weight and his gaunt appearance upon release shocked his surviving family.“He looked like a skeleton. At every moment in detention, he said he felt like he was staring death in the face,” Ali said.The Israel Prison Service has previously told theGuardianthat it operates according to the law, and under the oversight of the state comptroller.Abu Zeid had no access to legal representation or news during his imprisonment. On his return, he knew immediately something was deeply wrong when Hala and the children were not waiting to greet him. Ali was forced to confirm his brother’s deepest fears.He is recovering from his ordeal at Ali’s damaged home in Bureij, and says he will return to teaching when fit enough. He has changed, Ali says: he is quiet and finds it hard to talk to people. He has grown closer to God, spending time reading the Qur’an. With his home destroyed, there are no pictures of his killed loved ones to look at.“He imagined holding [his family] in his arms again, his children, and returning to live a decent life,” Ali said. “Instead, he found a catastrophe.”Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warThe ObserverGazaMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

According to a recent report byAmnesty International, so far at least 844,499 Afghan nationals have been forcibly deported back to Afghanistan where they are at “real risk of persecution by the Taliban”.Pakistan starts mass deportation of undocumented AfghansRead moreAmong those facing the threat of returning to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan are 60 female activists and human rights defenders, who fled persecution after they spoke out for women’s rights and education or attended protests. Many have been forced into hiding in recent weeks, as police have been going door-to-door in the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, arbitrarily arresting any Afghans and allegedly demanding huge bribes.Humaira Alim worked as a women’s rights and education activist in Afghanistan for seven years before the Taliban came back to power in 2021. After women were deprived of the right to work and then attend university under the group’s strict Islamic rule, she was among a group of women who defied the Taliban and helped organise protests on the streets.But after facing “dire warnings” and then direct threats to her life from the Taliban for her activism when pregnant with her first child, Alim said she had “no choice” but to flee over the border to Pakistan in December 2022.She has stayed in Islamabad ever since, living with her two young children on a visa that has been given monthly. Alim described her situation as an “awful nightmare”, as all Afghan nationals – even those who had lived in Pakistan for decades – were now facing routine persecution and harassment from the police. She and her children were recently forced to hide on the roof of their home as officers came looking for them.“If they send me back to Afghanistan, it only means death,” she said. “The Taliban have records on me and my activism. There is no place for women like me. They only arrest and torture us. I can’t go back there with my children.”Alim said she knew dozens of other Afghan women like her, who had worked as activists, lawyers and human rights defenders and faced harassment or torture at the hands of the Taliban, who were now in hiding in Pakistan.Liliana Harrington, senior campaigner for Avaaz, an organisation that has been advocating for the women, said: “Deporting these people to the Taliban is a death sentence. Pakistan would not only abandon these brave people to their oppressors but also abandon its proud legacy of protecting vulnerable Afghans.”The Pakistan government has given all undocumented Afghan nationals a deadline of 31 March to leave the country, otherwise they will be arrested. Alim said she and other female activists were just asking for more time, to find a third country who might be able to offer them asylum. Currently, they are waiting to see if they get an offer from Brazil or if other countries will offer them a safe haven.The widespread expulsion drew condemnation from Isabelle Lassee, Amnesty’s deputy regional director for south Asia. “The Pakistani authorities are violating the rights of Afghan refugees with impunity, subjecting them to arbitrary decisions that are shrouded in secrecy, totally lacking transparency and accountability,” she said.Explore more on these topicsPakistanAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaTalibanAmnesty InternationalnewsShareReuse this content"

His family and friends have not heard from him since, despite issuing an efit of what he might look like in his late 20s when the police investigation was reopened in 2019.At the time of his disappearance Sloley was described as a “light-skinned black male”, 5ft 5in tall and of medium build. He is reported to have “striking” blue eyes.Previously, police said he had little money, no wallet and no bag with extra clothes on him to indicate he was planning to run away, adding there was no proof that Sloley had been harmed and there was no evidence his case was linked to any others.DCI Sarb Kaur, who is leading the investigation, said: “Alex was reported missing to police on 8 August 2008. Since then there have been extensive inquiries made by police but sadly Alex has not yet been found.“We are now offering a reward of up to £10,000 for anyone who has information relating to Alex’s whereabouts.“This remains an active missing person investigation, subject to regular review by senior officers, with the aim of locating Alex and bringing some comfort to his family.“We have recently met with Alex’s mother to outline how we intend to progress our investigation to find him.“I would ask anyone with information who could help to please get in contact immediately, no matter how insignificant you think this could be.”In 2023, research by the charity Missing People found that missing persons cases involving black and Asian people areless likely to be resolved by policethan those involving white people. Black and Asian children are also likely to be missing for longer,the report found.Only 16% of incidents related to black children and 19% related to Asian children were concluded with the person being found by the police, compared with 23% of incidents related to white children.In 2019, when the efit was issued, Sloley’s mother, Nerissa Tivy, said it was a great picture of him, adding that she tries to imagine what her son might look like and how he might dress. “He was quite a slick dresser, my son; he wasn’t scruffy.”She added: “There’s no closure to this and, with all the appeals and knowing your child would not just run away, you start thinking something terrible has happened to him,” she said at the time.“I would love to see him walk through the door.”Explore more on these topicsLondonMetropolitan policenewsShareReuse this content"

A Guardian investigation has revealed councils will overspend on Send services by nearly £2bn over the next year, pushing theiraccumulated deficitsto at least £5.2bn by 31 March 2026.The date is crucial because that is when the £5.2bn debt, hidden away off local authority books using an accounting fix for seven years, is due to come back on to the balance sheets, threatening to instantly bankrupt scores of town halls.The government faces a massive headache: not just what to do about the rapidly increasing billions of historic Send debt, but how to keep a lid on future Send spending, which shows no sign of abating. There are no easy fixes.The last government tried to keep a lid on Send spending by paying millions of pounds in “safety valve” grants to scores of councils to help them develop better ways to “manage” parental demand for Send support. Very few of the schemes have had the desired effect of driving down costs.Of the 131 councils that responded to the Guardian, 79 signed grant agreements with theDepartment for Education(DfE). Only three are forecasting they will not be in deficit next year. Some of those that have slowly ground their way to near break-even say when the grants finish they will hurtle rapidly back into the red.City of York council, the only authority surveyed by the Guardian that is projecting its accumulated Send budget deficit to move into surplus next year, was sceptical about keeping its head above water in future. “Unless the system is changed, we will go back into deficit quite quickly,” said Bob Webb, York council’s executive member for children, young people and education.Attempts to change the system, however, could put councils and ministers on a collision course with parents and campaigners. Councils are clear they want changes to the law to give the authorities more control over which children get specialist Send support and where they are educated.Parents say more crude attempts to ration access to education, health and care plans (EHCPs) – formal assessments that give children the legal right to Send support – will not fix a problem caused primarily by the inability of mainstream schools to meet Send pupils’ needs, and those needs are not going away.“Parents are banging their heads against a brick wall trying to get schools to give support to their children, and they get knocked back,” said Tania Tirraoro of the campaign group Special Needs Jungle.Tirraoro said it was wrong to blame the financial woes of councils on parents exercising their legal right to Send support. “[The government] needs to write off those [council] debts. Then you need to keep writing those debts off until a programme of early intervention support and better inclusion has worked its way through the system.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is clearit wants to overhaul Send– a white paper is expected this summer – and that a new system must be financially sustainable. No decisions have been made yet about what to do with the deficits.Jane Hayman, the director for Send and inclusion at Norfolk county council, said the current system was “broken” and “pits parents against schools”. Norfolk’s Send deficit is forecast to reach £183m in a year’s time. Hayman expects the government to step in to bail out the council: “It cannot be ignored,” she said.Not everyone is so sure. Mike Cox, the deputy leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, whose forecast deficit will hit £168m by 31 March 2026, up £60m in a year, predicts: “[Government] is going to keep kicking the can down the road. The only thing that will change is that the can will get bigger and harder to kick.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsLocal governmentDepartment for EducationSchoolsDisabilityChildrenEnglandanalysisShareReuse this content"

At least 18 councils have warned explicitly that the debts put them at risk of insolvency unless the government intervenes, with council estimates suggesting even more could go bust.“The deficits are pushing councils all over England to the financial brink. The clock is ticking, and councils are being left in limbo with significant uncertainty over the future of services,” said William Burns, social care policy adviser for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (Cipfa).Mass defaults on Send deficits would cause chaos and damage other local services, said Cipfa, because councils that declare effective bankruptcy would be forced to drastically rein in spending in all areas, not just local schools. It estimates that as many as 75 councils are at risk.The spiralling debts were kept off council books by Tory ministers using an accounting fix called a “statutory override” but this ends on 31 March 2026, when the debt returns to town hall balance sheets. Ministers must now decide whether to clear the debt, or extend the override until the deficits can be cleared safely..The Send deficit ballooned under the last government, triggered by rapid increases in the cost of meeting education and health care plans (EHCPs) which give children and young people up to the age of 25 the legal right to school support from local authorities for conditions such as autism, and speech and language difficulty.In 2015, 240,000 EHCPs were in place in England, more than doubling to 576,000 in 2024, according to Department for Education (DfE) statistics. Insufficient special needs capacity in state schools, and the high costs of Send placements in private specialist schools, have been driving overspends.A government insider said: “Those [council] forecasts can only have been based on the failing Tory system that we will change. Tackling the chaos that the Tories left in our Send system is a major priority for [the education secretary] Bridget Phillipson, so we can give every child the opportunity to get a brilliant education.”A Guardian investigation shows at least 101 English councils – over two-thirds of the total – spent more than their allocated Send budget during the past year, with 18 councils breaching their annual allocations by evermore than £30m.Nearly nine out of 10 English upper-tier councils – of the 131 that responded in full to the FoI – will have an accumulated deficit on their high needs budgets by the end of next March, with one in four (32 out of the 131 who responded in full) now predicting debts of more than £50m and 15 debts of £100m or more..Leeds city council, which covers the chancellor Rachel Reeves’s Leeds West and Pudsey constituency, has forecast its accumulated Send deficit will soar from £17.5m to £50m by the end of the next financial year, and warned the increase will put it at “serious financial risk”.Hampshire county council, which has England’s largest forecast deficit at £312m, is projecting its debt to rise by £111m over the next year. In its budget reports, the council said that if the override was removed and the debt became a part of the organisation’s deficit, “a section 114 notice would become inevitable”.Middlesbrough, one of England’s most deprived authorities, said its forecast Send deficit will rise by more than a quarter to £26m over the next 12 months. In council papers last month, it called this “a critical risk to the council’s financial viability, given that it will wipe out the council’s general fund reserves”.The average forecast accumulated deficit across the councils covered by the analysis is £40m by the end of March 2026, with 112 forecasting their accumulated high needs deficit will worsen over the next 12 months.A Department for Education spokesperson said: “The evidence is clear that the Send system has been on its knees for years – with too many children not having their needs met and parents forced to fight for support.“It will take time, but as part of our Plan for Change we are thinking differently about what the Send system should look like, to spread opportunity, restore the confidence of families up and down the country and deliver the improvement they are crying out for.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The raid was condemned by the Quakers as “an aggressive violation”.However, Youth Demand said the publicity surrounding the raid had had the effect of increasing awareness of their activities and as many as 200 people had since expressed interest in joining protests starting this Tuesday to highlight Israel’s actions in Gaza.One of the women arrested and later released without charge told the Guardian on Sunday of how they and others at the venue, including a life-drawing class with a naked model, were shocked when police entered.“These are welcome talks run every week and they are completely open to the public, so anyone who has seen a poster and is interested can come in and learn more. The police could have literally come along and sat down,” she said.“Instead, we could see them gathering at the window and their little hats were tapping on the glass. Then they forced the door open and burst into a room with a group of women sitting in a circle. There was a life-drawing class in another room – with a model in the middle – and an elderly woman was in the toilet at the time.”A student who was arrested at the talk said police had released her in the middle of the night and that she was still waiting for them to return a laptop, which she needed for exams, and a notebook containing French notes from her coursework.The group, whose activists include young veterans of the Just Stop Oil movement, said it was planning to “shut down London” on a daily basis starting from Tuesday, when it is due to hold a rally at 6.30pm on Malet Street, Bloomsbury.It said police had carried out raids on the homes of activists across London and in locations outside the city in recent days, which it took as a sign that the authorities were worried about its potency.Eddie Whittingham, who was arrested at his house in Exeter last week, said: “I had taken part in a 10-minute blockade of a road and we had made it known we were going to be doing the same again in London.“To the best of my knowledge, stepping out into the road for 10 minutes is not something you could be pre-emptively arrested for, yet here we are.“It’s kind of baffling but also affirming that the police believe a bunch of young people taking actions like this are worth the sort of resources they are devoting to these raids.”The Metropolitan police said it had arrested six people at the Quaker meeting house on suspicion of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance.The force said those arrested were part of Youth Demand and it claimed those attending the meeting were planning direct action in the capital next month.“Youth Demand have stated an intention to ‘shut down’ London over the month of April using tactics including ‘swarming’ and road blocks,” police said.“While we absolutely recognise the importance of the right to protest, we have a responsibility to intervene to prevent activity that crosses the line from protest into serious disruption and other criminality.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

In the 30 forces providing only one week full pay, 60% of officers returned to work after seven days. In the five forces that provided data and offered two weeks’ fully paid leave, only 12% of officers went back to work after a week.More than 50 testimonies from officers and their families raised concerns about the treatment of fathers, with officers describing a culture where involved fathers were “mocked”, “slagged off” or “ostracised”.One former officer, who said the strain of his family was one of the biggest reasons he left the force, said he was “treated very poorly” and “slagged off behind his back” for taking two weeks’ unpaid leave to care for his partner after an emergency caesarean.“Overall the police service doesn’t support fathers fairly at all,” he said. “[The] culture makes men feel like they need to be back at work asap. If you’re not, you’re looked down on or treated differently.”In another example, a firearms officer was not allowed to adjust the dates of his paternity leave when his baby arrived three weeks early, meaning that on the day his wife and baby came out of hospital he did a night shift carrying a firearm.The Met police, the largest force in England and Wales, offers civilian staff – in roles such as administration or 999 call handling – three weeks of paternity leave at full pay. However, frontline officers get one fully paid week, with the second paid at the statutory rate of £184.03 a week, a quarter of thestarting salary for a Met officer.The Met said in a statement: “Officers and staff have different terms and conditions, set separately. For officers, these are governed nationally via police regulations and for staff, set by the Met. Fair terms and conditions are important to everyone.”Paternityleave for police officers is governedby police regulations, set by the Home Office, a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council said. Forces have to offer one week at full pay and one week at statutory pay for qualifying officers.However, at least nine forces across England and Wales now offer a second week of paternity leave on full pay. British TransportPoliceand the Civil Nuclear constabulary give officers three weeks’ leave on full pay, while Derbyshire, Greater Manchester, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands give two weeks’ full pay.A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said the increase in paternity pay, made last year, reflected “the changing nature of modern families”. They added: “It’s important to us that we do our utmost to support our officers and staff as they enter their journey into parenthood.”A survey from the Police Federation found that more than one in five officers were ready to quit the service in 2023 – up from 18% in 2022 and 12% in 2021. Of 2,654 officers who left the police between 2017 and 2024,27% resigned before they reached pension age, with 63% saying the impact on their family life was a critical factor.Alex Lloyd Hunter, a cofounder of the Dad Shift, urged Yvette Cooper to improve paternity pay for officers and speak to the Met commissioner to tackle its “grossly unfair policy”.“The home secretary has done a lot to ensure the police are doing better to protect women and girls,” he said. “Supporting dads in the force properly, so they can be involved caregivers, is part of that same equality agenda.”A Home Office spokesperson said police bodies made recommendations on pay, and that the government recognised that support for officers was “vital, as a healthy and engaged police workforce will be better able to tackle crime and protect the public”.Explore more on these topicsPoliceMaternity & paternity rightsMetropolitan policeParents and parentingChildrenEnglandWalesnewsShareReuse this content"

There are methods – there are methods which you could do it, as you know.”Welker alluded to a purported loophole some Trump supporters have fantasized about finding in which he could be the running mate to his vice-president, JD Vance, or someone else in the 2028 election. The person to whom Trump would be the running mate in that scenario could then immediately resign after winning and being sworn in as president, letting Trump take over by succession.Their argument would be that the constitution’s 22nd amendment only explicitly bans being “elected” to more than two presidential terms without saying anything about becoming the commander-in-chief on an additional occasion through succession.Vance has not indicated he is interested in participating in such a plan. And an election law professor at Notre Dame, Derek Muller,toldthe Associated Press that the constitution’s 12th amendment says “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”Muller said that indicates that if Trump is not eligible to run for president again because of the 22nd amendment, he is not eligible to run for the vice-presidency, either.“I don’t think there’s any ‘one weird trick’ to getting around presidential term limits,” Muller said.Nonetheless, Welker theorized that Vance could somehow “pass the baton” to Trump.Trump replied, “Well, that’s one.”“But there are others too. There are others.”When pushed to detail those methods, Trump said, “No.”Trump then said it was “far too early to think about” trying to defy the two presidential term limit in the constitution to stay in office and that he was “focused on the current”. But asked if being president a third time would be too much work, he said: “I like working.”And asked if he was just joking, as he and his supporters like to say whenever he floats anti-constitutional ideas, he said: “No, no, I’m not joking. I’m not joking.”Trump’s comments came after he previously likened himself to a “king” – the royal title without term limits – on social media.In February, he prompted widespreadoutcrywhen he took to Truth Social following his executive order for New York City to rescind its congestion pricing program and wrote: “CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD. Manhattan, and all ofNew York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!”The White House then proceeded toshareTrump’s quote on social media, accompanied with a computer-generated image of the president grinning on a fake Time magazine cover while wearing a golden crown, behind him the skyline of New York City.Meanwhile, the Republican US House member Andy Ogles of Tennesseeintroduceda resolution in January expressing support for amending the constitution into allowing a president to serve up to three terms – under the condition that they did not serve two consecutive terms.Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W Bush – who all served two consecutive terms – could not seek a third term under an amendment like the one posited by Ogles, which would stand virtually no chance of passing. Only Trump would be eligible for a third term because he won the presidency in 2016 and in November 2024 but lost in 2020 to Joe Biden.Nevertheless, not all members of the Trump-led Republican party are on board with the idea of changing the constitution to let the president stay in power beyond the end of his second term in early 2029. After Trump’s “King” comments in February, the Republican US senator Markwayne Mullin of Oklahomasaidhe would not back an unconstitutional third term under Trump.“I’m not changing the constitution, first of all, unless the American people chose to do that,” Mullin told NBC.To modify presidential term limits wouldrequiretwo-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House, as well as approval from three-quarters of the country’s state legislatures. Trump’s enablers do not have the numbers required in those various contexts to easily get that approval democratically.The 22nd amendment was ratified after Franklin D Roosevelt served two terms following his election in 1932 – and was then re-elected in 1940 and 1944 amid the second world war. He died as president in 1945, and the 22nd amendment was ratified in 1951.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

My phone number was in his phone because my phone number is in his phone.”Goldberg made waves when the magazine, over two days beginning 24 March, published details of a group chat that included seniorTrump administration officialsdiscussing a then imminent US attack on Houthi installations and senior personnel.The chat, on the Signal app, unnerved many in Washington about the security precautions being taken by neophyte administration officials to ensure national security, triggering several days of headlines over whether the texts amounted to a breach.Donald Trump on Sunday repeated his position that the disclosures were a mistake – and the president denied reports that Waltz had offered to resign. “No, he didn’t,” Trump said. “There was no reason for him to.”Earlier, Trump said Waltz is “a very good man, and he will continue to do a good job”.On Sunday, Goldberg claimed that Waltz is “telling everyone that he’s never met me or spoken to me – that’s simply not true”. Waltz had said during a meeting with Trump and ambassadors at the White House that he “never met” Goldberg.“There’s a lot of journalists … who have made big names for themselves making up lies about this president,” Waltz said, without offering evidence. Referring to Goldberg, he added: “This one in particular I’ve never met, don’t know, never communicated with, and we are looking into and reviewing how the heck he got into this room.”The national security council (NSC) confirmed the authenticity of the messages and said it was reviewing how Goldberg got into the Waltz-initiated chat. Theories range from unintentionally selecting Goldberg’s number; his number being under the name of a security official supposed to be included; to intentional sabotage.But Goldberg told NBC News: “This has become a somewhat farcical situation. There’s no subterfuge here. My number was in his phone. He mistakenly added me to the group chat. There we go.”Democratic US senator Mark Warner continued to press the issue on Sunday, saying the Republican White House officials involved in the Signal breach risked American lives.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He was 90.Chamberlain died on Saturday night in Waimānalo, Hawaii of complications after a stroke, according to his publicist, Harlan Boll.Martin Rabbett, his lifelong partner, said in a statement: “Our beloved Richard is with the angels now. He is free and soaring to those loved ones before us. How blessed were we to have known such an amazing and loving soul. Love never dies. And our love is under his wings lifting him to his next great adventure.”Tall, with classic good looks and romantic style, Chamberlain became an instant favorite with teenage girls as the compassionate physician on the TV series that aired from 1961 to 1966. Photoplay magazine named him most popular male star for three years in a row, from 1963-65.Not until 2003 did he acknowledge publicly what Hollywood insiders had long known: that he was gay. He made the revelation in his autobiography, Shattered Love.The actor became known as “king of the TV miniseries” in 1978 when he landed the starring role in Centennial, an epic production 24 hours long and based on James Michener’s sprawling novel. He followed that in 1980 with Shōgun, another costly, epic miniseries based on James Clavell’s period piece about an American visitor to Japan.View image in fullscreenChamberlain with Yoko Shimada in Shōgun.Photograph: Ronald GrantHe scored his greatest miniseries success in 1983 with another long-form drama, The Thorn Birds, based on Colleen McCullough’s bestseller. He played Father Ralph de Bricassart, a Roman Catholic priest in Australia who falls in love with beautiful Meggie Cleary (Rachel Ward). The ABC production, which also starred Barbara Stanwyck, reportedly attracted 100 million viewers.Chamberlain won Golden Globes for his work on Shōgun and The Thorn Birds. Years earlier, he received one for Dr Kildare.View image in fullscreenChamberlain with Rachel Ward in The Thorn Birds.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhen the public began to lose interest in miniseries, Chamberlain turned to the theatre, where he displayed a fine singing voice. He appeared as Henry Higgins in a 1994 Broadway revival of My Fair Lady and as Captain von Trapp in a 1999 revival of The Sound of Music.He reprised the role of de Bricassart in the 1996 TV movie The Thorn Birds: The Missing Years.He also appeared in numerous films, including The Music Lovers (as Tchaikovsky), The Madwoman of Chaillot, The Towering Inferno and The Three Musketeers and its sequels.Dr Kildare was based on a string of successful 1930s and 1940s films that had starred Lew Ayres in the title role.Chamberlain’s hunky, all-American appearance made him an overnight star. Another medical show that debuted the same season, Ben Casey, was also a smash and made its leading man, the darkly handsome Vince Edwards, a star, too.The so-called “Ben Casey shirt” became a fashion item, both shows’ theme songs made the pop Top 40 (the Kildare song performed by Chamberlain himself) and there was even a pop song called Dr Kildare! Dr Casey! You Are Wanted for Consultation.But in his autobiography, Chamberlain recounted how he was forced to hide his sexuality. He would escort glamorous female colleagues to movie premieres and other public events at the request of studio executives and dodge reporters’ questions about why he had never married with a stock reply: “Getting married would be great, but I’m awfully busy now.”“When I grew up, being gay, being a sissy or anything like that was verboten,” he said in an NBC interview. “I disliked myself intensely and feared this part of myself intensely and had to hide it.”The book also described a troubled childhood and an alcoholic father, and Chamberlain said that writing it finally lifted a heavy emotional burden. He also expressed relief that he was no longer hiding his sexuality.“I played a cat-and-mouse game with the press. Game over,” said Chamberlain, who for years was involved with fellow actor Martin Rabbett.Born George Richard Chamberlain in Beverly Hills on 31 March 1934, the actor originally studied at Pomona College to be a painter. But after returning from the army, where he had served as an infantry clerk in the Korean war, Chamberlain decided to try acting.He studied voice and drama, appearing in guest roles in a handful of TV shows and in the 1960 film The Secret of the Purple Reef, and ultimately won the Dr Kildare role.When Dr Kildare was cancelled, he initially found it difficult to shake the image of the handsome young physician.View image in fullscreenRichard Chamberlain with the titular characters, played by Eric McCormack and Debra Messing, in Will & Grace, 2005.Photograph: NBC/NBCUniversal/Getty ImagesHe moved to England for a time to find work and hone his acting skills. While there, he appeared in three of director Richard Lester’s films: Petulia (1968), The Three Musketeers (1973) and The Four Musketeers (1974).

The policy attracted 20 mentions in the previous year’s report. The earlier document mentioned three times that the company was seen as a “diversity leader”.The omissions, which were first reported by the Sunday Times, included changes to how the company reports on measuring top executives’ non-financial performance, which contributes to the size of their short-term bonuses. In the new report, the phrasing has switched to “people and culture”.WPP declined to comment on whether the new wording was a response to anti-DEI policy moves by theTrump administration. The company said that, while the phrasing in its annual report had changed, the way in which executives’ short-term bonuses are calculated was unaltered.Within his first few days in office, Donald Trump instructed US government agencies toshut down their DEI programmesand federal employees working in diversity offices were immediately put on paid leave.Trump signed two executive orders targeting DEI programmes within the federal government. The first executive order largelyscrapped the DEI efforts that took place under Joe Biden, who had ordered all federal agencies to come up with equity plans.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But as he pounded the ice after his final pose, the gesture wasn’t pure triumph like last year in Montreal. It was the frustration of a perfectionist falling short of a standard no one else is asking him to meet.“That was definitely because I didn’t land all seven,” the 20-year-old American said afterward. “It’s still the one thing I want to accomplish – whether before the Olympics or sometime in my career – just to land them all and really maximize my technical ability, while also incorporating the rest of the program.”He had come close. Malinin opened with a clean quad flip, then landed the mythical quad Axel – the dangerous four-and-a-half-revolution jumpno other skater in historyhas landed in competition – though it was marked a quarter under-rotated. But midway through the program, his quad Lutz unraveled into a double, leaving his long-sought “perfect layout” just out of reach once again.Unstoppable Malinin repeats as world champion with six quadruple jumpsRead moreYet still, the win was emphatic. Malinin’s 318.56-point total left him 31 clear of silver medallist Mikhail Shaidorov and nearly 40 ahead of Yuma Kagiyama, whose error-strewn skate effectively handed Malinin gold before he’d even taken the ice. The outcome was never in doubt. Only perfection was.Malinin’s technical ceiling is so far above the rest of the field that he can win on difficulty alone, with enough margin for error to withstand all but the most catastrophic mistakes and still dominate. Call him Simone Biles on ice. The only real drama lies in his own ambition.“There wasn’t even a single thought about doing an easier program,” Malinin said. “My main goal was to go for this layout. I really trained at home to make sure everything was effortless, comfortable and consistent. I just wanted to come here and try it – to see what would happen.”The program he attempted included all six recognized quads in addition to the quad Axel, a configuration beyond the reach of his most ambitious rivals. He refers to it now as the “perfect layout”, a goal he’s been chasing for months, even as he’s remained unbeaten since 2023. He first went for itat the Grand Prix finalin December, where he landed seven quads but several were under-rotated. He tried againat the US championshipsin January, falling on one and popping another. Both times, he won easily. Both times, he left unsatisfied.“I think until I land all of them I wouldn’t want to cut back,” he said. “The seven-quad layout is really my ideal layout, and I want to nail this and have it be comfortable, effortless.”After those misses, he returned to his home rink in Reston, Virginia, and drilled the layout relentlessly. Scaling back was never on the table. Even after Kagiyama faltered in Boston and gold felt assured, Malinin didn’t consider dialing back for competitive reasons. That’s just not how he’s wired. “I didn’t really think about anyone else’s scores,” he said. “I just wanted to skate how I wanted to skate. I felt bad for Yuma, honestly – he put in the work. But I had to focus on my own plan.”View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin reacts after his free skate on Saturday night at Boston’s TD Garden.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesThat plan has always been about pushing limits. Since landing the first quad Axel two years ago, Malinin has treated figure skating’s most daunting elements like a checklist. Six quads. Then seven. All while refining his transitions, his musicality, his performance – the artistry that once lagged behind the jumps but now rises alongside them. It seems like it won’t be longbefore aquintupleis on the table.But on Saturday night, it wasn’t the quad Axel that gave him the most satisfaction. It was the quad loop, a jump that had plagued him all season. “That whole season was for that loop,” he said, laughing. “I was ready to throw hands with that loop. Finally landing it gave me more happiness than not having a perfect program. That was the moment that made me smile.”Malinin is, in many ways, inventing challenges for himself. With victory nearly assured, he’s turned the test inward, building obstacles only he can clear. His closest rivals speak of him with a mix of awe and resignation. “I’m starting to think he’s invincible,” Kagiyama said earlier in the week. Even the popular and well-liked American Jason Brown, known for his own exquisite programs, remarked: “What I think is most incredible is I feel he has more in him.”That hunger, though, hasn’t just been physical. “I’m definitely impressed with how I feel on the ice, and how I feel inside,” Malinin said. “My confidence, the way I approach competitions mentally – it’s really changed. Now I’m able to get into that flow state and just be in the game.”He talks often about muscle memory: about trusting the work, surrendering to instinct when the music starts. “I don’t feel like I have to force anything anymore,” he said. “That’s what helped me get through today.”View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin of the United States performs a backflip during his free skate on Saturday night at TD Garden.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesNow with the Olympic season on the horizon and Milano Cortina only 10 months down the road, the spotlight will only grow. After claiming three of the four gold medals on offer at a world championships for the first time ever – Malinin,Alysa Liuand the ice dance team ofMadison Chock and Evan Bates– the United States will head to Milan as clear favorites in the team event.“I’m definitely looking forward to it,” Malinin said. “It’s a different type of energy. When you skate solo, you’re focused just on yourself. But having that team to support you and be there in the moment that’s really special. I think it’ll be fun.”For now, the summer offers a brief reset. Extra brief for Malinin, who is back to work on Wednesday when he flies to skating-mad Japan for an exhibition. “The first half of the summer I’ll spend doing shows and I think that’s really important,” he said. “There’s not the pressure of competition. I can enjoy performing, be more present with the audience, and just have fun out there.”Then the building begins again: new programs, new strategies – and the same goal he’s chased all year. “My focus on the Olympics will really start next season,” he said. “That’s when I’ll look at what I want to do, how the jumps are going, how everything feels. It’ll be a whole gameplan.”Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsWinter Olympics 2026USA Olympic teamfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Paul Goldschmidt, Cody Bellinger, Austin Wells, Anthony Volpe and Jazz Chisholm Jr all homered with the new bat intheir team’s 20-9rout of the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday. The Yankees then hit a home run in each of the first three innings ofSunday’s 12-3 victory over the Brewers, though two of those home runs came via Aaron Judge and Ben Rice, both of whom used traditional bats. Chisholm, who has never hit more than 19 home runs in a season, now has three home runs in his first three games of 2025 with the torpedo bat. The Yankees have hit 13 home runs in their last two games.MLB 2025 predictions: are the dead-cert Dodgers actually maybe-cert?Read more“That’s just trying to be the best we can be,” manager Aaron Boone said before Sunday’s game. “That’s one of the things that’s gotten pointed out. I say to you guys all the time, we’re trying to win on the margins and that shows up in so many different ways.”MLB has relatively uncomplicated bat rules, stating under section 3.02 of its rulebook that: “The bat shall be a smooth, round stick not more than 2.61 inches in diameter at the thickest part and not more than 42 inches in length. The bat shall be one piece of solid wood.” It goes on to state there may be a cupped indentation up to 1.25 inches in depth, two inches wide and with at least a one-inch diameter, and experimental models must be approved byMLB.Former Yankees infielder Kevin Smith posted online Saturday that Aaron Leanhardt, a former Yankees front-office staffer who now works for the Miami Marlins, developed the torpedo barrel to bring more mass to a bat’s sweet spot.“You’re going up with a weapon that can be better,” Smith wrote. “Your just misses could be clips, your clips could be flares, and your flares could [be] barrels. And it was true, it’s fractions of an inch on the barrel differentiating these outcomes.”On Saturday, Goldschmidt, batting leadoff for the first time, opened with a 413ft homer off Nestor Cortes and Bellinger followed with a 451ft drive that initially didn’t register with Statcast. Judge, using a bat with a conventional shape, hit a 468ft shot that made the Yankees the first team to homer on each of a game’s first three pitches since MLB’s records began in 1988.Bellinger was initially presented with the torpedo-shape bat in a practice session last season with the Chicago Cubs but did not use it in a game. He was given a more advanced version during spring training this year with the Yankees.“I started swinging this one in spring or before spring, kind of early on, and I was like, ‘Oh it feels good,’” Bellinger said. “It was an ounce lighter than the one I was swinging, but I think the way the weight was distributed felt really good.”Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP with the Los Angeles Dodgers, switched from a maple Louisville Slugger to a birch bat and cited MLB’s 2010 rule change narrowing the maximum diameter from 2.75 inches.“I’m usually a maple guy, but birch for me allows me to get the bigger barrel because I wasn’t grandfathered in,” Bellinger said. “So it’s all within regulation. They made sure that before the season even started, knowing that I imagine at some point the way these bats look that it’s probably going to get out at some point.”Volpe, who homered for the second straight game on Saturday, began using the torpedo in spring training.“The concept makes so much sense. I know I’m bought in,” Volpe said. “The bigger you can have the barrel where you hit the ball, it makes sense to me.”Judge, who hit an AL-record 62 homers in 2022 and 58 last year en route to his second AL MVP award, didn’t see a reason to experiment with the new bat.“The past couple of seasons kind of speak for itself,” Judge said a day after his third career three-homer game. “Why try to change something?”Milwaukee manager Pat Murphy said he knows a little about developing and designing bat designs from serving on the boards of two bat companies.“Players are doing everything to try to get an edge today legally and I think they should,” Murphy said. “I think whatever is good for the offensive game is good for the game.”Explore more on these topicsNew York YankeesMLBBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He wasn’t the onlyNBAplayer to have an explosion on offense that season –think Joel Embiid or Karl-Anthony Towns. And the league subsequently decided to change officiating to favor more physical play that would presumably cut down on high offensive output.That’s how Tim MacMahon sees it. The veteran ESPN writer has covered Dončić since the Slovenian’s arrival in Dallas as one of the most heralded European talents inNBAhistory. He saw Dončić live up to his billing, leading the Mavericks to the Western Conference finals in 2022 and the NBA finals last year. And he knew that even a change in rules wouldn’t stop Dončić’s stepback three.“I mean, there’s just not a lot of ways you can guard him,” MacMahon says. “If he’s not the best passer in the league, he’s top two or three … He sees the floor as well as maybe anybody who played the game.”MacMahon is the author of a new book on Dončić –The Wonder Boy: Luka Dončić and the Curse of Greatness. It came out on Tuesday, and in case you were wondering, yes, there is a Texas-sized postscript to the story.The Mavs are on fire after the Dončić trade. Don’t expect them to put it outRead moreIn February,the Mavs traded their star– who, according to the book, they had previously invested countless time and effort trying to get to stay in Dallas. Dončić was off to the Los Angeles Lakers, while Anthony Davis went to the Mavs.“Obviously, it was a major plot twist,” MacMahon says.He and his publisher had to scramble. (Insert your comparisons to an NBA team adjusting on the fly to the fast break.) There were 8,000 copies of the book already at the printer. MacMahon did his part, adding a final chapter.Even before the trade, MacMahon says, “a lot of Mavericks fans are upset that the book is being written. It was not blessed by Luka … Certain parts of the book are critical of him.”However, the author says, “One promise I made to Luka via his representatives was that I would not delve into his personal life.”What’s present, by and large, is a portrayal that’s respectful, candid – and lyrical in describing Dončić’s many achievements on the court over five-plus seasons.Dončić came to the Mavs having first drawn their attention while playing as a teenager for the elite Spanish team Real Madrid. He joined a Dallas organization that was as full of unhealthy machinations as Game of Thrones, to use MacMahon’s comparison. Rivalries simmered in the Texas heat between the then-owner, then-GM and then-coach – Mark Cuban, Donnie Nelson and Rick Carlisle, respectively. When the dust settled, only Cuban was left standing in Dallas, with Jason Kidd taking over as coach and Nico Harrison as GM. Eventually, even Cuban’s power waned after selling the team to a group headlined by a Las Vegas casino owner, Patrick Dumont. (The former owner retained a minority ownership stake.) During Dončić’s years in Dallas, the Mavs tried multiple times to find a supporting player who could do the difficult, ego-less job of complementing their star. First it was Kristaps Porziņģis, then Jalen Brunson. After those partnerships failed (for various reasons, discussed in the book), the Mavs added Kyrie Irving, who helped Dallas reach the finals last year.Through it all, Dončić lived up to his promise and then some. The book chronicles those breathtaking moments: an 11-0 individual run in one game against the Houston Rockets that put the league on notice; second-year praise, unprintable but memorable, from LeBron James, after a neat generational moment: James and Dončić became the oldest and youngest NBA players, respectively, to post a 30-10-15 triple-double. All while playing in the shadow of another legendary European star, Dirk Nowitzki.MacMahon calls Dončić “the most talented player in franchise history,” and acknowledges the competition for this honor: “Dirk is the sixth-leading scorer all-time.”The book chronicles how Dončić’s individual game point plateau increased over time: first 50-point nights, then 60, and ultimately 73. Then there’s all the triple-doubles. And don’t get MacMahon started on the intangibles.“Luka is a master at creating space,” the author says. “He’s such a rare blend of power and finesse … He’s impossible to cover for one man. He’s double-teamed so much. If you put another guy [on him], he’ll make the right pass.”Last season, MacMahon says, “he had more minutes than anybody in the league, combined regular season and playoffs, the highest usage rate in the league.” Don’t forget he played more than the NBA season – this loyal son of Slovenia played for his national team in the World Championships before coming to Mavs training camp. (For the book, MacMahon visited Dončić’s basketball-crazy homeland.) In the regular season, he had to compensate when Irving was absent due to a foot injury, while in the playoffs Dončić averaged 30-plus minutes per game despite a knee injury suffered in the first round.“The minutes and miles that are on him, it’s pretty extraordinary,” MacMahon says. “Also, he’s going to see the best defender on the other team … He gets in the paint, takes a lot of shots, initiates a lot of shots, rebounds … It takes a physical toll on his body.”It is a toll, some might say, that has been compounded by conditioning issues. The book addresses this claim, along with another knock – his frequent interactions with referees.“He has two major flaws,” MacMahon says. “Conditioning concerns, and … the occasional lack of focus. He allows his emotions to get the best of him.” Or, as the author puts it, “there are times he’s more focused on the three guys with the whistles than the five guys on the floor trying to stop him.”MacMahon cites diet and conditioning as among the reasons Mavs GM Harrison parted ways with Dončić. The author says he has discussed the trade with 50 executives and scouts.“Many said you cannot trade a generational talent at 25 years old unless the guy puts a gun to your head and wants his way out,” MacMahon says. “Luka was about to buy his forever house in Dallas.”Instead, it was off to Los Angeles, where he became teammates with his now 40-year-old admirer James. Dončić was also reunited with one of his favorite teammates on the Mavs, Dorian Finney-Smith. (Mavs coach JJ Redick was also an ex-teammate.) Old friend Nowitzki showed up to watch his first game.Although Dončić’s star shone bright in the Lone Star State, maybe he’ll be better off in LA, playing on a team with a fellow brilliant star – James.“I was just in LA to see him play,” MacMahon reports of Dončić. “He has the joy back, that smile, a bounce in his step. I don’t know if they’re going to be a championship team now. There’s a small chance.” But, he adds, “he’s got a pretty phenomenal chance to compete for championships long-term with the Lakers.”As for the team that traded him?“This is a really, really catastrophic experience for Mavericks fans,” MacMahon says. “The soul of this fanbase has been trampled on, to be blunt.There’s unbelievable, intense outrage.”The author reflects on Dončić’s five and a half years in Dallas, from his interactions with then-coach Carlisle and then-teammate Porziņģis to Brunson leaving via free agency – and on how Dončić stayed through it all until management traded him.“You go back through this,” MacMahon says. “It’s just amazing how much drama there was, how much dysfunction there was, how much, frankly, mismanagement there was – and how much success they had despite all of it. It goes back to the talent in this kid.”Explore more on these topicsLuka DončićNBADallas MavericksLos Angeles LakersBasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We saw a lot of images [from the game] that were not in our standard, nowhere near. There are minimum requirements that we have to show, respect for your mate, you have to make the effort. And today we did it.“This season we have played more games like the one against Bournemouth, which is why we have not deserved more. The most important thing today was that the players have learned the lesson.“I told them we cannot accept a performance like the one here in the league when people have travelled down for five hours. What we missed this season was heart, soul; the desire from how we’d done it for many, many years. For a manager the most important thing is to recover this passion. After Bournemouth, we started to make incredible mistakes and as a team we didn’t have heart. That’s the most important thing we have to recover at the end of the season and in the future.”Guardiola was asked why the heart had been missing during what has been the toughest season of his nine at City. “I will write it in my memoirs,” he said. “It was many things. Not just one. And put Pep first on the list. I should have taken decisions I didn’t take in the right moment.“I adore to play like today. If Bournemouth go through, congratulations. But I like to lose this way and we didn’t lose many times this way. A few weeks agoat Nottingham Forest[in the 1-0 league defeat], did the team play like today?

The Welsh fighter added the WBC and IBF titles to the WBA crown she already held witha points victory over Natasha Jonas at London’s Royal Albert Hallon 7 March.Saturday’s WBO title bout was a rematch after Mayer took the crown from Ryan in New York in September 2024. That contest was ramped up when Derby’s Ryan was splashed with red paint outside her hotel in what she called a “hit and run” attack.Before the rematch, Mayer denied any involvement in the incident. “Everyone who knows me, knows that would be out of character for me – it’s not my style,” the 34-year-oldtold BBC Sport. “You can’t just point a finger when there is no evidence leading back to me.”View image in fullscreenMikaela Mayer has fought in the UK four times and could take on Lauren Price in Cardiff.Photograph: Steve Marcus/Getty ImagesAfter an even start in Vegas, Mayer landed a number of hard shots to take charge of the fight.

But then the next three days have been about preparing for this match and the team have been very professional.”From the outset this game was a huge ask for Crystal Palace, who continue to prop up the WSL table. Leif Smerud, the manager, seemed to relish their role as underdogs but, having paid a visit to the Emirates Stadium, the Norwegian will have been aware of the challenges ahead.With this result, Arsenal returned to second in the league with their attacking flair and afterChelsea’s draw against West Ham, the gap at the top was cut down to six points. Before kick-off, Arsenal had scored 25 goals in 2025, seven more than any other side in the division. Their manager opted for three changes from Wednesday. Mead and Lia Wälti returned, and the USA international Jenna Nighswonger received her first league start with Katie McCabe missing through suspension.Smerud also made three changes, opting for experience as he tried to shore up the Eagles’ defensive capabilities. Chloe Arthur returned to the heart of midfield, Molly-Mae Sharpe took up her usual role up front while Hayley Nolan came into the backline.Spring was in the air in Sutton with a crowd of 2,885 present. The visitors dominated in front of their buoyant travelling contingent.

In the past, Arsenal have struggled to break down such an opposition but an early goal was the antidote for any potential heightened nerves.The breakthrough came in the 14th minute, starting in a sweeping move with Chloe Kelly breaking at pace. Beating Swaby, she cut the ball back with an expert delivery to find the run of Mead in the box: the England international opened her body to strike the ball with her left foot, her sublime volley marking her 50th league goal in an Arsenal shirt.The hosts had several opportunities on the transition after the opener – Ashleigh Weerden saw an effort deflected and Katie Stengel sent a curling shot over the bar – but they struggled to really trouble Daphne van Domselaar.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Mariona Caldentey has been a revelation as a deep midfielder in recent matches and her energy forced an error by My Cato. The ball ran into the path of Russo and the striker sent a shot home for her 11th of the season.The second half continued in much the same vein. Palace defended valiantly at times but did little to affect the outcome as Arsenal remained in command.

While Bob Marley singing “everything’s gonna be alright” reverberated around the stadium trying to inject some optimism, Smerud remained level-headed. “We’ll have to keep believing which is really important,” he said. “And we have to keep developing, which is even more important. We can control some things but not others. Of course, we’re going to need to do our bit. We tried today and couldn’t but we have a few more chances.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueCrystal Palace WomenArsenal WomenWomen's footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Poundbakery doesn’t do butter pie, but try Greenhalgh’s on the corner. Greenhalgh’s: closed on Sundays. The chip shop on Market Street does meat pie, meat and potato, steak, steak and kidney, chicken and mushroom, cheese and onion. Butter pie? A shake of the head.You’ve got to try the butter pie. That’s what everyone says the first time you visit Preston. It was created in industrial times, for the largely Catholic working population to eat on Fridays when meat was forbidden. Often you hear it described as a “delicacy”, but even this is to overstate its intensely yeoman nature. It’s layers of potatoes, onions and butter in a pie. It’s cheap. It’s hearty. It’s unpretentious. It exists to be consumed and then immediately forgotten. It is – with deepest apologies – the very embodiment ofPreston North Endin comestible form.Marcus Rashford ends drought as Aston Villa sink Preston to reach semi-finalsRead moreAre Preston really the most boring club in the Football League, as a fan group dubbed them earlier this season? Let’s examine the evidence. Nine consecutive seasons of mid-table finishes: tick. Drawn 45% of their league games this season: tick. Sponsored by a local rubber company: tick. Managed by Paul Heckingbottom: tick. Signature snack entirely comprising yellow and beige foodstuffs: tick.What Preston do better than anyone else is nostalgia. The world’s oldest continually used football stadium. The record win in English football. The first winners of the Double. The first Invincibles. Bill Shankly, Tom Finney, Alan Kelly, David Moyes. The same old facts, the same old tales, regurgitated ad infinitum. And in this context, reaching an FA Cup quarter-final againstAston Villaranks as comfortably the most interesting thing to have happened to Preston in years.Of course it should be patently obvious to everyone that Preston are not actually going to win this quarter-final and get to Wembley. That would be too interesting by far. What happens instead is that Heckingbottom sends a depleted Preston out in a cagey spoiling formation, Villa are frustrated for almost an hour and then score three goals with the minimum of fuss.View image in fullscreenPaul Heckingbottom seems the ideal manager for Preston.Photograph: Dave Howarth/CameraSport/Getty ImagesThe first 20 minutes essentially consist of players trying to pop balloons with their studs. Marcus Rashford keeps trying to score from free-kicks. Marco Asensio keeps trying to score from corners. Preston sit in a kind of rugged 5‑1‑4‑0. Then, after being frustrated for almost an hour, Preston submit without ever quite subsiding. Rashford pillages a couple. Jacob Ramsey makes sure.Briefly an embarrassing rout is on the cards. But of course this too would also be unsustainably interesting. Not for nothing are Preston one of only two teams in the top four divisions to have neither scored nor conceded more than three goals in the league this season. (Sheffield United, another Heckingbottom masterpiece, are the other.) Stuffed with competent but never spectacular players, they carry on running and fighting without ever remotely threatening.Ollie Watkins misses an elementary chance. The Villa fans toss a giant inflatable penis around the Bill Shankly Stand. Coming soon for them: Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Next for Preston: Derby in midweek, and the eight games that will define whether they finish in the top half, drop into the bottom six, or – and here’s the smart money – finish about where they are.The temptation here is to chide Preston for their apparent lack of ambition, their allergy to jeopardy, their refusal to spend stupid money, or go into administration for the bantz, or take their long-suffering fans on “a journey”, or appoint some 34-year-old Basque with a soul patch to impose a whole new footballing identity.

Preston will not provide an American hedge fund with an inflation-busting return on investment. They will not generate Hollywood content or Wembley showpieces. They are neither good nor bad. But they provide thousands of people with a ritual and routine. It’s cheap, it’s hearty, it’s local and it’s real. Will the market allow something this radical to survive?Finally, after hours of fruitless trekking, in a chip shop just off Friargate, amid a forest of bubble tea emporia and fried chicken joints, a butter pie is located, ordered and proffered. It costs £2.90. The pastry gives way just a little too easily. The filling oozes without conviction. It looks beige, smells beige and tastes beige. It is neither good nor bad.

The 27-year-old has improved at Aston Villa after ­leaving behind his home town malaise but everyone has been waiting until now for him to deliver goals to remind everyone of his key purpose on a pitch, these his firstsince 1 December.‘Great feeling’: Rashford delight after double sends Aston Villa to WembleyRead moreUnai Emery has worked hard to rebuild Rashford after the forward failed to impress Ruben Amorim with his attitude in United training. The change of scenery has ­seemingly helped Rashford, who played twice for Thomas Tuchel’s England in the international break, and he is finally back doing what he can do: making a difference in big matches. It might have been only a win over a ­Championship side but there was still plenty of pressure on Rashford, as the central striker, to lead his side to victory.If the thought of facing ­Champions League opponents was not ­daunting enough, Preston were without a number of key players, making the task ahead of Rashford and co somewhat easier. The ­goalkeeper David Cornell was called upon to make only his seventh appearance in two and a half years at the club after Freddie Woodman was ruled out for the season, while there were five teenagers on the bench with a grand total of four minutes of first-team action between them.Everything was done to ignite the atmosphere beforehand, not that choreography was required for ­arguably the club’s biggest match in two decades. A banner was passed along the Sir Tom Finney Stand, flags were placed on every seat and “PNE” was displayed in enormous letters behind one goal, while balloons blew across the pitch to underline the party vibe.Preston’s fans were eager for ­history and optimistically thought they merited a penalty in the second minute when Will Keane collided with Youri ­Tielemans in the box. The referee, Chris Kavanagh, was not interested but it helped Lancastrian vocal cords to strain for new limits.View image in fullscreenJacob Ramsey makes victory safe with the third goal.Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty ImagesPaul Heckingbottom set up his side to contain Villa to the best of their abilities, limiting the areas for ­midfielders to work in and offering little space in behind for Rashford to utilise. There was an infrequent desire to counter from the hosts as they lacked pace but it felt as if a set piece was their most likely threat in the circumstances, with Emil Riis possessing an ­Olympic long throw and Robbie Brady ­dangerous with a dead ball.Villa were the more aggressive team in the final third but, despite enjoying 72% possession, caused ­Cornell fewer problems in the ­opening half than the inflatables did. It was a Brady cross that brought hope to his hardworking teammates, as Emiliano Martínez failed to deal with it, allowing Mads Frøkjær to nod towards Stefán Thórdarson in space eight yards from goal. But the Icelander could not stretch his neck enough to get a header on target and that was the closest Preston came to scoring. They are a hard team to beat, drawing 17 of their 38 Championship games but they lack potency, and with a depleted squad the task of downing an elite team was nigh-on impossible.Rashford should have ended Preston’s resistance when he went through on goal but could not get the ball out of his feet, allowing Cornell to stop him in his tracks. Maybe a more confident Rashford would have taken the chance and the Preston jeers would not have helped him.Rashford soon had his first Villa goal though – his first since scoring twice for Manchester United against Everton – to relieve his personal ­tension. Lucas Digne had free rein down the left; receiving the ball on the edge of the box without a marker in sight, he squared for Rashford, who caressed his shot into the largely unguarded net.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was ­Rogers who helped out his ­international colleague when he went down after an Andrew Hughes ­challenge in the box, allowing ­Rashford to send ­Cornell the wrong way and finish the tie as a contest.“I felt that five-minute period took the game from us,” ­Heckingbottom said. “Bang-bang and the game’s gone. I can’t say I am not ­disappointed but I am proud with everyone ­connected with the club today.”Preston were wilting in cool ­Deepdale sunshine and Jacob ­Ramsey made the most of the ­tiredness, ­darting through the middle before firing into the bottom corner from the edge of the box. Any hope of a Preston ­comeback was extinguished and all the noise came from the packed away end as they mentally planned their trip to Wembley, where they will face Crystal Palace in the semis.Explore more on these topicsFA CupPreston North EndAston VillaMarcus Rashfordmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Evans has failed to mount a promotion charge in the third tier, with the team dropping to 16th place, nine points above the relegation zone.Saturday’s heavy defeat to relegation-threatened opponents at the New York Stadium proved to be the last straw, with the Brighton loanee Kamari Doyle striking twice before late goals from Gavan Holohan and Panutche Camará. It was Rotherham’s 17th league defeat of the season, and extended a run of one point in four matches.“There’s no hiding place when you have a performance like that,” Evans told BBC Radio Sheffield after the game, which saw some home fans call for his departure.“I think this is as low as it’s been in 31 years as a manager,” Evans continued. “Maybe my credit’s run out. I’ve had fantastic times at this club and, if the decision is made to remove me, I’ll be back in the future as a fan.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fabio Di Giannantonio of VR46 Racing tried to catch up to Álex but ran out of laps as he finished third to give Ducati another clean sweep of the podium.“I’m super happy, I’m already without (my) voice, I screamed out loud,” Bagnaia said after he had a celebratory hotdog in the paddock. “What a fantastic feeling, to be back on the top step of the podium after such a difficult period.”Even before the race began, there was chaos when the sun briefly came out and riders who had opted for wet tyres sprinted back to the pits to swap their bikes, opting for slicks on a drying track, leading to a red flag. When the 19-lap race got under way, Marc Márquez had a perfect launch off the line and established a lead of over a second by the end of the opening lap. Bagnaia had been finishing behind the Márquez brothers in previous races and sprints, and the Italian was determined to finish higher, using Álex’s slipstream to overtake the Gresini rider and take second place on lap four.Marc looked to be in cruise control as he set a race lap record but the Spaniard suddenly slid off the track on lap nine. Bagnaia grabbed the opportunity to close the gap to his teammate in the championship, extending his lead over Alex as the race wore on. Marc attempted to ride on without a foot peg and a screen but less than five laps later, he gave up and nursed his bike back into the pits to retire.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’re a very ambitious team, we want to try and get as far as we can in all competitions and push to get back into the top four.”The 27-year-old helped his parent club to win theFA Cuplast season but has struggled for form over a lengthy period. Rashford has shown steady improvement under Unai Emery and earned an England recall from Thomas Tuchel in the international break after a year without a cap.Emery said of his loan star: “Firstly, his commitment to work, to adapt quickly is very important and he’s doing it. And then, to feel comfortable playing in his best level, [he needs to] work, still training weeks to get it.

It was third time lucky for the 22-year-old, who won bronze at the event in 2021 and silver in 2023.“I feel amazing, I’m world champion,” Atkin said. “I’m going to go celebrate, I’m going to eat all the Swiss chocolate I have in my bedroom. I’m going to have a drink out on the patio. I’m just so excited.”Atkin fell at the end of her first run, which landed her in ninth place, and she was well behind China’s Li Fanghui, who took the early lead with a score of 90.25 points. But Atkin rebuffed the disappointment and her phenomenal second and final attempt, which contained the highest altitude of the day, landed her a 93.50.Fear and Gibson claim emotional bronze to end Britain’s 31-year medal droughtRead moreThe score was surely going to be enough to put her on the podium but Atkin was made to wait to see what colour medal she would be taking home. The fight for gold came down to the Briton and Li, the two top skiers this season. Li, also 22, fell agonisingly short, receiving a 93.00 to finish 0.5 behind Atkin. Canada’s Cassie Sharpe took bronze with a score of 88.00.“I was so nervous going into my second run,” Atkin said. “So to be able to put it down when the pressure was on felt so good, and to come back after I got third at my first world championship and second at my second championship, it just feels so good.“This season I was like: ‘You know what? I want to go for the gold.’ So I put a lot of work in this season to try my new trick in there.”Earlier this month Atkin and Li shared the overall freeski halfpipe World Cup after both claimed one win, two second-place finishes and a fifth place during the season.

Kon Knueppel, another potential lottery pick, led the Blue Devils with 21 points.But the most important stat: Alabama’s nation-leading offense, one coming off a record-setting night from three in the Sweet 16, failed to crack 70 points for only the second time this season.The Crimson Tide’s 35.4% shooting from the floor was their worst all season and their 25% from behind the arc (8 for 32) matched their fourth-worst showing of 2024-25.Mark Sears, who came one short of a tournament record with 10 threes two nights earlier, finished with one and only six points against the Blue Devils (35-3), who won their 15th straight.At the Final Four in San Antonio, top-seeded Duke will play the winner of Sunday’s game between Houston and Tennessee. Their win erased any chance of an all-Southeastern Conference show at the Final Four, but with No 1 Florida winning earlier, they kept alive the prospect of all four top seeds playing on the sport’s biggest stage for only the second time.Khaman Maluach scored 14 points on 6-of-7 shooting and Duke shot 53.6% despite its best player’s rough night.Flagg was hardly bad in this one. He had nine rebounds, three assists and one mega-block that sent Mouhammed Dioubate’s floater flying over press row.But in a game in which both teams were focused on taking away the other’s best player, it was Duke that did it more effectively, switching off on Sears, locking down the perimeter and never letting him find breathing room.The fifth-year senior’s first bucket of any kind came nearly 18 minutes into the game and the shot was a 16-footer from the elbow – the exact kind of midrange shot Nate Oats’ team of dunkers and three-point specialists avoids.Sears’ first three came with 16:19 left in the game. His final line: 2 for 12 from the floor, 1 for 5 from three. He also had six assists. Labaron Philon led the second-seeded Crimson Tide (28-9) with 16 points. Not a single Alabama player made more shots than he missed.Duke coach Jon Scheyer, leading the program to the Final Four for the first time since his predecessor Mike Krzyzewski’s last season in 2022, has up to six NBA prospects on his roster.They all chipped in on offense – Tyrese Proctor had 17 points – and even moreso on defense, where Alabama looked nothing like the team that set tournament records for makes and attempts by going 25 for 51 from 3 against BYU.The only other Final Four to feature all No 1 seeds was in 2008 when Kansas, Memphis, UCLA and North Carolina made it. The site: San Antonio.It wasn’t a totally lost night for Tide fans. Shortly before tipoff, the Alabama women’s wheelchair hoops team beat Texas-Arlington 67-52 for their fifth straight national championship.Florida 84, Texas Tech 79Coach Todd Golden cut the final strand of the net, waved it to the crowd and performed the famed Gator Chomp.A celebration that seemed completely improbable just a few minutes earlier was in high gear. Florida are heading back to the Final Four.Walter Clayton Jr rescued top-seeded Florida with two late thre-pointers, and the Gators rallied from nine points down late to beat Texas Tech 84-79 in the NCAA Tournament’s West Region final on Saturday.“It goes to show how together we all are,” Clayton said. “Many times could easily just break, start pointing the finger, blaming each other for this and that. But we just stayed together through the end and stayed the course. And thankfully we got it done today.”The Gators (34-4) trailed 75-66 with less than three minutes to play before staging a furious rally against the third-seeded Red Raiders (28-9), who had done the same in the Sweet 16 against Arkansas.Clayton dribbled out of the paint and hit a fadeaway three with 59 seconds left to give Florida a 78-77 lead, and the Gators held on from there to advance to their first Final Four since 2014 in Golden’s third season. Florida will face the South Region champion – either Auburn or Michigan State – next Saturday in San Antonio.“There’s not another player in America you would rather have right now than Walter Clayton with the ball in his hands in a big-time moment,” Golden said. “The biggest thing in those moments is you need to have somebody that wants to take those shots. They’re obviously difficult plays, but someone that has the confidence to step up and make incredible individual plays. Walter did that for us tonight.”The comeback provided a happy ending to Golden’s return to the Bay Area, where he played in college at Saint Mary’s and got his start as a head coach at San Francisco.As the final horn sounded, Golden turned to the Gators fans and demonstrably pumped his fist as his players rushed out to the court to celebrate.“It’s crazy,” forward Thomas Haugh said. “I feel like I’m dreaming. I was watching the round of 64 in the eighth grade sneaking my phone into science class watching it. Now to say I’m playing in the Final Four is wild. It’s wild.”Clayton, who began his college career at Iona, scored 30 points to lead the Gators. Thomas Haugh added 20 points and 11 rebounds off the bench, including the two 3-pointers that started the comeback.Clayton then tied it with his shot from long range after Texas Tech missed a second straight front end of a one-and-one as Golden called for the Gators to foul early to prolong the game.“It was a calculated decision we had to make at that point where we needed to get more possessions in the game and it worked out well for us,” Golden said.After Darrius Williams scored down low for Texas Tech, Clayton’s last three put Florida ahead to stay, and the Gators sealed it at the foul line.Williams missed two threes late. He had sank the game-tying basket late in regulation and game-winner in the closing seconds of overtime against Arkansas on Thursday night.“I wish I could change a few plays that happened,” Williams said. “But can’t go back and do that. I thought we could win until it hit zero.”Texas Tech fell just short of their second Final Four trip ever after being on the wrong side of a late-game comeback. The Red Raiders rallied from 13 points in the final five minutes to beat the Razorbacks in the Sweet 16.Williams scored 23 points to lead Texas Tech and JT Toppin added 20.Explore more on these topicsNCAA Tournament 2025NCAA TournamentCollege basketballCollege sportsUS sportsShareReuse this content"

On Saturday night, in front of a roaring crowd at TD Garden, Ilia Malinin made it official: he is once again the best figure skater in the world.The 20-year-old American conjured another sensational free skate to close out the world figure skating championships, landing a record-tying six quadruple jumps in strolling to his second straight world title. His season-best total score of 318.56 landed him a yawning 31.09 points clear of Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov, who captured silver with a personal-best routine, and Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama, who dropped from second place to the bronze after an error-strewn long program.Quick GuideWorld Figure Skating Championships 2025ShowScheduleAll times EST.Wed 26 Mar• Women's Short, 12.05pm (Peacock)• Women's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Remembrance Ceremony, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Short, 6.45pm (Peacock)Thu 27 Mar• Men's Short, 11.05am (Peacock)• Men's Short, 3pm (USA Network)• Pairs' Free, 6.15pm (Peacock)• Pairs' Free, 8pm (USA Network)Fri 28 Mar• Rhythm Dance, 11.15am (Peacock)• Rhythm Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Women's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Women's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sat 29 Mar• Free Dance, 1.30pm (Peacock)• Free Dance, 3pm (USA Network)• Men's Free, 6pm (Peacock)• Men's Free, 8pm (NBC/Peacock)Sun 30 Mar• Exhibition Gala, 2pm (Peacock)How to watch outside the USUnited KingdomAs of last year, Premier Sports holds the broadcasting rights for the World Figure Skating Championships in the UK, with coverage extending until 2028.

He joinednewly crowned women’s champion Alysa Liuandice dance winners Madison Chock and Evan Batesatop the podium – a dominant showing that sends a clear message heading into next year’s Winter Olympics in Milan.Simone Biles on ice: Ilia Malinin shows his only rival is perfection itself | Bryan Armen GrahamRead moreSkating last to I’m Not a Vampire by the American post-metalcore band Falling in Reverse, Malinin opened with a quadruple flip before landing the mythical quad Axel – the four-and-a-half-revolution jump that has proven beyond the reach of the sport’s most ambitious talents. From there, he added a quad loop, quad Lutz, quad toe and quad Salchow, the latter two in combination. Only a popped Lutz midway through the program kept him from attempting all seven quads.The quad Axel beenlanded only 15 times in competitionafter Saturday, all of them by the northern Virginia native, since he firstpulled it off at the US Classictwo years ago when he was 17.Malinin punctuated the programs with a seemingly effortless backflip – he and fourth-place finisher Adam Siao Him Fa of France became the first skaters to land the recently legalized move at a world championships in nearly 50 years – before striking his finishing pose to a standing ovation from another sellout crowd at the home of the NHL’s Boston Bruins.“I just fought for every element and I’m happy that I got this,” Malinin said.The performance extended Malinin’s win streak to nine consecutive events dating back to December 2023. His margin of victory was the second-largest in men’s history under the modern scoring system, trailing only Nathan Chen’s 47.63-point blowout in 2018. Barring injury, it’s difficult to envision a timeline where Malinin won’t be the overwhelming favorite for Olympic gold 10 months from now in Milan.View image in fullscreenIlia Malinin of the United States competes in Saturday night’s free skate.Photograph: Joosep Martinson/International Skating Union/Getty ImagesOf the six quads Malinin landed on Saturday, none made him happier than the loop – a jump that had given him fits all season. “I feel very relieved that I was able to put out that performance the way I tried,” he said. “It wasn’t what I planned to and of course there’s a few minor things that I can keep improving but overall I feel pretty confident and I’m really happy for landing the quad loop finally this season.”Malinin, the son of former Olympians from Uzbekistan who relocated to Virginia, was controversially left off the US Olympic team in 2022 despite finishing second at nationals. Since landing the first quad Axel in competition later that year, he has redefined the technical ceiling of the sport – and continues to raise it.Behind him, Shaidorov delivered a personal-best free skate with four clean quads, including a triple Axel-Euler-quad Salchow combination, to his Moonlight Sonata-Take On Me mashup to earn Kazakhstan’s first world medal in any figure skating discipline. The 20-year-old from Almaty, who also won Four Continents in February, surged past Kagiyama after the Japanese star struggled to stay upright through his jumps.“If someone had asked me at the beginning of the season that I would be on the world podium, I never would have believed it,” Shaidorov said. “The season was difficult but at the same time it was a breakthrough, and I’m just crazily happy to be on a world podium with such great skaters as Ilia and Yuma, and now I just want to keep moving forward.”View image in fullscreenSilver medalist Mikhail Shaidorov of Kazakhstan, left, gold medalist Ilia Malinin of the United States, center, and bronze medalist Yuma Kagiyama of Japan pose for a photo after Saturday’s competition.Photograph: Maddie Meyer/Getty ImagesKagiyama, the reigning Olympic silver medalist and three-time world silver medalist, entered the free skate just 3.32 points behind Malinin. But falls on his Salchow and a step-out on the triple Axel during his Flamenco routine to Ameksa and Romanza derailed any shot at gold. His score of 278.19 was enough for bronze, his fourth major international medal.France’s Kevin Aymoz (272.52) and world championship debutant Shun Sato of Japan (270.56) came in fifth and sixth, respectively. Among the other Americans, Jason Brown delivered a clean, expressive program that earned him eighth place and a standing ovation. Andrew Torgashev finished 22nd after a difficult free skate, but together they ensured Team USA will send the maximum three men to the 2026 Olympics.For all the excitement surrounding Saturday’s final segment of the championships, a current of grief ran beneath the competition all week. On Wednesday night, TD Gardenpaused for a 20-minute tributeto the 28 members of the skating community who died in January’s plane crash near Washington DC. Many of the victims – young skaters, coaches, and parents – were returning from a national development camp. Among them were several who trained at Malinin’s home rink in Virginia.“They’re always in my heart,” he said earlier this week. “I wanted to skate for them. I hope I made them proud.”Earlier Saturday, Madison Chock and Evan Bates became the first ice dancers to win three consecutive world championships in nearly three decades, holding off longtime Canadian frenemies Piper Gilles and Paul Poirier. Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson took the bronze, becoming the first Britons to win a medal at worlds in any discipline since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won the last of their four consecutive ice dance titles in 1984.Explore more on these topicsFigure skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now it’s reaching the youngest among us, and parents and teachers are grappling with the most responsible way to introduce their under-13s to a new technology that may fundamentally reshape the future. Though the terms of service for ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini and other AI models specify that the tools are only meant for those over 13, parents and teachers are taking the matter of AI education into their own hands.Inspired by astory we published on parents who are teaching their children to use AIto set them up for success in school and at work, we asked Guardian readers how and why – or why not – others are doing the same. Though our original story only concerned parents, we have also included teachers in the responses published below, as preparing children for future studies and jobs is one of educators’ responsibilities as well.Some parents and teachers told us they are going full steam ahead, integrating ChatGPT into everyday interactions with their children to explain new concepts, answer incessant questions and illustrate fanciful tales. Others, wary ofthe dangers AI can pose to young people, are demonstrating it only a little at a time in closely supervised settings.Still other parents and teachers are refraining from showing their children and students how to use AI at all, concerned about harms and the impossibility of ethical use of a technology stillrife with unresolved copyright questions. We felt their responses made valuable contributions to the discussion, too.The answers below have been edited for length and clarity.‘I want him to be prepared’: why parents are teaching their gen Alpha kids to use AIRead moreThe parents explaining the world with AI’s helpI swear, watching my kids discover AI has been one of those unexpected parenting joys nobody tells you about. Remember when we all used to say, ‘Let’s Google it’? Well, my nine-year-old has completely ditched that phrase. Now it’s always ‘Daddy, can we ChatGPT it?’ whenever he’s stuck on homework. The best part? He’s learning to ask for hints instead of answers – figuring things out himself but with a little AI nudge.Then there’s my six-year-old – this kid’s questions could outlast anyone’s patience! You know those evenings when your brain is completely fried but they’re still going strong? That’s when our AI buddy steps in. He will chat away for half an hour, bouncing from dinosaurs to space to ‘why is water wet?’ while I secretly recharge my mental batteries.My daughter is only three but already thinks she’s royalty. Instead of reading the same princess books for the millionth time, we now create stories where SHE’S the princess having these wild adventures.–Matt, consultant, 44, Palm Beach Gardens, FloridaI use AI as a kind of intellectual backstop when I’m having a conversation with my children and I can’t answer one of their questions. We have AI voice assistants at home and in the car so this has recently involved asking Alexa for the population of China and examples of how you can use the word ‘credential’ for homework. It fast forwards the conversation and keeps the learning flowing. My children are aware that AI can hallucinate, however, so you need to sense check responses. Alexa recently came up with some incorrect answers about the book Ann of Green Gables, which my eight year old challenged!–Graham, writer, Lamberhurst QuarterI use AI tools with my three-year-old to help explore the world. We use apps to identify birdsongs and plants on our daily walks, and ChatGPT to answer questions he has about the world (“what are bones for? Where did my bones come from?”) especially when we get new books from the library on something he hasn’t learned much about yet. I want him to feel comfortable turning to AI to augment his curiosity. At the same time, we minimize all passive play, including screen time.For now, I try to make time for us to tell stories to each other and do imaginative play for the topics he asks AI about, so he has a chance to do some generative engagement.AI is a daily part of our routine, but it’s not a particularly high priority.–Nate, data scientist, East Bay, California.I am currently introducing OpenAI’s ChatGPT to my oldest daughter, describing it as a creative helper that can be both friend or foe and teaching her basic prompts to make an AI work and benefit you. I show her my daily usage of AI in my working area, creating mails for me, optimising event planning, structuring data. I am teaching her that you have to be always sceptical when using AI and should not start to rely completely on its answers, which in fact can be wrong.–Ben, 47, entrepreneur, GermanyMy son understands Italian (my language) but speaks back in Dutch. My Dutch is very poor. I am occasionally making use of ChatGPT voice interaction tool to translate more complicated things from Italian/English into Dutch – with the upside that the output can be tailored to a six-year-old.–Name withheld, NetherlandsTo introduce them to AI, we logged into ChatGPT and generated images based on their prompts. While their understanding is still very limited, they are beginning to grasp the idea that you can create fake images and videos online.We then worked together to create a story, which we gave to ChatGPT to generate a screenplay of a news report. Taking this a step further, we used NotebookLM to convert it into a podcast, which I played through our car stereo. The podcast was formatted as a legitimate-sounding news report, but the story itself was absurd – our Shetland pony turning into a unicorn and teaming up with a toy gibbon to fight evil sheep in Co Kerry.After listening, I asked them whether we should believe the news report. We then searched online for evidence of the story and, unsurprisingly, found nothing. This helped illustrate the importance of verifying information, even when it sounds official. I have no idea how much of this lesson will stick, but it’s an ongoing conversation.My five-year-old, in particular, is starting to grasp that AI can generate fake content, and my hope is that this awareness will help him recognise or at least question misleading material in the future.–David, software developer, IrelandFor pupils struggling with writing, I encourage them to ask AI for feedback at a sentence level, requesting information about why sentences don’t parse, together with grammatical explanations.I encourage them not to use AI to produce whole essays because that’s not how they will learn. Some still ignore this advice, of course!–Jenny, English and drama teacher, Valencia, SpainI have a girl, six and a boy, 11. Both access chatGPT via myself. They know if dad does not know something they may insist he asks chatGPT. And I often do, while curating the response. The boy may also access it himself, most often to ask some questions about the world around.I want kids to understand that LLMs are a tool to be used to achieve our goals. We also talked about kids who do homework with AI. I explained that we humans, also have computers in our heads which have to be trained in order for us to be successful and own tools of our success.–Anton, fintech director, GenevaI have been frequently rendered speechless over these past two years by all the changes introduced in my profession by AI. I have an 11-yo and I am staunchly trying to ensure that the first (and possibly only) intelligence she uses must be her own; she is aware of the existence of ChatGPT, AI translation engines and the like, but does not use them for schoolwork or any other writing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Would they ask their teacher to write them an essay? No. Would they ask their teacher how to improve their essay? Yes.At the same time, I remind students that AI is inaccurate. It will lie and provide false information. They will need to exercise their critical thinking and fact-checking skills. While we do have guidelines in place to cite AI use, I tell my students they should never cite AI, similar to my guidelines around Wikipedia.–Adam, secondary English teacher, Vancouver, BC, CanadaWhenever I have used AI in the classroom it has been to spark children’s imaginations, rather than replace them. Adobe Firefly is great for encouraging descriptive writing in English, I simply type in children’s noun-phrases or lists of adjectives and AI creates an image based on the description. We can then adjust our vocabulary and take great delight in how AI interprets it quite literally. This is also a really important lesson as children can see first hand that AI has its flaws.I have also used character.AI to bring historical characters to life to generate quotations and responses for children, based on their questions.The children always ask for the website address so they can have a go at home, but I have not shared these directly. I advise the children that sometimes AI can appear so human, that children can become confused and start believing that the voice that answers is real. So AI tools and websites should always be used with an adult who can remind them and keep them safe online.–Angie, primary teacher, Tunbridge WellsI have chosen to introduce AI in generative ways – making clear that this is a tool, and it should be used. You need to know how to yield a hammer before you can use it; similarly, I see AI in the same way. Students more or less see it the same. Their teachers often don’t. I predominantly teach Māori and Pasifika students, and although they are often – and rightfully! – annoyed that their culture is sometimes misunderstood by these AI models, the technology is so inherently compelling that students take to it faster than their teachers.I have done simple things like, for example, during a speech unit, having students use it to generate a speech on a random topic, from a list of random unfamiliar topics, to get them up and talking.–Adam, 28, high school teacher, Christchurch, New ZealandThe parents using AI to help with homeworkMy 11-yo son uses it to help with homework and studying. He needs to get ideas and then reformulate the answer in his own words, so it’s not a copy and paste job.–Joanna, housewife and carer, BathI started introducing AI to my first born who is in secondary school while doing his school homework.My approach has been to show him how AI, particularly ChatGPT, can help to understand better concepts and encourage responsible use. The reason is because as ardent user of technology l believe the earlier he gets to know it will make him better since the AI revolution is here to stay–Richard, university lecturer, UgandaThe parents who are not introducing AI to their childrenMy five-year-old son barely even knows the internet exists. Computers are for video calls, games, movies, and reading the day’s temperature off the Met Office website. He definitely doesn’t need to know anything about LLMs at this stage and certainly shouldn’t use them. He needs to learn how to write his own words and draw his own pictures, not use machines for plagiarising and stunting his imagination. If LLMs come up, I would strongly encourage my son not to use them.They are built on the backs of labour and art from writers and artists who have not licensed their work for this purpose. They are plagiarism machines. They can’t create anything new.I would tell him to be suspicious of any machine wanting to write words for him, which is tantamount to thinking his thoughts for him. Young children deserve opportunities to develop their critical thinking skills and imaginations.–Name withheld, higher education administrator, OxfordI am not introducing it to mine – 10 yrs old and eight. They are extremely sophisticated readers but not great writers. One has ADHD and is always attracted to distraction and short cuts, ie, instinctively avoids hard work.–Name withheld, writer, LondonExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ChildrenParents and parentingFamilyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As part of the agreement, each model would be able book her twin on shoots for other brands – meaning they could, in image anyway, be in two places at the same time. Speaking to The Business of Fashion, Gvarliani described her replica as “like me, without the jet-lag”. Images of AI and human, side by side, look scarily lifelike.The news has been greeted with dismay by the wider industry, which fears this could be the start of a shift. It mirrors the concerns of Hollywood workers whowent on strike in 2023over the use of AI in film and TV. This is not the first time a major fashion company has explored AI models –Levisand Hugo Boss have also experimented with the technology.Bectu, the union that represents the creative industries, explained the concerns. “Even if models are compensated for the use of their image, it is hard to see how using technology will not have a significant detriment to other fashion creatives and industry workers, from make-up and hair, to rigging and lights,” said the head of the union, Philippa Childs. A survey found that 54% of Bectu workers believed AI would have a negative impact on the fashion industry.Those advocating for models have also raised concerns. Sara Ziff, the founder of Model Alliance, says: “There are a lot of open questions, and one of them is about compensation. What does fair compensation for a digital twin look like?” H&M has said each model would be paid when their twin was used, with the fee negotiated with their agency.In 2020, the model and founder of technology education company WAYE, Sinead Bovell, wrote an article in Vogue titled‘I Am a Model and I Know That Artificial Intelligence Will Eventually Take My Job’. She raises the issue of the lack of regulation. “If a model gives their consent to use their likeness somewhere, it can enhance the actual AI model, the data centre that the company uses, which could accelerate automation,” she says. “There’s all these nuanced ways that models may get even more exploited.”Guard rails are being built. The Model Alliance’sFashion Workers’ Actcomes into law in June – a piece of legislation which requires consent from models for AI usage, when working with agencies based in the state. “It couldn’t be more timely,” says Ziff. “With H&M’s announcement, it gives a lot of other industry players licence to move forward in a way that could be very reckless and damaging.”In addition to this, the AI Actwill be introduced in the EU in 2026, requiring AI images to be labelled as such (H&M said it would use a watermark on images featuring AI).Ziff is clear that she is not “anti-tech” and there are big players in fashion who have embraced advances in technology.The former Harpers Bazaar editor Lucy Yeomans founded Drest in 2019, a game that allows players to dress up avatars in designer brands. However, the use of AI is limited. “It would be lovely if AI could create all the looks,” says Yeomans, “but if JW Anderson decides he is going to put a belt halfway down the skirt, AI says: ‘Belts don’t go halfway down skirts’.”High-profile models such as Sjöberg and Gvarliani will likely be compensated well – casting agent Chloe Rosolek estimates they would be paid “millions” – but AI is likely to directly threaten models who more typically feature in e-commerce shoots that showcase products on brands’ websites. “Most models have had to deal with job loss already and this is a whole other frightening thing for them,” says Rosolek.Ingo Nolden, who is Gvarliani’s agent in Germany, agrees: “There is the erosion of human work especially at the entry level,” he says. He had negotiated a deal for an AI version of a model he works with in 2023, only to back out “because I felt it was giving the licence out to a third party I have no control of”.Lalaland AI creates AI models, and has clients including Zalando and Levis. Michael Musandu, the founder, says the technology allows consumers to see a more diverse “casting” when they look at a website. “As a person of colour, I never got to see models that represented this diversity or inclusion perspective,” he says.He argues the amount of shoots that big brands produce means it would be difficult to implement this change using real models.AI is not always a tool for inclusivity, of course – in 2023, Shereen Wu, a Taiwanese-American modelposted on social mediathat her image had been changed so she looked white.While Musandu says criticism of AI models is “warranted”, he downplays its impact. “Brands are going to continue to use real models,” he says. “This is supplementing … there is a cost-saving element, you can produce this content at a much more affordable price.”Rosolek describes H&M’s AI shoots as “another capitalistic approach to cut people, to cut their costs and increase their profits”. Profit may be on the company’s mind. In financial results for the first quarter of 2025, they missed expected growth, withReuters describingits start to the year as “sluggish”.An H&M spokesperson responded to concerns with the following statement: “While we understand that this will spark opinions, discussions, and uncertainty, we are humble in acknowledging that we do not hold all the answers at this point.“We will continue to explore with other creatives within the industry to see what generative AI can bring to any creative process, while ensuring we maintain our human-centric approach.”Rosolek hopes the development “is a massive flop” with consumers. “Models make an image incredible and I don’t think that can be replicated through AI,” she says.Yeomans agrees. “If you think of someone like [photographer] Steven Meisel, he was always discovering that next model, and everyone would ask, ‘Oh my gosh, is that beautiful?’ ‘Oh yes, it is beautiful’,” she says. “I’m not sure whether AI will be able to look around the corner and predict what might be next.”Explore more on these topicsModelsArtificial intelligence (AI)H&MfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it spying? Disquiet over NHS ‘magic eye’ surveillance camera in mental health unitsCampaign calls for investigation into the use of Oxevison amid concerns over care and its effect on patientsJon Ungoed-Thomas,Lucas Aminand Natasha IonSun 30 Mar 2025 02.00 EDTShareIn July 2022, Morgan-Rose Hart, an aspiring vet with a passion for wildlife, died after she was found unresponsive at a mental health unit in Essex. She had just turned 18. Diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Hart’s mental health had been badly affected by bullying, which had forced her to move school several times. She had previously tried to take her own life and was transferred to the unit, in Harlow, three weeks before her death.Hart, from Chelmsford in Essex, died on 12 July 2022 after being found unresponsive on the bathroom floor. A prevention of future deaths report issued after her inquest found that critical checks were missed, observation records were falsified and risk assessments were not completed.An investigation by theObserverand the newsletterDemocracy for Salehas established her death was one of four involving a hi-techpatient monitoring system called Oxevisionwhich has been rolled out in nearly half of mental health trusts across England.Oxevision’s system can measure a patient’s pulse rate and breathing without the need for a person to enter the room, or disturb a patient at night, as well as momentarily relaying CCTV footage when required. The hi-tech system can detect a patient’s breathing rate even when they are covered by a duvet.Spun out from Oxford University’s Institute of Biomedical Engineering in 2012, Oxehealth, the company behind Oxevision, has agreements with 25NHSmental health trusts, according to its latest accounts, which reported revenues of about £4.7m in the year to 31 December 2023.But it is claimed in some cases staff rely too heavily on the infra-red camera system to monitor vulnerable patients, instead of making physical checks.There are also concerns that the system – which can glow red from the corner of the room – may worsen the distress of patients in a mental health crisis who may have heightened sensitivity to surveillance or control.Sophina, who has experience of being monitored by Oxevision while a patient and asked for her full name not to be used, said: “I think it was something about the camera and it always being on, and it’s right above your bed.“It’s the first thing you see when you open your eyes, the last thing when you go to sleep. I was just in a constant state of hypervigilance. I was completely traumatised. I still felt too scared to sleep properly.”Advocates claim the technology can improve safety, but there are calls this weekend for the rollout of Oxevision to be halted, with mounting concerns over patient safety, privacy rights and conflicts of interest in the research to support its use. The campaign group Stop Oxevision said the surveillance technology could cause distress and had often been installed in patients’ bedrooms without proper consent.In a prevention of future deaths report issued in December 2023 after Hart’s inquest, the coroner noted that an Oxevision alert was triggered if a person was in the bathroom for more than three minutes, with staff then “required to complete an in-person check”. Instead, the “Oxevision red alert was reset” by staff and Hart was unobserved for 50 minutes before she was “discovered unresponsive on the bathroom floor”.The coroner noted the concern that “some staff may have been using Oxevision not just as an adjunct to face-to-face observations, but instead of them”. The conclusion of the jury inquest was death by misadventure, contributed to by neglect.Two days before Hart’s death, Michael Nolan, 63, a warehouse operator at risk of self-harm, died as a mental health patient at Basildon hospital. The inquest was told that the staff used Oxevision as a substitute for physical observations and that there had been a failure to conduct effective observations. The narrative verdict by a jury included the finding that training on the Oxevision system was inadequate.The following month, Sophie Alderman, 27, who had a history of self-harm, died while a patient at Rochford hospital, under the care of Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust. Her family say the Oxevision system caused her distress and harmed her mental health. In the months before her death, she complained about a camera in her room which she believed the government had hacked into.Tammy Smith, Alderman’s mother, told theObserver: “I don’t believe Oxevision is effective in keeping patients safe. It’s a huge invasion of patients’ privacy.“Staff either aren’t properly trained about it or it’s not appropriately used. People have died whilst Oxevision has been in use and questions have been raised about its use. That should be enough to pause a rollout and really consider whether this technology is keeping patients safe.”The Care Quality Commission has also raised concerns. In an inspection report of the Central and North West London NHS foundation trust published in February last year, it stated: “There had been a sad death in a safety room at [St Charles hospital in west London] where staff had not sufficiently engaged and monitored the patient and had relied on [Oxevision] which at the time was switched off. ”The trust said this weekend the “tragic death” in March 2023 had led to the dismissal of three individuals, and that the use of technology had never been designed to replace the responsibilities and care from staff.TheLampard inquiry, which is examining deaths of mental health inpatients under the care of NHS trusts in Essex between January 2000 and December 2023, is being urged to examine Oxevision.View image in fullscreenFormer patient Sophina, who was monitored by Oxevision.I was just in a constant state of hyper vigilance. I was completely traumatised. I still felt too scared to sleep properlySophina, former patientBindmans, the legal firm representing the families of Alderman and another patient, has told Baroness Lampard of concerns around consent, “sustained surveillance” and the safety and efficacy of the system. It said there was a concern that staff might delegate responsibility for monitoring a patient to the “digital eye”.A review by the National Institute forHealthand Care Research, published in November and commissioned by NHS England, looked at nine studies on Oxevision, along with other research, and found “insufficient evidence” to suggest that surveillance technologies in inpatient mental health units were achieving their intended outcomes, “such as improving safety and reducing costs”.Just one of these papers was rated “high-quality” for its methodology and reported no conflicts of interest. All other eight studies reported conflicts of interests, all connected to Oxehealth. In some cases, Oxehealth employees were co-authors of the papers.Alan Simpson, a professor of mental health nursing who was co-author of the review, said: “There isn’t independent research being conducted. There’s nearly always the involvement of the company who are making and marketing these devices.”Campaigners at Stop Oxevision said they were concerned about the threat the technology poses to patient “safety, privacy and dignity”.Lionel Tarassenko, a professor of electrical engineering at Oxford University and founder of Oxehealth, said Oxevision only intermittently relayed CCTV footage of patients. This is for a maximum of 15 seconds, and when clinical staff respond to an alert they only see blurred video.Lord Tarassenko said the papers reviewed by the National Institute team showed the benefits of Oxevision, including a reduction in self-harm, improved sleep for patients and enhanced safety. He added they were written by independent clinicians who maintained editorial control, and in some cases Oxehealth co-authors were included to reflect their contribution.He said: “There is no evidence that the appropriate use of the Oxevision technology is a contributory factor to the death of any inpatients. Patient experience of Oxevision has been very positive.”The company said in a statement that the Oxevision platform was in accordance withNHS England principleson digital technologies in mental health inpatient treatment and care, which were published last month and state that any decision to use the technology “must be based on consent”.The company said: “Oxevision can support clinical teams to improve patient safety, reducing incidents such as falls and self-harm, and allow staff to respond more effectively to clinical risks.” It said it welcomed dialogue on the responsible and ethical deployment of the technology.Paul Scott, chief executive of Essex Partnership University NHS foundation trust (EPUT), which had been responsible for the care of Hart, Nolan and Alderman, said any patient death was devastating and his sympathies were with those who had lost a loved one. He said: “We are continually focused on providing the best care, and use remote monitoring technology to enhance safety and complement therapeutic care and observations carried out by our staff.”An NHS England spokesperson said: “Any vision-based monitoring technology must support a human-based rights approach to care and only be used in line within legal requirements and ensuring patient and family consent is in place. NHS England has also instructed mental health trusts to review their use of all visual monitoring systems to ensure it is humane and compassionate.”A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: “These technologies should only be used in line with legal requirements, with robust staff training and the appropriate consent. We are transforming the care that people facing a mental health crisis receive through modernising the Mental Health Act. This will put dignity and respect at the heart of care.”Explore more on these topicsMental healthThe ObserverNHSHealthBipolar disorderAutismUniversity of OxfordSurveillancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

No one wants to lug heavy bags around transport hubs or arrive at the other end to a chaotically stuffed bag full of creased clothes. But we all have our “essentials” to cram in. For some, that’ll be a full skincare routine or a semblance of a wardrobe; for others, it’ll be sports equipment (though you really should leave the weights at home). So whether you’re flying on an airline offering ever-dwindling luggage limits, trying to cram a car for the whole crew, or rushing between trains with a backpack, it really does pay to travel light.The Guardian’s journalism is independent.

For ease of jumping on and off public transport, I travel with backpacks. I like the selection at Mountain Warehousebecause they’re affordable and durable, which is important as they get chucked around on local buses. And as simple as it sounds, rolling and separating clothing (dresses, tops, bottoms) into fabric tote bags is my biggest space-saving hack. Why buy packing cubes when tote bags do the same job but roll up even neater? Rolling your clothes condenses them, so you can fit more in, and also keeps creases at bay.Lydia Swinscoe, solo travel writer,@lydiaswinscoeColour code yourclothesView image in fullscreenI pack colours and tones that pair well together, allowing me to mix and match while sometimes wearing the same pair of shorts or jeans on multiple occasions.

That is why lawyers are targeted – with harassment, disbarment from the profession or even jail – by repressive regimes.Russia’s attempts to suppress the voice of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny did not end with his death in an Arctic prison colony. In a bleak coda, three of his lawyershave been jailedfor several years. Vadim  Kobzev, Alexei Liptser and Igor Sergunin were found guilty of participating in an “extremist organisation” for relaying his messages to the outside world.The Center for Human Rights in Iran warned earlier this year that Iranian lawyers were beingkicked out of the profession, arrested and jailed for representing protesters and dissidents. As its executive director, Hadi Ghaemi, noted: “Every lawyer imprisoned or disbarred represents many defendants whose rights have been trampled and now lack legal defence.”In China, where more than 300 human rights lawyers who had dared to take on sensitive cases were detained in 2015’s“709” crackdown, the pressurecontinues. As agrim jokehad it at the height of the campaign, “even lawyers’ lawyers need lawyers” – those who represented arrested friends were then seized themselves.The unrelenting nature of the clampdown is particularly striking when, as one Chinese lawyer, Liang Xiaojun, observed:“We know we can’t win.”When the verdict is clear before a case has started, lawyers can only offer solidarity, spread their clients’ stories, and highlight the gulf between legal theory and reality. But in doing so, they challenge the official narrative. Targeting these lawyers didn’t just signal that resistance only invites further trouble. It attacked the concept of the rule of law itself, which lawyers had attempted to assert, hammering home the message that the party’s power was unassailable.The Council of Europewarned earlier this monththat there are increasing reports of harassment, threats and other attacks on the practice of law internationally. The human rights body has adopted the first international treaty aiming to protect the profession of lawyer. Member states should now ratify this. Lawyers must be defended, as they defend others and the concepts of rules and justice.That message is more important than ever as the Trump administration turns on lawyers and judges as part of its broader assault on the institutions of US democracy and the principles that underpin them. The sanctioning of staff at the international criminal court is only the most flagrant example. William R Bay, president of the American Bar Association, told members in arecent letter: “Government actions evidence a clear and disconcerting pattern. If a court issues a decision this administration does not agree with, the judge is targeted. If a lawyer represents parties in a dispute with the administration, or … represents parties the administration does not like, lawyers are targeted.” Government lawyers too have faced “personal attacks, intimidation, firings and demotions for simply fulfilling their professional responsibilities”.Democratic governments and civil society must speak up for the law wherever it is threatened. Mr Bay is right to urge those in the profession to stand up and be counted. “If we don’t speak now, when will we speak?” he asks. The law still counts – both materially and culturally – in the US. Those who practise it need some of the courage in resisting abuses that their counterparts have shown elsewhere.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It looks like they are targeting even their mildest visa-carrying criticsSun 30 Mar 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 12.44 EDTShareDuring the Brexit era, it became obvious many comments under these columns were being placed by Russian trolls, with slightly strange grasps of idiomatic English, cut-and-pasting blocks of approved pro-Putin and anti-EU texts to change the direction of the discourse. Their posts read like the computer from2001: A Space Odyssey, but trained on 90s MTV Europe presenters’ accents and Russia Today op-eds.I began to bait the bots by inserting deliberately incomprehensible, but also somehow provocative, sentences into my pieces,culminating in the following paragraph, from the summer of 2016, after which point the Russian provocateurs left me alone:“One may as well give the kosovorotka-marinadingwazzocks something incomprehensible to feed their bewildered brainstems. To me, then, Vladimir Putin is a giant, prolapsed female worker bee that sucks hot ridicule out of langoustines’ cephalothoraxes. Let’s see what crunchy, expansionist lavatory honey this notion causes the parthenogenic Russian wendigos to inflate for us this week, in the shadow of Paul McGann and his art gnome.”But nature abhors a vacuum, and soon the comment space the Russians vacated was filled by Tories and Brexiters, like rats entering a vacant building, or unseated Tory MPs getting their own reality TV shows. Between 2020 and the fall of the last government these columns were the subject of complaints and criticisms on the right, many with their own newspaper columns in theDaily Mailor theTelegraph, and their own House of Commons notepaper and/or links to opaquely-funded Tufton Street outlets.But although Kemi Badenoch justtook a £14,000 freebiefrom Neil Record – whose tentacular connections include Tufton Street’s climate change denial group the Global Warming Policy Foundation, its Truss-grooming charity the Institute of Economic Affairs, and itsmonomaniacal astro-turfed anti-National Trust outfitRestore Trust – the background noise has lessened since the election. Perhaps because the US government are now doing Tufton Street’s job of normalising rightwing talking points more effectively than just getting the former IEA staffer Kate Andrews on to the BBC’sQuestion Timefor the 14thtime. That’s what I call a special relationship!One should hesitate before ascribing motive to a landslide or a prolapse. Like Trump perhaps, they just happenBut, as I enter my 15th year of satirising the news for money here at theObserver, the quality of complaint has changed again. These past few weeks it has been helpful readers that have been writing in to correct my factual errors and my “jokes”, although admittedly last week’s column on the Trump government’s attitude to its Navajo citizens wasa hot messfor which I, like Trump’s national securty adviser Mike Waltz, take full responsibility.I accept the point that Trump did acknowledge the Navajo veterans by inviting them to the White House in 2017, but at the same event he did thenmake a joke about Pocahontaswhile standing in front of a portrait of president Andrew Jackson, author of the Indian Removal Act, which relocated Indigenous peoples and saw their lands seized, which probably soured the celebration for the Indigenous wartime heroes.As usual with Trump, it’s difficult to know if the crass behaviour was calculated to play to his base, or whether it was just evidence of the ongoing tone deaf stupidity and systemic incompetence of his team. As a rule, one should hesitate before ascribing motive to a landslide, for example, or to a prolapse. Like Trump perhaps, they just happen.Which is where the worst western military security failure of the century so far comes in. On 15 March the Trump team used the Signal messaging service to discuss their forthcoming attack on the Houthi pirates, and accidentally invited a Democrat-supporting magazine editor, Jeffrey Goldberg, to join their discussion. If it was a sitcom plot you’d reject it as being too on-the-nose.Goldberg could have revealed the bombing plans and a CIA operative’s identity. And now everyone knows the depth of the current American administration’s ideologically-driven contempt for European democracy, and the fact that Mike Waltz, a 51-year-old man in a position of some responsibility, uses emojis to celebrate airstrikes. Like a baby with its own bombs.Does Keir Starmer still think he can salvage the special relationship, an abused husband watching his furious wife throw all of his jazz vinyl out of the bedroom window? The whole world saw America’s Uncle Sam mask slip. But when Trump was questioned about the incident by a journalist on Tuesday, he claimed to know nothing about it, as if he had just been roused from a 24-hour KFC coma and thrust before the cameras without being briefed on a story that was global front page news. Maybe, like in the classicWhatever Happened to the Likely Ladsepisode where Bob and Terry don’t want to know the football result, Trump was trying to savour the moment of discovery.Clearly, we can no longer share intelligence with Trump’s US, and no future defence or foreign policy plans can rely on the cooperation of a country that wishes Europe material harm. But more importantly, is it worth me writing jokes about Trump’s US? A paranoid reading of recent events makes it look as if they are targeting even their mildest visa-carrying critics, recently denying entry to a French scientist and three-quarters of punk veterans UK Subs. Although to be fair, five years ago the drummer from the offensively apolitical stoner metal band Orange Goblin was also denied entry, like some kind of innocent shrimp-like bycatch.First they came for a French scientist. And I did not speak out. Because I was not a French scientist.Then they came for UK Subs. And I did not speak out. Because I was not a member of UK Subs.And then they came for the drummer from Orange Goblin. And I did not speak out. Because I prefer Electric Wizard.And then they came for me.Stewart Lee toursStewart Lee vs the Man-Wulfuntil spring 2026 with a Royal Festival Hall run in JulyExplore more on these topicsStewart LeeOpinionTrump administrationUS militaryUS politicsHouthiscommentShareReuse this content"

He insisted onvisiting Greenlanddespite unequivocal statements by the territory’s leaders and Denmark’s government that he was not invited and not welcome. Vance’s trip was confined to a remote Arctic base, where he briefly spoke to a few Americans. Plans to make a wider tour and speak to Greenlanders were cancelled – because Greenlanders did not want to speak to him.Such hostility is entirely understandable, given the repeated, provocative and disrespectful declarations by Vance’s boss, Donald Trump, that the US plans to annex Greenland and may do so illegally and by force. Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory within the kingdom of Denmark.Election resultsthis month showed the vast majority of local people back expanded self-rule or outright independence. They do not want to be Americans.In a feeble attempt to justify what is, in effect, a Putin-style bid to seize another country’s sovereign territory, Vance claimed Denmark had failed to protect Greenland from Chinese and Russian threats – but did not produce any evidence. He also failed to explain why, if such dangers exist, the US, which like Denmark is a Nato member, has not honoured its legal obligation to develop a “collective capacity to resist armed attack” under the 1951 US-Denmark“Defence of Greenland” treaty.Trump, too, has been prating about Greenland’s importance for “world peace”. It’s true the Arctic region is seeing increased great power competition, partly because climate change renders it more accessible. Yet Trump, in anotherecho of Ukraine, appears more motivated by desire to control Greenland’s untapped mineral wealth. As in Gaza and Panama, his main interest is not security and justice but geopolitical, financial and commercial advantage. Insulting plans to enrolCanada as the 51st statereflect another Trump preoccupation: a return to an earlier age of aggressive US territorial expansionism.Vance in Greenland may have preferred a woolly hat to a pith helmet, but his imperialist intentions were unmistakable. Yet despite his frosty reception, he was perhaps glad to escape Washington, where he and his travelling companion, US national security adviser Mike Waltz, are feeling the heat for another scandalous piece of foolishness: theSignal message group security breach. This concerns the inadvertent inclusion of a leading journalist in an online discussion by Vance, Waltz and senior officials of real-time US bombing attacks on Houthi rebels in Yemen.This breach, by itself, is bad enough. It might have endangered US pilots and wrecked the Houthi operation. The discussion, on an insecure platform, could have been, and probably was overheard by the Russians and others. Yet its contents, which have now been published in full, also include rude and mocking comments by Vance and Pete Hegseth, the US defence secretary,about European allies. Their shaming, ignorant exchanges dramatically and damagingly highlight the rapid deterioration in transatlantic ties since Trump took office.Like the Greenland incursion, the official response to the Signal scandal speaks volumes about the true nature of the Trump administration. Trump’s shabby instinct was to deny all responsibility, minimise its importance, denigrate the journalist and dismiss the whole thing as a hoax. Hegseth’s claim thatno classified information was releasedis an obvious, stupid lie, as the transcript demonstrates. There is huge hypocrisy in the refusal of Waltz, Vance and Hegseth to even contemplate resignation, when such a blunder by a lower-ranking official would certainly have led to the sack.Above all, the hubris, arrogance, amateurishness and irresponsibility revealed by both episodes is truly shocking – and a chilling warning to the world.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It means we can draw on our coping strategies to manage setbacksThe modern mindis a column where experts discuss mental health issues they are seeing in their workSun 30 Mar 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 18.15 EDTShareAlex* was positively seething at his friend’s suggestion to “be a bit more resilient” in the face of a recent setback at work.“I wonder what they meant by that?” I queried, attempting to strike the delicate balance between acknowledging Alex’s distress while resisting assumptions about the friend’s intention in using the word.For Alex, the suggestion sparked anger, disappointment and a sense of demoralisation. Being told to “be resilient” can be comparable to telling someone in the midst of an anxiety attack to simply “calm down”, or advising a new mother to counteract fatigue by “sleeping when the baby sleeps” – perhaps well-intentioned, but simplistic and generally unhelpful.James thought he was just stressed – then the panic attacks started | Diane YoungRead moreLike many people, Alex had taken “resilient” to mean “invincible”. Instead of“you can manage this”, he heard“get over it”. He craved comfort and encouragement in that moment, but instead heard words synonymous to“harden up”. The gravity of his worry was minimised, his concerns dismissed.Gaining strength by enduring adversity is part of resilience, but these simplistic terms belie its true nature.Resilience refers to an extraordinary but ordinary process – successfully adapting to difficult or challenging life events, while drawing on past resources to face new challenges. Significant psychological growth is made through response and recovery to adversity; new skills are developed, while existing skills are honed. In this sense, resilience is aprocessnot atoutcome. Think of a person at peak physical fitness: the physique achieved by exercise and nutrition needs to be maintained. Our brains are not dissimilar: resilience comes not simply from enduring hardship but by the process of using and maintaining skills developed during that time.The misconstrued understanding of resilience is a trend I’ve observed both in my work as a psychologist and, more broadly, in social conversations. Resilience is now a buzzword being promoted as a mental health magic bullet. It is seen as key to a range of wellbeing outcomes across the lifespan, fromkids gaining confidencein their physical and social abilities, todecreased mortality rates for older adults.But for many people, the expectation to be resilient feels unachievable. The thought of not crumbling when one’s world may, in fact, be crumbling can be terrifying. The ambiguous notion of resilience induces pressure – to conform, to cope seamlessly with traumatic events, to maintain composure, and to hold it all together when stakes are high and chance of success seems low.From so-called“big T” traumas(such as life-threatening events) to the vicissitudes and stressors of everyday life, none of us get through life unscathed. The response and recovery after adversity is a fundamental part of life. It’s no coincidence that this mirrors a foundational process of therapy. First, identifying and exploring past hardships and trauma. Next, recognising the strategies and skills integral to enduring or mastering the situation. Last, managing the application of this newly developed set of coping strategies to fresh challenges and novel hardships.Oversensitive and overreactive: what is nervous system dysregulation and how can it be resolved?Read moreWhichever way it is framed and whatever psychological term is used to describe it – cognitive behaviour therapy, post-traumatic growth, trauma processing – much of modern-day therapy focuses on the process of nurturing and encouraging the development of resilience.For Alex, his friend’s words seemed the antithesis to the support he needed. Rather than“you can handle this”, Alex heard,“you’re on your own”.But resilience rarely develops in isolation. Instead, it is best fostered by support from others. This may include words of encouragement during difficult times, reminders of the coping strategies already within one’s remit, acknowledgement of growth and normalisation of setbacks.Think of the parent holding the back of a bike until the child gains balance. A teacher helping a student with a difficult assignment. A swimming coach encouraging their charge to complete one more lap. The achievements here belong to individuals but could not be achieved without the scaffolding and crucial help provided by others.Resilience is no longer a dirty word for Alex.By exploring and reframing his perception of the conversation with his friend, Alex gained confidence and competence in his capacity to manage the workplace difficulties. Rather than feeling discouraged by the notion of resilience, he was instead able to recognise its true and powerful meaning – the extraordinary but ordinary process of learning from past experiences, and drawing upon existing coping strategies to manage new problems.Hardship is inevitable. Life will teach us all tough lessons, many of which leave us feeling disempowered and vulnerable. But we are offered a modicum of control – how we use those lessons to improve our own position and future self. None of us are invincible, but we all have capacity for resilience.Dr Bianca Denny is a clinical psychologist based in Melbourne.

I’ll tell you why I think that’s nonsense – but please don’t pull up a chairSun 30 Mar 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 16.28 EDTShareIonce told a colleague that I was going to Amsterdam on a solo trip to wine and dine alone. “Do you not have any friends to go with?” she replied. She was joking, but I think she also meant it. Her comment was tinged with pity. Why would youchooseto eat a three-course meal with a good view or order room service in a nice hotel on your own? What’s the point? Wouldn’t you want to share that with someone?Eating alone often gets a bad rap. It’s getting an even worse rap now that the World Happiness Report moved Americans down the ranking in part because they are, apparently,eating alone too much. The picture doesn’t look good: too many people have no one to eat with, they lack community, and are clearly rather isolated and lonely. Community is incredibly important – especially now, when the world feels increasingly unstable and unpredictable. We all know that at the end of your life you will think about the people you love and how you spent time with them. Sharing a meal, especially in candlelight, is an intimate experience and makes us feel closer to one another. Historically, people gathered around open campfires – it was around these flickering flames that we first learned to share stories.And yet there is also a huge number of people who really enjoy spending time alone at a table too. Solo dining in restaurants in the US hasrisen by a staggering 64%since 2019, according to OpenTable.I am one of these people (I’ve even written an entire novel calledTable for One, about a woman rekindling her relationship with herself after a breakup). I’m always looking for new solo experiences to book. But it’s not easy being a solo diner – the world is set up for couples. There are two-for-one deals and sharing platters, and I’ve noticed that many nice restaurants don’t offer wine by the glass, only a full bottle. And it’s not just single people who love being solo diners: I am married and have been with my partner for 13 years, yet one of the biggest pleasures of my life is taking myself out for a solo date.When it’s good, it’s good. Just this morning I had breakfast alone in a nice hotel and three other women were also sitting alone, reading their books (two out of three had opted for Joan Didion). It felt surprisingly communal. But restaurants don’t always love a solo customer in the evening. In New York, I am usually shoved awkwardly at the end of the bar on an uncomfortably high bar stool, offered a snack menu and not treated to a full dining experience. In several restaurants in London, I’ve been told they would need the table back within 45 minutes and I wasn’t given the full dining foreplay: no specials board, just a quick in-and-out job. The assumption perhaps being that I was there for convenience – on a business trip perhaps? – rather than on an enjoyable evening out to spend time with myself.‘Table for one? Yes, please’ – the joy of eating aloneRead moreSomeone who lives in Tuscany recently told me that solo dining is not as widely accepted there: “People would think you were strange.” Dining in Italy, he added, is all about big groups of people, family, laughter, and sharing food. As much as I love a hearty group meal (I’m not that much of a loner), I’m also a raging introvert, so I couldn’t help but feel defensive that anything other than dining at a big table is labelled “strange”.I don’t always want a big, raucous dining experience. Sometimes I just want to eat slowly and silently while chewing over my thoughts. Tasting the food, reading a book, looking out of a window, thinking, maybe even with a friendly podcast in my ears for company instead (they talk and you don’t need to talk back). Some countries have solo dining baked into their DNA – in Japan, it’s encouraged and respected. There is even a famous ramen chain, Ichiran, that offers individual booths where people canenjoy their dinner in privacywithout needing to interact. (And it has now expanded into the US.) Some people might think this is sad and too antisocial, but what about if it’s chosen as an occasional treat? Life is busy and stressful: what’s wrong with wanting to eat a meal in privacy every now and again?It’s beenfive yearssince the pandemic began. Many of us were either stuck inside a house full of people with no escape or desperately alone, craving company and conversation. I wonder if those people who were cooped up with others without any personal space are behind this rise in people eating alone, seeking out alonement and travel and savouring every morsel of hard-won peace. I wonder if chosen solitude can one day be openly celebrated – especially for women, who often forget to prioritise their pleasure in a world of endless to-do lists for other people. Eating alone doesn’t always mean misery. There’s room for nuance at my table for one.Emma Gannon is an author and journalist.

Three long weeks ago, the governmentbegan to announce all those cutsto disability and sickness benefits – aimed, they said, at saving£5bn by the end of this decade. Then, only hours before Rachel Reeves’s emergency financial “update”, the seemingly omnipotent Office for Budget Responsibility said that the clawbackswould total significantly less, which prompted the Treasury to notonly halve the money paidto new claimants of the incapacity benefit element of universal credit, but freeze its current levels until 2030. Cruelty had followed cruelty: by last Thursday, when it became clear that a record 4.5 million children in the UK are living in poverty, Oxfam was calling these moves “morally repugnant”.In some quarters, pundits and politicians have moved on from the controversy all this has caused, and are busy speculating about whether the chancellorwill soon have to put up taxes. But at the heart of our politics, there is now an inescapable certainty, which will flare up spectacularly when some of the cuts to benefits areput to a parliamentary vote: the fact that Reeves, Keir Starmer and their colleagues are set on immiserating millions of disabled people.The suffering their decisions are going to cause will materialise soon enough. For now, what the government has triggered is a huge outbreak of the kind of awful fear I heard first-hand last week, when I spoke to someone whose next official benefits assessment might send their family’s income plummeting.I was put in touch with Kevin by the disability charity Scope. He is 60 years old, and lives in the Croxteth area of Liverpool. In 1994, he was working in a factory that made rubber tubing, where he broke his back. He then found work in the hospitality trade, followed by a job recovering crashed cars, before a benign tumor was discovered in and around his spine, which cannot be removed. “I’ve got nerve compression on my spine,” he told me. “My left leg doesn’t work properly. I’m in pain 24 hours a day. I can’t stand up or sit down for more than five minutes.”He now receives what official speak calls the enhanced rate of the daily living component of personal independence payment (or Pip), which is about torise to £110.40 per week. When we first spoke, he said he was terrified that the government’s sudden drive to “tighten” eligibility could drop him to the lower rate of £73.90 – a loss of almost £160 a month. “That’d be a disaster for us,” he said. He already has to make ends meet by regularly borrowing money from relatives.View image in fullscreenProtest against welfare cuts in Westminster, London, 26 March 2025.Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/ShutterstockIn fact, he has even more to worry about. His anxiety is focused on the scores awarded inludicrously bureaucratic Pip assessmentson the basis of such “descriptors” as “can prepare and cook a simple meal” or “needs to use an aid or appliance to be able to wash or bathe”. Before we had our second conversation, he had discovered that in thenew system, people will have to score a minimum of four points in one of the official categories to receive either rate of the daily living component. “I get threes and twos,” he told me. He is also worried about his 21-year-old autistic son – who also has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and epilepsy – and receives the enhanced rate of Pip, but may also not satisfy the new criteria. “I’m terrified,” he said. “My mental health is in the gutter. How do these people sleep at night?”In a town far from Whitehall, I saw how devastating Labour’s cuts will be. When will ministers wake up? | John HarrisRead moreWhat Kevin’s predicament most vividly highlights is something everybody well knows: that a lot of the new cuts drive is not about getting people into jobs, but rather the cold imperative to slash money from the so-called welfare budget so that Reeves can meet her fiscal rules. The same callousness is evident in plans tomake people under 22– such as Kevin’s son – completely ineligible for the incapacity benefit part of universal credit, paid to people who have very limited ability to work.To make things even more wretched, the Pip cuts may actually fly in the face of the employment drive the government insists it wants to pursue, by making it much harder for thesixth of Pip claimants who workto carry on doing so. “If you want to work, the government should support you, not stop you,”Starmer recently said. But tightening entitlements will hack away at the basic economic foundations that disabled people who can work need if they want to enter the labour market. In 15 years of social reporting, one certainty has hit me again and again: that penury and worry make people less likely to get a job, not more. This government is the latest to ignore that fact.And listen to all the mood music. Darren Jones, the chief secretary to the Treasury, compared the benefit changes to taking some of his children’s pocket money to push them into getting a Saturday job, beforeadmitting that what he said was “tactless”. The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has endorsed the fashionable idea that mental illness is “overdiagnosed”. In the right company, that might be the subject of a nuanced and careful conversation, but from a senior minister in the midst of this political moment, it sounds more like a nasty justification for the cuts: an implied suggestion that it’s OK to take sickness and disability payments away from people, because they may not actually be as sick and disabled as they say.Meanwhile, a real crisis of public health – manifested in conditions such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and all the rest – festers away. So does a national emergency centred on a genuine epidemic of anxiety and depression, not to mention long Covid. To enduringly save money, the government could take the ambitious and strategic option of trying to turn these things around. It might also think hard about the deep social issues that keep people out of employment, and look at an idea recentlyfloated by the Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham: turning jobcentres into “live well centres”, dedicated to practical help with debt and poor housing, and their effects on people’s health.Instead, we get what looks like the worst domestic policy decision made by any postwar Labour government. I wonder how many of the party’s MPs have recently cast their minds back to a rather different kind of thinking, and a book of essays written by that great Labour god, Aneurin Bevan. Published in 1952, it was titledIn Place of Fear, and its text was full of observations that sound discomfitingly relevant right now. “Financial anxiety in time of sickness,”wrote Bevan, “is a serious hindrance to recovery, apart from its unnecessary cruelty.” He was making the case for the NHS, but the same point applies to other parts of the welfare state.And now look: the people in charge of the party Bevan once served are sowing anxiety and horror as a matter of deliberate policy. Which brings us back to the first couple of questions, not so much in the sense of fiscal maths and parliamentary intrigue, but the bleak moral journeyLabourhas set out on: what just happened, and where are we now?John Harris is a Guardian columnist.

Inferior parents should note that help is available: Sabrina Carpenter returns to the UK this summer, seats available for £191 each (VIP £364).Keir Starmer once said that, under him, Britain would be the party of the family and the “best place to grow up in”: we can already feel confident that, thanks to his approach to dynamic sponging, no child of a Labour minister need be denied their essential football or concert outing, regardless of ticket price or scarcity. Starmer leads the way with his non-negotiable visits to theArsenal directors’ box, a perk that Sky Sports at Chequers cannot be expected to replace. “It means I can continue to do something which is really special to me,” he said (after his free specs and outfits scandal), “which is to go to football with my boy.”Leave aside the ethical complexities that would, if poncing free stuff is virtuous, make Boris Johnson a living saintBut as Reeves said last week, risking a furtherLabourmasterclass in tin-eared entitlement, Sabrina Carpenter is not special to her. She obtained reportedly £600 worth of tickets on a more sacrificial basis for her daughter, for whom, we are invited to believe, no other companion was available. Plus Reeves would have loved to be “in normal seats”. Anyway, she eventually conceded, after repeated freebie questions had disrupted post-Statement interviews: “I wouldn’t do it again, I felt I was doing the right thing, but I do understand perceptions.”Leave aside the ethical complexities that would, if poncing free stuff is virtuous, make Boris Johnson a living saint – why did she do it in the first place? It might be standard among Starmer favourites butpolling confirms, unsurprisingly, that the public deplores parliamentary freeloading, just as it doesMPs having second jobs. Last week, the housing minister, Matthew Pennycook (“If I want to go to a concert, I’ll pay”), spoke for decent MPs who have to live with the loss of public respect generated by less scrupulous colleagues. As with the recent discovery that the speaker Lindsay Hoyle’s “working trips”, sometimes undertaken with his employee Lady Hoyle, have cost £250,000 since October 2022, the public’s disappointment is arguably more acute when inflicted by supposedly evolved politicians given to effusions about “working people”, than by Tory degenerates with a known specialism in lushery. If principle alone is not enough to stop Starmer allowing elite freeloading to contaminate his deliberate, former-prosecutor’s, son-of-a-toolmaker, opposite-of-Johnson projection of decency, how come pragmatism has also failed?Last November, it’s true, Starmer, then recently embarrassed for acceptingmore freebies than any other MP, “tightened up” the ministerial code. His sententious introduction (with its ritual homage to “working people”) began – as well it might after his consignments of Lord Alli’s “multiple” free specs (£2,435.00) and “work clothing” (£26,200) – “Restoring trust in politics is the great test of our era”. Bafflingly, at least to this working person, hisrevised version, which couldsimply have put a stop to undue gifts, has instead preserved the fault that facilitates the exact opposite. As with personal judgment on second jobs for MPs (a flourishing affront to constituents thatStarmer once opposed), the acceptance of gifts was left to individual ministers, as opposed to straightforwardly banned.Beneficiaries must now, the code blithers, consider before taking gifts the “need to maintain the public’s confidence in the standards of propriety”. So, pre-Carpenter, Reeves presumably gave that her intensest consideration. For as long as meeting this requirement depends on the ethics or wisdom of the takers, you gather that parliament’s long-overdue protection from greedy and entitled members is an outcome that does not interest the current possessor of a massive Labour majority. The new code need not have discouraged 11 MPs from accepting £17,000 worth of Taylor Swift tickets, it still indulges Starmer and colleagues’ off-duty access to free VIP football and other sports tickets, a benefit not everywhere considered more endearing than Johnson’s infamous, magnate-subsidised lifestyle. One thinks, in particular, of those individualsonce advised by Starmer, that “handouts from the state do not nurture the same sense of self-reliant dignity as a fair wage”.View image in fullscreenSabrina Carpenter performs at the Brit Awards 2025 at the O2 Arena on 1 March, 2025.Photograph: JMEnternational/Getty ImagesBut Starmer is not, thankfully, done with safeguarding parliament’s reputation. His new “modernisation committee” will consider, among other things, “how to restore public trust in politics”. Older voters may register, among 14 members selected by party whips, the Tory and Viktor Orbán sympathiser, Christopher Chope. Prior to the expenses revelations of 2009, theTelegraphreported, he “drove a Chesterfield sofa 85 miles to have it reupholstered for £881 at taxpayers’ expense”. Parliament also employs his consort, Mrs Chope.It may further comfort our keenest parliamentary freeloaders that the person heading this body is Lucy Powell MP, leader of the Commons and most recent runner-up to Starmer in the freebie acceptance league,with £40,289 of declared gifts. As much as Powell prizes high standards,telling theGuardian, “We need to make sure we’re meeting that public smell test”, both the Register of Interests and herdefence of giftsonQuestion Timehave suggested personal olfactory organs highly adapted to the current parliamentary environment. Powell’s impressive haul has included, along with sports and cultural events purportedly justified by her old, shadow Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport job, pairs of tickets to watch tennis (£564), the Ashes (£600) and the Silverstone Grand Prix (£464).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The mythic Welsh warrior Lleu Llaw Gyffes, who appears to have been bigger on brawn than brain, once came home to find his wife, the flower-maiden Blodeuwedd, weeping with fear over premonitions of his death. She begged Lleu to prove that he was, as rumoured, invincible.Lleu, who had clearly not read the story of Delilah, thought it was a good idea to reveal to his wife each of the unlikely and incongruous conditions that would make it possible for a rival to kill him: among other kinks, they required him to be caught outdoors on a riverbank with one foot straddling a thatched cauldron and one on a wriggling goat. Lo and behold, in one year’s time Lleu found himself being struck down in exactly that pose by Blodeuwedd and her lover, the hunter Gronw Pebr. The story is still told to explain the peculiar shape of the Stone of Gronw, sitting to this day on the banks of the River Cynfal in Blaenau Ffestiniog.Blodeuwedd may have been a tricksy wife, but she is one of eight magical creatures celebrated on Royal Mail’scollection of stamps, which revive folkloric traditions from regions across the UK. None is fully human: Blodeuwedd herself was reportedly moulded from flowers by two magicians for their friend, Lleu, after a curse doomed him never to find a bride from among his own people.View image in fullscreen‘Blodeuwedd, weeping with fear at over premonitions of his death, begged Lleu to prove that he was invincible.’Photograph: Royal Mail/PAThe subjects of these stamps are all deeply rooted in regional landscape. They include Cornish Piskies (not to be confused with Devonian Pixies); the shapeshifting selkies of Orkney and Shetland (part seal, part woman); and of course, Loch Ness’ most famous resident, Nessie. They provide a rare reminder that England has magical creatures to match the smaller home nations. Norfolk is represented by the Black Shuck, the demonic black dog of East Anglia; Lancashire and Yorkshire by the Grindylow, a river monster that drags children into the reeds. They’d deserve attention if only thanks to the lyrical designs by the artist Adam Simpson, packed with mobile storytelling detail in each still image. They are also, in their own quiet way, deeply patriotic.Patriotism gets a bad rap in modern Britain. The left often struggles to accept that patriotism can be distinguished from nationalist chauvinism, or that there can be any place for it. Liberals of the centre, meanwhile, have a dangerous tendency to vest pride only in institutions that flatter our ideological preferences, forgetting that France, Germany and even Italy make their own claims to have invented Enlightenment values. Secular patriotism – and by that, I mean a patriotism devoid of emotion or aesthetic – can only ever be transactional. If your love of country is conditional upon its strict adherence to the separation of powers, the secret ballot or even the NHS, it will crumble the first time those institutions come under successful attack.Blodeuwedd was reportedly moulded from flowers by two magicians for Lleu, after a curse doomed him never to find a bride among his own peopleIt is almost 20 years since Gordon Brown, as chancellor, staked out this territory as a personal project. Brown had remarkable foresight: in a speech at the 2006 Fabian Society conference, he foresaw the risks that the lack of a confident and coherent British identity posed to the union and Britain’s place in Europe. Three years later, Brown commissionedBeing British, a collection of essays edited by then-Spectatoreditor Matthew d’Ancona, and wrote the introduction.In an accompanying BBC radio programme, he identified the dangers of leaving British patriotism to be defined by the hard right. “I think everybody wants to be rooted. Everybody wants to feel a sense of belonging,” he told D’Ancona. But when progressives and liberals fail to cater for that need, “we define ourselves by race or ethnicity – which would be a disaster for a country that has many people with different backgrounds as part of it.” The result, as Brown foresaw, is the anti-immigrant provocation of Tommy Robinson and the racist violence of theSouthport riots.It is possible to celebrate aspects of Britain that everyone who lives here can share; that are not co-authored by our peers in Europe; that stimulate our senses with a materiality more enduring than the abstract precepts of a civics lecture. (And I’m not talking, like the wretched “Life in the UK” test, about fish and chips.) A new set of stamps for Royal Mail is not going to transform a nation’s self-image, but it should inspire us. What we have in common with each other, and with every other human being who has set foot on these islands, is no more and no less than our experience of place.Take the selkie. Coastal nations the world over have stories of water-nymphs who come and go from human husbands: the Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index, a categorisation system used by folklorists to define tale types, classes the selkie myth as a subsection of ATU 400, “The Man on a Quest for His Lost Wife”. (Nothing takes the joy out of fairy stories like reducing them to numbered index cards.) Versions of seal-maiden can be found well beyond the legal boundaries of the UK, in the Faroe Islands and across Scandinavia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But only in the Shetlands is the motif so closely linked to the geographic challenges of the sea-swells in the Ve Skerries. The folklorist Walter Traill Dennison claimed to have found a different selkie tale shaped around the landscape of each Orkney island. The thrill of these stories is the local detail woven into the universal.Just as regional folklore can build new communities, it can stoke ethnic conflict. Royal Mail’s stamps take a provocative risk by locating Fionn mac Cumhaill, the Gaelic giant also known as Finn McCool, in Northern Ireland’s Giant’s Causeway, thus inveigling him into a set celebrating the United Kingdom. Yet they also do a brilliant job of reminding us that Britain’s legends are everywhere you look in our landscape.You don’t have to share any DNA with the previous generations who have told these tales.

She is almost completely friendless in the media. Rightwing outlets blame the paucity of growth on higher business taxes while voices of the left decry reductions to incapacity benefits as balancing the books on the backs of the poor. The public mood is grim. The Opinium poll that is published today suggests that only half of those who voted Labour in 2024 think this government is handling the economy better than the Conservative one that the country evicted last July. Thinktank world reckons thatlast week’s spring statementwas a can-kicking exercise that leaves the fiscal position fragile and the government at the mercy of events. Planned reductions to welfare payments are generating asulphurous atmosphere among Labour backbenchersand this will not dissipate anytime soon. Implementing these cuts requires putting them into law. This means that horrified disability charities and other appalled groups will have many weeks to campaign against the legislation while venting their outrage at Labour parliamentarians. “This is not what Labour MPs came into politics to do,” says one of their number who would normally be counted as a loyalist.Can the chancellor survive so much opprobrium and opposition? Yes she can, so long as she still has a friend at Number 10. The opinion that matters to her most is that held by the prime minister. He may be no economist, but he will be the ultimate decider when, and if, her number is up. In the early 80s, Sir Geoffrey Howe had a much grimmer stretch of his chancellorship than she is enduring now, but he got through to the other side because his strategy had a fully paid-up subscriber in Margaret Thatcher. George Osborne’s humiliatingly awful“omnishambles” budgetin 2012 might have done for him had he not been best mates with David Cameron.The dynamic between the current duo is interesting. Cabinet colleagues generally portray their relationship as “rock solid”. There is certainly no sign of the festering resentments and bitter rivalries that disfigured dealings between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown when those frenemies were the neighbours of Downing Street. On the other hand, the Starmer-Reeves pairing is not as chummy as Cameron-Osborne who were godfathers to each other’s children. It is worth noting that the relative statures of Sir Keir and Ms Reeves have shifted with time and circumstance. In the early phase of this government, it was she who radiated the power. The Treasury looked extremely dominant, while Number 10 was debilitated by theinternal strugglesbetween Sue Gray and Morgan McSweeney’s gang. Officials were surprised by how little and late the prime minister’s involvement was inlast October’s budget; they were even more startled that Sir Keir seemed content to almost entirely delegate economic policymaking to the chancellor. More recently, his star has been in the ascendant as have his priorities. While the chancellor has been besieged, the prime minister’s efforts to handle Donald Trump and give succour to Ukraine have drawn widespread plaudits.His ratingshave had a boost, albeit from a low base.Her unpopularity is perilously close to the depths plumbed by Kwasi Kwarteng during his calamitous stint at the TreasuryThey have maintained a front of unity for public consumption, but there have been disagreements behind the scenes. She was initially resistant to extra funding for defence. That contrasted with the prime minister who was quick to heed the argument that more had to be spent on the military in response to Trump’s return to the White House. Sir Keir has been very struck by surveys suggesting that global uncertainty is shooting up as a concern among voters. But this is about much more than polling. He regards it as a personal mission of the highest importance to persuade the US president to keep America bound into Nato’s security guarantees. He will be pleased if one of the things said about his prime ministership in years to come is that he played an essential role in ensuring the future of the Atlantic alliance. It was when she appreciated the strength of his feeling that the chancellor pivoted to a more accommodative position on defence spending. She has taken to talking up additional investment and jobs in defence manufacturing as a potential engine of prosperity. Once Labour’s growth ambitions were concentrated around becoming a “clean energy superpower”; now the chancellor wants to be a “defence industrial superpower”. Khaki is the new green.The Office for Budget Responsibility is increasingly controversial in Labour’s ranks where there is regret that the chancellor championed the legislation elevating the status and clout of the fiscal invigilators. TheOBR has cheered the governmentby judging that planning reforms will result in a permanent improvement to GDP over the longer-term. But the watchdog also made life difficult for the chancellor in the short-term by telling her that she’d bust her rules unless she made additional spending reductions. The complaint is that policymaking has become too subservient to satisfying OBR guesstimates about what growth and debt might be in five years. I have it on exceedingly good authority that the prime minister himself has come to the view that it is unhelpful, to the point of being barmy, that the government has to live in dread of an OBR report card every six months, rather than face an annual verdict at budget time.It remains hard to detect significant differences between him and the chancellor on the fundamentals.I remarked back in Januarythat their fates were entwined because they were lashed to the same mast and they are tighter bound as the headwinds howl with increased ferocity. Both have made improved growth the centrepiece of strategy, so both will pay a continuing political price unless and until it materialises. Both believe the world has become a darker place since the new year without being able to say explicitly that the principal author of this turbulence lives in the White House. Both share the dread of the damage to the economy and the government’s finances that isthreatened by the US president. Though his big reveal on tariffs is supposed to be coming this Wednesday, cabinet members and officials tell me they don’t have any certainty about what might be in store. Even if the UK manages tododge the worst of the Trumpian tariffs, we will still suffer from the fallout of a global trade war.Yet prime minister and chancellor remain as one in believing that there is no alternative to doubling down on toughing it out in the hope that it will ultimately galvanise growth and generate respect.Faced with crunchy decisions they’d rather not have to make, many Labour people, including a significant number of the cabinet, think life could be made a lot easier by relaxing the fiscal rules, which thechancellor declares to be “non-negotiable”. Some of these critics describe it as a terrible mistake to strap Labour into a self-imposed straitjacket. This argument has no traction among her supporters, one of whom retorts: “We all know Labour governments have to work harder to sustain credibility. Borrowing is right at the limit of what the market will tolerate. If the government cannot prove that it can stick to fiscal discipline, it will be shot to pieces.” In this, the chancellor has, so far, had a steadfast ally in her nextdoor neighbour. When Sir Keir encounters ministers who argue for easing the fiscal rules, he has been heard to contemptuously dismiss it as “classic Labour” to seek a reality-swerving refuge from facing difficult challenges.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rather than soften his resolve on cuts to incapacity benefits in the name of getting people into work, his background appears to have strengthened the conviction that bearing down on the rising cost of the welfare budget is the right thing to do.

I know exactly what she means. Imagine you’re diagnosed with cancer. Do you think you’d look back on the moment as one of the best of your life?It sounds bonkers if you’ve not been through it, but it’s how I feel. My wedding day beats it. As does Stuart Pearce’s penalty against Spain in Euro ’96, Nottingham Forest getting promoted at Wembley and Oasis reuniting. But those are in everyone’s top five, so let’s set them aside.Eighteen months ago, I wasdiagnosed with cancer. Awful nerve pain in my left leg, which I presumed was sciatica, forced me to see a doctor. An MRI scan revealed a tumour at the base of my spine. They knew it was cancer, but weren’t sure if it was a primary tumour or had metastasised. It was bad news, but I didn’t yet know whether it was bad-bad or just bad. I had no idea how much longer I had to live. That precise moment will stay with me for ever. Because now I know how I really feel about death. Obviously, I’m broadly against it. But being forced to accept that I may have a limited time left clarified the point of life. And it wasn’t just to watch more football.I braced myself for the worst news. Like an old airport departure board, I saw the time I had left rapidly fluttering away. In seconds, I’d bargained myself down from 10 years to a few weeks and had come to terms with it. This rapid reckoning with existence was done calmly – there was no panic. I felt grateful to have lived and to have followed my passions. I wasn’t afraid of dying. The only thing I felt sad about was that I’d miss my wife. We’d only got married a few months before and it felt desperately sad that our story was going to end too soon. That aside, and of course it’s a huge thing, I had accepted my fate as a condemned man.Alongside this serene conclusion about life, something else happened. It was as if my body was talking to my brain. It was something beyond a thought, as if my mind wasn’t just in my head, but distributed equally through my whole body. My body was telling me: “Carve any part of us off in order to stay alive. Go through anything. Life is the point.” This was a phenomenal rush. I’ve never been brave – my housemate used to hide a toy rat just to make me scream.Yet here I was, calmly ready to leap onto a bandsaw, embracing whatever it took to stay alive.Even on days when I was gripped by pain I couldn’t believe the body could endure, I still laughed with friends who came to visitAfter weeks of limbo, I got my answer. I had a chordoma, a form of bone cancer that only one in 800,000 people get. Nice to be special. Surgery involved removing the base of my spine, which meant losing bowel, bladder and sexual function. It’s not that these things sounded inconsequential, or that I didn’t worry about what my life was going to be like. But compared with death, they were preferable. Although I accept that most things are preferable to death – apart from listening to Ed Sheeran.The 10 weeks I spent in hospital recovering from surgery were difficult in that they were often physically painful and, at times, I despaired. But even on the hardest days, there were moments of levity. For three weeks, I was in severe distress from catastrophic levels of nerve pain. But even on those days when I was in tears, gripped by pain I couldn’t believe the body could endure, I still laughed with friends who came to visit. My sides weren’t in danger of splitting, but the stitches holding my back together were. Laughter wasn’t the best medicine, but after morphine it did wonders.I’ve quickly adjusted to the changes to my body. My stoma is far easier to manage than I expected and hasn’t limited my ability to go to football matches or the pub. Plus, not pooping the old way has given me more free time – although I am reading less. To pee, I have to self-catheterise, which means using disposable catheters a few times a day. Yes, it sounds horrific. Thankfully, it’s not.Every few hours I have to push a tube down the hole in my penis until it reaches the bladder. I look like I’m loading an old rifle. When the tube is fully in, pee comes out the other end and when the flow stops, I gently withdraw it. And believe me, I do that very gently. I could teach bomb disposal squads a thing or two about keeping a steady hand under pressure.Erectile dysfunction can be embarrassing and talking about it can be hard. Sorry, soft. I’m 42, so it’s not something I thought I’d have to deal with yet, if ever. I’m still in the process of discovery when it comes to pills, pumps and injections. It’s miraculous what these things can do for a part of the body that was effectively pronounced dead. You don’t need the details of how I’m getting on, but let me put it this way: I’m now far less sceptical about the resurrection of Lazarus.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toObservedFree weekly newsletterAnalysis and opinion on the week's news and culture brought to you by the best Observer writersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A lot of the past year and a half has been difficult and distressing. At times, I felt petrified about my future. But it was also a life-enriching experience unlike anything else. I benefited from the love and care of exceptional nurses, doctors and hospital staff. Friends and family entertained me at my bedside. It has brought me and my wife even closer together.But the main thing it has left me with is a deeper appreciation of life. Being alive is wonderful. One day it’ll end, and thanks to this I know how I’ll feel when that day comes.

If this was recorded, organisations such as the NHS could still identify the sex of individuals, regardless of the gender they identify as. If people did not want that information shared they could elect to opt out, understanding it may put them at risk of missing out on screening programmes etc.The toxic debate around gender identity has stopped a sensible approach prevailing and caused a poorer experience for gender diverse people and those who continue to identify as the sex they were born. This is fundamentally about human rights and respect and dignity, all of which have been forgotten in this debate and in successive governments’ failure to act.Karen EdmundsAshford, KentOf course biological sex or sex assigned at birth is relevant when organising sex-specific medical checks such as cervical cancer screenings, but gender identity is also relevant. A trans woman who has been on hormones for several years will have different medical requirements to a cisgender male.We have a huge issue with male on female violence, but demonising trans people is not the answer. Women have enough to be scared of already, let’s not give them another reason to fear without reason.Bethan TannerCaerphillyThe cult of ScientologyRegarding your story about the Church of Scientology, the same sort of things happened to former Scientology members in California (“‘I’ve been getting 100 messages a day’: Church of Scientology accused of intimidating UK critics”, Investigation). This is not a religion, it is a cult founded by a mediocre science-fiction writer because he thought he could make more money founding a “religion” than writing. Its beliefs are so outlandish as to be laughable, and from what I’ve read of its adherents’ activities in California, it is all about having complete power over members’ lives. This cult should never have been allowed to gain a foothold as a “religion” in the UK.Rosemary AFletcher-JonesNew Milton, HampshireSuffragette’s cityI am the great-great-niece of Elsie Inglis, whose strength and fearlessness are endlessly inspiring to myself, my family, and hundreds of others who know her work (“‘A cultural embarrassment’: anger as male sculptor commissioned for statue of suffragist”, News, 16 March).When she asked the War Office if female doctors could serve in frontline hospitals during the First World War she was told “my good lady, go home and sit still”. Instead, she raised the equivalent of £53m in today’s money and set up 14 hospitals across Europe. What set Elsie apart was her perseverance, her courage, her self-belief, her persuasiveness and her ability to inspire thousands of others to follow her in her mission – saving countless lives in the war as a result. I have walked down Edinburgh high street with a small hand tucked in mine and I want my daughters to take inspiration, as I have, from Elsie’s fearlessness. At a time of unprecedented global challenge, women as unstoppable as Elsie are needed more than ever.Tamsin LejeuneLondon E5Chaste scenes can be sexyBarbara Ellen’s article about Gwyneth Paltrow and intimacy coordinators makes the valid point that when you are rich, powerful and well established you might not need what younger, more vulnerable actors do (“#YouToo, Gwyneth Paltrow? Intimacy coordinators make sex scenes safe for all, not just A-listers”, Comment).The easiest way to deal with the problem is not have scenes that require intimacy coordinators. I’m not advocating going back to the Hays Code (one foot on the floor). It can be done – surely no one can deny that the love inCasablancaorBrief Encounterwas intense, moving and realistic, yet they hardly took their raincoats off.GlenaChadwickCharlbury, OxfordshireAge cannot wither the BardKenan Malik exposed the narrowness and parochialism of much modern academic thought which claims that the plays of Shakespeare must be subjected to the nonsense of decolonisation (“Why decolonise Shakespeare when all the world’s a stage for his ideas on injustice?”, Comment).Those works that cannot reach across the divides of time are laid to rest. That is not a fate ever likely to befall our greatest ever playwright’s productions.No one can come away from exposure to the Bard without being thrilled by his language and uplifted by his intuitive grasp of the human condition.Denis BruceBishopbriggs, East DunbartonshireAll about the goalsJonathan Wilson says, “Qualifiers matter only in as much as they have to be negotiated” (, Sport). I have to disagree. Wilson is paid to watch football, but I have to pay to watch it. My return on my investment is centred on the hope that I will be entertained, see plenty of goalmouth action and possibly goals to boot. He goes on to say that England could have won 10-0.

He talks about why he would never have made it as a live action movieSun 30 Mar 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhen the acclaimed French film-maker Michel Hazanavicius was approached by his parents’ best friend, the author and playwright Jean-Claude Grumberg, to adapt his fairytaleThe Most Precious of Cargoes(2019) into an animated film, hehesitated. The short book is a fable about the Holocaust, and the extraordinary acts of kindness that people are capable of. Although moved by it, Hazanavicius was initially reluctant: he had never made an animated film, and he thought he would never make a film about the Holocaust. The grandson of eastern European immigrants who came to France from Lithuania and Poland in the 1920s, Hazanavicius, 58, had felt that the subject was not his to tell. “It was more my grandparents’ and my parents’ story, not mine,” he says, speaking from his home in the 10th arrondissement, Paris, the sunlight streaming through the window behind him. “I was born in Paris in the late 1960s, and I had a wonderful, very happy childhood.” That period, however, coincidedwith when Holocaust denial began and survivors, who had until then remained silent, started to speak out about their experiences in the camps. “For many years, the priority [of those seeking to preserve the memory] was hearing testimony from witnesses. And I thought fiction on the subject was not appropriate.”It was Hazanavicius’s wife, the actor Bérénice Bejo – who starred as Peppy Miller, an ambitious young actress inThe Artist, Hazanavicius’s Academy Award-winning film about Hollywood’s black-and-white silent era – who changed his mind. Bejo told him he had not explained enough about his family’s Jewish history to his four children, now aged 26, 23, 16 and 13, and she persuaded Hazanavicius to take on the project, not only for them, but also for other people’s children. “[I realised] that if I hadn’t told my kids stories about my family–how they came to France and what happened during the war – it was likely that other [Jewish parents] hadn’tpassed on [their heritage] either.”It’s impossible to show the lives, loves and dreams of 6 million people, and the cruelty or evilness of how they diedThe Most Precious of Cargoesfollows a poor woodcutter’s wife (voiced in the film by Dominique Blanc) who rescues a baby girl from the snow, thrown by her father from one of the many trains bound for Auschwitz that pass through the forest where she lives with her husband (Grégory Gadebois). The woman has lost her own child and, aware that the baby might be Jewish – she is wrapped in a tallit (Jewish prayer shawl) – she manages to convince her reluctant husband that they should look after her, despite the risks. As the circumstances and fate of the baby’s family become known, the little girl transforms the lives of the couple, as well as those whose path she crosses.Hazanavicius has described the story as ultra fiction. “To me, Grumberg’s story felt as if it had always existed, and I wanted the film to be in keeping with that.” It begins with, “Once upon a time…” (narrated by the late Jean-Louis Trintignant) and employs another device of the fairytale in not naming characters. “By doing so, it makes it universal,” says Hazanavicius. The film then gradually subverts the form by introducing historical reality into the story.View image in fullscreenFor The Most Precious of Cargoes, Hazanavicius drew all the main characters himself.Photograph: Ex NihiloThe Most Precious of Cargoes, which took more than five years to make, premiered at Cannes last year where it was nominated for the Palme d’Or. The critic Leila Latif, writing inIndieWire, said that the film was an “unflinching but elegant Holocaust fable”.The previous year at Cannes,The Zone of Interestwon the Grand Prix and the Fipresci prize for director Jonathan Glazer. Both films approach their subject indirectly. “It’s impossible to show the lives, loves and dreams of about 6 million people, and the cruelty or the evilness of how they died,” says Hazanavicius. Glazer’s technique is to convey the atrocities off-screen through the exclusive use of sound; Hazanavicius’s differs. “I try to activate the imagination or the knowledge of the audience through suggestion.”For their film, it was obvious to Grumberg and Hazanavicius that it would be an animated feature and not live action. “I would never have made it with live actors because of the subject matter,” Hazanavicius says emphatically. “We all know that Brad Pitt is not a spy, for example, but we suspend our incredulity. When representing theHolocauston screen this can be very uncomfortable, even obscene.If I make a shot with a deported man on a train going to Auschwitz, we all know that out of frame, if he [the actor] is hungry he’ll have some chocolate, and if he’s thirsty he’ll have some water. That is a problem for me.” The advantage of animation is nothing is real, he says. “The drawings do not lie. There’s nothing out of frame. The drawings are an evocation of something. Paradoxically, the drawings that are very far from reality might be more realistic.”View image in fullscreenJean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo in The Artist (2011).Photograph: Warner Bros/AllstarAn art school graduate, Hazanavicius drew all the main characters, “as an artist, not an animator. I draw in a very traditional way, using pencil and paper,” he explains, disappearing briefly to find examples of his black-and-white drawings, which include headshots of the woodcutter’s wife. “As I thought the book was a classic tale, the idea was to have classical animation, not 3D or Japanese style.”His initial vision was not dissimilar to early Disney films, but the rounded, childlike images did not seem appropriate for the story. He turned to French and Russian painting and was also inspired by the 19th-century Japanese artist Hiroshige’s use of heavy, black outlines and blocks of colour in his portrayal of people and nature. Eventually, Hazanavicius and his team of animators combined bold lines and colour with the engraving style of illustration, used by the artist Henri Rivière, one of the leading proponents of 19th-century Japonisme.There is little dialogue and what there is has been taken from Grumberg’s book, including the naming of Jews as “the Heartless”. At first, the gruff, antisemitic woodcutter wants nothing to do with the baby, even refusing to have her in his house. Eventually, when he touches her and feels her heart beating, he realises that the Heartless have a heart and he starts to discover his own compassion.I’ve done a lot of screenings with teenagers from a variety of backgrounds, and they have all been moved by itThe Oscar-winning composer Alexandre Desplat created the original score. “The music is a very important voice: it really contributes to the soul of the movie,” saysHazanavicius, adding that sound is also vital in telling the story. Is it a substitute for dialogue? “Oh yeah. Usually, as a director, for important things, I prefer to use silence,” he replies with a smile, a nod toThe Artist. Yet here sound is a mechanism for introducing real life: the crunch of footsteps in the snow, birdsong, the rustle of wind in the trees or the baby’s laughter. But there is something pragmatic too. “The woodcutters are simple men and women. They don’t speak much. And I didn’t want the deported man, the father of the baby, to speak. I mean, there’s nothing to say.”Hazanavicius grew up in Paris. After art school, he worked as a director on commercials and TV series, and in 1999 released his first feature,Mes Amis.Two spy parody films,OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of SpiesandOSS 117: Lost in Rio,followed, but it wasThe Artistthat catapulted him to global acclaim, winning five Academy Awards, including best picture and best director. He is currently adapting another book,The Third Hand, set during the first world war and the early 1920s.Watch a trailer for The Most Precious of Cargoes.Although work began onThe Most Precious of Cargoesprior to the Israel-Gaza war, it is being released during a time of global unrest and rising antisemitism. Have these factors affected viewers’ responses? “I don’t think so. I’ve done a lot of screenings with teenagers from a variety of backgrounds, and they have all been moved by it.” The only repercussion he has experienced is difficulty finding a US distributor, and discussions are ongoing. “Businessmen are not as clever as teenagers,” he says wryly.For Havanavicius, the message of the film is a very simple one. “It’s about the Righteous Among the Nations: the men and women who risked their lives to help others, who did the right thing. It says, we can all make that choice.”The Most Precious of Cargoesis in UK and Irish cinemas on Friday.

The time for conversations about the weather andI like your shoeshas passed – now, she says, is a time for talk that is large and unwieldy and circles the question she finds herself asking people a lot which is (she leans in): “What are you afraid of?”She’s at home in New York, in front of a grey screen set up to shoot her nanny’s audition tapes. Her nanny acts, her husband (Pulitzer prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts) acts, their little kids, well, act up – this is a house of love and drama, in which Coon mothers and frets and contemplates the end of the world. She grew up in Ohio, one of five kids – her parents adopted her sister, Morena, when Coon was three. Her father had almost become a Catholic priest before returning to run an auto parts store and her mother was a nurse who worked nights, so Coon babysat her brothers, did the laundry, played football, excelled. In 2010, she was cast in a Steppenwolf Theatre Company production ofWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolfthat transferred to Broadway. Though not usually a story associated with happy marriages, it was here she met Letts, 15 years her senior, and in 2013, following his emergency gallbladder surgery, they got married in an Illinois hospital. “Tracy’s hospital gown was off his shoulder. He was so high. My family kept saying the only way to get him to marry me was to drug him.” She chuckles. “It was a great wedding. The vows really put life and death just square in their middle.”At 44, following pivotal roles in prestige TV dramas, includingThe Leftovers,The Gilded AgeandFargo, plus films like Azazel Jacobs’sHis Three Daughters,The Nestwith Jude Law, and blockbusters including theAvengersandGhostbustersfranchises, she’s currently starring inThe White Lotus. And yet, she admits happily, most people have no idea who she is.View image in fullscreen‘I have a shape-shifting quality’: in the latest series of The White Lotus with Leslie Bibb and Michelle Monaghan.Photograph: Fabio Lovino/PR IMAGE“There is a precision in her that does not feel robotic,” Jacobs tells me, “but as a person on a real quest.” The women she plays often appear ordinary and competent, their cool beauty only occasionally cracking to reveal somebody tiptoeing right up to the edge of sanity. “There’s no vanity,” Law says over email. “There’s a joy and a thrill to the challenge in the moment, and a playfulness which makes it light and fun, even if the subject matter is hard and dark.” In a recent interview forTown & Countrymagazine, director David Fincher (who gave Coon her first feature film role inGone Girl) said: “It’s not that you remember Carrie Coon, but that you remember Carrie Coon was fucking great.”Memes abound of Coon’sWhite Lotuscharacter, Laurie, one of a trio of old blonde friends on a girls trip to Thailand, laundering their bitchiness through tight compliments and loudly slurping their drinks. It has ignited conversations about friendship, rivalry and a deeply feminine brand of toxic positivity. “One of the things all of my projects seem to be reinforcing this year – and I do find that the universe puts projects in your way when you have something to examine – is how, as we age, friendship is very difficult to maintain.” The show asks, she says, “not only ‘Are new friends better than old friends?’, but also the question of, ‘Are you willing to see past your ideas about a person to see the person who’s right in front of you?’”She can do that with her children, sometimes with her friends, but finds it trickier with her siblings. “I think that it would be probably wise for me, as an adult, to remember to always re-encounter someone and try to see them for where they are.”View image in fullscreenBlonde ambition: Carrie Coon wears jacket by Willy Chavarria for Adidas Originals; shorts and belt by Rochas.Photograph: Andrew Yee/The ObserverHer sister’s adoption was a long and expensive process, and while Coon was excited to have a sister, a four-year-old who had been selling sweets on the streets of El Salvador, the transition was complicated, and little psychological support was offered. In adulthood, “My sister was in the navy, she’s a veteran now – she has some mental health issues, and she’s in a system which is very overextended, and will be more so because of the cuts being made.” JD Vance is from Coon’s state, a fact that sharpens her response to him: “A completely unprincipled and power-hungry sell-out.” She pauses to elaborate, with precision: “They’re fascists.” In a very white town, growing up with a Latin American sister, an immigrant, “shaped all of my siblings as much as we shaped her”. It made Coon a more open-minded person and helped her become, she says, an artist. “I was a middle child and always really aware of how everyone was feeling. I was very sensitive about Morena and how she was moving through the world.” She became the go-between when her sister and mother fought, “and so that kind of adaptability, I think, lends itself well to being an actor. There’s a shape-shifting quality that comes naturally. Plus, I’m a good listener, and that’s definitely part of being an artist, or this kind of artist that I am.”Wait, let’s just talk quickly about Coon’s voice. This is a voice that is low and serious, and sounds like it comes not just from deep within her body but perhaps deep within the earth. Says Jacobs: “I witnessed something our first day of shooting I’m still trying to get my head around.” They shotHis Three Daughtersin script order, beginning with a monologue from Coon to camera, a long, unbroken take. “I saw an energy or spirit spill from her, spread to the other actors facing her, past the camera and, as I turned my head, I watched it hit each surrounding crew person, one after the other. People’s spines straightened. The overwhelming feeling was: this was real, what we are doing could matter, that we all needed to do our best to reach what Carrie had begun.”View image in fullscreenArresting performance: in Fargo, 2017.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyWhen did Coon find her voice? She worked hard on it, she says, first at graduate school, then at the experimental Roy Hart Theatre, where they told her humans can make any sound an animal can make. “You do all this wild creature work!” she says. It’s a subject that energises her, she waves around a glass of green juice. “In young people, you hear that vocal fry,” her voice thins and rises as if Paris Hilton has entered the room, “and what’s happening is people are cut off from their bodies.” Did I know, she asks, “babies can cry all night and not lose their voices, people who are dying can scream and not lose their voices. And yet our voices feel very fragile and precious when we have to use them in performance.” It’s important to really breathe, she says. “I’ve modelled that for my kids, so now I have really loud kids. But I wanted them to be able to feel their capacity, because it’s really liberating. And for women, in particular, that is power – to be in a room, to take up space.” Can she share a voice exercise with me? She straightens in her chair. “OK”.Together we put our hands on to our chests, and open our mouths very wide and round, and say, almost sing, Oh – My – Soul. “Feel it,” she says, serious now. “Shake your chest.” I’m not quite changed, but I am sitting taller.Coon first found her voice in herLeftoverscharacter Nora Durst, a woman enduring the loss of her family. “She was so unapologetic, which frankly, I’m still working on, so it taught me how to drop my voice into my body and have really fast emotional access.” Both in her work, and her life. A corner of the internet got excited recently, when on a podcast Coon described her marriage as open. In fact what she said (she clarifies, wearily) was, they were “open-minded” about monogamy. Less scandalous perhaps, but just as interesting.View image in fullscreen‘I had been taught that I had to control information to protect other people’: Carrie Coon wears overcoat by Patou; leather dress by Tod’s; shoes by Altuzarra; and earrings by Briony Raymond.Photograph: Andrew Yee/The Observer“If you are willing to talk to your partner about these very natural biological impulses, willing to have those conversations without feeling that your ego is threatened, everything changes.” What happens? “What’s on the other side of that is the fact that those opportunities and impulses often lose their charge entirely. Freedom is actually the most titillating and interesting offering there is to me.” It’s foolish not to acknowledge that our bodies are operating somewhere with an engine that’s not always conscious, she says lightly. “And I find that willingness just thrilling and arguably it makes my marriage much more stable.” The internet will be disappointed, I sigh, with this clarity about one of theatre’s premier power couples. “Join us for movie night, hey, who knows? I’ve always maintained I would love to have a second wife.”To shoot White Lotusshe moved to Thailand, away from her family, for six months. But, “when you get to step away from your life as a mother you get to appreciate it in a new way”. With every sunset swim, every leisurely meal, she was aware of the gift she was being given. “I got to just be the artist in the ivory tower, the thing men have done for centuries. Because of motherhood, women’s creative lives are often lived in fits and spurts. We are always being interrupted.” She discovered that, “having children feels like a deeply creative act that actually deepens my well of creativity. The act of producing a child – the depth of that is something that no male artist will ever really sufficiently have access to. So it is profoundly creative in that way.” But the “juggle” means she is regularly giving up opportunities in order to be with her kids, and compromising share space with Letts’s career.“My husband’s almost 60, entering this third act of his life and the kind of artist he wants to be. So I have to be compassionate about whatever that transformation will be.” How does that work within the relationship? Well, she says, “Tracy and I both are in recovery. He’s been sober for over 30 years, I’m now coming up on five, and the shared language is really helpful.” During the pandemic, when their eldest child was three, Letts would write, but Coon had little structure to her day. “It was wonderful to spend all that time with my son, and also very easy to have a glass of wine at three and then maybe the next day at 12…” She chose sobriety when she recognised this “inclination” that ran in her family, and while she’d never been interested in drugs and alcohol growing up, “I did go through some pathological lying, some compulsive skin picking. I had my own version of how I was not dealing with my feelings.”View image in fullscreenTriple threat: in His Three Daughters with Natasha Lyonne and Elizabeth Olsen.Photograph: FlixPix/AlamyIt was something she’d investigated at university, when a therapist helped her see that her skin picking was an “authenticity alarm”. “When you’re a kid, those impulse-control things are about self-soothing. We all have them. They’re just varying degrees of damage.” Eventually, she was able to confront why she was self-soothing. “And so I found that when my skin picking was really out of control, it was because I was either not living according to my values, or I was living my life in relationship to another person, having remade myself in the image that I thought they wanted from me. It wasn’t until I found myself in my own life, that that started to subside.” When was that? She winces bashfully. “When I met Tracy. I realised I hadn’t really trusted anyone before. I had been taught that I had to control information to protect other people, when in fact what I was doing was protecting my own ego. And I had to start to unpack that problem.” She could see that Letts could handle whatever she threw at him. “There was nothing I could say to Tracy that would make him mistake my behaviour for my morality. He saw me. He respected me as an artist and he respected me as a person. And he recognised in me a great potential, I think, to live a good life.” It was, she smiles, “satisfying”.Part of gettingolder, she says, is about the integration of self – as we understand all our different impulses and experiences they come together, and as an actor you can bring that knowledge to the work. “That’s why it was previously unfortunate that women were pushed out of the industry when they got to 40, because we were still in the process of that illuminating feedback loop that was just creating more energy and creativity and self-awareness, which would mean we had more to give as artists just when we were being cut out of the whole game!”Is that not the case any more? “Well, I think it’s shifting.” She reels off actors like Jean Smart and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Plus, “Women are often now the breadwinners in their homes, we are consuming art and art should be made for us!”The White Lotusalways features a clutch of older women, including, in this series, Coon’s group of wealthy friends, “who are forging connections by criticising the person who’s not there. And each one feels left out. This epidemic of loneliness is about feeling fundamentally left out and like you don’t know how to conduct yourself in order to belong. It’s always about not being, I think, totally honest about our feelings.” Why is that honesty so tricky? “Mostly it’s fear – fear of being judged, fear of being misunderstood, fear of being excommunicated. It’s always fear.”So, what is she afraid of? “I think about death a lot. Our complete denial of the climate catastrophe we’re in the middle of right now and what the implications are for our children. I don’t know how to prepare them for the world they will be living in, or dying in. The time for mitigation is over. We’ve blown past it. And now we’re facing either adaptation or suffering.” She’s travelled a long way from the Catholicism she was brought up with, and she’s unclear quite how to prepare her children for, “What comes to all of us, which is that everything you love will die and pass away. But I do feel like that’s part of my responsibility as a parent.”She’s preparing for uncomfortable conversations. She’ll tell them she insulated their house. She got heat pumps. “But we’re actually pacified by being preoccupied with our phones. It’s keeping us all exactly where they want us. We don’t have a way to fundamentally agree on the truth. Republicans are trying to take away education of history, so people have even less context for this information. And they’re then therefore really easily manipulated. It’s terrifying.” This is what scares her.We’ve gone over our allotted hour, of course, and Coon apologises (“You can imagine what fun I am at parties”), but we can’t just leave it there, the world smouldering, the self destroyed, phones eating our memories, so we reach for some small talk. In her deep, liquid voice she offers, “I like your scarf,” and suddenly, everything’s fine.The White Lotus, season three, is on SKY Atlantic and NOWStylist Alicia Lombardini; photograher’s assistant Hele Ho; stylist’s assistant Cyrenae Tademy at Chanelncrocs and Kayla Stephenson; set design by Shari Anlauf at Atelier Management; hair by Ben Skervin at Walter Schupfer Management using Color Wow; makeup by Rebecca Restrepo at Walter Schupfer Management; nails by Marie Barokas using Zoya; shot at Pier59 StudiosExplore more on these topicsThe White LotusThe ObserverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Elegant, spare, pristine, the Villa Empain in south Brussels seems little changed since it was built over 90 years ago.Yet this art deco masterpiece reopened only in 2010 after falling into ruin. Illegal ravers had scrawled on its marble walls and stolen its treasures, from radiator grills to a decorative fish that was the centrepiece of a fountain in the bar.Now restored to its former opulence, the villa is one of the highlights of Brussels’ year of art deco as the Belgian capital celebrates the artistic movement of the 1920s and 30s – and seeks recognition. Many people know ofBrussels’ art nouveau heritage: the sinuous curves and floral designs of thebelle époque. But fewer see the Belgian capital as a centre for art deco, with its geometric lines, luxurious materials and exotic motifs.“Not a lot of people know that Brussels also has a lot of amazing art-deco buildings,” Ans Persoons, secretary of state for urban planning and heritage for the Brussels region, told theObserver. Now she wants the Belgian capital on the map as one of the main European cities for art deco.Throughout 2025, the city is celebrating this heritage with events, conferences, open-door days and film screenings including, perhaps inevitably,The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece ofcareless people in the jazz age. The year will showcase landmarks such as the Basilica of Koekelberg, a pharaonic brick, concrete and stone church with feted modernist stained glass; and the Centre for Fine Arts (Bozar), designed byVictor Horta, who traded the flourishes of art nouveau for a sleek and streamlined style moderne.Few of the city’s art deco buildings had the near-death experience of the Villa Empain. It was finished in 1934 for Louis Empain, the son of Belgium’s answer to JD Rockefeller. His father, Édouard Empain, born into a modest family, turned a successful quarrying business into a wide-ranging business empire, building the Paris Métro, rail lines in Turkey, China andLéopold II’s Congo Free State– a project built at enormous cost in human lives.A wealthy young man, Louis commissioned from the star architect of the day, Michel Polak – who was already known for the Résidence Palace in Brussels – glamorous apartment buildings intended as a new way of living for the wealthy. The modernist complex survives today as offices, overshadowed by the glass and steel of the EU institutions.Louis, increasingly disillusioned with the trappings of wealth, barely lived in his villa, donating it to the Belgian state to use as a museum of decorative arts. But this plan was thwarted when the sumptuous marble villa was requisitioned by Nazi officers during the second world war.It was then given to the Soviet Union for its embassy, later serving as the Belgian HQ for a Luxembourg TV station. The Boghossian Foundation, founded by Armenian philanthropists, took it over in 2006, funding the restoration and reopening it as a centre for art and dialogue between eastern and western cultures.View image in fullscreenThe University Foundation, Brussels.Photograph: Credit: University Foundation, Brussels.In the basement, the villa is hosting an exhibition on art deco, showcasing posters, stained glass, ceramics and other objects of this turbulent period. Before and after the first world war, artistic movements were flowering everywhere: constructivism, cubism, Bauhaus, surrealism. “There were so many movements at the same time, in rivalry but also inspired by one another,” said Louma Salamé, manager of the Villa Empain. Good design, she said, was also more available to everyone through “a revolution of standardisation”, as items such as radios became mass produced.Artists such as the Belgian surrealist René Magritte or abstract painter Victor Servranckx, were not confined to the galleries – they were making wallpaper and ad posters. “We are very far from the cliche of a romantic guy dressed in black alone in his studio doing things for himself,” Salamé said. “The interbellum is a wonderful moment where there is no difference between artists and craftsmen, and they all want to work for society.”Above all, art deco celebrated modernity. It was a style adopted from capitalist Chicago to Soviet Moscow and in Shanghai, Beirut and Brussels. “Art deco is the first movement of a new global world,” Paul Dujardin, curator of the art deco year, told theObserver.The movement is typically dated from l’Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes in 1925 in Paris. But Dujardin, who ran Bozar for two decades, sees the first true art deco building as the Palais Stoclet in Brussels, an imposing marble mansion of asymmetric blocks, built from 1905. However, he does not see a particular Belgian style, pointing instead to his country’s “in-between hybridity”.He was speaking from the University Foundation, established in 1920 by Belgian diplomat Émile Francqui and future US Republican president Herbert Hoover, who had joined forces to provide food aid toBelgiumin the first world war. A meeting point for international scholars, with the ambience of an English private members’ club, the foundation remains a testament to US-European friendship, with star motifs on the walls as a tribute to the American flag.Persoons hopes Brussels’ art deco year will get people thinking beyond style and reflecting on the tumultuous times between the wars, when the euphoria of peace gave way to economic crisis and the rise of the extreme right. While she stressed that there is no direct message in the official programme, she said: “It can make us think about what we are going through today and how quickly we can take a wrong turn.”Explore more on these topicsArchitectureThe ObserverBelgiumEuropeArt (Education)F Scott FitzgeraldArt (Art and design)featuresShareReuse this content"

Alex Gibney, whose new documentary examines how ‘dark money’ became part of the American system, introduces the listGuy LodgeSun 30 Mar 2025 04.00 EDTLast modified on Sun 30 Mar 2025 16.21 EDTShareThis is a dire moment in the US. It’s a moment where there’s an opportunity for people with a lot of money to rip apart all of the guidelines enacted by the Roosevelt administration, way back in the day, to guard against the brutality of unfettered capitalism. Capitalists like to have all the power that they want, whenever they want it. They’re not much interested in democracy either, it turns out. Nor, apparently, the rule of law. The government is not the solution – it’s the problem. And now a vengeful president who just wanted a get-out-of-jail-free card is going topunish his enemiesand show us all how to destroy the American administrative state by using the big stick of Elon Musk’s chequebook.It reminds me of that moment inOnce Upon a Time in the West, when Henry Fonda sits behind the rail tycoon’s desk and says: “It’s almost like holding a gun, only much more powerful.” The US has always been about money. That’s been our blessing and our curse. It’s the land of great opportunity, but that obsession with money over everything else has now taken us to a very bad place. We’ve reached the dark side of the American dream.What you hope for is that a film will be a kind of a slow-motion timebomb in the psyche of the audienceAs a film-maker at this moment, I feel defeated in one sense: you always look in the rear-view mirror and wish your films had had a more lasting impact. Yet the fight for liberty and democracy is a never-ending one, so I’m still very much engaged. I’m reminded of what Salman Rushdie said at the Pen America World Voices festival in 2022: “A poem cannot stop a bullet. A novel can’t defuse a bomb. But we are not helpless. We can sing the truth and name the liars.”Art can always have an impact, but it isn’t Pavlovian. It isn’t a vending machine. A film won’t make someone go out tomorrow and pass a law. What you hope for is that it will be a kind of a slow-motion timebomb in the psyche of the audience, where they begin to reckon with essential human values. When I madeThe Crime of the Century, my documentary about the opioid crisis, I wasn’t thinking to instigate a particular kind of change. That wasn’t the purpose of the film. I was concerned that people tended to look at the crisis as something that just “happened”, like a hurricane. I wanted to emphasise that it was an intentional crime, in which people were literally killing people for money. It wasn’t something to be endured, but to be reckoned with. I wanted the film to help reorient the vision of the viewers.I’ve got a diptych of films coming out next month calledThe Dark Money Game, all about the power of dark money and how that’s become part of the American system. It’s about how white-collar crime is now almost legal: so long as rich people are stealing, it’s OK. And I’ve also been working for two years on a film about Elon Musk, to get at some deeper understanding of not only who this man is and why he’s doing what he’s doing, but also why we’re letting him. A lot of my films are crime films, in a way. It was Chekhov who said that if there’s a gun on the mantel in the first act, it had better go off in the third act. So very often I’m faced with the spectacle of a gun going off. My job is to look back to find the guns on the mantels.I’m naturally drawn to the film-makers who explore the dark side: the Scorseses of this world. And at a time such as this, you want to engage the darkness of the moment – but you also want films that reaffirm your sense of humanity. It’s not an American film, but I was deeply inspired recently by Walter Salles’sI’m Still Here, about surviving a military dictatorship: it was so finely observed and so deeply human. There’s always a way out. This is a pendulum and it swings back and forth. But, you know, if we don’t wake up, then it’s going to be a very long, dark period.Alex Gibney(as told to Guy Lodge)American Factory(Julia Reichert and Steven Bognar, 2019)Best for:a look at what the American workforce faces in a globalised economy.View image in fullscreenAmerican Factory.Photograph: NETFLIXAn Oscar winner for best documentary feature and the first film acquired by Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground production company, this perceptive, humane film examines the initial promise of a modified, modernised American dream, as an abandoned General Motors plant in Ohio is reopened by a Chinese company, only for the new owners’ labour practices and values to clash sourly with those of their working-class American employees. Shot between 2015 and 2017, it captures a country’s growing insularity at the outset of the Trump era.The Apprentice(Ali Abbasi, 2024)Best for:a primer on how the Trump mythos began.View image in fullscreenJeremy Strong as Roy Cohn and Sebastian Stan as Donald Trump in The Apprentice.Photograph: Profile Productions/Tailored FilmsFew were especially looking forward to a Donald Trump biopic from Iranian-Danish director Ali Abbasi when it premiered at Cannes last year: don’t we see enough of him as it is? But this period-perfect, video-grainy portrayal of his rise to celebrity in the 1980s is caustically gripping and insightful, as Sebastian Stan’s dead-on performance captures the chronic insecurity behind his bluster, while Jeremy Strong’s venal lawyer Roy Cohn models the behaviour of a toxic sociopath. A stark, shattering scene of Trump raping his former wife Ivana, meanwhile, was a gutsy inclusion.Bisbee ’17(Robert Greene, 2018)Best for:understanding how the US confronts its history, or doesn’t.View image in fullscreenBisbee ’17.Photograph: AlamyIn 1917, in the small Arizona mining town of Bisbee, more than 1,200 immigrant mine workers were kidnapped and illegally deported to the New Mexico desert 200 miles away. Robert Greene’s highly original hybrid documentary studies how the Bisbee of the 21st century processes this shameful history, as local people mark the centenary of the event by staging a grand-scale re-enactment that raises debate and dissent in the general community. It’s a wise, eerie reflection on how Americans can compartmentalise or rationalise the past – but also acts as a mirror for anti-immigrant sentiment in the present day. History is never fully over.Bowling for Columbine(Michael Moore, 2002)Best for:fuelling rage against US gun laws.View image in fullscreenBowling for Columbine.Photograph: AlamyThe obnoxiously hectoring documentary style of Michael Moore might now seem of a previous era, but in the 22 years since this ferocious polemic won an Oscar, the frank absurdity of the US gun crisis hasn’t been more vigorously addressed on screen. By now, mass school shootings such as the Columbine massacre are distressingly commonplace stateside; Moore’s restless, roving examination of its causes and effects still hits hard, and bitterly underlines just how little has been done to prevent such occurrences in the intervening decades.The Brutalist(Brady Corbet, 2024)Best for:a timeless dissection of the soured American dream.View image in fullscreenAdrien Brody in The Brutalist.Photograph: Universal PicturesBrady Corbet’s Oscar-winning, three-and-a-half-hour-plus epic might be set between the 1940s and the 1980s, but it has plenty to say to the 2020s, as it unfolds the plight of a Hungarian immigrant architect whose personal fortunes and creative ideals are gradually stymied by the Faustian allure of American capitalism. As a miserable east coast mogul seeking to own not just art but the artist, by dint of sheer wealth, Guy Pearce unnervingly encapsulates the ruinous entitlement of the 1%.The Crime of the Century(Alex Gibney, 2021)Best for:a journalistic exploration of the continuing US opioid crisis.View image in fullscreenThe Crime of the Century.Photograph: 2021 Home Box Office, IncWeighing in at nearly four hours overall, Gibney’s two-part documentary is as comprehensive a film as has been made on the opioid epidemic plaguing the US today, beginning with a look at how the Sackler family got OxyContin approved by the Food and Drug Administration, before getting into the mass marketing of fentanyl – taking on all manner of corporate corruption and human devastation along the way. If you can handle more rage against big pharma after watching it, pair it with Laura Poitras’s more emotive, award-winningAll the Beauty and the Bloodshed.Don’t Look Up(Adam McKay, 2021)Best for:summing up the divided US stance on the climate crisis.View image in fullscreenLeonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence in Don’t Look Up.Photograph: APAdam McKay’s brash, broad social satire split critical opinion a few years ago, but there’s resonance in even the silliest aspects of its farce, as it captures the grating, oppressive cacophony of a population at war with itself, even in the face of universally impending disaster. The environmental crisis isn’t directly addressed, but the metaphor couldn’t be clearer: a planet-destroying comet is headed towards Earth, but scientists can’t make Americans take heed over a din of debate, denial and political spin.Election(Alexander Payne, 1999)Best for:American electoral politics brought down to brass tacks.View image in fullscreenReese Witherspoon in Election.Photograph: Ronald Grant ArchiveAny number of films have been made about the complex vagaries of American electoral campaigns, but have they ever been summarised as simply and cruelly as they are in Alexander Payne’s lethally dark high school comedy? The stakes might be comparatively low in this anatomy of a midwestern student body vote, but try telling that to Reese Witherspoon’s indelible overachiever Tracy Flick – an analogue for every ambitious, capable woman ever deemed too unlikable to succeed by dominant male mediocrity.A Face in the Crowd(Elia Kazan, 1957)Best for:a prescient vision of the US media landscape at its most cynical.View image in fullscreenAndy Griffith and Patricia Neal in A Face in the Crowd.Photograph: AlamyNot a great success upon its release in 1957, Elia Kazan’s nearly 70-year-old media satire has enjoyed quite a revival in recent years – even being adapted into astage musical at the Young Vic last year. That’s because, its mid-century milieu notwithstanding, it speaks directly to the modern era of faux-populist celebrity construction and public manipulation. Its protagonist, Larry “Lonesome” Rhodes, a drifting Arkansas hayseed discovered by a New York radio producer and turned into a merchant of increasingly hypocritical homespun wisdom, is an idiot savant monster whose popular touch callsJoe Roganto mind.The Florida Project(Sean Baker, 2017)Best for:a slice of life on the poverty line.View image in fullscreenBrooklynn Prince and Bria Vinaite in The Florida Project.Photograph: Freestyle Picture Company/AllstarSeveral years before he stormed the Oscars with his sex worker storyAnora, Sean Baker received less than his due for one of the definitive modern portraits of poor white America, turning an attentive and compassionate gaze to a demographic often dismissed with cruel stereotypes. Playing out largely through the eyes of Moonee, the six-year-old daughter of an unemployed stripper barely surviving day to day in an Orlando fleapit motel, it avoids condescension as it shows us the wonder that the young girl routinely finds in squalor.Hale County This Morning, This Evening(RaMell Ross, 2018)Best for:an immersive, unsensationalised view of everyday life in the south.View image in fullscreenHale County This Morning, This Evening.Photograph: AlamyBefore switching to fiction with his recent, radical adaptation of Colson Whitehead’sNickel Boys, RaMell Ross made his name with this exquisite, Oscar-nominated mosaic of daily routines and rhythms among the predominantly Black residents of Hale County, Alabama. Interspersing carefully observed vignettes with more lateral poetic meditations, it was described by Ross as an “epic banal” work, aiming to “bring elation to the experience of blackness”. The film’s calm lyricism and granular detail stand out against other, more vocally political modern docs on that experience.Here(Robert Zemeckis, 2024)Best for:a telling boomer viewpoint on the US past and present, for better or worse.View image in fullscreenTom Hanks and Robin Wright in Here.Photograph: APRobert Zemeckis’s kitschy, AI-assisted graphic novel adaptation about centuries of American life playing out on one patch of land bombed in cinemas, and not undeservedly so – but I’m not sure I’ve seen a film recently that captures the stiflingly conservative family values of the modern US with more inadvertent accuracy, or the political overreach of white liberal worldview. (Its passages on Indigenous trauma and the Black Lives Matter movement are a veritable time capsule of cringe.)I Am Not Your Negro(Raoul Peck, 2016)Best for:bringing a fresh context to the history of US racism.View image in fullscreenI Am Not Your Negro.Photograph: Album/AlamyThis Bafta-winning documentary from Haitian film-maker Raoul Peck is based onRemember This House, an unfinished manuscript by trailblazing Black writer and activist James Baldwin, and brings vital visual information to his literary examination of racism in the US. Told via Peck’s own experiences and through reflections on the work and legacy of Martin Luther King Jr and Malcolm X, among others, it’s a fascinating history lesson bristling with modern relevance.In Jackson Heights(Frederick Wiseman, 2015)Best for:a celebration of American diversity.View image in fullscreenIn Jackson Heights.Photograph: Courtesy of Venice Film FestivalVeteran documentarian Frederick Wiseman is the foremost US chronicler of the country’s institutions and communities, whether in his midwest portraitMonrovia, Indianaor his exhaustive administrative studyCity Hall. But his most vital recent work is this vast cinematic patchwork of life in the teemingly diverse New York City neighbourhood of Jackson Heights, as its gaze takes in everything from a Muslim school to an LGBTQ support meeting to a Jewish community centre – adding up to a compelling study of how the US, at its best, can evolve to meet the needs of a changing population.Joker(Todd Phillips, 2019)Best for:a popular touchstone of current American masculinity.View image in fullscreenJoaquin Phoenix in Joker.Photograph: Dc Comics\\warner Bros./AllstarWhen Todd Phillips’s unexpectedly artsy, ambitious superhero spinoff movie premiered at Venice, scooping up the Golden Lion, the heated critical debates began: had he made the ultimate “incel” manifesto, or a snarling critique thereof? Six years andone flop sequellater and there’s still no consensus, not least because some audiences adopted Joaquin Phoenix’s downtrodden, mentally ill, ultimately murderous Arthur Fleck as an anti-woke icon and others recoiled from his toxic villainy.

Verhoeven’s original action blockbuster was an ice-cold, viciously satirical vision of American capitalism and militarisation heading towards an unholy worst-case scenario: a privatised corporate police force staffed by ruthless droids, with predictably dire consequences for humanity. Nearly 40 years later, it’s ageing horribly well: under Trump, its dystopian world-building seems only slightly far-fetched.Shy Boys IRL(Sara Gardephe, 2011)Best for:a snapshot of the origins of incel culture.View image in fullscreenShy Boys IRL.Gardephe’s viral short is scrappily shot and only half an hour long, but remains a definitive visual text in our understanding of what, in 2011, had not yet been popularly named “incel culture” – an online community of young men, frustrated by their failure to meet and date women, whose involuntary celibacy seeds an increasingly toxic view. Gardephe’s film, which has recently enjoyed a resurgence on TikTok, treated incels as a subculture then, but today looks prescient in identifying a far broader social phenomenon.Sound of Freedom(Alejandro Monteverde, 2023)Best for:an insight into rightwing blockbuster heroism.View image in fullscreenJim Caviezel in Sound of Freedom.Photograph: AlamyOn the face of it, Alejandro Monteverde’s sentimental search-and-rescue thriller is straightforwardly gung-ho stuff, following an intrepid homeland security agent (played byThe Passion of the Christstar Jim Caviezel) as he sets out to crack a child sex-trafficking ring in Colombia. But as produced and marketed by conservative faith-based entertainment company Angel Studios, the film became laden, intentionally or otherwise, with intricately coded QAnon conspiracy theories, and was championed by the right as a rejoinder to the supposedly reprobate output of leftist mainstream Hollywood. Sure enough, it was a sleeper hit, and there’s a lot to be learned from watching it.Stillwater(Tom McCarthy, 2021)Best for:a canny distillation of the culture gap between the US and Europe.View image in fullscreenMatt Damon in Stillwater.Photograph: AlamyPlainly inspired by theAmanda Knox case, Tom McCarthy’s quietly potent culture-clash thriller was unfairly written off by many critics, but there’s some acute wisdom in its portrayal of a gun-loving, blue-collar Oklahoma dad navigating the intricacies of the French legal system – and eventually taking his own roughneck revenge – to save his imprisoned daughter. It’s a criminal melodrama with blunt contrivances softened and complicated by Matt Damon’s knotty, humane portrayal of a character who would be easier to demonise.Strong Island(Yance Ford, 2017)Best for:a searingly personal account of the struggles of social integration.View image in fullscreenStrong Island.Photograph: AlamyIn 1992, Yance Ford’s brother William, a young, unarmed Black man, was shot dead by a white 19-year-old who claimed self-defence and was subsequently acquitted by an all-white jury. That might have been more than 30 years ago, but Ford’s pained, unflinching documentary points to enduring unequal treatment in its first-hand portrait of a Black family who anticipated a better life on moving to the suburbs of Long Island, only to find, ultimately, they were unwelcome outsiders. Ford, a trans film-maker, has a sharply intersectional understanding of minority identity; his film is both an elegy and a plea for change.Support the Girls(Andrew Bujalski, 2018)Best for:A snapshot of labour politics with a side of lively feminism.View image in fullscreenHaley Lu Richardson and Regina Hall in Support the Girls.Photograph: AllstarThere may be no brand more absurdly and quintessentially American than the lurid, unabashedly chauvinist “breastaurant” Hooters, and it gets a wicked send-up in this breezy but bittersweet workplace comedy, starring a wonderful Regina Hall as the world-weary manager of one such institution. Following her across her last two days of employment, and glancing upon the various crises of its female staff members, it’s a casually piquant skewering of unjust labour practices in a still-patriarchal society, and a warm valentine to the women who endure them.13th(Ava DuVernay, 2016)Best for:a thorough breakdown of the US prison-industrial complex.View image in fullscreen13th.Photograph: NetflixThe title refers to the 13th amendment to the US constitution, abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude – except as punishment for convicted criminals. In her first documentary, Ava DuVernay uses this caveat as the basis for a compelling argument that slavery continues to this day in the US prison system, further challenging the corporations that profit from it. With interview subjects ranging from activist Angela Davis to politician Newt Gingrich, it’s the most expansive and searching work of DuVernay’s career.Time(Garrett Bradley, 2020)Best for:an unromantic, long-view take on fighting the power.View image in fullscreenSibil Fox Richardson in Time.Photograph: APIf13thoffers an essayistic takedown of the prison-industrial complex, Garrett Bradley’s heart-wrenching documentary takes a more personal view of the subject, portraying Black abolitionist Fox Rich, AKA Sibil Fox Richardson, and her 20-year campaign for the release of her husband, Robert, sentenced to 60 years in prison for his role in an armed bank robbery. It’s a powerful study of systemic dysfunction and the lives caught up in it, but also a hard, realistic view of the exhausting grind of long-term activism.Us(Jordan Peele, 2019)Best for:an allegory for the class divide in the Black US.View image in fullscreenWinston Duke, Lupita Nyong’o and Evan Alex in Us.Photograph: APJordan Peele’s 2017 smash,Get Out, immediately established him as a leading Hollywood merchant of political commentary as entertainment, as it probed the threat posed to the Black population even by supposed white liberals. But this even better follow-up film got into thornier, more nuanced territory with its ingenious examination of American privilege, classism and gentrification, alongside its ramifications as visited upon a bourgeois Black family terrorised by their “tethered” underclass doppelgangers. It’s witty, frightening and rings violently true.White Noise(Daniel Lombroso, 2020)Best for:explaining the rise of the far right.View image in fullscreen‘Alt-right’ activist Lauren Southern and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes in White Noise.It’s cold comfort that the three principal subjects of Daniel Lombroso’s upsetting documentary on the surge of the “alt-right” movement in the US – Richard Spencer, Mike Cernovich and Lauren Southern – are no longer as prominent in the news as they were when the film was made five years ago: they’ve simply been surpassed by other toxic celebrities as white supremacy has expanded from the fringes to the mainstream. Produced by news publisher theAtlantic, the film works as an excavation of the movement’s roots, and is suitably pessimistic about where it’s heading.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverUS politicsDrama filmsDocumentary filmsRacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a hope, say officials at the Frick Collection in New York, which reopens next month after a five-year, $220m (£170m) renovation.Axel Rüger, the director of the museum, which began with a trove of European masterpieces including Rembrandt and Vermeer, hopes that its art could be a reminder of US-European ties in these turbulent political times.“We are approaching a time when culture and education are not seen as priorities,” said Xavier Salomon, the Frick’s deputy director, at a preview of the renovated museum last week. “It’s a huge mistake, in my opinion, and I hope a place like this gives people a chance to think about the role of culture in our lives.”The Frick, which started with the collection of Henry Clay Frick, the Robber Baron-era industrialist, has long been an oasis from the intensity of the city – a home in a grand style but domestic in overall feel. Now it could be something more – a reminder that European culture and leadership was once held in high esteem by the ringmasters of US power.Reluctance by European travellers to visit the US has yet to show in official figures, as it has for Canadian visitors, but Eric Dresin, the secretary general of theEuropean Travel Agents’ and Tour Operators’ Associations,told theNew York Timeslast week that “turbulent times” are anticipated.The museum’s old-world charm, updated by architect Annabelle Selldorf, now comes with additional galleries on an upper floor. It includes Ingres’s portrait of the Comtesse d’Haussonville and George Romney’s 1785 paintingLady Hamiltonas “Nature”, as well as François Boucher’s wall panels of frolicking children.“The whole collection, ultimately, comes from Europe,” said Rüger, newly installed as director of the Frick after serving as the secretary of the Royal Academy of Arts in London and the curator of Dutch painting at the National Gallery in London.Rüger notes that Frick, a Mennonite from Pennsylvania who made his fortune in steel, “first gravitated to English art and the aesthetic of the English country houses. It was not as intentional as it sounds now, but Americans looked to their ancestors, and a lot came from Europe.”View image in fullscreenAxel Rüger, the new director of the Frick Collection, pictured at at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam when he was the director.Photograph: Sabine Joosten/Press Association ImagesThe museum reopens as reciprocal tariffs, while not specifically targeting art, loom over a market already depressed by high interest rates, inflation, geopolitical instability and a shift in tastes. Global dealers are this weekend in Hong Kong, at Art Basel, hoping to lure Chinese and Asian buyers back into the market dominated by US sales.At the same time, the Trump administration is threatening to gut theInstitute of Museum and Library Services, which provides funding for museums and libraries across the US. Keith Sonderling, acting director of the agency, said he plans to steer it toward promoting “American exceptionalism” and cultivating “love of country”.Last Thursday Trump issued an executive order – “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” – promising to eliminate “divisive narratives” from the Smithsonian Institution’s museums and National Zoo, and restore “monuments, memorials, statues, markers” that have been removed over the past five years. A fact sheet describing the order said it will focus on removing “anti-American ideology”.In June the Frick will unveil Vermeer’s Love Letters – the Frick’sMistress and Maidand two loans,The Love Letterfrom the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, andWoman Writing a Letter, with Her Maidfrom the National Gallery of Ireland.Salomon said no one is sure the ladies are writing or receiving love letters, per se, but the themes of letter writing and epistolary exchange in 17th century domestic settings are intact nonetheless. “They may be shopping lists, who knows?”“Art from the past is always relevant, and as history changes around these works they assume a different significance,” Salomon said, pointing to Rembrandt’sThe Polish Rider, in the Frick collection, which acquired the title long after it was painted. It became a symbol of Polish freedom fighting and more recently, on loan to Poland, a symbol of support of Ukraine’s resistance to Russia.Explore more on these topicsMuseumsThe ObserverArtnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s presumably been flammed together for the occasion via the miracle of AI, but the point it’s making about succeeding beyond one’s wildest dreams is clear. More than 30 years into his career,Usherhas sold out a staggering 10 nights at the O2: the crowd seems to be equally split between people old enough to remember his late 90s rise to fame and those you suspect may have first encountered his music through their parents playing it. As he skips between old-fashioned slow jams and the kind of EDM-influenced pop-R&B that temporarily held sway around 2010, you’re struck by the sense that his longevity might be down to his ability to neatly assimilate whatever’s currently vogueish into his own sound.His current world tour follows on the heels of two Las Vegas residencies, and a distinct hint of Vegas lurks around the show, both in its desire to cram as many songs as possible in – there are well over 40 tracks, or at least parts of them – and in its penchant for glitzy spectacle. Like Vegas itself, it’s not really at home to subtlety. This is an evening in which Usher deploys his impassioned falsetto while rollerskating around the stage wearing a union jack suit; in which he underlines his loverman credentials by feeding ladies in the audience cocktail cherries; in which a pair of high-waisted trousers that appear to be made entirely out of studded belts teamed with a bare chest and a selection of chains and medallions Isaac Hayes might have considered a littlede tropconstitutes one of his more understated outfits. He wears it to perform one of the aforementioned old-school slow jams, Nice and Slow. “I’ve got plans to put my hands in places I’ve never seen,” he sings: lest anyone mistakenly believe that means he’s thinking of sticking them down the back of the radiator, he lubriciously caresses his privates, then pretends to have sex with his microphone stand.View image in fullscreenOn top of his game … Usher.Photograph: Gus Stewart/RedfernsYou have to say that he’s wearing middle age incredibly well. The impassioned falsetto is fully intact and the bare chest draws appreciative female murmurs when it appears: at 46, and four children in, there’s no hint of a dad bod. Moreover, it’s a show that strikes a perfect balance: it’s both completely preposterous – at one point, the big screens puzzlingly seem to suggest that Usher actually retired in his early 20s and what we’re watching is some kind of computer-generated Usher replicant – and preposterously entertaining. You’re certainly never bored: rather, you’re left in little doubt he’s at the top of his game, even as wonder what on earth he thinks he’s playing at.Usher is the O2, London, until 7 MayExplore more on these topicsPop and rockUsherreviewsShareReuse this content"

The painting depicts Thomas Coram, founder of the Foundling Hospital in London’s Bloomsbury district. A shipbuilder by trade, he is portrayed in full baroque garb, a style usually reserved for the aristocracy. But amid the classical architecture and rich fabrics, he is shown as he was: the thread veins on his face, his feet not quite touching the ground. The setting is apt for Dacus’s disquisitions on life and love, and the ways they can exceed, or fall short of, the expectations we place upon them: the moments that feel exalted, idealised, as well as the times when reality intrudes on the fantasy.TheFoundling Museum, the setting of tonight’s intimate show, also holds a deeper meaning for the singer-songwriter, who was raised in Mechanicsville, Virginia by adoptive parents; the mother who raised her was herself adopted from an orphanage at a young age. “I had nothing like this growing up,” says Dacus to the assembled crowd. “We don’t have the concept of a foundling in the US. It would have been cool if the other kids at school had known that was fine.” The previous day, after her photoshoot in the museum’s grand-looking court room, she is visibly moved upon learning about the building’s history, and its current work training care-experienced young people. She asks the organisers about inviting some of the trainees to the concert: it would, she says, be a way of showing them “hey, I’m doing cool shit – you can do cool shit.”The cool shit in question is the kind of life most teenagers dream of. Signed to Matador in 2016, aged 21, Dacus has been crafting sumptuous, emotionally astute music straddling folk and indie rock since the release of her debut,No Burden. Two critically acclaimed albums followed, producing singles such as immaculate breakup anthemNight Shiftand the yearning, Springsteen-esqueHot & Heavy. A through-line of her discography is the arresting interplay between her agile, velvety voice and often unsettling lyrics: on the quietly devastating Thumbs, inspired by the time she accompanied a friend to meet her estranged, abusive father, Dacus imagines placing her thumbs on the man’s eyes, “pressing in until they burst”.View image in fullscreenDacus with Phoebe Bridgers (left) and Julien Baker of Boygenius as they accept the best rock performance award at the Grammys in 2024.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/APIn 2018, she joined forces with Californian Phoebe Bridgers and Tennessee-born Julien Baker, two songwriters who share her enthusiasm for 90s alternative music, ethereal harmonies and dry internet humour, to form supergroupBoygenius. After a self-titled EP, their chart-topping 2023 debutThe Recordwas nominated for seven Grammys, winning three of them; the group made history as the first all-female band to win best rock song and best rock performance. The group also won a Brit, and the band’s first UK gig, a sold-out25,000-capacity showat London’s Gunnersbury Park, has also been their biggest to date. They replicated Nirvana’s historic 1994 cover shoot for aRolling Stoneinterview, in which the magazine called them “the world’s most exciting indie band”. They are currently on hiatus. “The goal is not a repeat of that experience,” says Dacus, sipping green tea in a room downstairs, under a different Hogarth painting. “The reception toThe Recordoutpaced what any of us expected. Then the time since then – thank God we’ve stopped. It’s nice to chill a little bit.” A later question about the band is met with: “Let’s skip it. Because it’s not about them.”Dacus’s focus today is firmly on her accomplished new solo album,Forever Is a Feeling, an intensely personal record that should crystallise her reputation as an important artist in her own right. In the run-up to its release, Dacus has deliberately scaled things down, playing a selection of tiny gigs in boutique, atmospheric venues: the neo-gothic Vondelkerk in Amsterdam; a candle-lit show at the Église Saint-Eustache in Paris, where she dedicated a song to her girlfriend (“I wonder if that has never been done in this building,” shemused, eliciting cheers). For the first time, she has had the money and resources to invest in an elaborate aesthetic for the album, which centres largely around classical art. The cover is a Renaissance-style oil painting of Dacus by artist Will St John; in the video for lead singleAnkles, she is a portrait who has come to life and escaped from her frame, wandering around Paris in a custom-made Rodarte gown.The portrait imagery reminded many of Céline Sciamma’s film about forbidden love,Portrait of a Lady on Fire, but it may also be a reference to a key part of Boygenius lore: the time that Baker found Dacus reading Henry James’sThe Portrait of a Ladybackstage at a show they played together in 2016. Fans have fervently speculated about Dacus and Baker’s relationship, which, while not exactly kept secret, has until now never been confirmed or denied. Several lyrics onForever Is a Feelingcorroborate what many had long suspected: “You knew when you caught me reading at your show”, goes Big Deal; elsewhere, the “most wanted man in West Tennessee” nods to Baker’s hometown of Memphis.I was feeling all aspects of falling in love and out of love and moving and missing people and finally admitting the truthWe meet on the day the news goes public, in the narrow window between the publication of aNew Yorkerprofile, in which Dacus confirmed she and Baker are “in a committed relationship”, and the story being picked up by gossip sites and social media. Before long, memes had been spawned, as well as a portmanteau (“Jucy”). Was it a difficult decision to write about her personal life on the album, knowing how invested many people would feel? “It wasn’t a choice to write the songs – that’s just what I have to give, though I guess it’s a choice to share them,” she says. “There’s this vague uneasiness to opening up that much. I can never tell why it feels scary, because ultimately, I feel secure in my relationships … I don’t love being perceived.” She looks down, slightly shrinking in on herself. “I hope the record speaks for itself, and that people will find it. That will matter more than anything I can say.”Fans excited by the announcement might be alarmed by some of the lyrics. There is good sex in hotels and wrists in zip ties, but also minor betrayals and possibly bigger ones; faces are contorted in anger before tender gestures are exchanged. Both parties make mistakes: “I’m not sorry, not certain, not perfect, not good,” sings Dacus on Lost Time. The excellent, spiky singleTalkis about a relationship that may or may not be in its death throes: “We run out of conversation / Day runs out of light”. Written and recorded between 2022 and 2024, the songs show relationships at various stages, encompassing the rush of first love as well as the meaner, darker moments not usually aired in public. “I was just feeling all aspects of falling in love and falling out of love and moving and missing people and revelling and finally admitting the truth. It’s all very big things.”The central thesis of the album is that, even if a relationship does not last forever, the feelings experienced in the moment are of immense value. “I love your body / I love your mind / They will change / So will mine,” Dacus sings on Best Guess, acknowledging that the future is unknown; throughout, the lyrics reconfigure the conventional wisdom of “till death do us part” into something more modern and realistic, based on choice rather than obligation. “Life is non-consensual,” she says. “You get brought into this world. You did not ask to be. You learn whatever language you’re hearing, you usually take on the religion you’re raised in. That’s part of why I think love is so powerful later in life, because you basically get to bind by choice with people; you share enough experience that there’s a bedrock that makes it enjoyable or rich. Love with a partner – that’s like saying, we are family now, and I choose these obligations to you, and I happily take on whatever that requires of me.”This concept also extends to her family arrangements. Growing up, her schoolmates’ reference points for adoption were tales of tragic orphans, likeOliver TwistorAnnie, but she never saw it that way. “I felt very special, because the emphasis was not on the fact somebody didn’t want me, it was that somebody was honest that they couldn’t take care of me.” After meeting her birth parents aged 19, she is now good friends with her birth mother; they recently went to a Heart concert in LA together. She is close to her adoptive parents, a pianist and music teacher and a graphic designer. “You can build a family by choice and not just blood. Societally, maybe people look down on it, but I am my parents’ child – the parents who raised me. We are family, and there’s no second best or diminutive follow-up to that. It’s just a good thing. I wish more people considered it an option for their lives.”In person, Dacus emanates a sense of calm that belies the analytical self-excoriation in her songs. Emotions and relationships are discussed with reverence, but a sharp sense of humour often lurks beneath the surface (when I ask what body part she’ll write a song about next, after Thumbs and Ankles, she deadpans: “Head”). The care that has gone into every aspect of the album is apparent in the way she talks about it. There is a new intricacy to the arrangements, greater introspection in the lyrics; from the cover art to the cinematic music videos, there is an increased emphasis on artistry and detail. “I’m a bit burnt out on all the digital art that is happening,” she says. “I wanted to work with people who have high skill levels and craftsmanship. It’s connected me back to why people make art in the first place.”I wanted to work with people who have high skill levels and craftsmanship. It’s connected me back to why people make artShe is frustrated by mounting pressure to incorporate AI elements into creative processes. “I don’t care, basically, whether AI would or wouldn’t create good art,” she says with an exasperated eye-roll. “The environmental impact alone should be enough to have people stop. And also – you want a shortcut to art? You want to have made a product, you don’t want the internal process. That’s the entire reason for me. I would never be able to sing a song that a robot wrote. It breaks my heart that some people would forgo the chance to actually get to know what they have to say.”On the album, she sings about feeling alienated by the music industry: “I was in a boardroom / Full of old men guessing what the kids are getting into… I don’t belong here, nobody does” (Come Out). She recalls being in rooms with people who have no interest in her music, but view her as a potential paycheque: “Sometimes people are upfront about their want to make money off of you. Some people try to disguise it.” Putting out music now, compared with when she started, “is a lot less fun. And I love fun – I take fun seriously. Life should be bringing you joy.” The heightened cynicism and negativity on the internet can sometimes take its toll. Although her fans are generally “really sweet”, the increased visibility brought by Boygenius has made her a bit more guarded. “Other people do expect performance from you. It doesn’t feel good sometimes if you’re having a personal moment, and people basically make it a professional moment by wanting to film you.”View image in fullscreenThe cover art for Lucy Dacus’s latest album, Forever Is a Feeling.Photograph: UMusicLast year, her friend Chappell Roanspoke outabout fans’ intrusive behaviour. Has it made a difference? “One hundred per cent. We were in New York one time, and that was the least I’ve ever been talked to in New York – it was with her. So I think people are really listening.” Dacus believes we should start to think about fandom in a new way. “I have abstract care for the fans, and I genuinely feel that they care about me, even though we don’t know each other at all. That doesn’t even mean we know how to have a conversation when we’re together, but still, there’s something sweet there. Most people have good intentions.”Many of Dacus’s values, she says, stem from her upbringing in the church. “There was a huge emphasis on service: painting fences, babysitting, making food for people. There’s a lot about growing up in the church that made it hard to get to know myself, but that was a really good part of it.” These days, though she no longer considers herself religious, she still has “a lot of reverence and curiosity”. One lesson Christianity taught her is the importance of not giving in to hatred, something that can feel increasingly difficult. “I do think it’s important to try for love. Maybe a useful distinction is hate versus anger. I’m extremely angry and frustrated and disgusted, with lots of people in power and bigots in general. But hate to me feels like it’d be more of the same if I just hated them back.” (When I ask about the 1975 singer Matty Healy, whom she had apublic falling out withafter he tweeted an offensive joke about her band’s name, she says simply, “We’re not in touch.”)I have friends whose passports are being ‘corrected’, and people whose IDs are being held so they can’t get out of the countryOne of the topics Dacus has been vocal about is the situation in Gaza: Boygenius woreArtists4Ceasefire badgesto the 2024 Grammys and have attended pro-Palestinerallies, which has led to some backlash. “Sure, but it doesn’t matter. There are some opportunities that I’ve lost, but the idea that I would take them anyway… I don’t want them. You have to look back on your life one day and try to be proud of yourself.” Two days after Trump’s inauguration, she announced she would begiving away$10,000 for trans people’s surgery costs. “I currently have friends whose passports are being ‘corrected’, and people whose IDs are being held so they can’t get out of the country. I fear for the physical safety of the trans people in my life, particularly non-white trans people – I fear for immigrants getting deported. It’s just so heartless. What are you trying to defend? What is this country you speak of?”Watch the video to Best Guess by Lucy Dacus.At the start of May, Dacus will turn 30 – a decade she’s looking forward to, whatever it holds. If her 20-year-old self could see her life now, she says, she’d be “really weirded out. If I was given the choice, I would have to really think about it.” If she could give herself a piece of advice at that age, it would be: “Don’t be so loyal that you bring assholes along for the ride. Get real about people who don’t treat you well enough.” Her main ambition for the future is to keep doing things she is proud of, not necessarily in music but “other fields and art forms, including farming and cooking”. She hopes to spend more time in LA, where she moved in 2023, despite the “apocalyptic” fires earlier this year. “I want to plant a seed and then see it become something. I want my life to be still enough and reliable enough that I can do that.”Later this summer, she’ll be playing Glastonbury, another experience to add to her “cool shit” portfolio. “That, I guess, is a bucket-list thing. I hear it’s kind of a dirty experience: a muddy, weird time. I’m sure I’ll be dripping sweat and it’ll be a riot.”Forever Is a Feelingis out now via Interscope.

For a decade, he has covered Donald Trump and the Republicans. In March 2015, an Isenstadt dispatchblared: “GOP hopefuls rush toward starting gates.” The story made no mention of the man who would win the 2016 election, lose in 2020, then win again in ’24.But like all political reporters, Isenstadt has now mentionedDonald Trumpplenty.Revenge, Isenstadt’s first book, is aptly titled. In office only two months, Trump has already made settling scores and torching enemies a hallmark of his second term.At a speech to a joint session of Congress, he used Joe Biden as punching bag and foil. Now, he declares that pardons issued by his predecessor are “void” because Biden maybe used an autopen. Whether Pam Bondi, Trump’s attorney general, brings charges against recipients of those pardons – Hunter Biden, Liz Cheney or Anthony Fauci – remains of course to be seen.Bondi once said, as Isenstadt recalls, that if Trump won, “the prosecutors will be prosecuted” and the “investigators will be investigated”. In that spirit, Ed Martin, acting US attorney for DC,unsuccessfully attempted to push a federal grand juryto indict Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, for remarks made in 2020 about Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, two of Trump’s picks to the supreme court.Tom Cotton gingerly steps on Trump’s toes as he eviscerates TikTok in bookRead moreTrump and his followers claim to be committed to freedom of speech. In reality, it’s not just graduate students with green cards who labor under the gun.Revenge is a delectable smorgasbord of scoop, dish and bile. A luridly fascinating read, it jauntily describes the efforts of Trump and his minions to gut, fillet and disembowelRon DeSantis, Florida’s humorless governor whose short-lived bid for the 2024 Republican nomination quickly morphed into a joke.Beyond beating DeSantis, Trump strived to humiliate him. And succeeded.“To anyone who listened, Trump would tell the tale – and who the hell knew how much of it was true,” Isenstadt writes. “DeSantis came to the Oval Office, ‘tears in his eyes’ to plead for his endorsement.“‘He was like a beggar,’ Trump told people aboard Trump Force One in June 2023, as he blasted Sinéad O’Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U from a portable speaker … ‘I could have said, Drop to your fucking knees, Ron.’”You’ve got to love seeing Trump, DeSantis and Sinéad O’Connor in the same sentence.Isenstadt also captures the Trump campaign rehashing a litany of the governor’s stranger moments: shoving chicken fingers into his jacket, clipping his toenails in the back of his security vehicle, or “the time he had a bathroom mishap aboard an airplane”. Revenge does not elaborate on that last item, which is probably a good thing.Snack food emerged as Ron’s achilles heel. In the same nausea-inducing spirit as Senator Amy Klobuchar reportedly eating a salad with her comb, DeSantis was said to have snarfed pudding with his fingers during a flight in 2019.“I don’t remember ever doing that,” DeSantis told Piers Morgan. “Maybe when I was a kid.” Pro tip: if you’re running for president but denying you’re an awkward slob, you’re losing.“Trump didn’t just want to stop DeSantis from winning the Republican nomination,” to quote Isenstadt. “He wanted to destroy him and make it impossible for him to run for anything ever again.”Mission accomplished.Isenstadt also examines the on-again-off-again relationship between Trump andRupert Murdoch. According to Isenstadt, their interactions were moored in profit and convenience. During Trump’s bid for the nomination in 2016, the New York Post, Murdoch-owned, denied Trump the respect he craved. When DeSantis vied for the nomination in 2024, Murdoch appeared to be in his corner. That wounded Trump’s ego.“That Rupert is such a piece of shit, he’s so cold,” Isenstadt captures Trump thundering, privately. He castigated Murdoch in public too, accusing him of “aiding and abetting the DESTRUCTION OF AMERICA”. As for James Murdoch, Rupert’s son? “He’s a crazy fucking liberal,” Trump complained to Tucker Carlson.Other sources bolster Isenstadt’s take on Murdoch and Trump. According to Fire and Fury, Michael Wolff’s first bestseller that birthed a genre, Murdoch called Trump “a fucking idiot”after the two men ended a call. InThe Fall, Wolff’s Murdoch book from 2023, Wolff wrote that Murdoch frequently wished Trump dead, despite the fact he was a monster Murdoch helped create, and who made him even richer.“Of all Trump’s implacable enemies, Murdoch had become a frothing-at-the-mouth one,” Wolff wrote. “Trump’s death became a Murdoch theme: ‘We would all be better off … ?’ ‘This would all be solved if … ’ ‘How could he still be alive, how could he?’ ‘Have you seen him? Have you seen what he looks like?’”Fast forward. Trump is living large, while Murdoch’s life mirrors Succession, the HBO hit about vicious family rivalry that was based squarely on … the Murdochs.In conclusion, Isenstadt argues convincingly that “revenge” remains the byword for the secondTrump administration. He reviews ABC’s $16m settlement of a Trump defamation suit, and the consumer fraud complaint Trump filed against Ann Selzer, the Des Moines Register and its parent company, Gannett. Selzer’s pre-election Iowa poll “so angered him” – because she had Kamala Harris ahead. Defendants have moved to dismiss the lawsuit. Trump’s opposition is due by 28 March, with briefing by all parties by mid-April.Isenstadt also recalls that HouseRepublicansreleased a report calling for Liz Cheney, once their own congresswoman from Wyoming, to be investigated by the FBI for her work on the January 6 committee. She too received a Biden pardon.Trump responded by posting: “Cheney could be in a lot of trouble.” Isenstadt ends on an ominous note: “His quest for revenge appeared under way.”Revenge: The Inside Story of Trump’s Return to Poweris publishedin the US by HachetteExplore more on these topicsBooksDonald TrumpTrump administrationRupert MurdochRon DeSantisRepublicansUS politicsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The Moscow-born director, 70, plans to use Dickens’s two storiesGreat ExpectationsandHard Timesto create a new performance.Arriving in London this weekend for a short stay, Krymov, who is regarded by many western theatre pundits asamong the best directors in the world, told theObserverhe wants to link British and Russian performers and audiences, despite the divisions caused by President Vladimir Putin.“It is because of this that we wanted to create our Dickens show,” he said, before the first of his acting workshops. The rehearsals have been set up by Margaret Cox, the writer and producer who is also the daughter of the ScottishSuccessionstarBrian Cox, in collaboration with one of Krymov’s former students, Lucie Dawkins of Scrum Theatre in Hammersmith. “My brother, the actor Alan Cox, and I have long admired Krymov, so we have been supporting him in any way we can,” said Cox.Krymov hopes to create more of the kind of cultural exchanges that have recently been blocked both by sanctions and bad feeling towardsRussia. His anger and sorrow at leaving Moscow, where he was a key cultural figure, are now a driving force behind his work, he said, although he recognises the pitfalls of using entertainment to send out a political message. “It’s a process. Expressing your pain in artistic form is not easy at all; you just want to shout out what you think in direct, unprintable text,” he said.His period of exile, which began when he signed a letter of protest in 2022, the day after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has given him new energy, he suspects. “As the saying goes: ‘What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger’. So, I hope to prove with my activity now that we are in this unexpected crack in the earth’s crust, that not everything is subject to the laws of physics. In other words, I try not to fall into the abyss, but stage performances on the crack’s edge.”That February day three years ago, Krymov had flown to the US with his wife, Inna, ready to carry on work on a production of Anton Chekhov’sThe Cherry Orchardin Philadelphia. But on landing, friends and concerned colleagues back in Moscow warned him it would now betoo dangerous to returnto Russia.I try not to fall into the abyss but stage performances [are] on the crack’s edgeDmitry KrymovIn an interview with the broadcaster Voice of America, Krymov compared the threat of the invasion to that posed by the second world war. Immediately, seven of the nine different shows he had running in theatres across Moscow were shut down. His name was removed from the posters of the remaining two; they have now also been closed.Until that point Krymov had been both critically admired and popular in Russia, famously using experimental techniques and winning many Golden Masks, the equivalent of an Olivier award or a Tony award on Broadway. He is also the child of well-known parents; a director, Anatoly Efros, born in territory now inside Ukraine, and a critic, Natalya Krymova.Krymov, who took his mother’s name, had already been critical of Putin, signing an open protest letter after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, but he had been left to work relatively unchecked.As an exile, he travelled first to Latvia, France and Israel, before settling in New York and setting up an actors’ workshop there. He has since argued against strict cultural boycotts, which he sees as potentially counterproductive. “The desire to destroy everything Russian on a national basis is also nationalism,” he has said.During his stay in London this week, Krymov will answer questions after a screening of his showВсе тут, or “Everyone Is Here” – based onOur Town, a classic of American theatre by Thornton Wilder – at Ciné Lumière South Kensington.View image in fullscreenA scene from Everyone is Here.Photograph: Yury BogomazThis weekend he said he was looking forward to gaining an understanding of British talent, adding that all actors who move from a film set to the stage of a theatre are moving “from Disneyland to an empty space”.He had, he added, no clear idea of London’s theatrical style yet, although he has seen the difference between Broadway and off-Broadway shows. “In the Russian tradition, people come to the theatre in search of answers to questions that concern them, while on Broadway, people come to have a good time.”In Russia, he said, he hoped that, despite the war, “the basic need to hear something important, something not written in the newspapers or said out loud, will still remain.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreThe ObserverRussiaUkraineBrian CoxCharles DickensAnton ChekhovEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not that he’s afraid of getting hurt. Quite the opposite, since a rare genetic abnormality means he’s unable to feel pain. Rather, Nathan is concerned that because of his sensory quirk he risks inadvertently injuring himself. When the girl of his dreams, sparky fellow bank employee Sherry (Amber Midthunder), is abducted during a heist, and Nathan embarks on an off-the-cuff rescue mission, his unusual condition suddenly comes in handy.While Nathan may feel no pain, the audience certainly does: this is an amped-up, cartoonish blitzkrieg of ultraviolence and – fair warning – a bit of an endurance test if deep-fried fingers and snapped bones give you the ick. Directors Robert Olsen and Dan Berk take a sadistic glee in dreaming up extravagant horrors to inflict on their irrepressibly chipper central character. Quaid’s personable screen presence holds things together, even as his brutally beaten body starts to fall apart. But this gory action comedy has just one joke, and like poor, battered and bleeding Nathan it starts to run out of juice.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for Novocaine.Explore more on these topicsAction and adventure filmsThe ObserverComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

While a deeper reckoning seemed to have begun in the past few decades – statues toppled, archives scoured, reparations debated – the global rightward lurch has seen a renewed reluctance to connect past crimes with present privilege. Lashmar’s book makes that connection impossible to ignore. Unlike broader studies of Britain’s colonial economy, such asMatthew Parker’sThe Sugar BaronsorMichael Taylor’sThe Interest(to both of which Lashmar acknowledges a great debt),Drax of DraxHallnarrows its focus to a single family, showing that the Drax dynasty did not just profit from slavery but pioneered its brutal processes.James Drax, the family’s 17th-century patriarch, was not merely a plantation owner but the founder of a system of control and punishmen. Arriving inBarbadosin 1627, he was instrumental in shifting the island’s labour force from white indentured servants to enslaved Africans. By the 1640s, he had devised the plantation model that would dominate the Caribbean for centuries – a vast industrial machine, extracting staggering wealth through calculated cruelty. At the height of their power, the Draxes enslaved up to 330 people at any one time. The violence was staggering: life expectancy for the enslaved on the island was just five years. Lashmar makes clear that, while figures such as Clive or Rhodes may loom larger in the public imagination, James Drax deserves equal, if not greater, infamy as one of history’s great profiteers of human misery.Drax of Drax Hall is an indictment of a nation’s refusal to reckon with its pastAnd yet, while slavery was abolished, the Drax fortune was not. Henry Drax, an 18th-century descendant, inherited not only land but a ruthless business acumen, ensuring the family’s grip on power remained unbroken. WhenBritain compensated slave owners for their “losses” in 1837, the Draxes collected more than £4,200 – a staggering sum at the time. With that money, they pivoted from colonial extraction to domestic consolidation, expanding their English holdings and further entrenching their wealth. The plantation may have been built in Barbados, but its profits were banked in Dorset and the City of London, where they remain to this day.Which brings us to Richard Grosvenor Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax, the latest in this long line of beneficiaries, who until 2024 was Britain’s wealthiest MP (he lost his seat; the cash is still there). From his vast Charborough estate – surrounded by the so-called “Great Wall of Dorset” – Drax built his career on Brexit and hard-right politics, railing against progressive taxation while presiding over a fortune directly linked to slavery. “I can’t be held responsible for something that happened 300 or 400 years ago,” he has insisted, yet he continues to reap its rewards. Now, as Barbados’s prime minister, Mia Mottley, pushes for reparations anddebates whether to seize Drax Hall– the family’s still intact Caribbean plantation – Drax is resisting, hoping that Britain’s role in slavery will once again fade into obscurity.Lashmar follows the money, tracing the profits from sugar plantations to country estates, from enslaved labour to inherited privilege. If the book has a flaw, it is its exhaustive approach – at times, the sheer number of minor Draxes can overwhelm.Drax of Drax Hallis not just a look into the dark sources of one family’s fortune; it is an indictment of a nation’s refusal to reckon with its past. Lashmar’s book is a necessary, damning reminder that the ghosts of empire are not distant – they are living, breathing and, in some cases, still collecting rent.Drax of Drax Hall: How One British Family Got Rich (and Stayed Rich) from Sugar and Slaveryby Paul Lashmar is published by Pluto (£25).

A decade later, in her mid-80s, her sons put this cognitively and physically enfeebled woman into a state-run nursing home, whose French name –établissement d’hébergement pour personnes âgées dépendantes– makes it sound nicer than it was.After only two months in this institution near Reims, swollen legs preventing her leaving her bed, still less her room, her mind ailing and her sons’ answering machines filled with tearful late-night messages from a bewildered woman, she died.Eribon contests the idea that his mother’s death was what was called “unconscious suicide”. For him it was willed. “She could herself see this diminishment and she surely knew that it was irreversible… And yet she went on repeating, ‘When I’m feeling better’ or ‘When I’m well again’.” Eribon, a sociology professor at the University of Amiens, is alert to what his peers call the “ritual drama of mutual pretence” that neither speaker nor hearer really believe.In truth, hers was a death foretold. The admitting doctor had warned Eribon that for new arrivals there was a high risk that, uprooted and alienated, they would quickly die. The French speak ofun syndrome de glissement, a slide to death prompted by utter hopelessness.It’s not true, though, that his mother’s life was entirely unhappy. In widowed dotage, she took a lover called André. But André ended the affair because, perhaps understandably, he could not handle her evident decline. Alone again, she took respite in mad fantasy. “I don’t remember if I told you that I’m expecting a baby,” she tells Eribon one day. “I don’t think that’s possible at your age,” he replies. “That’s what I thought, but in any case I’m not going to keep it.”Although I was often in tears reading this heartbreaking account of his mother’s decline, Eribon often writes drily, obliquely. I’m not even sure what his mother’s first name was. He comes sidelong at his grief and guilt. He quotes writers – Beckett, Ernaux, Solzhenitsyn, Coetzee – and his great philosophical mentors – Foucault, Sartre, De Beauvoir, Bourdieu – to comprehend his loss.This method has the virtue of underlining the unbearably universal nature of one woman’s death and its meaning for those who live on. After leaving his mother at her new home, he recalls the opening lines of Beckett’s novelMolloy. “I am in in my mother’s room. It is I who live there now. I don’t know how I got there. Perhaps in an ambulance…” Eribon doesn’t draw the moral but it’s clear: we know that when our parents die, we’re next.Deploying his own wide reading has another purpose: it honours his mother. After all, she paid for his education, doing overtime for pin money so that this internationally celebrated intellectual could do something she was never allowed to do: flourish.Eribon is wonderful when he directly expresses his anger. He rages over his mother’s treatment in that nursing home“I am fully aware that it is both in opposition to her and thanks to her that I became who I am,” Eribon writes. “I have been ashamed, obviously, and for a long time now, of the selfishness and ingratitude I displayed.” It’s not obvious: others would be more shameless.And yet this is a finely nuanced portrait, not least when he visits his ailing mother and struggles to confront her habitual racism. In her toxically lucid moments, he recognises, she expresses hateful views to wind up her liberal intellectual son. But how can an oppressed woman from a working-class background be so hateful to persecuted minorities, he asks himself. He finds the answer in Pierre Bourdieu’s law of conservation of social violence: people who experience violence reproduce it against others. Nigel Farage’s electoral success, I thought reading this, exploits this law.Much of the book echoed for me that of another sociologist, Richard Hoggart, who, in The Uses of Literacy, described scholarship boys who went to grammar school as eternally “uprooted and anxious”, cut off from their class, guilty about their self-perceived social betrayal. Eribon is their kin, with an additional turn of the screw: as a gay boy discovering his sexuality cruising Reims parks, he became doubly removed from his heteronormative proletarian roots. His earlier memoir,Returning to Reims, was a theatrically adapted bestseller, but figures here as a source of guilt: perhaps what he wrote was class betrayal by a deracinated intellectual exploiting a world that he had, by the skin of his teeth and the toil of his mother, avoided.For all the obliquity, Eribon is wonderful when he directly expresses his anger. He rages over his mother’s treatment in that nursing home. The civilisation of western Europe, after all, is indicted by the barbarism of overrun, understaffed nursing homes. Eribon finds staff so overworked that they are unable to care effectively for residents who, for their part, feel like prisoners deprived of rights or tenderness. “It is question of abuse,” he writes. “There is a profoundimmoralityin the whole system. That is the word that needs to be used over and over:immorality.”While his mother lies dying in a nursing home, Eribon’s inbox fills with messages predicated on his recent search history, inviting him to invest in private care homes. “Cynical advisers who talk about this ‘market’ use the term ‘grey gold’. Each time I come across one of these images, I feel sick to my stomach.”The great virtue of Eribon’s memoir is that it compels us to confront our fixation on youth, our sweeping of elderly people to the margins, how we treat them not as humans but as business opportunities. All of these bespeak a blind, narcissistic and callous society. He asks profound questions that are at once philosophical, deeply personal and topical: can the completely dependent speak for themselves – and if not, who can speak for them? How does our society treat the elderly? Shabbily is Eribon’s answer to the last of these.The Life, Old Age and Death of a Working-Class Womanby Didier Eribon (translated by Michael Lucey) is published by Allen Lane (£22).

The Stath vehicles that work best tend to be the ones that deliver a wink to camera along with a punch to the throat; films that embrace the inherent absurdity of the British star as well as his ability to convincingly dismantle a Russian mafia militia using just his fists and the decorative, wall-mounted skull of an ox.Statham’s latest picture, in which he stars as Levon Cade, a retired marine turned building contractor required to dust off his murder skills and rescue the kidnapped daughter of his employer, delivers on face-pulverising mayhem. But the fun is undermined by dialogue that is overmasticated, Russian-accented word mulch. In the end,A Working Mantakes itself rather too seriously for a movie that unironically uses Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata as a recurring musical motif.In UK and Irish cinemasWatch a trailer for A Working Man.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe ObserverJason StathamAction and adventure filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

She acts it too. This is not as rare as you may imagine. The desolated lover’s winter journey is an accommodating masterwork. Actor-singers including Håkan Hagegård, Mark Padmore and Simon Keenlyside have performed staged versions too, establishing for all except diehard purists that a traditional male voice and piano recital need not necessarily be the only way with Schubert’s bleak setting of Wilhelm Müller poems.DiDonato takes this a step further by inhabiting the songs from the standpoint of the woman whom the poet has deserted. Many women, includingAlice Coote, have performed these songs with searing authenticity, but DiDonato’s theatrical skills bring something more. Costumed in black mourning, she sings each song from the poet’s journal, giving her voice to the verses within. Only at the end, in Schubert’s totemic final song, Der Leiermann (The Organ Grinder), does she put the journal aside and own the song outright, and with it the whole cycle’s pain, as her own.It is ingenious artistry, characteristic of DiDonato, and it enabled her to confront not just one, but two, of Winterreise’s challenges. One is that the poet’s journey is already so vivid as to demand some characterisation from any singer. The other is that it allows DiDonato to feminise the cycle in a particularly original way. To borrow Wagner’s term, her approach felt like aGesamtkunstwerk– a total work of art.There was innovation too in the fortepiano accompaniment by Maxim Emelyanychev (who conducted DiDonato inHandel’s Agrippinaat the Royal Opera in 2019). The instrument’s drier sound brought special brittleness to the haunting Der Lindenbaum (The Linden Tree) and an appropriate spikiness to Letzte Hoffnung (Last Hope). But not even Emelyanychev could produce the terrible finality that a modern piano brings to the postlude to Das Wirtshaus (The Inn).Did this add up to too many distractions? Occasionally that thought flickered. Yet Winterreise is big enough to take new approaches. It helps that DiDonato’s voice can still conjure so many colours and shades as she achieves in songs like Irrlicht (Will o’ the Wisp) and Rast (Rest) or such emotional vulnerability as in Der Greise Kopf (The Hoary Head). Her shock at the poet’s self-dramatisation in a song like Der Wegweiser (The Signpost) felt truly raw.Yet the emotional climax of the evening was yet to come. An encore after Winterreise is extremely rare, but DiDonato told the audience she wanted to give them a bit of hope amid these abnormal times of grief and chaos. We all knew exactly what awfulness she was referring to. When she sang Richard Strauss’s Morgen! (Tomorrow!), with its message that tomorrow the sun will shine again, it was a message that cut to the heart – and the memory of it still does.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicWigmore HallJoyce DiDonatoreviewsShareReuse this content"

It mentions a painting he’s known since his Liverpudlian childhood, still sitting above his 92-year-old father’s mantelpiece: “Dapple-bruised Welsh horses, painted in a loose herd, are imagined beneath a sky that promises rain.”From 1998, on commutes from Liverpool to the University ofWales, Newport (where he led a documentary photography degree), he noticed similar horses – completely by coincidence. “I didn’t seek them out at first, but on my drives, I soon got aware that they were there. Sometimes up a valley’s road, you’d see packs of 40 or 50.”You’re rewarded by staying with subjects over time, seeing any kinds of changes or shifts, slow dismantlings or initiationsSome were descendants of animals once used in mining; other herds would have pre-dated industry; either way, they now roam wild and free. Grant’s horses sit, lie, nuzzle each other and look directly into his lens. He became struck by the creatures’ hardiness in all seasons. “They’re beautiful, observant, built to last – they let things happen around them. They became a loose metaphor for me for thinking about communities in these areas – communities built around a particular purpose which is not active any more in any shape or form, but which carries on, having endured all those upheavals, and the shifts that have taken place in the land.”View image in fullscreen‘You’re made aware that something’s still happening’: a playground next to a former steelworks, Ebbw Vale.Photograph: Ken GrantThe horses in Cwm (the name of a mining village Grant photographs and a Welsh word for valley or steep-sided hollow at the head of a valley) act like solid anchors among images of striking environments. Harsh hills, often pillaged by industry, sit behind pale, pastel rows of terrace houses. A photography studio sits in an old building, its front wall soaked with stormwater. An old playground sits quietly alongside the site of a demolished steelworks.There are signs of development – new redbrick houses and road improvement projects – between the battered allotments and ruined buildings. “It struck me how strongly these roads are built to take people past a place,” Grant says. Moving on from Newport in 2013, he has to-and-froed between Wales and Liverpool ever since, often returning to the same places – like the village of Beaufort, named after a duke who originally owned the land, and Manmoel Common outside Ebbw Vale, high on a ridge, near abandoned quarries.View image in fullscreenMare and foal, near the ironworks, Blaenavon, 2022.Photograph: Ken GrantMid-century Czech photographer Josef Sudek inspired this approach. “There’s a lovely phrase of his – ‘rush slowly’ – about how you’re rewarded by staying with subjects over time, seeing any kinds of changes or shifts, or slow dismantlings or initiations. You’re made aware that something’s still happening, or you’re reminded to find something again.” Other influences include the American photojournalists W Eugene Smith and Robert Frank, and people closer to his experience in Wales, such as West Wales-based photographer Paul Cabuts and photographic historian Ian Walker.The book’s subtitle is a nod to Alexander Cordell’s bestselling 1959 novelRapeofthe Fair Country, about the iron-making communities of Nantyglo and Blaenavon before the Chartist uprisings in Wales. Best known as a photographer of people within places (in series such asNew Brighton RevisitedandShankly), Grant talks warmly about those he has met in these communities (“there is a beautiful temperament and decency in these people”). He’s also done a project simultaneously in the area about pub football teams (“It’s as much about football as it is about men navigating being part of something that their dads were part of”).View image in fullscreenAllotments in Cwm.Photograph: Ken GrantThe only people we see inCwmare walkers, on the edges of frames, often in startling landscapes. “People use and walk through these places just because they’ve walked through them for centuries,” Grant says. He also loves the vivid colours of the land, the saturated browns, yellows and greens that partly come from the wetness of the Welsh weather. This resilience and richness, he says, is part of everyday life.“I’ve got a lot to be thankful for in Wales,” he adds. He’s now living back in Wirral, near his father, but his daughter lives in Cardiff, so he still has a reason to take strange, cross-country diversions. “The beautiful, gentle landscapes and full-blown mountains in which people still live – it’s still incredible, even in the winter, when it’s quite tough. But in the time of year we’re in now, I love watching how everything comes alive.”Cwmspeaks to the same, startling spirit.Cwm: A Fair Countryby Ken Grant is published by RRB Photobooks (£45)Explore more on these topicsPhotographyThe ObserverWalesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She’s barefoot against a hard, cracked floor. And yet Achta Derib’s pose in this photograph by Antonio López Díaz, a finalist in the professional sports category at theSony world photography awards, suggests reserves of determination that will carry her across continents to perform at the highest levels of her sport.For Díaz, who has been documenting her journey since 2019, Derib’s story “stands as a symbol of resilience”. She was one of hundreds of girls from Chad who joined a pioneering gymnastics class at a school outside the capital, N’Djamena. Set up in 2016 by a Chadian Jesuit priest and a Spanish club president, with support from Spain’s Ramón Grosso Foundation, the class was the first of its kind in the central African country, where nearly half the population lives below the poverty line. Chad lacked gymnastics facilities, and the idea of a girl becoming a professional athlete in a country where female social mobility is extremely limited – three in five women are married before the age of 18 – seemed fanciful.Nonetheless, Derib excelled in the class and in January 2020 she and three other 11-year-old girls moved to Spain to step up their training, staying on after Covid hit despite being thousands of miles away from their families. Their most ambitious goal, to compete at the 2024 Paris Olympics, proved elusive but the team came fourth at last year’s African gymnastics championships in Marrakech, with Derib reaching the finals of the uneven bars and finishing ninth in the competition overall.As the maths-covered blackboard in Díaz’s photograph intimates, gymnastics was only part of the equation. Moving to Spain meant that Derib and her peers got to continue their education, a rare opportunity in Chad where the female literacy rate is below 20% and only two in five girls complete primary school. Their achievements have proved inspirational back home: Chad now has five registered gymnastics clubs and a national gymnastics federation to help other aspiring athletes reach their potential – “something unthinkable just a few years ago”, says Díaz. At a time when the world’s richest countries are slashing aid budgets, Derib’s story is a reminder of how even modest interventions can prove hugely transformative in the lives of talented young people the world over.The 2025 Sony world photography awards exhibition is at Somerset House, London from 17 April to 5 MayExplore more on these topicsPhotographyThe big pictureGymnasticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A typical dinner was one of a spicy noodle dish glowing red with chilli followed by a pale and gently flavoured panna cotta. A sort of whip-and-kiss effect that followed that of the week’s see-saw between icy mornings and blissful afternoons with the sun on our backs.I used two hits of chilli for the noodles – a thick, brick-red Korean paste in which to toss the strings of noodles hot from their steaming water and then flakes of dried chilli added to the breadcrumbs I used to finish the dish. A double hit of chilli, but still producing an effect that was warm and aromatic, rather than blow-your-socks-off hot.Noodle dishes in this house tend to be last-minute affairs, often prepared after a rummage in the cupboard. This one had more thought behind it, a need for something crisp with the soba noodles brought seasoned breadcrumbs to the recipe, the soft white crumbs toasted until crisp with chilli flakes and sesame seeds. An idea that also dealt with a slightly past-its-best loaf.The panna cotta followed my favourite version, stirring in buttermilk after infusing the cream with cardamom pods, bashed with a heavy weight to release their fragrance, but served with a spoonful of passion fruit seeds on top.Noodles with sesame breadcrumbsYou can use soba or matcha noodles here, whatever you have around. I would normally suggest you don’t use spaghetti for a recipe that clearly isn’t Italian – it just seems wrong – but, in this instance, it will work well enough if that is all you have to hand. Use whichever chilli paste you fancy. I like the thick Korean-style paste for this, but just use your favourite. Recipes such as this one are very much a suggestion, rather than a blueprint that must be stuck to word for word.Serves 2.

Warm the oil in a shallow pan and cook the garlic over a low heat until pale gold and fragrant. A matter of 3 or 4 minutes, stirring from time to time. Remove from the heat and scoop the garlic out on to kitchen paper with a draining spoon.Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil and salt it generously. Once it is boiling, lower in the noodles and cook at a rolling boil until they are tender, but toothsome (check the packet timing as it can vary). Drain the noodles in a colander and set aside.Prepare the breadcrumbs: place the empty garlic pan (adding a few more tablespoons of oil if necessary) over a moderate heat and add the breadcrumbs, cooking them in the garlic-scented oil until they are crisp and golden brown. Move them around the pan regularly to ensure they colour evenly.Stir in the sesame seeds and chilli flakes and continue cooking for a minute or two. Tip them out into a dish, then wipe the pan with kitchen paper.Chop the spring onions, return the pan to the heat, adding a little more oil if necessary, then scatter in the spring onions. Let them cook for a couple of minutes until soft, then stir in the chopped tomatoes. Bring to a bubble, then stir in the chilli paste, chopped coriander and lime juice. Season generously with salt, then stir in the noodles. Toss with the toasted breadcrumbs and the reserved, crisped garlic, then transfer to a bowl or shallow dish to serve.Panna cotta with passion fruitView image in fullscreen‘As the little desserts cool, they will get firmer, so are best eaten the day they are made.’Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverIt is crucial to pour the mixture through a sieve, which will achieve a much smoother result. Make sure that the buttermilk is never heated – it will curdle – and that it is only just warmed by the cardamom-scented cream. As the little desserts cool they will get firmer, so are best eaten the day they are made.Serves 4.

Crack open the cardamom pods and extract the seeds, then crush them to a coarse powder using a pestle and mortar. Put the cardamom in a small, nonstick saucepan with the double cream and sugar, and place over a moderate heat. Bring the cream almost to the boil, then remove from the heat, cover with a plate and leave to infuse for 30 minutes.In the meantime, soak the gelatine in a bowl of cold water for 10 minutes, or until it has become soft.Warm the infused cream gently, stirring continuously, for 2–3 minutes, but on no account let it come to the boil. Lift the gelatine from the water and drop into the cream, stirring with a wooden spoon until it has dissolved, then remove from the heat.Pour the cream through a sieve suspended over a jug. Stir the buttermilk into the cream, then pour into the ramekins or cups and refrigerate for 4 hours or until lightly set.Halve and squeeze the passion fruit over the panna cotta.

Sushi and sashimi from £2 per piece, small dishes from £3, larger dishes from £10, beer from £3.50, sake from £6.50We only get to truly value excellence by experiencing what it is to fall short. In politics. In sport. But also in food. How many times my heart has sunk as I’ve opened a miserable portion of fast-food sushi, limp and flimsy to the touch, dull in colour, the fish supposedly raw and yet partially cooked in its plastic enclosure. But when you taste the real stuff in all its glory, you know what you’ve been missing. So my excitement surges as our salmon sashimi arrives at Shiki, an independent Japanese restaurant in the centre of Norwich. Each of our four slices is plump, fatty, firm, glowing and juicy. Unusually, I dial back the wasabi in the soy sauce to let the fish dominate.Yet it’s not the silky freshness of the salmon, unencumbered by an unnecessary dollop of sticky rice (which for me always makes sushi second-best), that most grabs my attention. It’s the staggering sight of my 86-year-old father, chopsticks tightly gripped, preparing to stab his fish – a technique unusual, not very Japanese, but not at all hesitant.View image in fullscreen‘Plump, fatty, firm’: salmon sashimi.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverBorn in Norwich, growing up with the rations-era restricted tastes of many of his generation, my dad is well travelled, but always prefers a roast, doesn’t really want chilli or spice in anything, and spent a decade living in Italy while claiming throughout that he didn’t like pasta. Until now, he has always matched Gordon Brown for raw-fish aversion, but no longer.Gordon, another cautious eater who definitely knows what he likes and doesn’t, had a better excuse for fearing sushi. Once, at a finance ministers’ dinner in Tokyo, he made the classic error of mistaking a wasabi blob for a harmless garnish and then had to style out the consequent mouth explosion without causing a scene (beyond excessive sweating).For my dad, the embrace of sushi and sashimi is a truly damascene conversion. Appropriately biblical, given this canteen-style restaurant is situated in the corner of an ancient and cobbled square in the shade of the towering spire of Norwich’s majestic cathedral. For close to 1,000 years, stalls and sellers have thronged these narrow “Tombland” streets, selling goods and victuals – though I’m pretty sure Shiki is the first restaurant across all those centuries to tempt passing worshippers to try a taste of Japan.View image in fullscreen‘Smoky and soft’: mackerel sushi.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverWe’ve nabbed the only spare table in the cosy downstairs room, in anticipation of it becoming even more crowded in the more spacious upstairs. The menu is longer for dinner, but there is lots of lunchtime choice – from the sushi bar to an array of noodle, soup, bento box and meaty options. We follow our sashimi with some mackerel sushi from the specials menu. It is smoky and very soft with a subtle flavour that grows in the mouth and would certainly be overpowered by even a little wasabi. Exhausted by his harpooning adventures, my dad crunches on edamame beans as we discuss the Norwich City line-up (it’s two hours to kick-off at Carrow Road, a 20-minute walk away).Annoyingly, Shiki is out of pork gyoza, but the vegetarian alternative, which I hesitate to order, is good, with a spinach-infused pastry and a mild vegetable filling that certainly benefits from wasabi in the soy sauce. We slurp excellent miso soup, spicy with proper seaweed, but without the bottom surface of gunge you get in second-rate places. We then order a portion of tempura, another dish that separates the best Japanese restaurants from the also-rans. The batter is light, but fabulously crunchy and clings well – no limpness here either. The choice of vegetables is wide – courgette, asparagus, sweet potato and red pepper – and all perfectly cooked. You should never have to chew tempura.View image in fullscreen‘Benefits from wasabi in the soy sauce’: vegetable gyoza.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverWe wash our array of starters down with my favourite combination: cold Asahi beer and a small flask of warm and nutty sake. I know the connoisseurs say sake should always be drunk cold. But I’m not a connoisseur and I don’t.As we munch, we reminisce. Japanese restaurants have a special place in our family rituals. My wife, Yvette, and I have been to the same yakitori bar every year to celebrate our now 26 years of marriage. A special family treat when the kids were small was teppanyaki – great shrimp and steak seared on an enormous hotplate, followed by flambéed ice-cream.View image in fullscreen‘Light, but fabulously crunchy’: vegetables in tempura.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverIndeed, it was in a Leeds Japanese restaurant that our then 13-year-old son famously broke from the food caution inherited from his granddad – a diet of sausages and nuggets – by ordering chicken yakisoba noodles with chilli. We all sat staring with open mouths, disbelieving but silent in case we jinxed it, just like I am today watching dad try sushi.I remind him that Shiki in Norwich was the last restaurant I went to with my mum, before her dementia became too much and she moved into a Norwich care home. On that occasion, she had reacted extremely negatively to the idea of an outing to a Japanese restaurant, but thankfully had forgotten all about that by the time we arrived there an hour later. With dementia, you just have to close the wardrobe door, take a moment, then open it again. Culinary innovator of our family that she always was, she loved the food and the hugely patient and thoughtful staff.View image in fullscreen‘A little too sweet for me’: chicken teriyaki.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverDuring the pandemic, dad became a regular orderer of Shiki’s excellent home-delivery teriyaki beef – but it’s only available in the evening. So, today, he orders the chicken version to share, which I find a bit bland, a little too sweet for me and without the caramel richness I was expecting. By comparison, my beef noodles are stunning, vinegary with an oily sheen and wafer-thin carrot and pickle batons in the tangy sauce.As we attempt to finish off the last grains of rice (dexterous chopstick scooping works, spearing definitely doesn’t), the restaurant starts to empty. It’s already 2.15pm, so I grab my yellow-and-green scarf and pay the unexpectedly reasonable bill.View image in fullscreen‘Stunning’: beef noodles.Photograph: Chris Ridley/The ObserverShun, Shiki’s proprietor, is nowhere to be seen. Born in Japan, but resident in Norwich since the age of 16, he graduated from the University of East Anglia and then went back to Tokyo to train as a sushi chef before returning to take over the restaurant his mother first opened.When I ask if he’s in the kitchen, I’m told he’s already at Carrow Road having lunch with their young son (named after City hero, the Finnish striker Teemu Pukki).Famously excellent as Norwich City’s catering is – still watched over every week by Delia Smith – I’m sure we’ve had the better pre-match meal today. But we need to hurry. I don’t want to miss the kick-off.Ed Balls, a former Cabinet minister, presents Good Morning Britain on ITV and Political Currency, a weekly podcast with George Osborne.

Inclusiveness would be high on my list, by which I mean no snobby condescension or arch comments if you betray that you don’t know your chardonnay from your chablis (or, indeed, that you don’t know that chablis is always made from chardonnay in the eponymous part of northern Burgundy). Enthusiasm, a feeling that your merchant really loves what they sell and wants nothing more than to share it and find the right bottle for you, is another welcome quality, as too is a sense that prices are fair – if not “never knowingly undersold” at least not “always furtively oversold”. Most important though, is the wine itself – that sense that, whatever you buy, you’re in safe hands and likely to end up with something delicious. One retailer that answers all those prerequisites for me is the London-based online specialist,swig.co.uk, which has a range that never seems to miss, filled with fantastic wines such as Priune, an exquisitely pure, deep, plum-and-cherry fruited, supple Rhône red.Danbury Ridge Pinot Noir, Essex, UK 2022 (£43,swig.co.uk)Swig sources its wines from all over the winemaking world, and in all imaginable styles, but, as with all the best merchants, there’s a recognisable house signature across its portfolio: these are wines that are balanced with a sense of clarity and verve. One of their traditional strengths is South Africa, and the company has been responsible for raising the profile of many of the stars of the new wave of funky, adventurous winemaking that has emerged in the Cape over the past couple of decades: names such as Adi Badenhorst, maker, among other things, of the consistently superb AA Badenhorst Secateurs White, Swartland 2024 (£17.50), a fabulously complex, rich, weighty mouthful of apply chenin blanc loveliness, and Pieter Walser of Blankbottle, the man behind such distinctively delightful, wackily named wines as Orbitofrontal Cortex 2023 (£32.50), a by-turns tangy and creamy, multilayered dry white blend. Latterly, the Swig team have been looking closer to home, turning up such delights as Danbury Ridge’s insouciantly suave immaculately ripe berry-fruited Essex pinot noir red.Alberto Orte Atlantida Blanco, Jerez, Spain 2022 (£39,swig.co.uk)Pinot is the variety used to make another red highlight of the Swig range, which I was happy to taste at a recent event where the retailer showed off its wares alongside 11 other similarly independent-minded wine importers: Weingut am Schlipf Schneider Spätburgunder vom Kalkstein, Baden, Germany 2022 (£32) is serious pinot noir in a lacy, intricate, lipsmacking style with, as a Stranglers-loving someone in the Swig team puts it unimprovably on the retailer’s website, a “texture like sun”. That phrase would also fit rather nicely with one of Swig’s finds in Valdeorras in Galicia, northwestern Spain: Alberto Orte A Portela 2019 (£27.50) is a red wine from the local mencía that combines the slightly crunchy feel you get in Loire cabernet franc with the graceful fluency of pinot noir. It’s the work of the super-talented winemaker Alberto Orte, who also supplies Swig with the outrageously lovely Atlantida Blanco, an effortlessly evocative unfortified dry white from sherry country in Jerez that feels like an Atlantic breeze-cooled stroll through apple orchards and citrus groves.Explore more on these topicsWineDavid Williams's wines of the weekFoodfeaturesShareReuse this content"
