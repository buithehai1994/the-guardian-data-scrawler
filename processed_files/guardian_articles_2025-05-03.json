Guy Shahar and his wife, Oksana, looked at each other in stunned disbelief.They had followed the Guardian’s investigation intothe carer’s allowance scandalthat has left thousands of families with crippling debts and criminal records. Not once did they think they would join them.“Important,” it read in big bold type. “You have been paid more carer’s allowance than you are entitled to. You now need to pay this money back”.The sum being demanded by the government was staggering: £10,180.45.“It just didn’t seem real,” said Guy, 53. “It was so surreal and outrageous we assumed there must have been some sort of mistake”.There was no mistake. The family, from Feltham in west London, had unwittingly breached the strict earnings limit that has left hundreds of thousands of carers paying back huge sums to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) in a saga that has beencompared to the Post Office scandal.Oksana, 53, had overstepped the earnings limit by just £1.92 a week on average while juggling caring for their son Daniel, 15, who has autism, with part-time roles as a school dinner lady and a zero-hours contract at Sports Direct.In some weeks, she was paid just 38p more than the threshold – but for that tiny infraction she is being forced to repay £64.60 each time, the rate of carer’s allowance at the time.View image in fullscreenGuy, who set up the charity Transforming Autism, said the DWP’s repayment demand will financially devastate the family.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianUnpaid carers are allowed to work as long as their earnings do not breach the strictly enforced weekly threshold, which is £196. If their income exceeds this limit, even by as little as 1p, they must repay the whole week of carer’s allowance – meaning a breach of even 1p would trigger a fine of £83.30.This so-called “cliff-edge” approach has been widely condemned as “cruel and nonsensical” and “perverse” after a Guardian investigation exposed how scores of unpaid carers had been caught in the trap, leaving many saddled with five-figure debts and others withcriminal convictions.As of February, nearly 100,000 carers across the UK were repaying sums as high as £20,000 after breaching earnings rules, according to thelatest official figures.A Guardian analysis of five years of Oksana’s earnings show that on average she was paid less than the DWP’s strict threshold for three of those years. In another year, her earnings exceeded the limit by an average of just 83p a week – but for this infraction they must repay £1,938 for the year.Across the whole five-year period, she earned a total of £505 more than the rules allow – an average of £1.92 a week. Yet instead of repaying £505, the DWP is demanding £10,130.45 – plus a £50 “civil penalty”.“It will devastate us financially,” said Guy, who founded the charity Transforming Autism. “It just seems so unfair that it’s not even real. It just feels like this actually can’t go through. In any sort of ethical world, this would not happen.”Thewell-documented failureof the DWP to alert carers immediately to these overpayments meant that instead of being notified in 2018, when they first began, the Shahars were not told until January – nearly seven years later.This meant they unknowingly accrued debt until 2023, when they stopped receiving carer’s allowance after Shahar notified the DWP that she had been able to increase her hours at Sports Direct.The DWP’s top official, Peter Schofield,promised MPs in 2019to end the delays that have left scores of carers incurring enormous debts by accident – yet six years later the failure is continuing.“They never alerted us – not even once,” said Guy. “They let it build up and then more than six years later they’re slapping this enormous fine on us. I feel really let down by the system.”The DWP is supposed to consider a carer’s average earnings when deciding whether they have broken the rules. However, the way officials do this is inconsistent.In Oksana’s case, they punished her on the basis of her individual weekly pay rather than her average earnings despite this approach being criticised as unfairby tribunal judges.“It’s like it’s set up to be a booby-trapped benefits system. It’s inhumane,” said Shahar. “It traps families into long-term debt, anxiety and mental health issues and leaving us much worse off rather than better off to look after the people we’re supposed to be caring for.”Liz Kendall, the welfare secretary, ordered an independent inquiry into carer’s allowance last year after the Guardian’s investigation. The review, by the former Disability Rights UK chief executive Liz Sayce, is due to report within weeks.Earlier this month the DWP said it was boosting staff numbers in an attempt toclear the huge backlogof thousands of unpaid carers who have unwittingly exceeded the earning limit – and will almost certainly now be punished.The family appealed against the £10,000 fine but it was rejected by the DWP. They are now awaiting the outcome of a second challenge.Guy said the government’s “unfair persecution” had left them distressed and devastated: “It was like the whole foundation of the life that we’d created, which is a very simple life and it’s on fragile foundations anyway – it’s like those foundations were just being taken away. And they’re being taken away by people who’d been telling us all along that they were there to support us”.Helen Walker, the chief executive ofCarersUK, urged the DWP to write off debts in cases like the Shahars’ – and said the case highlighted the need for wide-ranging reform.“I’m saddened and concerned by the fact that we’re still hearing of fresh instances of those, like Guy and his family, who have fallen foul of an inflexible and unfair system,” she said. “This is a clear demonstration of why we need to see a better alternative to the current ‘cliff-edge’.”A DWP spokesperson said:“We have paused the recovery of Mrs Shahar’s overpayment pending the outcome of her appeal.“We understand the struggles facing so many carers, which is why have launched an independent review of carer’s allowance, to explore how earnings-related overpayments have occurred and what changes can be made. This is due to report in the summer and the government will consider its findings following its conclusion.”Explore more on these topicsCarersCarer's allowance crisisSocial carenewsShareReuse this content"

Such a move will face resistance from the Department for Education and from universities, which are reliant on the income from international students’ fees.More than 900 Labour figures decry party’s migration and asylum policyRead moreLabour MPs in the north of England have privately urged more action on migration afterReform emerged as the largest partyin the local elections in England on Thursday. Reform won the byelection in Runcorn and Helsby, the Greater Lincolnshire mayoralty, 10 councils and more than 600 council seats.Jo White, who represents Bassetlaw and founded the Red Wall caucus of Labour MPs, said the government should stop “pussyfooting around” and “take a leaf out of President Trump’s book”.In anarticle for the Sunday Telegraph, White called for digital ID cards as a way of reducing immigration and for regional grooming gang inquiries. She also criticised the cut to winter fuel payments for the elderly.Other Labour MPs have argued that the government must tack to the left and that its controversial public spending cuts, including to disability benefits, have contributed to its unpopularity.Rachael Maskell, the MP for York Central, said Labour’s driving mission should be “about protecting people”. “We were created to serve the needs of people across working areas of our country so that people had a real voice of the kind of change that they wanted to see,” she told BBC Breakfast.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Yesterday, many people were searching for that response, to find that protection, to get that support.Emma Lewell, the Labour MP for South Shields, said a “change of plan” was needed and that it was “tone deaf” for the prime minister to say on Friday that he would move “further and faster”.Keir Starmer wrote for the Times that he would not blame the local election results on the “same old excuses”. “I get it,” he wrote. “Uncontrolled immigration, sewage in rivers, failing local services: I feel the same sharp edge of fury at the way our country has been let down as people who voted on Thursday night do.”But in a warning shot to Starmer,Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, said it was wrong to “pander” to Reform.“The Labour government needs to take Nigel Farage head on, not pander to his attempts to divide our country,” Davey said. “We saw in Canada how Mark Carney turned the tide against populism by standing up to Trump and staying true to his values.

Hebecomes the first Australian prime minister to serve consecutive terms since 2004.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese takes to the stage with his son Nathan and partner, Jodie Haydon.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPWith counting continuing into Sunday morning, Labor was projected to win comfortably more than 76 of the 150 lower house seats needed to form a majority government, with an increased share of votes bucking a recent trend against the two major parties.Addressing the party faithful in Sydney, Albanese said voters had chosen Australian values, including “fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all”.“Australians have voted for a future that holds true to these values, a future built on everything that brings us together as Australians, and everything that sets our nation apart from the world,” he said.In an apparent reference to Trump’s policies, Albanese said he would “choose the Australian way”.“We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration from overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,” he said.Labor was certain to add to the 77 seats it held going into the election, with the opposition Liberal/NationalCoalitionprojected to receive its lowest ever national vote and to lose further seats.In a six-minute concession speech, Dutton accepted “full responsibility” for the party’s wipeout, which included losing his own seat, and said that the party had unfortunately been “defined by our opponents in this election”.“It’s not our night, as I point out, and there are good members, good candidates, who have lost their seats or their ambition, and I’m sorry for that … we have an amazing party, and we’ll rebuild.”The Australian conservative party’s lossmirrored that of the recent election in Canadawhere the centre-left Liberal party won a fourth-term despite being well behind in the polls in the leadup to the election.Like Dutton, Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he had held since 2004in an election dominated by the impact of Trump’s presidency.Meanwhile, most if not all of the inner-city “teal” independents elected at the previous poll in 2022 seemed certain to retain their seats, with several other independents, some in regional areas, having a good chance of adding to their number.View image in fullscreenOpposition leader Peter Dutton concedes defeat alongside his sons, Harry and Tom.Photograph: Dan Peled/Getty ImagesHowever, it was a disappointing night for the Greens, who were projected to lose two of the three Brisbane seats they sensationally won in 2022, even as their national vote remained static at around 13%. Even the apparently safe Melbourne seat of their leader, Adam Bandt, seemed in a certain amount of jeopardy.Dutton was first elected in 2001 and is one of his party’s most senior members. He has held a number of ministerial positions, including defence and immigration, since 2013.He had consistently led in the national polls since the end of 2023, but the US’s decision to place tariffs on Australian exports made associations with Trump detrimental to the opposition party’s brand.The opposition leader avoided mentioning the US president during the election campaign, even as some of hissenior colleagues referred to Trump’s slogansat political rallies.Months before the campaign officially kicked off, Dutton hadannounced a government efficiency unitto scale back “waste”, mirroring the Elon Musk-led so-called “department of government efficiency” in the US.The opposition’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who used Trump’s slogan during the campaign, accused the media of “slinging mud” and “smearing” the party for making links to the US president.“Donald Trump doesn’t own those four words,” the senator said on ABC, referring tothe Make Australia Great Again sloganshe used.0:48Labor wins the Australian federal election 2025 – videoCounting to determine the final shape of the House of Representatives and the Senate (the upper house) will take several days, if not weeks in the case of a few seats.Voting is compulsory in Australia and is based on a preferential voting system.

Thames is in a desperate race to find a buyer willing to inject cash, with the US private equity firm KKR in pole position.However, should that takeover fail, the heavily indebted utility could collapse into state hands via the special administration regime (SAR).Existing budgets at the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which insiders describe as already stretched, would have to be used to meet the burden of keeping ThamesWaterafloat if bids to save the company fail, according to sources.That pressure to find a private sector solution rather than a state rescue is helping to force through KKR’s bid uncontested, with potential long-term challenges and associated costs not being given serious consideration, sources close the bid and Whitehall insiders said.Some estimates have suggested temporary nationalisation could cost as much as £4bn over 18 months, a figure used by senior Treasury officials in discussions with counterparts at Defra, sources said. With Defra’s annual budget for last year totalling £4.6bn, the costs could be crippling.Departments have spent months waiting to hear what the chancellor’s spending review will mean for their budgets. This is to be revealed by Rachel Reeves on 11 June. She unveiledbig cutsto overall Whitehall spending at her spring statement.The Thames issue is causing what one source termed a “binary choice” for regulators and central government: higher customer bills but a recapitalised utility versus what another called “potentially catastrophic cuts” to Defra’s budget. This need not be the case if the Treasury were to take a different approach, several sources said.One suggested threats to Defra’s budget were an example of “scare tactics” to shut down discussion about other options for Thames.The cost of nationalising Thames, which serves almost 16 million customers in London and the Thames valley, has been hotly debated.The company is wrestling with a mountain of more than £20bn of debt, amid growing pressureto invest in its ailing assetsandset aside sums for anticipated future regulatory finesand costs. The debt levels are so great that some bidders for Thames suggested it would be better if it were to enter temporary nationalisation, in order to force creditors to accept steeper losses and make the company more viable in the long term.A consultancy,Teneo, provided estimatesof what a temporary nationalisation could cost the government as part of a recent court case. It claimed it could be as high as £3.4bn to £4.1bn over an 18-month period.The author of Teneo’s report, Matthew Cowlishaw, worked on the temporary nationalisation of the energy company Bulb. Teneo suggested that if Thames were nationalised, customers would be more likely to refuse to pay their bills, the government would demand an interest rate of nearly 10% on any loans to the company, and staff wages would have to go up by about 20% to stop them leaving.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That repayment meant the governmentrecouped almost all of its costs from the emergency measure.If Thames was temporarily renationalised, the government would become first in the pecking order to recoup its money and could reclaim all the funds spent on financing it when the company was eventually sold, with other lenders forced to suffer steep losses on their loans.Even if a private market solution were to be favoured, Whitehall sources added, they were highly critical of the lack of transparency over the KKR bid. This disquiet was echoed by several sources at regulators, too.A spokesperson for Defra said: “The company [Thames Water] remains stable and the government is closely monitoring the situation. It would be inappropriate to comment further on the financial matters of a private company.”Do you have information about this story?

By giving clinicians a comprehensive view of patient pathways, we can identify and address delays immediately.NHS cancer patients denied life-saving drugs due to Brexit costs, report findsRead more“As Cancer 360 expands to more hospitals nationwide, I’m confident we’ll see meaningful improvements in both treatment times and patient experience.”It is understood that trusts will not be forced to use the tool, but those not meeting NHS standards on cancer – including that 85% of cancer patients should have started their treatment within 62 days of being referred – may be asked to consider how Cancer 360 could help them meet targets.The DHSC said Cancer 360, as well as helping patients get a faster diagnosis, would help cut treatment delays and thus boost survival rates.Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, welcomed the rollout, saying: “With nearly 3.5 million people living with cancer in the UK – a number that continues to rise – the need for faster diagnosis and timely treatment has never been more urgent.“Too many people still face unacceptable disparities in their cancer care, from diagnosis to treatment and support. We welcome the rollout of any technology that will help improve outcomes, reduce delays, and give people with cancer greater control over their wellbeing.”Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said: “Initiatives like this show great promise in bringing disjointed, disconnected, and outdated NHS systems into the 21st century.”He added: “For these reforms to really make a difference though, we need to make sure the health service has the wider investment and staff that it needs to benefit from these advances.”The technology has been piloted at Royal United hospital in Bath, and Chelsea and Westminster hospital. It was said to have helped the latter meet the faster diagnosis standard, whereby 75% of patients should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of referral.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “I’ve seen first-hand the stress and heartbreak that cancer causes in my own family.“Dependent on archaic pen-and-paper systems, life-saving diagnostics appointments hung on whether a Post-it note lost its stick, or a piece of paper went missing. That put lives at risk. And, with the technology we have today, there’s no reason for any part of our healthcare service to run in such a way.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the government was investing £26bn in the NHS, adding: “It’s a long road but we’re already getting our NHS back on its feet, giving patients over 3 million more appointments, hiring 1,500 new GPs and starting the rollout of new tech that will save lives.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthNHSEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

In the more than 50 years that have elapsed, the territory, which unilaterally declared independence in 1983, has been recognised by no other country but Turkey.Ahead of his visit officials had said that Erdoğan’s focus would be on the opening of the big government complex, financed by Ankara with the aim of promoting international acceptance for the isolated entity.On Saturday the Turkish president insisted that in the wake of decades of failed peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots only “a two-state solution” could be discussed to resolve the west’s longest running diplomatic dispute.“The two-state solution is the joint vision of Turkey and northern Cyprus,” he said. “Any new negotiation process must be between two sovereign states.”Friday’s demonstration, which followed almost daily protests over the hijab law, was organised by more than 100 trade unions and civil societies many of which still advocate the island’s reunification as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.“Partly because of Kemalism but also because of eighty-two years of British colonial rule, Turkish Cypriots are by far the most secular Muslims in the world,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia in the internationally recognised south.For Turkish Cypriots who have long opposed Ankara’s ever-expanding influence in the north, the regulation, he said, was further proof of the leader’s determination to not only erode long-held secular traditions but ultimately alter their own identity.“What we are witnessing is a cultural clash,” Faustmann said. “The legislation on headscarves is seen as part of a package of continuous attempts by Erdoğan to unwind the secular character of the community.”With the backlash showing no sign of abating, Turkish Cypriots appear determined to have the measure repealed – even if it has been vigorously defended by the community’s leader, Ersin Tatar, a close Erdoğan ally who argues the law protects students from discrimination.“If we are to save ourselves we have to continue this struggle,” said Şener Elcil, a veteran former trade unionist.Increasingly, he lamented, Turkish Cypriots had been made to feel like a minority “in our own land” as a result of hundreds of thousands of mainland settlers moving to the north.“Religion was never a point of division on this island but after years of building mosques that Turkish Cypriots don’t even go to, they want to make it one in our schools,” he added. “Now, more than ever, we need to stand up to Erdoğan and have our voices heard.”Explore more on these topicsCyprusRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And they have faced some common challenges, rebuilding their clubs and parties from low ebbs to extraordinary success.Now Starmer may face a similar challenge – and criticism – to Wenger in his later years: whether he can adapt his tactical rigidity when results start to suffer.So far, a successful strategy has been to win back Conservative switchers and working-class voters whom the party was felt to have abandoned. That has morphed into deep concern about the threat of Reform UK. In Runcorn and Helsby,lost by an agonising six voteshaving been one of Labour’s safest seats, Reform showed how it could turn out its machine.But cabinet ministers have told the Guardian they are concerned that Labour’s own pendulum has swung too far and is alienating their own voters. In that same seat,Labourretained just 55% of its vote, suggesting many of its own voters did not turn out. The Greens, however, clung on to their vote from last July.Disillusioned Labour voters graphicNigel Farage may loom large as the biggest threat in some of Labour’s most vulnerable seats in the north and the Midlands. But MPs and ministers fear the threat in those seats of Labour staying at home and losing votes to the Greens, Liberal Democrats and independents could just as easily be the factor that would deliver seats to Reform, as more Conservative voters switch to Farage.An example of this double bind came as council results trickled in on Friday, with Labour losing two Lancashire council seats in adjoining wards in Accrington on massive swings – one to the Greens and one to Reform.Senior Labour figures have been sharing data that appears to suggest the party’s actual biggest risk is from losing progressive voters angered by a perceived inaction on the cost of living and potential cuts to public services, as well as by specific policies such as cuts to winter fuel payments and welfare.Green campaigners said these issues were frequently raised by left-leaning voters before this week’s elections, with some expressing an almost visceral dislike of Starmer’s record thus far.A new poll for the public affairs firm Apella Advisors, conducted by Find Out Now, found the threat of drifting progressive voters was significant. Among Labour 2024 voters, 43% said they would be likely to consider voting Green and 40% Lib Dems. Just 9% said they could consider voting Reform.Welfare cuts are likely to be a major challenge, mainly because of the sheer number of people claiming personal independence payments, which is up to one in five people in some Labour constituencies.At least three cabinet ministers have told the Guardian they feel uneasy at the apparent unwillingness in No 10 to spend any time speaking directly to progressive voters. “Where is this transformative change people were promised? Why are we not picking the fights we can pick on our own turf?” one minister said.Reasons for not voting Labour graphicOne said they felt a vacuum particularly acutely on two subjects, climate and the flagship workers’ rights bill, perhaps the most progressive-friendly legislation that has passed the Commons. “Keir talks about it passionately when you get him on the topic but there’s absolutely nothing proactive,” one cabinet minister said.“I’m constantly making the case to No 10 that we can’t just talk to the right,” another said. “So we are at risk of losing voters to the left, and we need to have a strategy to reassure the left. And it’s so frustrating for me. Frankly, we need to be speaking to Guardian readers a lot more than we are.”A saving grace, some ministers believe, is that the Greens are underperforming. “I think we are extraordinarily fortunate that the Green party are shit,” one minister said.“If they had any kind of charismatic or populist leadership we’d be eight to 10 points further down the polls. I would still believe we could squeeze that vote if it came to it, but we should be aware that they may be voters who simply will not turn out for us.”MPs have told the Guardian they perceive a loss of focus on the cost of living and on fixing public services.“We should be constantly, relentlessly talking about costs for ordinary people. That is the only way to beat Reform,” said one MP facing a big challenge from Reform in his seat. “But it is also the only way we keep our core people onside.”That concern is borne out by the Apella polling: it found Reform voters support a strongly interventionist, leftwing economic agenda, including nationalising utilities, higher taxes on corporations and for Britain to take steps to protect national industries from foreign competition.There is a frustration among some No 10 advisers that Labour has got little credit for its most progressive measures on the economy: raising the minimum wage and public sector pay and protecting the vast majority of workers from any tax rises, even on fuel. “When you’re Labour, people feel that stuff is baked in and they only remember the very hard decisions,” one said.For all of those who are worried about the progressive vote, there are as many in the cabinet who feel strongly that Reform is by far the biggest threat Labour faces, especially as it squeezes the Conservative vote even harder.Graphic showing how many swtichers would return to Labour to keep out Reform“We won the large majority at the last election essentially based on a split on the right. At the moment that split is disappearing because so many Tories are going to Reform,” one cabinet source said.“If we lose voters to Reform ourselves as well, that’s a lot of seats we will lose. If the next election is versus a Farage-Jenrick coalition then we can squeeze the progressive vote very hard. The choice in front of people will be very stark.”This is part of the counterargument in favour of a focus on Reform which is being put forward by some in No 10 and the Treasury. That argument is threefold: that by the next election the government will be making tangible improvements to public services, especially the NHS; that a spending blitz would risk a Liz Truss-style meltdown; and that in four years’ time, faced with the threat of a Reform-Conservative coalition, progressive voters will vote tactically to stop them.Red lines graphicThe data suggests that final assumption may be true: almost 80% of Labour 2024 voters are prepared to vote tactically to keep out Reform, according to More in Common data.But there was little evidence of that in the Runcorn and Helsby result, where the Greens kept their share of the vote from 2024 election. But there was certainly significant evidence that Reform can even win wavering committed Conservatives over if the choice is between it and Labour. On the other hand, Labour managed to keep hold of the West of England mayoralty by squeezing Green voters, despite an unexpectedly strong Reform showing.There are a growing number of MPs who believe a major economic reset is needed. That would be borne out by the polling. For those who have said they will no longer vote Labour, the winter fuel allowance, cost of living and a lack of public service improvement are the top reasons. Immigration is chosen by just 18% of switchers. Only about 1% cite policies on the environment or net zero, way down the priority list.Senior strategists are not blind to the progressive problem. Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, has told staff he knows the party has to widen its support base. “You have to rebuild the coalition after each and every election, because for some people the mandate was just to get the Tories out,” one ally said.“When you look at the broadest possible coalition that we could build … for all of those voters who are open to voting for Labour, cost of living is number one and NHS waiting lists is number two,” another Downing Street insider said. “And having a health service that works is the most progressive thing we could do.”Additional reporting by Raphael Boyd"

In fact, they’re more likely to blame his political opponents.‘Humiliated Tories’ and ‘angry Labour’: what the papers say about Reform’s local election routRead moreFindings by the Good Growth Foundation, a thinktank with links to the Labour leadership, offer some insight. Its polling suggests that among a key group of swing voters Farage has managed to shift the responsibility for what is indisputably his lifetime achievement.The findings are based on a poll of 2,200 voters carried out by JL Partners in mid-March, including 222 voters who backed Labour in the general election but now say they support Reform.Of these Labour-Reform switchers, 39% said they believed Brexit had made the country worse – but by and large they did not blame Farage for it. Instead, 30% blamed the Conservative party and 29% blamed Boris Johnson. Only 11% said it was Farage’s fault.Farage’s net favourability was 46% among Labour-Reform switchers, significantly higher than his national net approval rate approval of -2%. Admirers said they thought he defended British values, “tells it like it is” and speaks for ordinary people.One woman in Rochdale who switched her support from Labour to Reform this year said: “Some of what he says is resonating with people, while a lot of the other, you know, MPs and stuff [are] very pasty about things.”The local election results suggest Farage is successfully tapping into the public’s appetite for change, which less than a year ago helped Keir Starmerwin his landslide.Labour strategists now see Reform as their primary threat. Jonathan Ashworth, the former Labour frontbencher, said the results suggested the country was heading towards a two-party systembetween Labour and Reform.Over the coming weeks and months Labour figures will pore over research like this into the driving factors behind Reform’s surge, but MPs aredivided over the best way forward. Some want ministers to focus on bringing down legal and illegal migration while others say voters inRuncorn and Helsby, where Reform narrowly won, most frequently cited the government’scontroversial benefit cuts.Keir Starmer has said this weekend that he ‘“gets it”, suggesting he is willing to take accountability for the policy decisions that some of his MPs believe have lost the party support in northern towns and cities.For Farage, a man who has spent the majority of his career influencing policy from the sidelines, accountability for his one greatest political achievement appears to be slow in coming.Explore more on these topicsNigel FarageLocal elections 2025BrexitReform UKLocal electionsLabourKeir StarmeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Then came Trump’s tariffsFrom the local sports team to local businesses, Saginaw is intimately intertwined with its northern neighborStephen Starrin Saginaw, MichiganSat 3 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 11.01 EDTShareThere are few entities that embody the close, fraternal ties between the US andCanadaquite like the Saginaw Spirit junior ice hockey team.In a place whose fortunes have been more down than up in recent decades, the Dow Event Center hockey arena in Saginaw,Michigan, comes alive with more than 5,000 fans once these young stars take to the ice. A huge banner depicting the players adorns the main street into the city.Nearly all the players, aged 16 to 20, come fromCanada, and stay with local Saginaw families during the regular playing season, which runs from September to April.“They are family, almost literally,” says Jimmy Greene, the Spirit’s vice-president of marketing and community relations, “because players come over here and stay with American families. It’s more than just sport.”One of the top prospects of this year’sNational Hockey Leagueentry draft is forward Michael Misa, the Spirit’s 18-year-old Canadian captain. Last year, the Saginaw Spirit won the Memorial Cup of the Ontario Hockey League for the first time. In the season that recently finished, the Spirit played 28 times on Canadian soil.So the fallout from DonaldTrump’s tariffsregime on Canadian goods has been felt more keenly in Saginaw than most other communities – as has the fight over the Canadian election, with the US president’s jibes over Canada becoming the US’s 51st state looming over the contest amid a fierce backlash against such comments.‘We are not the 51st anything’: viral Canada ad gets Trump-inspired updateRead more“We’ve had this relationship for decades and all of a sudden, in the last couple of months, it’s been uprooted,” says Greene.“Of course, you’re going to be concerned because you just don’t know [what will happen next]. At some point, it’s going to end up costing us. I just don’t know what extent and by how much.”As the largest city in the northern half of Michigan located within a short drive of three Canadian border crossings, Saginaw has closer ties to Canada than perhaps any other community of its size. Canadian companies own close to 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of farmland in the county, and last year,Saginaw establishedits first sister-city ties with a Canadian counterpart.What’s more, it is akey political bellwetherand manufacturing county that helped push Donald Trump over the line in last November’s presidential election, but today the community faces uncertainty around the trade war with Canada.Michigan, with its vast automotive manufacturing industry, is set to be affected by Trump’s trade battle with Canada more than perhaps any other US state.After Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian vehicles and parts – with some exemptions – Ottawa responded withits own 25% tariffon certain US automotive products. Canada says the tariffs are unjustified, but on 23 April Trump warned that the tariff figures could go up.While Trump hasclaimedthe US doesn’t need goods produced by its northern neighbor, Canada buys more American products than any other country, at$356bnworth of purchases. Nearly 40% of Michigan’s exported goods go to Canada. In 2023, $1.7bn worth of goods made in the Saginaw metropolitan area were exported, one of the highest amounts for any Michigan city, with much of that sent to Canada.Nexteer Automotive employs around 5,000 people in Saginaw while Means Industries, an automotive parts company headquartered in the city, also has a base in London, Ontario. Repeated calls and emails sent by the Guardian to Saginaw’s chamber of commerce seeking information on specific local industries potentially affected by the tariffs were not responded to.‘Sport right now triumphs over politics’Saginaw is no stranger to economic ups and downs.On a recent Friday afternoon, the downtown area is almost dead. Despite the recent success of the hockey team, there isn’t a sports bar for blocks in any direction as most of Saginaw’s commercial activity is now concentrated around miles of strip malls north of downtown.For Brad Pyscher, an officer at a correctional facility and former union president who, on a recent Saturday afternoon, is manning the Saginaw county Republican party office in one of these strip malls, the tariffs on Canada were something of a shock.“People are concerned, and they hope this works itself out,” he says. “The shock and awe [of the tariffs] really took everyone by surprise.”The 54-year-old says he had voted independent all his life before backing Democrat Barack Obama, and then Trump for president in 2016.“The thing with Trump, whether you like him or don’t like him, there’s transparency,” he says. “I’m drawn to him because he is not a politician.”But Pyscher concedes that Trump could have negotiated with Canada before “hitting them with that shock and awe. I think it’s on purpose, to let the world know he can do it,” he says.“[With] Canada, it should have been negotiated a bit better, a lot better. I’m expecting the deals with Canada to come soon, and we can all put this behind us.”Trump has said one of his main motivations for issuing tariffs on Canada was to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the US. However, reports indicate the opposite may be happening. Last month,$11m worth of cocaine was seizedat the Port Huron border crossing, 80 miles (130km) east of Saginaw – on its way into Canada. In December, around 1,000lb (450kg) of cocaine were also seized in a semi-truck attempting to enter Ontario from the same border crossing.Back in the world of ice hockey, Greene of Saginaw Spirit says he feels most people he interacts with have been able to park their political feelings, starting with the organization’s Canadian players, who have been essential to the team’s recent success.“I think we all made a concerted effort, while not to keep [the players] dumb and naive, we did enough to make them feel comfortable in our environment and away from the political stuff. We kept them in a mindset of sport,” he says.But Greene also realizes the strained ties with Canada fueled by the White House’s policies are a very real dynamic.“I’m not immune to the idea that at some point Canada had some hostile feelings towards us, but people have, until this point, been able to park the politics away from sport. I think sport right now triumphs over politics,” he says.“Because we play in Canada, and [because of] the tariffs. I’m more concerned about how they feel about us. Our feelings towards Canada have been and always will be favorable and friendly. I’m concerned not just because of the economic tariffs, but because of the emotions that come from that. I’d be foolish to pretend otherwise.”Saginaw residents are hoping the kind of fraternal ties that were on display across the city last May, when hundreds of Canadian hockey fans from as far away as Saskatchewan descended on the region for the Memorial Cup, won’t become a thing of the past.“Everybody’s been super friendly. You guys have been incredible hosts,” one Canadian hockey fan who drove 11 hours from Quebec for the tournamenttold local media.Explore more on these topicsMichiganCanadaTrump tariffsUS politicsUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Tourists squashed themselves up against the palace gates, e-bikes whizzed around the memorial of Queen Victoria and security staff hurriedly erected impromptu barriers to manage the heaving crowds.For the family drawing this familiar circus, things have been equally chaotic.Prince Harry sat down with the BBC for anotheremotional and pointed interviewthis week in which he said it would be “impossible” to bring his family to the UK afterlosing a legal battleover his personal security.He also appeared to extend an olive branch to the royal family, saying he would “love” to reconcile with them, despite King Charles’s refusal to speak to him “because of the security stuff”.Did the wantaway prince’s calls for a truce cut ice with the royal watchers outside Buckingham Palace?

He can’t just change his mind and come back to the UK and expect everything to be as it was before.”Jones said Harry “could afford to pay for his own bodyguards” if he wanted to. “He’s not doing royal duties. He’s living a life in Hollywood, isn’t he?”After permanentlystepping down as royalsin 2021 and relocating to the US, Harrytold Oprah Winfreyin a blockbuster interview that racism was “a large part” of why he and his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, left Britain.View image in fullscreenHannah Taylor, 25, said Meghan ‘has been treated awfully’.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The Guardian“She has literally been hated on so much and received a lot of racist comments. I think she’s been treated awfully, really,” said Hannah Taylor, 25.On Harry, however, her words of support were more reserved. “I don’t have much sympathy for somebody that’s really rich and has a lot of choices,” she said. While she acknowledges the poor treatment faced by Meghan, she is more mixed on the couple’s security battle. “I’m sure she can afford it,” said Taylor.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But not even Oscar-winning director Thomas Vinterberg can make this climate crisis dystopia the epic it promised to beLucy ManganSat 3 May 2025 16.50 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 17.29 EDTShareFamilies Like Ours is a drama – directed and co-written by the Oscar-winning Danish directorThomas Vinterberg– that asks the question: what would you do if your luck ran out? The kind that maybe saw you born with a healthy body, or into a privileged, developed country, or with a skin colour that didn’t invite discrimination among others. Maybe even all of the above. What if life as you knew it – stable, easy, dependable, cushioned – was turned upside down? What then?The seven-part series is set inDenmarkin a near future in which the Dutch economy has recently crashed, flooding the Netherlands’ nearby countries with job-seeking immigrants, eating up capacity and goodwill. Thus there is little of either available when the government announces that the threat posed to low-lying Denmark by global heating and rising sea levels means it must now be evacuated of its six million inhabitants entirely. The country is, in effect, being shut down.So Vinterberg takes what most of us treat as an existential threat, a problem too huge and frightening to think about, and puts it into a more manageable frame. Rendering it smaller and more potent still, we follow a handful of characters through the decisions they are forced to make as the massive displacement begins.Some have advance notice of the government’s announcement and use it – illegally, but who wouldn’t, is the first question we are made to ask ourselves – to liquidise assets before the market crashes and withdraw savings in cash before restrictions are brought in. Among them is Nikolaj (Esben Smed), a government employee, who tells his husband, Henrik, (Magnus Millang), and his sister Amalie (Helene Reingaard Neumann). Henrik’s volatile, homophobic brother Peter (David Dencik) is tipped off too and it is from him that come most of the violent incidents that Vinterberg’s naturalistic approach otherwise eschews. Sometimes, you wonder if it eschews them too much. There are reports of social unrest but there is so little on screen that you do wonder if the drama could not afford to ratchet up the tension a bit more. There is so much talk about the necessary documents to be found, visas to be applied for, permits to be amassed and so many scenes set across desks from cold-hearted bureaucrats that you could get to the end of the first few episodes feeling that you have a better idea of how to organise a nationwide exodus than of how it would really feel to be caught up in one.The other characters we follow include Amalie’s husband, Jacob (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), an architect who manages to use his connections to get his family a coveted pathway to France. But his daughter Laura (Amaryllis August), from his first marriage, is torn between going with him (to take up her place at the Sorbonne or going with her less wealthy and connected mother, Fanny (Paprika Steen), to her state-organised placement in Romania (it is possible Vinterberg has chosen to make some of his soon-to-be-refugees a little too privileged). There is also new boyfriend, Elias (Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt), to throw into the mix and provide a “will first love be torn asunder” subplot that is given too much time for what it adds to the show. More affecting is the decision made by Christel (Asta Kamma August), mother of nine-year-old footballing talent Lucas who has been offered a place by football scouts in England but would have to go without her. As borders close and travel by resettled Danes will become impossible, she would essentially be saying goodbye to him for ever.Families Like Ours has been a hit with viewers and critics since its inaugural showing at the Venice film festival last year. And there is much to admire. It doesn’t preach, it does have the themes work through the characters instead of the other way round (and has a cast stuffed with Danish heavyweights to help it). But it all feels a bit thin, a bit bloodless – like a thought experiment made flesh rather than a compelling, provocative drama. The script is uninspiring and the relentlessness of the bad decisions made by characters, as if to be privileged is not just to be unreflective but actively stupid, too, lends a slight air of flagellation to proceedings. One to admire, perhaps, but not to love – and therefore one whose message can, if you try, be resisted.Families Like Ours aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewThomas VinterbergDenmarkreviewsShareReuse this content"

Returning to the venue last week for Samuel Beckett’s one-man playKrapp’s Last Tape, the 67-year-old English actor is a world removed from the young upstart onceadvised by Rada to do something elsefor a living.In the intervening four decades Oldman has steadily become one of the greatest actors of his generation, whose versatility and intense performance style have earned him numerous accolades including an Oscar, three Baftas and a Golden Globe.Today, he is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time (more than $11bn worldwide), and beloved by British audiences for his“standout” performanceas Jackson Lamb, the cantankerous manager of a team of defunct spooks in the Apple TV+ spy drama Slow Horses.It’s no surprise that viewers are drawn to Lamb, whose appeal lies in his fallibility: he is rumpled, mildly corrupt and pessimistic, with a propensity to drink and swear. It’s exactly the type of offbeat role Oldman has spent his career perfecting.View image in fullscreen‘An older man in conversation with his younger self’: Oldman in Krapp’s Last Tape.Photograph: Gisele Schmidt“Jackson Lamb’s character arc is all in the backstory. He’s not going to change or develop; we’re looking at a burned-out wreck of a man,” Will Smith, the Emmy-winning creator and showrunner ofSlow Horses, told the Guardian.“Because Gary is such an extraordinary actor, he can convey that vast hinterland with the narrowing of his eyes or a shift in his posture. There’s so much to reveal and explore with Lamb, but Gary is happy to have it simmering in the background and then give us the occasional tantalising glimpse into the darkness of his past. It’s a wonder to behold.”Often hailed as a “working-class hero” in an industry increasingly rife with Etonians and Harrovians, Oldman began his life in New Cross, south-east London, in 1958. His father, Leonard, was a welder and former sailor who left the family home and Gary’s mother, Kathleen, when his son was seven.The teenage Oldman, a diehard Millwall fan, was initially drawn to music but gravitated towards a career in acting after seeing Malcolm McDowell on stage. He began studying with the Young People’s theatre in Greenwich while working odd jobs as a porter and a shoe shop assistant. After failing to get into Rada, Oldman studied acting at the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, before a run of work with York Theatre Royal, the Royal Court and the Royal Shakespeare Company.On screen, he made his film debut in 1982 in Colin Gregg’s Remembrance, and the following year he landed a starring role as a skinhead in Mike Leigh’s Meantime, before rising to prominence with his portrayal of Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy (1986).View image in fullscreenGary Oldman alongside Chloe Webb and Kathy Burke in Sid and Nancy.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyPlaying the Sex Pistols’ bassist – a performance described by John Lydon as “bloody good” – showcased Oldman’s devotion to his characters (at one point he was taken to hospital after losing significant weight for the role) and led to other starring turns. He was the playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987), a football firm leader in The Firm (1989), and the titular Rosencrantz in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He became the unofficial frontman of the “Brit pack”, a fraternity of driven young British performers that included Colin Firth and Daniel Day-Lewis.In 1991 Oldman starred in his first US blockbuster, playing Lee Harvey Oswald in Oliver Stone’s JFK. After that, the actor began to gain a reputation as Hollywood’s “psycho deluxe”: he was the titular Count inFrancis Ford Coppola’s Dracula(1992), the violent pimp Drexl Spivey in the Tony Scott-directed, Quentin Tarantino-written True Romance (1993), a sadistic prison warden in Murder in the First (1995), and a corporate tyrant in The Fifth Element (1997). Perhaps most memorably, he played a corrupt DEA officer in Luc Besson’s Léon: The Professional (1994), widely considered as one of the best villains and most corrupt cops in cinema history.View image in fullscreenOldman as Dracula.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarAfter a fallow period in the early 2000s, Oldman found himself back in the spotlight when he was cast in two major franchises. He was Harry Potter’s godfather, Sirius Black, in the film adaptations of JK Rowling’s books, and the police commissioner Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy – a performance lauded by critics, who increasingly regarded Oldman as one of the greatest actors never to have been nominated for an Oscar.That Oscar nomination eventually did come, for Oldman’s portrayal of the spy George Smiley in Tomas Alfredson’s 2011 adaptation of John le Carré’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. But he didn’t win the gong until 2018,for playing Winston Churchillin Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour – a role the actor recently revealed he turned down “half a dozen times” until his wife intervened. “[She] said: ‘Go out there and walk on the wire. It could be great, but even if you fall and it’s no good, you’ve got to stand on the set and say: We shall fight you on the beaches.’ I thought: You’ve got a point there.”Oldman’s transformation into the wartime prime minister required 200 hours in the makeup chair, 14 pounds of silicone rubber, and $20,000 worth of Cuban cigars, which gave him nicotine poisoning. Christopher Eccleston hailed Oldman’s Oscar win as “massive” for people from working-class backgrounds. “Oldman is as fine an actor as Daniel Day-Lewis, but Gary is not double-barrelled,” he said.View image in fullscreenGary Oldman as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.Photograph: Jack English/APOldman’s third Oscar nomination was for an eponymous role inMank (2020), David Fincher’s paean to a past era of great American film-making. He has previously expressed how difficult he found it to work without disguise on the film. “I do like to hide, but I’m hiding because it’s all my baggage … so that was my problem,” he said.And there’s been no shortage of personal baggage over the course of the actor’s life. There was his difficult childhood, an experience he mined whenwriting and directing Nil By Mouth (1997), a bristling portrait of an abusive, alcoholic father in south London – which the film critic Nick James described as “the most authentic working-class cockney movie ever”. There was his alcoholism in the 90s, when he was arrested for drunk-driving and checked into rehab (Oldman has been sober for more than 25 years).Then, in 2014, Oldman issued apologies for offending Jewish people after he played down antisemitic slurs by Mel Gibson. He has also had a string of marriages, including to the actors Lesley Manville (the mother of his eldest son Alfie) and Uma Thurman. He has faced down accusations that he was violent to his third wife, Donya Fiorentino (the mother of his younger sons, Gulliver and Charlie), which came out during the promotion of Darkest Hour. He has been married to the writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt since 2017.Slow Horses season four review – Gary Oldman roars like a bear dipped in chip fatRead moreWhile Oldman has been in several recent films, including Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Paolo Sorrentino’s Parthenope – released in the UK on Friday – Slow Horses has solidified his status as a national treasure.“Working with Gary was an education and inspiration,” Smith said. “He is a truly transformational actor, a once-in-a-generation talent, an intuitive genius with an incredible work ethic and a disarmingly generous spirit. Every actor that joins the cast is in awe of him, but he makes them feel welcome and puts them at ease.”Much like the character of Krapp, Oldman is reconnecting with his past when he steps on to the stage each night, carrying “the sense of an older man in conversation with his younger self” according tothe Guardian’s review. The actor has spoken of his desire to retire once Slow Horses ends, which would make his return to York all the more serendipitous. Towards the end of the play, Krapp questions whether his “best years are gone”, but it’s clear that Gary Oldman’s star is as bright as it ever was.Explore more on these topicsGary OldmanSlow HorsesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Share the story of your sex life, anonymouslyAs told to Olivia LadanyiSat 3 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareLucy, 41As it takes Kyra a long time to climax, we usually have sex on the weekend – it takes upa Saturday morningEven though I’ve had more experience with women than Kyra, she has a higher sex drive than me. I’d happily have sex once a month, whereas Kyra wants it two or three times a week. So we settle on once a fortnight. When we have sex, I’ll be living off that buzz for a while, but I think Kyra would like to live in that buzz constantly.The fact that she is four years younger and this is her first lesbian relationship is probably part of it (when we met, I was 26 and she was 22). But it’s more than that – Kyra wants joy all the time. She’s hedonistic and wants to do everything. Then do it again, and again. She makes life fun. It’s what I love about her. If we haven’t had sex in two weeks, Kyra will say: “This is really bad.” But it won’t bother me.We don’t need to have sex for sexual intimacy. We walk around naked, lie together on the sofa, touch and kiss. Grab each other’s bums in bars. Flirt outrageously. But I feel closest to Kyra behind closed doors, when it’s just me and her. Talking about boring things, like how the car needs an MOT. I can be my true self when I’m around her.She might suggest a quickie in a club bathroom, or on the sofa after work, but in reality, she doesn’t get home until 7pm, and dinner’s already in the ovenAs it takes Kyra a long time to climax, we usually have sex on the weekend – it takes up a Saturday morning. Brunch plans are out of the question. Other times, she might suggest a quickie in a club bathroom, or on the sofa after work, but in reality she doesn’t get home until 7pm, and dinner’s already in the oven. So it’s probably not going to happen in the way she fantasises.If I question whether her needs are being met and discuss opening up our relationship, she’ll say, “I do want more sex, but I only want it with you.” I can be stubborn and think: you can’t make me. But then I take a step back and realise my wife’s asked something simple of me, and I’m withholding out of stubbornness or laziness.Kyra and I aren’t the same people who met nearly 16 years ago.

Sometimes when I masturbate, I just think about her handsBefore Lucy, I’d always wanted to have sex with girls, but I hadn’t met a hot, butch, cool lesbian like her. That’s why it was explosive when we got together. I was living in a shared house, and we’d go into my room on a Friday afternoon and emerge Monday lunchtime. It was like that for more than a year. I wanted to have sex all the time.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Sometimes when I masturbate, I just think about her hands. I’m an active thinker and can find it frustrating how straightforward and uncomplicated Lucy is. I try to coax fantasies out of her, but she resists and says she doesn’t have them like I do.There are seasons to our sex life. It might be romantic and loving for a while, but at the moment, it’s less loving and more kinkyIt also takes me a lot longer to orgasm, whereas it’s so easy for Lucy. And because I need to orgasm to feel satisfied, the sex we have is indulgent and lasts two or three hours. As Lucy comes first, she is the one who puts in more effort and energy, which is partly why I’m eager to have sex more often. In the back of her mind, she’s thinking: “How long will this take?”But I think Lucy imagines I want to have sex more than I do; once a week is enough. Sometimes I wish she had a higher sex drive, but I don’t feel any pressure to initiate sex; Lucy initiates it. If we haven’t done it for a week or two, and we’re in bed on a Saturday morning, kissing, giggling and gossiping, I’ll think, “here we go”.There are seasons to our sex life – it ebbs and flows, it evolves. It might be romantic and loving for a while, but at the moment it’s more kinky. Recently, I’ve become more interested in the butch-femme dynamic, where Lucy is in control. It plays into what I’m attracted to in women: strength, power and masculinity. And I like to feel feminine, or powerless, in contrast. I hope it will always continue to change, as I find not knowing what the future holds exciting.Explore more on these topicsSexThis is how we do itRelationshipsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Ask yourself, “Has David ever knowingly lied to me?” No, never. He may have told us things 40 years ago that science has updated, but he’s always told us the truth. In an age when it’s hard to trust anyone, that stands as his greatest asset.Robert MacfarlaneWriterWatching David, I came to realise that every time we recognise something human in creatures, we are also recognising something creaturely in ourselves. That is central to the rejection of human supremacism as the pernicious doctrine it is.Barack Obama44th US presidentI know, from watching David’s programmes, that our ecosystems are all interconnected and that if just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not, then we’re not going to solve the problem.View image in fullscreenWith Barack Obama in 2015.Photograph: Chuck Kennedy/The White/BBC/PAArundhati RoyAuthorHe showed how every living thing on this planet is connected to another living thing. Alone, we are nothing. We own nothing, we control nothing except perhaps for the lever that could destroy everything.John EllisProfessor of media artsFor eight years, Attenborough was a revered BBC senior manager – but he refused to be director general. Admirably, he preferred programmes to power. That’s rare in TV, and something we can all learn from.Monty DonHorticulturist, broadcasterWhen I was starting out in television, I saw a clip of David and his director discussing a piece to camera for The Private Life of Plants. David said, “But what are we actually trying to say here?” then went on to deliver something succinct but with immense insight. That simple remark has remained with me ever since.View image in fullscreenMaking The Private Life of Plants in 1993.Photograph: Neil Nightingale/naturepl.comHelen JukesAuthorThe number of times I’ve typed “Attenborough slug sex” into YouTube … David brings us the weird, wild and wonderful, so we can meet it up close and afresh.Margaret AtwoodAuthorI was living in Edinburgh when David Attenborough’s first series launched. Nobody was to be seen on the streets on those nights. They were all home watching – a look at nature as they had never seen it before.Mike GuntonCreative director, BBC Natural History UnitThirty-five years ago, David told me after the series we were working on, he was going to retire. Given he is now 99, still working and still enjoying it, I think the lesson there is: for a long and happy life, don’t retire!View image in fullscreenWith Mike Gunton in 2023.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyGeorge MonbiotGuardian columnistA few years ago,I was sharply criticalof Sir David for downplaying the environmental crisis on his TV programmes. Most people would have reacted badly but remarkably, at 92, he took this and similar critiques on board and radically changed his approach.Samantha HarveyBooker prize-winning authorI can never forgetthe nightmarish bird-eating snakethat tricks its prey into thinking it’s a spider. David Attenborough has taught me humility; humans are amazing, but only as amazing as every other creature.Caroline LucasGreenparty MPI’ll never forget the mountain gorillas in Life on Earth welcoming David with such trust and playfulness. I’d never appreciated their immense gentleness. As he says, “It seems unfair man should have chosen the gorilla to symbolise all that is aggressive and violent when that’s the one thing the gorilla is not and we are.”View image in fullscreenWith gorillas, filming Life on Earth in 1979.Photograph: BBCBillie EilishMusicianDavid Attenborough’s deep love and knowledge of our planet and the animal kingdom brings out the childlike curiosity within us all. He’s a living treasure.Mia MottleyPrimeminister of BarbadosHis voice has stirred the conscience of our planet and awakened generations to the wonder and urgency of protecting our natural world.Doug AllanWildlife and documentary cameramanDavid’s deep concern for conservation extends to his camera crews. Producer Mike wanted him to drive a snowmobile, but David was hesitant when I proposed lying on the snow while he zoomed past, so he did it too far away. “Closer please,” I said. David’s reply? “Imagine the paperwork if I run you over.”View image in fullscreenGentoo penguin meets leopard seal in 2019, for Seven Worlds, One Planet.Photograph: BBC/PAMorgan FreemanActorI’ve spent hours captivated by his storytelling and reminded of the beauty and fragility of the world we share. David Attenborough is one of my favourite narrators, bringing the wonders of our planet to life in a way that’s both inspiring and unforgettable.Hannah Bourne-TaylorAuthor, swift campaignerAttenborough taught me to convert my deep love of birds into action to save them. The average return date of swifts to Britain is his birthday. That says it all.Dr Paula KahumbuConservationist, WildlifeDirect CEOThrough him, I discovered the power of storytelling to move entire nations to love, care and act to protect nature. He inspired me to tell African stories through African eyes, transforming conservation outcomes.View image in fullscreenIn northern Kenya in 1961, with Elsa the lioness, whose story was turned into Born Free, a film and later awildlife conservation charity.Photograph: BBC Pictures ArchivesLily ColeModel, environmental advocateDavid Attenborough has taught that any hope of protecting the extraordinary biodiversity of our planet begins with curiosity, love and wonder.Steve BackshallTV presenter, wildlife expertI learned, via David, how to approach your heroes. A friend who had been his producer said, “When you meet Sir David, don’t go down on one knee and tell him how much he’s inspired you. He’s spent decades being told that. Talk about the rugby, that’ll be much more up his street.” We presented some awards together and, as luck would have it, the Irish had just beaten the All Blacks. We spent hours gabbing about it.Michael PalinPresenter, comedianWhen Monty Python first aired, the BBC put it on late, hoping no one would notice. At a BBC event, the only one who’d talk to us was David Attenborough, then director of programmes, who told us the more they tried to stop it being seen, the greater would be our cult following. He was right. Years later, David, now the most respected man in television, was to receive an award at the Canadian embassy. He strolled in alone, unnoticed. I told him I admired him for arriving with so little fuss. Almost apologetically, he said, “Oh, I came here yesterday as well. It was the wrong night.”View image in fullscreenWith Michael Palin in 2002.Photograph: Richard Kendal/BBCMaria Isabel Sánchez VegaraAuthor of children’s book David Attenborough: Little People, Big DreamsWhen David was just a boy, a friend sent him a dried seahorse for his fossil collection. The tiny treasure sparked a decision – he would become a naturalist. That was 90 years ago. It’s a beautiful reminder that even the smallest gift, shared with wonder, can ignite a passion that lasts a lifetime.Will WhatleyCaptain of RRS Sir David AttenboroughSir David taught me not to take yourself too seriously. While we were building the Royal Research Ship Sir David Attenborough, I had the idea that he could record the onboard announcements – and he kindly agreed. Newcomers get a good chuckle when we play his message about the status of the toilets.Doug AndersonWildlife cameramanFor 30 years I’ve worked as a wildlife cameraman beneath the waves, in silence and shifting light. Yet in my mind David Attenborough often speaks – giving voice to wonder, turning moments into meaning. When the sea is unkind, when doubt sets in, I still hear him, calm and clear: “Stay with it, Doug. Trust the process. Trust the journey.”View image in fullscreenFilming Life on Earth in 1979.Photograph: BBC Picture PublicityJane FondaActor, activistI have watched every one of his documentaries. There is so much to learn and love, but particularly how he shows us the interconnectedness of the natural world: everything matters, and we must fight to save it all.Simon ArmitagePoet laureateDavid’s broadcasting style isn’t just about the science of the natural world. His voice is one of wonder that we have the good fortune to exist in the same space and time as these bewildering, beautiful creatures.Hamza YassinStrictly winner, children’s TV presenterDavid Attenborough taught me everything about the natural world as a young boy arriving in the UK from Sudan. He instilled the excitement in me to follow my dream of becoming a wildlife cameraman.Emily EavisCo-organiser of Glastonbury festivalThere is a spark, a shimmer of youth in him – you can see it when he talks to children. When he came to Glastonbury, we were lucky enough to meet him and my youngest kid asked, “Which is your favourite country and where would you most like to live?” He said, without hesitation, “Great Britain”, listing all the reasons, including our wonderful seasons, astonishing wildlife and the diversity in landscapes.View image in fullscreenAt Glastonbury in 2019.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianChloe CobhamFormer neighbourMy dad lived next door to David Attenborough when I was six. One afternoon, we discovered what my father remembers to be a chipmunk in our kitchen. Unsure what to do, my dad rang his doorbell. To our shock and delight, he was round in a flash and rescued it. Some years later, I wrote to him about a science project, regaled the chipmunk tale and asked some inane questions about jellyfish. He quickly responded with a handwritten letter assuring me he remembered the incident and answering my queries.Sam LeeSinger, writer, naturalistIt was Sir David’s first job, as a folk song collector for the BBC, that inspired me. These songs are examples of ancient forms of land stewardship. Could their old truths be central to his campaign today to bring about societal change to protect our beleaguered wildlife?Ben FoglePresenter, adventurer, authorDavid is the reason I do what I do. As a child, he rewilded me, providing a bridge between my urban home and the jungles and deserts of faraway places. The first time I met him was the day my wife was due to give birth to our second child. She suggested I join her first, then go and interview my hero. It was the best day of my life … for two reasons!View image in fullscreenFilming in the Suguta valley in northern Kenya in 2013.Photograph: David Chancellor/BBCDave ReayClimate scientistDavid has shaped my entire life. He’s shown me life on Earth is miraculous, beautiful, brutal; that all species matter and in harming nature we harm ourselves. He’s also made clear that I make awful cups of tea.Robin Hanbury-TenisonSurvival International founderDavid’s The Tribal Eye series was one of the first to reveal the wisdom of indigenous societies, how much they have contributed to culture and how much better they are than us at protecting the environment.Jane GoodallConservationistHe has done more than anyone to educate people around the globe about the magic of the natural world, so more and more are working to protect the environment and the ecosystems that support life.View image in fullscreenWith Jane Goodall in 2010.Photograph: Wenn Ltd/AlamyJay GriffithsWriterFrom the start, he spoke to animals in friendship and presented them to us as friends. This helped shift attitudes, to see them not as aliens or prey but “persons” in their own right.Mike SalisburyRetired TV executiveDavid’s willingness to put up with any discomfort – mud, cold, wading through swamps, getting bitten by army ants – for the sake of a good piece to camera was an inspiration to me when we were working together. And if things went wrong, as they often did, so was his huge chuckle!António GuterresUNsecretary-general“If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet,” David once said, “surely, working together, we are powerful enough to save it.” He has taught us we must unite to tell leaders enough is enough. Act now to protect people and nature.Beccy SpeightRSPB CEOIn Wild Isles,he waves goodbye to a Manx shearwater chick taking off on a 6,000 mile flight. “Good luck, good luck!” he chuckles. “What an astonishment!” So human, rooting for the individual bird while also teaching us the wonder its journey represents.View image in fullscreenBirdwatching in 1995.Photograph: Marinepics Ltd/ShutterstockBen GoldsmithEnvironmentalistMy love of wildlife has been nourished by David’s documentaries since childhood. The best moments I spent with my late father were watching footage of wildlife, including from our garden: blue tits raising their young, ponds teeming with frogs, foxes fighting.Simon BarnesNature writerI was once asked to speak at a World Land Trust fundraiser. So was its patron – which is why I refused: “You can’t ask me to follow David Attenborough.” They insisted – and it was then I realised I’ve been following him all my life. The world would be a better place if everyone else was to follow him, too.Bella LackEnvironmentalistI have seen young people increasingly disenchanted, wrestled from the biophilic human tendency to lean towards the natural world. It’s Sir David who has stirred up the restless curiosity that brought us back.Amy-Jane BeerRight to Roam activist, nature writerSir David is the closest we have to a real-world Gandalf or Merlin. Aided by longevity, tech-wizardry and a host of animal familiars, his quests have enriched, bewitched, inspired and motivated generations.Michael MorpurgoAuthorHe has opened hearts and minds to the connection we share with every species, and renewed in us the understanding that we are the sisters and brothers of all those with whom we share this planet. He has passed on his knowledge and love of the wild world, and given us a chance as a species to redeem ourselves.View image in fullscreenWith orangutans at London zoo in 1982.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesEd MilibandUKsecretary of state forenergy andnet zeroNobody has done more to fill us with awe about our world, or to inspire us to protect and preserve it for future generations. David is a true British hero.Mary ColwellEnvironmentalist, writerDavid is an honest broker in a time of increasing divisions, even between groups who identify as nature lovers but seem to be at war. We need leaders like this more than ever, to speak out for the natural world with compassion and purity of vision.Joe LycettComedianBefore doing something I’m unsure about, I think: would David Attenborough approve? If not, I (usually) don’t do it. Among all his achievements, his role as our national moral compass is the most important.Simon KingConservationist, presenterIn an age of celebrity for celebrity’s sake, David is atypical. Despite being one of the most famous people on the planet, he remains humble and puts the focus of his passion – the natural world – front and centre.View image in fullscreenWorking on Zoo Quest in 1954.Photograph: © David AttenboroughAlan TitchmarshGardener, author, presenterSir David fostered in this Yorkshire lad a love of the natural world. I have met him several times and recall one pat on the back when, after I’d interviewed him, he nodded at me and said, “A safe pair of hands.” I feel bashful about repeating it but treasure our encounters.Megan McCubbinBroadcasterEven though he’s travelled the globe seeing rare and endangered wildlife, he still comes home to admire the blackbirds in his garden. An important reminder to recognise the extraordinary in the ordinary.Mike DilgerNaturalist, broadcasterAs a mediocre student, I won a school award for “trying hard” and bought Life on Earth by a certain D Attenborough. This fabulous book lit a fire in my 12-year-old soul, that 46 years on still blazes away, with a burning desire (like him) to spark an interest in the natural world in anyone willing to listen.Kate HumbleTV presenterWhen you see something you’ve never seen before, you need a guide. Someone with authority, but who doesn’t talk down to you. Someone with knowledge they want to share. Someone with infectious enthusiasm, always curious, always with a sense of wonder. Someone who tells the story without making themselves the story. And that’s David.View image in fullscreenWith Kate Humble in 2010.Photograph: Hilary Jeffkins/BBCDiane BoydAuthorAs a wolf and carnivore biologist, I was amazed byDavid’s show on pitcher plants, which ingest insects and mice through mimicry and entrapment. Who knew these beauties could be so dangerous?Christy LefteriAuthor of The Beekeeper of AleppoI have been haunted by David Attenborough’s stark warnings about the climate crisis. I learned from him that fires should regenerate a landscape, but instead they are becoming destructive, ferocious. I visited a burned-down forest near Athens where once lived birds of prey and foxes and weasels and butterflies and bats and snakes and lizards. A wildfire had ripped through, transforming it to ash and ghosts.Craig BennettThe Wildlife Trusts CEOThe Victorian tradition of natural history was very much about cataloguing species, almost in isolation from their environment. But as a child of the 70s and 80s, watching The World About Us with boiled eggs and toast for Sunday night tea, Sir David taught me to celebrate the infinite connections of Life on Earth.Stephen MossFormerwildlife TVproducer“Ah, you’re the birdman!” were David’s first words to me, swiftly followed by, “I don’t really know much about birds.” Not false modesty, but because he has always seen himself as a popular communicator rather than an academic expert. He does, of course, have an immense avian knowledge, as I discovered while interviewing him for the series Birds Britannia, during which he offered his insights into what birds truly mean to “the health of the human spirit”, while delighting in the noisy parakeets in his garden.View image in fullscreenWith daughter Susan and cockatoo Georgie in 1957.Photograph: Smith Archive/AlamyRowan WilliamsTheologian, poetThere are people who seem to think concern for the natural world somehow sidelines characteristically human concerns. David Attenborough makes it clear deep attention to our environment nourishes all that is most humane and generous in us – and if we lose this capacity for caring attention, we lose our souls.Benedict AllenWriter, explorer, film-makerHe once said to me, “In the end, Benedict, I’m a professional communicator. And I chose to communicate what I passionately care about: our planet.” I thought that was perfect. Also, I love that he inspired my friend’s daughter with a long, heartfelt letter, replying to her scribbled little note as a very young fan. She’s now a grownup, and an ecologist.Ben OkriAuthorThe chief thing learned from David Attenborough is that longevity in the service of a leading interest is one of the most powerful things in the world. Year after year, just when you would think there is nothing more to be said about the mole or the seal, the tiger cub or the zebra, David finds a new lyricism in the ordinary denizens of the natural world going about their business wholly unaware of being observed and gushed over by this passionate Englishman.View image in fullscreenWith Ben Okri at the Observer Magazine ethical awards in 2009.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianInger AndersenExecutive director of the United Nations Environment ProgrammeAs part of Blue Planet II, Sir David captured the beauty of our oceans and the threats they are facing, including the impacts of plastic pollution. It helped build momentum behind a global call to action.Lucy LapwingBroadcaster, naturalistIn admiring David, I’ve learned it’s OK to be critical of your heroes. David has inspired millions, but he’s not infallible. People have called for him to be more outspoken, and it’s working: recent documentaries have highlighted the plight of the natural world in the face of the climate and consumption crises. I’ve also learned the spider-tailed horned viper has a tail that resembles an arachnid. Nature is incredible.Chantelle LindsayConservationist, presenterDavid’s voice and vast knowledge have long been a soundtrack to my journey of connecting with nature. In Life, I cried at the beautiful mating ritual of the Clark’s grebe. Who said romance was only for humans?View image in fullscreenMaking the 1976 series The Discoverers.Photograph: Barry Boxall/BBCPhilip BernieHead of BBCsportcontentAmong his many extraordinary achievements, David Attenborough notably advanced sport on television when he was controller of BBC Two in the late 60s. He was responsible for Wimbledon being the first regular colour TV offering and for developing snooker as a TV sport, now you could see the balls in colour.Louis TherouxBroadcaster, writerI’ve watched David Attenborough’s programmes my whole life and what I am inspired by, other than the obvious warmth and intelligence, is the economy of his writing and the music of how he delivers the lines: the pauses, the inflection, how he can imbue even a single word with wit. He never says too much.Benedict MacdonaldWriter, founder of RestoreThe lesson I remember from David is, when creating a sequence, “don’t just show what has happened, but why it is important”. We spent two years setting up shoots in Sumatra for Our Planet, trying to captureorangutans using toolsfor the first time. But it was the emotional resonance of the wider setting that made the story; here they were, showing near-human behaviour, in a habitat being cut down by humans.Dr Mya-Rose CraigAKA Birdgirl,Black2Nature founderAs a child who was aware their love of birds was seen as odd, I lived for each Attenborough documentary that came to our living rooms. His love of birds helped me learn mine wasn’t weird, that it makes sense to be excited by the natural world humans are part of.View image in fullscreenWith Mya-Rose Craig in 2016.Photograph: courtesy of Mya-Rose CraigLizzy CrottyAustralian conservationistWhen I met Sir David, what struck me most was his sense of humour. He reminded me that, while conservation is serious work, we won’t last if we don’t find joy along the way.Charles FosterAuthor of Cry of the WildIt’s not the epic elements of David’s work that stay with me – the high drama of a hunt across the plains, or the ant’s eye view of an aphid – but his childlike wonder at it all. David shows us it’s intellectually respectable to love the non-human world, and if you observe closely, you’ll get very emotional about it.Tim HanniganTravel writerBritain’s rich tradition of nature writing wouldn’t exist without David. His documentaries introduced me to nature as narrative. The shock of the revelation that chimpanzees sometimes hunt other animals – and behave in uncannily familiar ways – still lingers.Chloe DaltonAuthorWatching his presentation ofthe male bowerbird’s efforts to lure a mate, I realised nature contains more wonders than can be observed in a single lifespan, but a lifetime can be spent learning from its secrets.Michael MalayNature writerIn one of her letters, Elizabeth Bishop described the qualities she admired in Charles Darwin: exactness of attention and openness to mystery. Behind the patient collector of “facts and minute details”, she glimpsed a “young man … sliding giddily off into the unknown”. She could have easily been describing David Attenborough. He, too, has helped us see the world with greater respect, care, accuracy and joy.View image in fullscreenWith the Zoo Quest team in 1956, en route to Komodo, island home of the giant lizard.Photograph: © David AttenboroughHuw CordeyWildlife documentary-makerDavid radiates confidence and calmness (although I discovered on a shoot he has a phobia of rats). I was once working with him in Bristol when he got a call to say there’d been a mix-up and he had a speaking engagement in St Paul’s in London that afternoon – he was doing the keynote speech, which he’d done nothing to prepare for. He didn’t seem at all flustered. Next day, I asked how it went. “Oh, fine,” he said. “I waved my arms around a bit and it seemed to work.”Bill BaileyComedian, musician, writerHis elegant, unceasing advocacy for the planet is an example to us all. To paraphrase the Victorian naturalist and explorerAlfred Russel Wallace, he is himself one of the great productions of nature.Dara McAnultyAuthor, conservationistDavid Attenborough’s unwavering voice follows you when you’re out in nature. Recently, on a field trip to Borneo, I was (nastily) bitten by a centipede, thanks to my naive explorer complex (which he also inspired). Of course his voice rang in my ears, his indomitable, and sometimes necessary, admonishing narrative. That’s the power of his presence, his embodiment of the joy and wonder of the natural world.Lorraine KellyTV presenter, authorI was honoured to interview the great man and wanted to sit at his feet and listen to him for hours – he has so much wisdom, compassion and humanity. He saved me when I was editing my book while camping in remote Zimbabwe. The only wifi was at anti-poaching stations and when I showed them a pic of me and him, I was given all the internet access I needed.View image in fullscreenDavid Attenborough’s Madame Tussauds waxwork with Lorraine Kelly in 2023.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockHelen MacdonaldAuthorLife on Earthwas a foundational experience for me. Deeply serious and founded on cutting-edge science, it was lit with devotion and fascination.Look,he said.Look at this.He showed us what was there. And that, ever since, is what I have tried to do.Kate WinsletActorBefore the digital world filled our everyday lives, we lived in a different time. David Attenborough remains, for me, an integral part of how things used to be. Our more plentiful oceans, our verdant, bulging rainforests, full of species that thrived before their natural habitats came under such serious threat. He is someone I would swim through stormy seas to meet. In a declining world when we desperately need compassionate anchors, David is that anchor for so many, showing us depths and beauty that won’t be with us forever, forming a picture for future generations of just how vital it is to stay educated, to stay curious.Hans ZimmerComposerI’ve been a film composer all my life, telling stories with music. I’ve worked oncountless movies– some great, some good and some I’d rather not mention. But I’ve always loved the process, the endless hunt for the right note, which expresses something that can’t be elegantly expressed in images or words alone.And then, one day, Sir David and the BBC Natural History Unit came knocking on my door and seduced me with the truth and beauty of extraordinary pictures, tales of courage and a love of the world we have the honour to share with fascinating and extraordinary creatures. And the power of Sir David’s message, always spoken gently with his extraordinary human spirit and intellect, reaching out to us – profoundly moving and kind, full of hope and love – convincing me that now, I’ve finally found the reason for my work.Sadiq KhanMayor of LondonHe is a guiding light in our efforts to make London a more sustainable city. From parks to rivers, his influence can be felt across our green and blue spaces.View image in fullscreenWith Sadiq Khan in 2016.Photograph: David M Benett/Getty ImagesLira ValenciaWildlife influencer, volunteer rangerI often think why did someone like me get into nature? A council estate girl from the city, destined for the corporate world. David has the gift of inspiring people from all walks of life to appreciate and respect nature – a real super power and key to a greener future.Tony JuniperChair of Natural EnglandI have never forgotten Sir David telling of the huge significance of the evolution of grasses. They are the basis of food webs that include grazing mammals and predators such as lions, because they grow from the bottom up, not the top, like other plants. When I see a neatly trimmed lawn, this pops into my mind.Bill McKibbenClimate activist, authorHis whole life has been a remarkable journey, but the last couple of decades are a powerful reminder that long experience can produce deep clarity.View image in fullscreenAbseiling down a living wall in 2016.Photograph: Toby Smith/Geoff Robinson PhotographyMelissa HarrisonAuthorThere’s respect and patience in his approach to nature: it’s not all drama and spectacle, but also waiting, at times failing, it’s about smaller, intimate behaviours, and not inserting yourself into what’s unfolding. Just sitting on a riverbank watching fish flick about feels like something David showed me how to do.Fiona MathewsProfessor ofenvironmentalbiologyI first met David with a bat in my hand. We were at an event with throngs of people and he made a beeline for me as soon as he saw the bat. It turns out they are among his favourite animals, demonstrating his true love of the weird, wonderful creatures of the planet.Farhana YaminClimate lawyer, authorI came to the UK from Pakistan in 1973. My dad banned “western” TV but Life on Earth was allowed – Attenborough’s storytelling made everything fascinating, whether it was about exotic creatures such as cheetahs or insects in our gardens. My sense that nature is a source of delight but that we have a responsibility to protect it comes from him.Molly EastonCo-director ofYoungwildersAttenborough taught me nature is something we do together – not just watch “over there”.

Happy birthday.David OburaMarine ecologist, coral expertI was brought up on Life on Earth. I received the book as a birthday present before I turned 13, still on my bookshelf now. I pored through each chapter, then waited with bated breath for episodes flown to Kenya on VHS video, screened at sporadic movie nights. I wonder that his words now sound close to a semi-obituary for nature that can yet be beautiful, but must be at a new balance with our overbearing species.Colin ButfieldCo-author with David Attenborough of Ocean: Earth’s Last WildernessI remember, before I met him, watching in The Life of Mammals a blue whale breaking through the water as he perched in a small boat only a metre or so away. It was 2002, so there were no drones or satellite tags to help them locate the whale. Most of us would have said “wow” or waffled a few rehearsed facts. David told a story. I’ve learned many things from working with him but the one that stays with me is the power of turning expert research into a fascinating story.View image in fullscreenFilming A Life on Our Planet with Colin Butfield in 2018.Photograph: Conor McDonnellChris WatsonMusician, sound recordistIn April 2010, I was standing with David at the north pole. The Russian helicopter that had flown us there had just taken to the air to film him standing alone on the ice. I had stayed to keep him company and would duck behind a slab of sea ice when the helicopter returned. As we chatted, we observed that in one direction was the US while to our left was Europe and farther over was Asia. All the time zones on the planet converged at our feet, so what time was it for us?Helen CzerskiPhysicist, oceanographer, presenterThe UK named a research vessel for him and I saw it being built and talked to him about it. His excitement was focused on the science it would enable, and the new ideas, new knowledge and new perspectives on the natural world that would come with it. It was humbling to see such indomitable curiosity, alongside the absolute conviction that nature will always have something fascinating to teach us.Raynor WinnAuthorDavid taught us to look below the surface, observe the detail, then question what we saw. I received the Life on Earth book as a school prize in 1979. Since then, he’s taught us all how to see what’s really happening, not just in nature but in the wider shifting world.Tanya SteeleWWF CEODavid is famous for his words, yet he is a generous listener, whether discussing politics or a new species. I’m inspired by his willingness to be a voice for nature in the corridors of power as well as our living rooms.Louis JadwatClub promoterYou might not think of David Attenborough as having a big impact on clubbing, but in 2018 a student party my friend Will and I threw,celebrating him, went viral. We turned a Leeds venue into a jungle and filled it with cardboard cutouts and masks. Then the DJ cut his narration over tracks. It led to a sort of collective joy, realising he’d taught a generation to find excitement and happiness in the natural world.Mary RobinsonFormer president of Ireland, former UN human rights commissioner andclimate envoyOur family loved watching David Attenborough’s films, enthralled by his wonder and joy. Gradually, watching with grandchildren, I became irritated. Why did he not mention the climate crisis? When he did, with increasing authority, what a difference he made!View image in fullscreenWith Mary Robinson, receiving an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin in 2008.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyElif ShafakAuthor, activistFor me, David Attenborough is, first and foremost, an exquisite storyteller, making “the invisible” more visible and bringing the “far away” closer to our homes and thus our hearts. In an age in which we need to connect the dots and see how deeply interconnected we all are beyond borders, he is a bridge builder between cultures and continents, humans and nature.Debbie PainConservation biologist, ecotoxicologistIn 2016 David Attenborough wrote a letter on behalf of the World Land Trust, for which I worked, opposing plans to build an environmentally disastrous road bridge across the Kinabatangan River in Borneo.

This greatest hits remix of previous episodes likeLove and Monsters,BlinkandTurn Left, where we only see glimpses of the Doctor in the background, just about earned its place in the run.Much of the weight of the episode was carried by whether you could invest in hate-watching Jonah Hauer-King as odious grifter Conrad Clark, the podcast host and conspiracy theory propagandist who had gone through what he called the “chore” of getting to know Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) in order to “expose the lies” of Unit.Having already watched Ruby live out a post-Doctor life in a different timeline in73 Yards, there was a real risk of a re-tread, as this episode hit several similar beats, including her aimlessness and romantic failures, and being trapped in a pub in a small village with a menace outside. But Gibson got the best line. Asked who put her in charge, her delivery of “or go and get some fresh air, big man, and see what happens” was deliciously waspish.Pete McTighe had previously written the muddled messaging ofKerblam!for the 13th Doctor, and did a better job here of targeting the conspiracy sphere than he did targeting Amazon in that. The tension ratcheted up sharply once Unit were on the scene, and Jemma Redgrave (Kate Lethbridge-Stewart) was put in a position where she ceased knowing where to draw the line.View image in fullscreenRatchet that tension! … Kate Lethbridge-Stewart (Jemma Redgrave) and Colonel Ibrahim (Alexander Devrient).Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonThe episode touched upon modern phenomena with the doxing of Unit staff, the livestreaming of the armed standoff via body cam and the mainstreaming of conspiracy theories on broadcast legacy media. And if you thought the idea of Think Tank seemed far-fetched, just recall the moment in 2021 whenanti-vaccine campaigners filmed themselves “serving legal papers”to hospital staff alleging “crimes against humanity” at the height of the Covid pandemic.Sum it up in one sentence?What ifDoctor Whodid another episode like Love and Monsters, but without the terrible ending.Lifeaboard the TardisWe only got three Tardis moments, with Belinda (Varada Sethu) and the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) using the vortex indicator in 2007, Ruby and the Doctor having their own encounter with the Shreek – dialogue indicated that happened directly after last year’sThe Devil’s Chord– and the Doctor telling off Clark in the Tardis at some unspecified point between the two.Fear factorView image in fullscreenAll the monsters are human … odious grifter Conrad (Jonah Hauer-King).Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonSomeone who was definitely feeling the fear factor wasthe Vlinx, who hilariously couldn’t abandon its post on the Unit bridge fast enough. The Shreek were monster of the week, and, rather like the Dregs inOrphan 55, worked better in the shadows and in brief shots than out in the open. The reveal that, at least at one point, they actuallywerejust men in hoax rubber suits felt like yet more meta-commentary on the production of the show. But all the real monsters in this episode were human.Mysteries and questionsSurely “the guv’nor” is not going to turn out to be the recurring Anita Dobson’s villain character name?Deeper into the vortexView image in fullscreenShe’ll be back … expect more from Shirley (Ruth Madeley) soon.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/James PardonIt was good to see the London Eye being used as a tourist attraction again on New Year’s Eve in 2007. Public confidence must have recovered after it was discovered to be the Auton transmitter inRose, set in March 2005.The first time we saw the Doctor operate the Tardis with a snap of his fingers was in 2008 episodeForest of the Dead, when David Tennant’s 10th Doctor tries it after having been told by River Song that her Doctor in the future could open the doors that way.Among the aliens Clark lists as Unit hoaxes are the Sycorax, who appeared in David Tennant’s debutThe Christmas Invasion, and “yetis in the underground”, a reference to the partially missing 1968 Patrick Troughton storyThe Web of Fear, which first introduced us to the character of Kate’s dad, who then had the rank of Col Lethbridge-Stewart.We can expect to see Unit again later in the year, as Redgrave, Alexander Devrient and Ruth Madeley are all reprising their roles in spin-off The War Between the Land and the Sea.This is the second time in a fortnight that a main character has been told their name is “ridiculous”, as Clark used the word to belittle Ruby after we’d seen Belinda dismiss the Doctor’s chosen moniker duringLuxthe same way.Think Tankwas the name of the scientific institute developing a giant robot and infiltrated by conspiracy-minded scientists during Tom Baker’s 1974 debutRobot.If you missed it, earlier this week we ponderedwhether the whole enterprise might be on its last legs…Next timeLagos!

Could I ever forgive my father for driving him away?Growing up, I had so many questions about Marshall, my hippy older sibling who left home and got embroiled with the Manson Family cult. Years later, I embarked on a quest to find out his true storyKate PotterSat 3 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareOne morning in March 1995, my father and I were having coffee at the kitchen table when somehow the conversation deviated to my brother Marshall. As always, I had questions.“He was tall for his age,” my father said, gazing at the memory of his estranged son, as if he was standing beside us in the kitchen. “At school they always wanted him for the football team. His hair was red, deep red like your grandmother’s, and his eyes …” my father paused, searching for the right comparison. “Copper. His eyes were copper-coloured and he’d tan so well in the summer he looked as if he’d been dipped in wood stain.”Another memory still tickled. “A 15-year-old kid tried to dominate him once, bragging about being 15, and Marsh stood up, towered above him and said in a manly voice, ‘Well, I’m12.’”My father’s smile slowly sank as a thought passed behind his eyes. “When he was 17,” he continued, “Marshall won a scholarship to Harvard off the back of a short story he wrote, and he declined it! Can you imagine?” My father went quiet for a moment, the blade of that wasted opportunity still sharp. “He was such a gifted writer.”My father was of a generation that upheld the notion that if an establishment such as Harvard University came knocking, it was your duty to answer. Not to do so was an unforgivable waste of opportunity.Perhaps Marshall didn’t want that particular opportunity at that particular time in his life, I suggested. Perhaps it was simply bad timing. I felt my words fail the moment they left my mouth.His voice soured: “Then he became a hippy.”View image in fullscreenMarshall Potter with his parents in 1945.Photograph: courtesy of Kate PotterI was well versed on the family accounts surrounding Marshall’s life choices. The last time my father had seen his son was 22 years earlier. Marshall had been a homeless hippy who had hitchhiked from California to Texas in need of money.I knew my father found it all hard to talk about. His hand trembled as he lifted his mug.My father was 54 when I was born, and I loved him beyond measure. He had a warm American voice, and was witty and full of character. At four years old, when I asked why I had a belly button, he replied that it was for dips when eating crudites. Chocolate digestives were wedged in apple tree branches for my sister and me to pick. Hoisted on to his shoulders, we would reach for them in the belief that cookies really did grow on trees.However, as I became an adult, I became more aware of the life he’d lived before I was born, and I wanted to know more. How could my father leave one of his children behind, allow him to disappear into a void? Was it my father’s choice or Marshall’s? How did my brother become linked to theCharles Manson cult, so infamous it rocked the foundations of American society? Years of research and discussions with family members have brought me closer to the answers.My brother’s story begins miles away from sunny California, love-ins and communal living, in middle-class 1950s Michigan and the emotional chaos of Marshall’s mother, my father’s first wife, Sally. After years of a gradual descent into psychosis, Sally was hospitalised in 1954, receiving electroshock therapy and medication. A year after admission, Sally was deemed fit enough to return home for a weekend. The moment my father went out to do the grocery shopping, she lay on the bed filled with enough sleeping pills to kill a horse, drifting so far into oblivion that her son’s pleas for her to wake up failed to reach her. Marshall was 11 years old.After this devastating upheaval, my father, with the help of my grandmother, sought structure for his teenage son, finding the solution with the Marine Corps. An ex-US marine and war veteran himself, my father knew the kind of discipline the marines could inculcate. Marshall was subsequently enrolled at the prestigious Howe school, a private military academy in Indiana, and a photograph was taken to immortalise that first day. Looking closely at that image, it’s clear Marshall isn’t keen. Aged 13, not yet two years since his mother took her own life, my brother stands rigid in his service uniform next to the Howe school gate, head slightly lowered, flinging the photographer a glowering stare. It is an anger my father’s lens doesn’t hide.View image in fullscreenMarshall Potter aged 13, outside the military school he was sent to after his mother killed herself.Photograph: courtesy of Kate PotterMarshall’s time at Howe didn’t last long. After a year, my father’s job relocated them to the Netherlands where my father met his second wife. By this time, Marshall was 15 and his behaviour was becoming a problem. Unable to self-regulate, my brother became volatile, opinionated, oppositional. Modern psychology tells us that suppressed trauma will find an escape route, behaviour the most common outlet. In 1959, however, my father’s emotional awareness was far less acute. Marshall was sent away again, this time to a boarding school in Switzerland. By 1962, at just 18 years old and a fully fledged marine, my brother found himself stationed in Vietnam where his days were fraught with danger. During one of those harrowing moments, an explosion changed his life for ever. The blast resulted in burn scarring on the side of his head and severely damaged the hearing in his right ear. The psychological scars would linger far longer.Discharged in 1966, Marshall was thrust back into a turbulent America that had little regard for the sacrifices made by young veterans. In a world that seemed to have forgotten them, countless others like him were searching for a sense of purpose. Thus, at the tender age of 23, my brother entered the hippy world of California as a war veteran struggling to find his place as the country grappled with civil rights issues, anti‑war protests and counterculture movements. As traditional values crumbled, it is easy to see why vulnerable individuals would have been susceptible to manipulation by charismatic leaders, particularly sociopathic predators like Charles Manson, who preyed on those who felt marginalised or disconnected from mainstream society. And so it proved for Marshall.My father embodied an archaic America. Marshall’s dubious life choices were disapproved of. He called my father a ‘corporate whore’For someone like my brother, who had seen the darker sides of humanity, the 1960s counterculture must have represented not just freedom but a chance to heal. It was a world far removed from the hellscape of Vietnam and the archaic rigidity of military institutions, and Marshall would have been easily swept up in it.Spahn Ranchwas the perfect place for Manson to position himself as a guru. In the middle of nowhere, it was as far from any form of social connection as it could be, isolating the “family” from cultural norms. Yet an internal sense of community prevailed through the language of belonging. At first, it’s likely that Marshall would have responded to small requests, such as attending meetings or participating in group hangouts, perhaps getting friendly with a fringe member who would pull him into the circle. He would have received a warm welcome, hugs, been shown around a sprawling compound, while its elderly owner, George Spahn, sat passive and blind in a rocking chair, a pretty girl on his lap. Communal living would present itself as a consensual family space where children were looked after, all burdens of responsibility vanished. Acid trips would create transcendental experiences.Marshall needed family, and, for a short while, he must have felt as if he’d found one. Nine months later, however, the sky would fall. The horror of the Manson murders had exposed the workings of a deeply disturbed mind. There’s relief in knowing that my brother was long gone by then. Headstrong and resistant to coercion, Marshall was again on the move, drifting in and out of familial memories until 1973, when Manson and his killers were two years into their life sentences.The most vivid vignette in the Marshall archive occurred in June that year. It was to be the last encounter my father would have with his son. At 29 years old, my brother stepped out of the shadows to materialise on my parents’ front doorstep in Houston, Texas. The oppressive heat rendered him shirtless under denim dungarees, and barefoot – a striking figure wrapped in a tattered blanket, caught between past and present. Beneath the nest of hair and unkempt beard, familiar copper eyes gleamed, and my father was pleased to see him.Marshall was warmly welcomed into the home. My father introduced him to my mother, and showed off his new baby daughter. Marshall stayed a few days, and my mother remembers how gentle he was with my sister, helping to feed her, wiping her chin.“Dad’s a quiet man, isn’t he?” Marshall said to my mother, a plastic spoon of apple sauce held aloft. She nodded. Yes, she agreed that he was. “We Potters are a quiet bunch,” he said as my sister’s little mouth opened for her spoonful.After a week he announced his departure. My father’s corporate job was a big source of contention. Marshall’s dubious life choices were disapproved of, sparking defensiveness on his part. A bitter argument followed. Two generations clashed at the kitchen table. My father embodied the principled, archaic America built on religious faith, conformity, academic success and stoicism. The lost Harvard opportunity still stung. Marshall, however, came to the table as a member of a damaged generation in search of change and cultural freedom by taking a stand against conservative ideals and middle-class values. I’m told he called my father a “corporate whore”.“This is my life. This is how I will live it,” my brother asserted, forefinger pressing on the table.And so, on the way to the bus station, the last time my father would ever be with Marshall, my brother demanded to be dropped off in a layby along the Katy Freeway. The car door slammed shut. As my father drove away, his rear-view mirror caught sight of a painted van pulling over. His son got in. I often think how strange it must be to see your child disappear into a void, spirited away in a dubious-looking vehicle spattered with graffiti.August 1981. One summer evening, my sister and I were playing in the garden. It had been a warm afternoon and we were still running through the sprinkler as the day waned. The phone rang, my father answered, his demeanour shifting as he pressed his ear to a familiar voice laden with distress and urgency.“Dad, I’ve done something stupid.”We heard my father’s tone change between long silences. Then he called for my mother. My sister and I looked at each other. Something was wrong. Someone named Marshall needed help, money for a lawyer.In the early 1980s, ongoing investigations scrutinised anyone who might be linked to Charles Manson, and Marshall was caught in that trawling net. The shadow of the Manson murders loomed large. Victims’ families were still grappling with the aftermath of those horrifying events, and law enforcement was desperate for answers regarding potential connections between Manson associates and contemporary cases of violent crimes taking place in New York. Many individuals linked to Manson or anyone within his organisation were apprehended and scrutinised. To me and my sister, however, none of this made sense. My parents discussed it at length, long after we had gone to bed, and it wasn’t until a few days later that I summoned up the courage to ask my father who Marshall was.But, after that phone call, all things Marshall fell deathly and irrevocably silent.It was 11 September 2002, and my husband and I, newly embarked on our teacher training, found ourselves at home in our London studio flat. The television news that evening was centred on the first anniversary of the9/11 attacks. We watched as representatives from more than 90 countries arrived in New York City, their sombre presence interspersed with haunting footage of the planes crashing into the World Trade Center. The profound sense of vulnerability that had enveloped the world’s greatest superpower struck a chord with me – as though it mirrored a similar vulnerability in my father. This was also the year he would turn 80, and, over the coming months, I felt a sense of urgency to reassess unresolved questions about his past.Over the years, Marshall had never been far from my mind. Still drifting in and out of our lives, my brother would appear by way of a photograph unearthed in a drawer, or a casual mention in conversation would ­trigger an anecdote. That evening, the mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg lighting the eternal flame in Battery Park was that trigger. The desire to reconnect, to remember, to unravel the mysteries ­surrounding my brother’s life launched me on a quest to find him for myself. Apart from asking distant ­relatives, I didn’t know where to start.View image in fullscreenMarshall in 1955.Photograph: courtesy of Kate PotterIn August 2003, a groundbreaking network called MySpace heralded a new age of online socialising. On the persuasion of a friend, I set up an account. It occurred to me that MySpace might be a way of finding my mysterious lost brother. I still wanted answers; to find out what happened to him after that phone call.My search yielded many Marshall Potters, none of them mine, and it looked like a dead end. I turned to archive sites until I found one offering access to official documents, national census information and addresses. It claimed to have a Marshall Potter on its records. Embedded in documents and certificates, I finally unearthed my brother. His birth date matched, but there was also an additional date, the other bookend to a life: 14 September 1995.I couldn’t help but think about my father fleshing out that shadowy figure at the kitchen table nine years earlier. There had been a six-month deadline to find him and I was eight years too late.About a month later, the postman arrived with a document that required my signature. When I held the envelope in my hands, I felt a mixture of dread and anticipation. I was hoping Marshall’s death certificate would provide me with the closure I needed. For a long while I didn’t want to open it. A part of me didn’t want to know the cause of his death. Marshall would have been 51 at the time, and I could only speculate at a heart attack or misadventure. When I finally read it, the certificate told a different story.Date: 14/09/1995. Time: 04:00. Cause of death:gunshot wound to head and brain.No pending investigation, concluded suicide.I often reflect on my father’s decisions. Was he simply a product of his time? Was Marshall a casualty of his?For a long time, I found myself at odds with how my father let his only son vanish down the barrel of a gun. Still, he was upset by the news of Marshall’s suicide, enough so that my mother rang to tell me not to discuss it any further. I was frustrated by this stubborn reluctance to talk. Surely, together, we could cauterise this wound; it would be of help to my father, and me, towards a positive understanding. Or perhaps my mother was right to shoo me away. Perhaps the news had weakened a dam restricting the flow of a regret too big to control. It’s no secret that my father’s generation had a removed regard to parenting, the misguided assumption that Marshall, being male, would survive, would “rally round” and “step up”; an ethos that a 1950s military school would, no doubt, brutally uphold with pride. So often I’d think of Marshall, gun poised to his temple, about to launch himself into another world where he’s no longer broken. It still feels strange to mourn someone I’ve never met, yet my DNA tells me I do.When my father died in 2007, it brought a profound sense of loss, not just of him, but also of Marshall. My father never had the opportunity to make amends, something I’m sure he lamented. I often reflect on my father’s decisions and the societal norms that influenced him. Was my father simply a product of his time? Was Marshall a casualty of his? In the future, will our children, decades from now, look back at our parenting choices and say to us:you got that wrong?In today’s digital age, rife with toxic influencers preying on our vulnerable children, the relevance of my father and Marshall’s story becomes more acute. At its heart lies the need to communicate with our children, to satiate the craving to belong and be understood. As a parent, I will embrace this responsibility, for I know the implications of inaction are far too great.Explore more on these topicsSiblingsParents and parentingFamilyBereavementAutobiography and memoirBiography booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Though it has been 93 years since the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case merged crime, fame and mass media together, the enduring mystery of the crime still holds fascination for many in the US.The case was shocking. Thetransatlantic aviator Charles Lindberghand his wife Anne Morrow Lindbergh suffered the kidnapping and murder of their 20-month-old baby son on 1 March 1932. Now a new lawsuit filed in New Jersey – where the crime played out – seeks to force the state police to allow mitochondrial DNA testing on envelopes used to send a series of ransom notes.The crime was pinned on a 36-year-old German immigrant, Bruno Hauptmann, but his conviction relied on circumstantial evidence. Hauptmann, who was sent to the electric chair, maintained his innocence of the abduction and death of little Charles A Lindbergh Jr.But the involvement of unknown co-conspirators has never been entirely ruled out – and even the prosecutor in the case seemed to have doubts that Hauptmann acted alone when the infant was stolen from his second-floor nursery using a homemade ladder.The case had a profound impact on American legal and cultural history, expanding the authority of the FBI – then known as the BOI, or Bureau of Investigation – to investigate kidnappings involving interstate travel and expanding their role in law enforcement, while making kidnapping a federal offense and leading to a ban on photography and cameras in federal and most state courts.But enduring speculation about the death of the child – whose body was discovered on 12 May beside a nearby road – and who was behind the kidnapping and ransom demands has never entirely subsided. Now researchers want access to more than a quarter-million documents, photos and other bits of evidence in an archive at theNew Jerseystate police museum in West Trenton, New Jersey.The archive was made accessible 44 years ago by an executive order of the New Jersey governor, Brendan Byrne, so scholars and members of the public could study the crime. But for more than a year, researchers have been locked out as calls for advanced DNA testing on the evidence have mounted.Plaintiffs inthe lawsuitcontend that in an era when “the very idea of historical or legal truth has come under political pressure it is incumbent on those of us who prize truthfulness in our public life to use every tool at our disposal to affirm its value”.View image in fullscreenA postcard from the kidnapper published in the Daily Express in London in 1938.Photograph: Print Collector/Getty ImagesOpening the case’s archives to modern forensic science testing, they say, is a necessary step in the pursuit of truth and historical justice. DNA testing of the ransom letter “has the potential to clarify lingering questions about the case, reaffirm or challenge past conclusions, and ultimately contribute to a fuller, more accurate account of our collective past.”The plaintiffs are Jonathan Hagel, a New Jersey native and professor at the University of Kansas who has studied the Lindbergh case for decades, Michele Downie, a retired schoolteacher, and Catherine Read, an author and developmental psychologist.They contend that saliva on the backs of stamps and on glue used to seal the envelopes could help to resolve questions about whether Hauptmann acted alone or in concert with unidentified others.But why would New Jersey want to prevent scientific testing of evidence?In response to a prior lawsuit over the archive, the state police said they wanted to ensure that there was no risk of damage or mutilation to the artefacts. The state police have said that closing the archive is a temporary measure so they can develop new access policies around genetic testing by experts.A court ruling in the earlier lawsuit, also brought by the current plaintiffs’ attorney Kurt Perhach, over access to the material for genetic testing found that the suit had not sufficiently established a public interest in analytic testing.In message to the Guardian this week, the New Jersey’s attorney general’s office said it would not comment on pending litigation.“This is a 93-year-old case and I don’t think they actually care about knowing the truth,” says Perhach. “But their argument about damaging the documents is completely laughable.”Perhach says there is an urgency to examine the documents because the Lindbergh documents have already been threatened by a water leak. “It’s not like they’re being kept in the Smithsonian – it’s not an environment where it’s going to last indefinitely. They’re deteriorating and wearing down, and will continue to do so.”The demand for scientific access to the documents comes as the Trump administration has released archives relating to the assassinations of President John F Kennedy and his attorney general brother, Robert F Kennedy, with little new gleaned from either.View image in fullscreenA contemporary front page shows Charles A Lindbergh Jr, who was kidnapped from his crib at the Lindbergh home at Hopewell, New Jersey.Photograph: New York Daily News Archive/NY Daily News/Getty ImagesBut the Lindbergh files, conceivably, could show that others were involved in a conspiracy to kidnap and ransom the child. They could either confirm or – perhaps more likely – dismiss conspiracy theories that have surrounded the case. Some have suggested that Hauptmann was the victim of a police frame-up; others that the hero-aviator may have been involved in the kidnapping and murder of his own son.“Maybe there is no more saliva available there, but there’s 15 total envelopes which contain 12 stamps and there’s still adhesive. Unless somebody in 1932 had the foresight to dab water on the adhesive there’s a high likelihood that there’s still saliva attached to these pieces of paper,” said Perhach.Angelique Corthals, a forensic anthropologist at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, who has written a letter in support of the lawsuit argues that the envelopes would be handled in “a non-destructive manner”.Corthals, who drew international attention in her successful attempt to extract DNA from ancient Egyptian mummies, told the Guardian that it was “pretty realistic” to think DNA could be extracted.“We have the technology to amplify very, very small amounts of DNA and are getting better at parsing out contaminate DNA, including recovering particles from a document or a stamp without destroying it,” Corthals told the Guardian.Advances in DNA analysis have produced, for instance,an entire Neanderthal genome, identified by the evolutionary genetics specialist and Nobel prize winner Dr Svante Pääbo, and the arrest of “Golden State Killer” Joseph DeAngelo using DNA from a cup collected at the 1980 double murder of Lyman and Charlene Smith, and running it through a genealogy database.Few seriously doubt that 36-year Hauptmann was at least involved with the Lindbergh baby case. He was arrested in September 1934 after using a $10 bill from about $50,000 in ransom paid by Lindbergh. Some of the ransom money was found in Hauptmann’s garage and wood used to make the ladder matched wooden beams in his home.But the man who came to collect the ransom through an intermediary at a Bronx cemetery, who became known as “Cemetery John”, did not match Hauptmann’s appearance.The intermediary on the exchange, Dr John Condon, specifically said the man he had met was not Hauptmann.But opening up the Lindbergh files to DNA testing under open public access records laws could open up access to countless government-controlled records and documents, says Perhach.“In the event that Hauptmann’s DNA is found on the envelopes it just proves he was a conspirator like everyone knew, but the broader concern they have is that extending the Open Public Records Act will open up DNA testing in future cases,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS crimeNew JerseyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe Leinster thought that a fourth successiveChampions Cupfinal appearance was a formality against supposedly outgunned English opposition. If so they were made to pay a heavy price as a triple whammy of tries from Tommy Freeman helped Northampton pull off one of the all-time great knockout heists.Henry Pollock revels in ‘special win’ over Leinster in hardest game of his lifeRead moreThe Irish province, beaten in the final in the last three consecutive seasons, looked stunned at the final whistle. But the Saints had led 27-15 at half-time and, even afterLeinsterhad charged back to within three points, the visitors came knocking again via a 63rd-minute score from James Ramm. The final quarter was frantically tense, settled in contentious fashion after an aghast Leinster had a possible 79th-minute score disallowed.It was a seesawing thriller to compare with the classic Munster v Wasps semi-final back in 2004, previously first among equals in this exhilarating category. As well as being a memorable contest in its own right, it was also a heavy-duty final trial for assorted contenders on both sides with Thursday’s British & Irish Lions squad announcement looming. Is Andy Farrell’s mind already made up? If not here was some compelling additional 11th-hour evidence, not least from a couple of Englishmen who played central roles in the throbbing drama.Quick GuideBath beat Edinburgh to reach Challenge Cup finalShowScotland talisman Finn Russell enjoyed a fruitful return to his homeland as Bath eventually wore down spirited Edinburgh to reach their first European final in 11 years with a 39-24 Challenge Cup semi-final victory.The runaway Premiership leaders – undermined by losing players to untimely yellow cards in each half – trailed 17-12 in the third quarter at The Hive.But Bath's power ultimately paid off, with all six of their tries scored by forwards, as they set up a showdown with the winner of Sunday's semi-final between the Top 14 sides Lyon and Racing 92 in the final at Cardiff's Principality Stadium on 23 May.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There was certainly no ignoring – not for the first or last time – the precociously talented England flanker Henry Pollock who contributed a spectacular solo first-half try and a stunning late turnover and again looked wholly unfazed by the lofty company he is keeping. The back row is already awash with candidates but Pollock could not have done much more.Ditto Fin Smith, whose duel with Sam Prendergast was an enthralling one for connoisseurs and casual watchers alike. Smith did not have everything his own way but exudes the calm assurance of a veteran No10. Prendergast is also clearly a talent but will Farrell pick both of them with his son Owen, Finn Russell and George Ford also in the fly-half frame? We shall see.View image in fullscreenNorthampton close ranks on Joe McCarthy to frustrate Leinster with a courageous defensive display.Photograph: David Fitzgerald/Sportsfile/Getty ImagesWhoever goes, this was a proper ding-dong even without the significant subtext. Preparing to face a full-metal Leinster at the moment is psychologically akin to being strapped to the railway track with a steaming locomotive just round the bend. And that’s when you don’t have the ball. The pressure is just as screeching when Leinster are defending, the blue line erected by Jacques Nienaber so steely that neither of their previous knockout opponents, Harlequins and Glasgow, mustered a single point between them.It was all the more encouraging for the Saints, then, when they opened the scoring with a daring early score, Smith cutting a sharp line from Ramm’s pass to split the cover and then rolling a perfect chip into the path of his good mate Freeman who, after a brief juggle, did the rest.Leinster, though, are a mighty hard side to subdue for long and the understanding between Jamison Gibson-Park and Prendergast is sharp enough to take advantage of the smallest opportunity. WithNorthamptonstill digesting the award of a free-kick to the home side, Gibson-Park took the swiftest of taps and Prendergast’s long ball put the lurking Tommy O’Brien over.Cue Pollock. Even with his side down to 14 players after Curtis Langdon was sent to the sin-bin, he is not the type to shut up shop even 50 metres from the opposing line. Storming on to a short ball from Mitchell, he left Prendergast grasping at thin air on the touchline and raced clear for a striking score at the glass-windowed end of the stadium.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Pollock and Smith were both part of a slick backline attack that gave Freeman another chance to show his pace on the right before the winger secured his third after a box kick fell nicely for the stampeding Juarno Augustus.The 12-point half-time gap was reminiscent of the famous Cardiff final in 2011 when Leinster overcame a 16-point interval deficit against the same opponents. The hosts, as then, were always going to mount some kind of fightback and duly did so through third-quarter tries by Caelan Doris and Josh van der Flier, his second of the game.View image in fullscreenTommy Freeman storms in to complete a first-half hat-trick for Northampton.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesWith Jordie Barrett now involved off the bench, surely that would be that? Not a bit of it. With Leinster unusually stretched, Saints kept the ball alive and the excellent Ramm dived over, Smith added the conversion to his earlier penalty and Northampton led by 10 points with 15 minutes left. A yellow card for Josh Kemeny for a high tackle and a converted 69th-minute try for James Lowe provided further twists but after Ross Byrne was denied a late score at the corner flag for a knock-on in the buildup it was the Saints who will now go marching into this month’s final in Cardiff.Explore more on these topicsChampions CupLeinsterNorthamptonRugby unionmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

There was precious little rotation from the manager before Wednesday night’s Champions League, semi-final second leg away against Paris Saint-Germain, the tie that cast long shadows here. Arteta wanted to keep his starters in the groove, to generate momentum for the Parc des Princes with a win. So much for the theory.Arteta rested Jurrien Timber, who had picked up a minor knock in the1-0 first-leg defeat against PSGbut that apart, he went with pretty much his best available line-up. It was certainly a contrast to the approach of his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, who made 10 changes for his team’s Ligue 1 game at Strasbourg. PSG, who have already sewn up the title, lost 2-1.Arteta’s refusal to ring Arsenal changes keeps doom spiral firmly locked in | Ed AaronsRead moreIt was looking good for Arsenal when Declan Rice marked his 100th appearance for the club with the opening goal on 34 minutes. Arteta had recalled Thomas Partey after his European suspension and his presence had a liberating effect on Rice in midfield, allowing him to play in his more familiar driving role.And yet it would all come crashing down for Arsenal as Andoni Iraola oversaw a stunningBournemouthturnaround from the midway point of the second-half – basically from the moment he introduced Antoine Semenyo and Alex Scott from the substitutes’ bench. That said, his Bournemouth team had asked questions before then.Bournemouth had only ever tasted defeat in away matches against Arsenal. But they would depart with a victory that gave their hopes of a first ever European qualification a tonic. It was almost a footnote that it also added up to aPremier Leaguedouble over Arsenal – after their 2-0 home win over them last October.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice gives Arsenal the lead.Photograph: John Walton/PASemenyo was the provider for the equaliser, his long throw headed home by Dean Huijsen and Scott was behind what proved to be the winner, his corner bundled in by Evanilson. Did the striker use a hand? Arteta thought so but the VAR, after a lengthy check, gave the all-clear. At long last, Bournemouth had caught a break from the technology; Evanilson, too. He was sent off in last weekend’s1-1 home draw against Manchester Unitedon the advice of the VAR; a decision thatwas later rescinded.Bournemouth were 1-0 up at the time.Iraola’s team are realistically chasing an eighth-placed finish, which could be enough for a place in next season’s Uefa Conference League. Their belief has soared – in stark contrast to that of Arsenal.The north London club are supposed to be the set-piece kings but the concessions here were their 11th and 12th from dead-ball deliveries in the league this season. Even more worrying, it was the tenth game in which they had led and failed to win; a total of 21 points squandered. In only one previous season have they thrown away as many points from winning positions, which was in 2019-20. Could Arsenal yet find themselves looking over their shoulders for a top-five finish and a return to next season’s Champions League?It was the worst possible outcome for Arteta, going strong with his selection and getting nothing, even if he could enjoy the performance of Rice, whose desire to surge forward was an impossible-to-miss detail. Rice lacked end product initially but it did not affect him. He kept coming and his finish for the breakthrough goal was clinical; never in doubt from the moment he fastened on to Martin Ødegaard’s reverse ball and ran around Kepa Arrizabalaga. Ødegaard had found the space on the half turn following a pass from Partey.Quick GuideArsenal v Bournemouth match statsShow• This was the first time Bournemouth have ever avoided defeat away against Arsenal in all competitions (L8).• Arsenal have dropped 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, their joint-most ever in a single campaign (also 21 in 2019-20).• Dean Huijsen’s equaliser was Bournemouth’s first shot on target in this match, and their first Premier League goal from a throw-in since  2017.• Declan Rice made his 100th appearance for Arsenal in all competitions. His opener was his 15th goal for the club, as many goals as he managed in 245 games for West Ham.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was a sickener for Bournemouth, for whom this was arguably a bigger game given their European aspirations via the league. They played a full part in a lively first half and they created the first big chance, Evanilson heading high from Milos Kerkez’s whipped cross on 26minutes.

But they still needed William Saliba to stretch into a last-man slide tackle on Dango Ouattara before Rice’s goal. There was also the moment in first-half stoppage time when David Raya erred with a pass out from the back and Evanilson had the chance to measure a chip with the goalkeeper off his line. He overcooked it.Iraola was an animated presence throughout. He watched Arsenal bring the intensity at the start of the second half, Bukayo Saka going close with a curling shot but then came the substitutions that changed everything. Semenyo’s first act was to blaze up the right only to show too much of the ball to Saliba, who cleared for a throw-in.View image in fullscreenDean Huijsen’s header beats David Raya to bring Bournemouth level.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe Bournemouth winger’s next act was to hurl the throw-in into the box whereupon Huijsen, drifting back from near the goal to the six-yard line, craned his neck to direct his header home. It was a stunning piece of athleticism and precision.Bournemouth sensed blood. Marcus Tavernier, who Iraola had moved from the right to the No 10 position after Semenyo’s introduction, went close with a shot that deflected over. When Scott curled over the corner, Bournemouth forged ahead. Tavernier won the flick-on and Evanilson was stronger than Ødegaard at the far post, managing to get something to the ball, forcing it home. Raya was guilty of a fumble into the bargain.

Certainly he could do no more than the complete commitment he demonstrated in delivering a remarkable lap for pole position at the Miami Grand Prix. He was equally pleased in the process to be able to confirm that becoming a new father had had no impact on his pace, but the world champion remained unequivocal that he still expected more from his Red Bull team after they were found wanting at his expense inSaturday’s sprint race.Verstappen claimed pole with an immense lap at the Hard Rock stadium, in what was an enormously competitive session. Anything short of perfection would have been costly and he was on rails, just beating the McLaren of Lando Norris into second and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli into a superb third place by the tiniest of margins, six hundredths of a second. McLaren’s Oscar Piastri was fourth and Mercedes’ George Russell fifth.McLaren’s Norris wins chaotic Miami sprint race as Hamilton grabs thirdRead moreVerstappen set the pole with a blistering final lap in Q3, threading the needle in Miami with an attacking assurance that was a reminder of just how quick he can be when he has confidence in his ride – something that has been sorely lacking on many occasions this season. The Dutch driver, who became a father for the first time with the birth of his daughter Lily in the last week, felt satisfied that he had answered suggestions bandied around that becoming a father would slow him down.“It’s been good to be able to spend a few days at home before coming here,” he said. “When she’s just born you want to make sure everything is OK. Clearly it didn’t make me slower as well, being a dad, so that’s a positive. We can throw that out of the window as well for people mentioning it.”This was also the perfect comeback for the world champion after he was penalised in the sprint race for an unsafe release in the pit lane, dropping him from fourth to 17th place. With Norris and Piastri taking a one-two it dropped Verstappen to 21 points behind Piastri in the world championship but, with the pole, he has a great opportunity to claw some of it back on Sunday.He was unsurprisingly pleased, especially with track position being so crucial in Miami. After managing only sixth in Bahrain with a car that lacked balance and a pit stop problem, he was blunt that he did not believe he could compete for the title as things stood. The team had held discussions after that race to consider how best to address the issues but have been honest in that no quick fix was expected, with a disconnect between wind tunnel predictions and real world performance at the heart of their inability to solve the problems.Yet they came back well with pole and second in Saudi Arabia and had been hopeful of further improvement from the new floor they brought to Miami and it appears it has, at very least over the single lap, narrowed the gap to McLaren.Verstappen acknowledged as much but maintained the team could ill-afford any errors.“We need to make less mistakes and we need to find more performance,” he said. “I think it’s quite straightforward, it’s just not easy to extract or find. That’s how it is, but we keep pushing, keep trying to bring bits to the car to make it faster.“What we are trying to achieve is a better balance in the car. Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something, because it’s just a really weird layout but it was not negative. From my feeling we’re not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.”Verstappen opened strongly on his first run in Q3, very quick through the opening two sectors and Piastri could not quite match him, just one hundredth of a second down. Norris, however, was on real form, especially in the middle sector but was also just pipped, three-thousandths of a second back in second.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton was knocked out in Q2.Photograph: Mario Renzi/Formula 1/Getty ImagesFor the final runs it was still all to play for as the track rubbered in and Verstappen went out and duly went quicker, Norris could not quite match him in the opening sector and nor could Piastri.Verstappen had provisional pole as Norris went quicker in the middle sector but could not quite pull it off for the final third after he took too much kerb at turn 17. Piastri did not improve, while Antonelli delivered another superb lap to claim third for Mercedes. Verstappen’s time of 1 minute 26.204 seconds was just six-hundredths up on both Norris and Antonelli.The pole may prove key for the race in what remains a very closely fought title fight, where Piastri leads Norris by just nine points with Verstappen in third.Lewis Hamilton’s hopes of a strong qualifying after taking third in the sprint were dashed as he failed to make it to Q3, going out in 12th, his first exit in Q2 since he joined Ferrari this year.Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were sixth and seventh for Williams, Charles Leclerc eighth for Ferrari, Esteban Ocon ninth for Haas and Yuki Tsunoda tenth forRed Bull. Isack Hadjar and Liam Lawson were in 11th and 15th for Racing Bulls, Gabriel Bortoleto in 13th for Sauber and Jack Doohan in 14th for Alpine.Nico Hülkenberg was 16th for Sauber, Fernando Alonso and Lance Stroll were in 17th and 19th for Aston Martin, Pierre Gasly 18th for Alpine and Oliver Bearman 20th for Haas.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMax VerstappenRed BullMotor sportUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

When play resumed Trump took the 29th frame to keep his hopes alive and also won the next with a 116 clearance after Williams missed a red to the middle with his first chance to seal victory.Trump had the chance to pile on the pressure after a superb red to the middle in frame 31, but missed a difficult thin black and Williams grabbed the opportunity in style with a clearance of 123 to seal victory.Williams won his first world title in 2000 – when Zhao was just three years old – and his most recent in 2018, when he famously conducted his winning press conference naked – apart from a towel – to fulfil a promise made earlier in the tournament.“It’s unbelievable. Twelve months ago I wasn’t even here. I watched it in a caravan,” Williams said at the time, having contemplated quitting the sport the previous year after losing in the final round of qualifying.Ronnie O’Sullivan believes Zhao has what it takes to become the first Chinese winner of the world championship, and with it a “megastar”, after the 28-year-old beat the seven-time champion to reach the final. Zhao has had an extraordinary journey to the Crucible showpiece, which gets under way on Sunday and concludes on Monday, with his latest remarkable achievement his victory over O’Sullivan with a session to spare.View image in fullscreenZhao Xintong has reached the final after coming through four qualifying rounds and breezing through the draw at the Crucible.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesHaving fought through four qualifying rounds as he continues his comeback after a 20-month ban for his involvement in a betting scandal, Zhao has since seen off Jak Jones, Lei Peifan, Chris Wakelin and O’Sullivan to become the second player from China to reach the world final after Ding Junhui, wholost to Mark Selbyin the 2016 final.Zhao, who is playing as an amateur in Sheffield, showed his class against O’Sullivan on Friday as he won all eight frames in the morning to open up a 12-4 lead before finishing the job in the evening to knock out his hero. O’Sullivan thinks Zhao, who won the UK Championship in 2021, is capable of going all the way and feels it would be good for the sport if he did get his hands on the trophy.He said: “I think it would be amazing. I think if he did win he would be a megastar. He’s still very big in China as it is. But if he becomes world champion it would just be amazing for snooker and for his life as well. He can definitely get over the line. I think he’ll have more of a test [in the final].

Those who do not think they are corrupt, think they are incompetent. Standards, apparently, have never been lower. Clubs and their fans rage about conspiracies. But even in the present context, the scenes at the end of lastSaturday’s Copa del Rey finalwere unprecedented as Antonio Rüdigerthrew an ice-packat the referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea.And to think this is a club that used to pride itself on its sense of itsseñorio, its gentlemanliness, to the extent that in Steve McManaman’s day players were given a code of conduct; the familiar line used to be whinging about referees was for thecry-babies of Barcelona.But this season alone Real Madrid haveboycotted the Ballon d’Or ceremonyafter it became apparent that Vinícius Júnior would not win, allegeda refereeing conspiracyagainst them and thenrefused to perform pre-match media dutiesbefore the Copa del Rey final while fuelling rumours that they would not turn up for the game.Real Madrid TV had also, as it does with all referees before every game, highlighted past decisions De Burgos Bengoetxea had made against them, reducing him to tears in his pre-match media appearances. In the heat of the moment, players do occasionally lose the run of themselves, even if not quite as shamefully as Rüdiger did. Far more toxic are those destructive acts of pettiness instituted at executive level, not least because they create an environment in which players and fans, conditioned to believe they are being persecuted, are far more likely to react badly.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez.Photograph: Real Madrid TV/EPAAt the heart of it all, the ageing general in his labyrinth, sits Florentino Pérez, who has been Madrid president for all but three years of this century. He has been wildly successful, with seven Champions League titles and a revenue 25% higher than that ofthe next wealthiest club in the worldand yet he is at war with everybody, a 78-year-old watching the world changing around him, insisting it is all fixed against him.It is an ancient theme but this is a very modern story of populism and propaganda, of the failure of traditional journalism and the rise of social media, of hyper-partisanship and self-interested power destroying a culture.It was startling during the Super League fiasco to see how Pérez’s nonsense would be faithfully reported by a complaisant local media, even as the rest of the world saw delusion. But even Marca and AS are not so wholeheartedly supportive any more, with the reliablymadridistaAS editor Alfredo Relaño, writing a column for El País last week in which he criticised Pérez for not pursuing Barcelona harder for having José María Enríquez Negreira, the then vice-president of the referees technical committee, on their payroll between 2003 and 2010.In other times, it is possible to imagine Madrid making more of Barcelona’s shambolic financial situation, the questionable audits and the reluctance of Uefa to take action against them. But Pérez needs Barcelona, because they are the only club left backing his doomed Super League project.Lose Joan Laporta and Pérez would be completely alone. He has messed up another great side: just as the team that had won two Champions Leagues in the early 2000s was undermined by the sale of Claude Makélélé, the preference for celebrity over balance, so the team that won the league and Champions League last season has been undone by the failure to replace Toni Kroos and by the addition of Kylian Mbappé, a third left-sided forward who wants to cut in and struggles to perform defensive duties.That is not the only failure. The renovated Bernabéu may look impressively futuristic, but it cost €1.76bn (£1.51bn). VIP boxes have not been built and concerts cannot be staged there after protests from neighbours; two of the income streams that could have helped pay off the debt have been severely compromised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The refusal to perform media duties before the Copa del Rey final was part of a broader pattern. Rights holders paid to have their studios in the ground and to conduct post-match player interviews, Madrid deny them and yet nothing is done. There is a staggering and highly corrosive lack of responsibility or self-reflection, while Madrid fill the gap with influencers who produce content rather than performing the journalistic duty of holding power to account.Decline on the pitch has been followed by decline off it. There is a temptation to trace this back to José Mourinho’s time at the club. He was not the first manager to inhabit a post-truth world, but he was the first openly to acknowledge that a game begins in the press conference that follows the previous match. But he was a symptom not a cause. One of the reasons Barcelona rejected Mourinho in 2008 and Manchester United rejected him in 2013 was a fear that he did not fit the values of the club. For Madrid, the situation in 2010, with Barcelona rampant and Pep Guardiola reinventing football, was so dire they felt they could not afford such morality. What followed were two years of sulphurous battle that did eventually topple Barça and Guardiola, but at enormous cost.Madrid knew what Mourinho would do; they appointed him with their eyes open. Perhaps his example broke down some barriers and made it easier for the club once again to embrace self-interested petulance, but he was brought in by Pérez because Madrid were losing; he did not infect them. And now Madrid are losing again, Pérez has once again started lashing out at enemies, some real, but most imagined, most useful fictions to explain away the club’s decline.Add in the baleful influence of social media, and the modern tendency for people to pick a side and support them no matter what, and the result is a tribalism so toxic that it renders football effectively ungovernable and potentially, given the absurd pressures on referees, unplayable.One of the reasons the Victorians saw sport as having an educational role was that it taught equanimity in defeat. Not to know how to lose is childish, yet it is a lesson a septuagenarian in Madrid has seemingly still not learned.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridInside footballRefereesCopa del ReycommentShareReuse this content"

Scott Parker, though, was determined to remain positive.“I’m absolutely delighted,” said theBurnleymanager. “The main objective was to get three points and end the season on 100 points. Two defeats all season, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded, that’s all I could ask for .“If you’d said to us at any point that 100 points this year wouldn’t get you the title we’d all be thinking, ‘no chance’.

Now will Starmer change tack?John McDonnellThe local elections showed that voters feel betrayed. But in a party that brooks no dissent, that message isn’t getting throughJohn McDonnell was shadow chancellor for Labour from 2015 to 2020Sat 3 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 06.14 EDTShareThe response from Labour spokespeople so far to theloss of Runcorn and Helsby– and to the election results as a whole – has been especially tin-eared. There doesn’t seem to be any understanding of the deep-seated emotion in the reaction of Labour supporters to the party’s behaviour in government over the past 10 months. There used to be talk of the need for emotional literacy in politics. What we are witnessing is a staggering level of emotional illiteracy.Labour supporters feel deeply that their party has turned its back on them. It’s not just that they feel they are not being listened to. It’s that the Starmer and Reeves government is doing things that they believe noLabourgovernment should ever do.After 14 years of enduring year after year of austerity under the Conservatives, there was such a collective sigh of relief in getting rid of the incompetent, corrupt and brutal Tories. There might not have been much in the way of inspiring politics fromKeir Starmerin the run-up to the election last July, but at least we had a Labour government.The problem now is that, at times, the government is unrecognisable as a Labour government. This isn’t the traditional argument about whether the Starmer administration is behaving like old Labour or New Labour. It’s whether it’s Labour at all in the eyes of people who have supported us or would want to support us.The strategy dictated by Starmer’s office appears to be that, to neutralise Reform, Labour has to position itself as close to Nigel Farage’s party as possible. The argument is that this will give Labour the breathing space of the next few years to deliver the investment and noticeable improvement in our public services that will garner the support needed to win the next election.The plan was that the large-scale investment required to radically improve our public services would come from growth and a limited range of tax redistribution measures. The problems with this strategy became pretty obvious very quickly.If Labour seeks to ape Reform, then voters will largely opt for the real deal and vote Reform, while at the same time Labour will alienate supporters who are aghast at the party adopting Reform-like positioning on immigration.If the growth and investment in the economy are not on the scale needed, then the only other way to secure these resources is through borrowing or redistribution of wealth. Having a fiscal rule that restricts borrowing becomes largely a technical argument, but when books are balanced through cuts in the winter fuel allowance, a national insurance “jobs tax” andcuts to disability benefits, no amount of citing improvements in NHS waiting-list figures can overcome the betrayal Labour supporters feel.The problems with the strategy are so obvious, but the usual mechanisms for communicating signs of discontent are broken. In normal circumstances the feedback from Labour’s membership in the constituencies or from MPs and councillors would flag up an emerging problem.This self-correcting mechanism within the party failed to operate because the centralised control of the party under Starmer has meant that political debate in constituency Labour parties is closed down or ignored and dissent expressed by Labour MPs is met with threats of the withdrawal of the whip. As the large number of newly elected MPs took time to find their feet, it naturally meant that their voices have been relatively quiet.The overall impression now is that the government lacks not just any political strategy but also any sense of purpose. People are also questioning the moral compass of a government that increases poverty among children by keeping the Conservatives’ two-child limit and among pensioners by means-testing the winter fuel allowance, as well as one that puts the welfare of hundreds of thousands of disabled people at risk by cutting their benefits.It’s time for Labour party members and elected representatives to stand up and call for a resetting of Labour’s strategy but also, just as importantly, to reclaim the party for democracy so that we do not cut ourselves off from our supporters like this again. A first, significant step to symbolise that change would be for the Labour leadership to listen to our people and drop the cuts to disability benefits.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

This time they were wrong,” Bolt wrote.The reason for the loss? It was because the Liberal party “refused to fight the ‘culture wars’”.A little over a hour earlier on Sky News Australia, he had recognised it was all over for the Liberal leader that he had dubbed Scary Guy. He was unsentimental about the loss.Peter Dutton was comprehensively beaten by Anthony Albanese, Bolt said, because everyone agreed the prime minister looked like a “nice easy going guy” compared with Dutton.Australia re-elects Anthony Albanese as Labor rides anti-Trump wave to seal crushing winRead moreBut that’s where Bolt’s praise for the Labor leader ended. It was incomprehensible, he said, that a government that “left Australians poorer, more divided, more uncertain”, could have been re-elected.“Well, it did because Anthony Albanese didn’t look threatening,” he said.“If Peter Dutton does lose in Dickson, they’ve got a leadership crisis. Because there is no person one can say ‘that man is a leader, or that woman is a leader’.”By the time Dutton’s gracious concession speech was over at 9.39pm, Sky News was calling the election result a “blood bath” and recriminations were flying between Sky’s commentators and their political guests.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterLike Bolt, the Sky political editor, Andrew Clennell, pinned the loss on the leader. “People don’t like Peter Dutton,” Clennell said matter of factly as he recounted what happened when he went door knocking. “You know, it’s just one of those unfortunate things.”For Chris Uhlmann, a former ABC and Nine political editor who has embraced his conservative side over on Sky News, the Coalition’s primary vote is down to a “horrific” 30% and the party is facing “an existential crisis”.“Where does this party go?” he asked. “This is a party that will tear itself apart while it tries to work out how it articulates itself to appeal to enough people in Australia to be able to form a government in future.”But shadow minister Sarah Henderson was not conceding defeat. “It’s looking pretty challenging,” she said. “There’s no doubt about that … but there is some green shoots. I like to stay positive. And I want to say that in Solomon, in the Northern Territory, there looks like a very strong swing to the Country Liberal Lisa Bayliss.”2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoWhile everyone expressed their surprise at the magnitude of the loss, Clennell suggested the election drubbing was far from a shock to many senior Liberals as Sky producers had struggled to get them on air tonight.“I just want to take you through how big this is,” Clennell said. The pre-polls can come back, but is Albo about to win a landslide?“I don’t think there’s any doubt that Albanese has got an increased majority, not just a majority.”Sky’s election analyst Tom Connell called it not long after 8pm: “This contest is effectively over. Albanese will be prime minister of Australia.”For much of the night Sky After Dark host Sharri Markson, stationed at Coalition headquarters, was hanging on to the pre-poll results as a path to redemption, predicting that when those results came in the gap between the parties in some seats would narrow.But it was also Marksonwho recently predictedthe national opinion polls were inaccurate and the Coalition’s private polling was positive: “the polls you’re reading in the news are wrong when it comes to this federal election”.The Australian PM’s experience showed but a truly terrible Trump-inspired Coalition election campaign helpedRead morePeta Credlin, a former chief of staff to Tony Abbott, said it was disgraceful that Dutton had been “demonised” as he was a decent guy. But she came alive when suggesting her side of politics should fight more culture wars. “I’d argue we didn’t do enough of a culture war,” Credlin said.She went on to suggest the Liberals make a “simple statement” about the rights of biological women, and when she was shouted down by the panel she fired up.“Again, gentlemen, if you would forgive me, but I’m sick of being mansplained about what biological women feel about biological female rights. We do care about it.”Former Labor minister Graham Richardson, who hasn’t lost his talent for the one-liner, said the Liberals have got to ask themselves where do we go now?“We’ve tried Dutton - what else have we got? Well not much because if Angus Taylor is the answer, it’s a stupid question.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian mediaOpinionPeta CredlinCoalitionAustralian election 2025commentShareReuse this content"

And that seems to be the interpretation of electoral results across the industrialised world.From the seismic shifts in recent US and German elections to the rise of Reform and the Green party in the UK, electorates are signalling that they reject the status quo.As the song says: “We all wanna change the world.”And yet, there is an important caveat in the next few lines of the lyrics penned by Lennon and McCartney that are just as important almost 60 years later.“But when you talk about destruction, don’t you know that you can count me out.”As private wealth has accumulated since the 1950s, only the radical few have been prepared to see jobs disappear and their wealth diminished while they wait for the supposed benefits of political and economic upheaval. And no amount of pleading from leaders to wait for the good times will overcome that resistance.For several years now we have witnessed the call for revolution from those who consider themselves insulated from its effects, until that is, the level of destruction they voted for takes a toll on their own finances.That was the case with Brexit, and buyer’s remorse is now widespread.While it takes time for people to react, financial markets have become more sensitive.Over the past month we have seen the custodians of global wealth – fund managers and pension funds – react with almost palpable anger to Donald Trump’s attempts at revolution, just as they did when former prime minister Liz Truss embarked on a borrowing spree to revolutionise the UK’s economy.Andy Haldane, the former chief economist of the Bank of England and outgoing boss of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), says financial markets have become a bulwark against leaders’ excesses.Writing in the Financial Times, he said the interconnectivity of world trade and the costs of tearing up supply chains sparked fears of a return to high inflation, spooking investors.“The excess sensitivity of financial markets [applies] a double-lock. By telescoping and amplifying these costs, they serve as a real-time disciplining device on politicians claiming they can weather the short-term pain. This makes capitulation speedier than in the past.”Last month the US president vented his anger at financial markets,accusing them of undermining his economic project with panic selling.Coining a new term, he said on his Truth Social platform: “Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!).”Haldane is not the only one to say that the loss of more than $6tn from global stock markets by the end of April, which wreaked pain on ordinary savers and undermined consumer confidence, helped halt the tariff scourge.As a senior fellow at the free-market American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Desmond Lachman analyses the subject from a different perspective, butcomes to the same conclusion. He said US consumers will be next to put a block on Trump’s intentions.Despite his feisty rhetoric, Trump understands that he has less room for manoeuvre than he wanted. And his U-turns have had their reward.The stock market recovery this week is built on US officials saying they have approached Xi Jinping for talks over escalating tariffs. That humiliating climbdown comes after Trump’s claims that China had much more to lose from tariffs than the US.A resumption of Washington’s support for Ukraine’s war effort, after a deal to share the badly battered nation’s mineral wealth, has also calmed markets.Lower tariffs between the world’s two largest economies and a reassertion of the old international order, one that maintains Russian aggression breached international law, is good for business.Sensible policies have reasserted themselves and we have the markets to thank for that.Yet, while it might seem like a good outcome for those who gained from the old system, those who consider themselves losers are left with a festering anger.Politically, they might not achieve an electoral majority. Too many middle income households will support the old ways because that is what delivered them housing and pension assets they could only dream of 60 years ago.The poorer half of the income distribution – those who have seen their low incomes flatline for almost two decades – might still have some power, especially if they opt for social unrest.Lennon and McCartney wouldn’t have been surprised. They were writing the White Album while the 1968 student riots raged across Europe.Young people are one of the biggest losers from the 21st century economic lottery. They are voting green in the south and east and reform in the west and north in ever-greater numbers. What will they do when voting gets them nowhere?Explore more on these topicsEconomicsDonald TrumpLiz TrusscommentShareReuse this content"

It was CJFQ 29:4; my old brain has forgotten many things, but that number is deeply engrained. The details of what happened next are confused, until the door at the bottom of the stairs in my billet was slammed closed by my unwilling hosts, and I lay trembling on that settee. As an adult, my first reaction to everything is fear, which I put down to my wartime childhood, along with my ability to survive. After two runaway escapades I was allowed to return to London, preferring bombs to bullying locals.View image in fullscreenSheila Hancock as a child.This month, we are commemorating the 80th anniversary ofVE Day, and I worry that we will turn it into a yet another jingoistic celebration of the second world war. Yes, in 1945 we were relieved that the bombs and doodlebugs and rocket weapons had stopped, and we heard there was fun going on in the West End of London – but where I lived it was less jubilant. The war there felt far from over: we were still waiting anxiously for the return of the young lad next door from the rumoured horror of a Japanese prisoner of war camp, and many of my friends were trying to accept as fathers strange men they barely knew. The unspeakable details of the Holocaustwere being revealed, and I imagine the grownups were utterly exhausted and often grief-stricken. For five years, they had lived under the threat of occupation. Churchill said we wouldfight them on the beachesand never surrender, but he did not deny that we could be invaded. In fact, it was a miracle we were not. And that threat is what the grownups lived with, and presumably, being unequipped, knew they could not withstand.I remember in the early days of the war asking my dad about some concrete blocks that had appeared on the pavement, and some black metal cylinders along the kerb. He explained, somewhat unconvincingly, that the blocks would be dragged into the road to stop the Nazi tanks, and the cylinders would be lit to make a smokescreen that would, together with the barrage balloons filling the skies, impede their planes. Being close to some weapons factories and the docks, our area around Bexleyheath was the scene of many dogfights between Spitfires and Nazi planes. There was even a searchlight and mobile ack-ack gun stationed on the path behind our house. When we were in our garden air raid shelter, the noise of that guncertainly scared the wits out of us, if not the Germans.Because I now deeply fear the dangerous signs of history repeating itself, I want everyone to remember that war is terrible. On VE Day 1945, the world was looking at the complete destruction of many cities, some by us.Tens of millionsof people were dead or homeless. It was hard to wholeheartedly rejoice in May 1945.Sorry to be a spoilsport. I actually hope everyone comes together and has a lovely time on the 80th anniversary. I think I probably quite enjoyed myself in 1945. The kids had a street party tea, with junket and blancmange (whatever happened to them?), with evaporated milk as cream, and a few chocolates. A feast in those strictly rationed days.View image in fullscreenSheila Hancock’s father in his air raid warden uniform.Photograph: SuppliedBut what I most remember is when the tables were removed, and someone brought out a wind-up gramophone and put it on the garden wall. The grownups did some stately ballroom dancing. Holding one another in their arms! Clinging to one another. I even saw my dad kiss my mum on the forehead. Unheard of behaviour. Were they expressing relief at being near the end of an appalling few years? Or were they giving one another strength to face the inevitable struggle to dress the mental and physical wounds of war, and build the better, fairer, more peaceful world they wanted to create?Now, our beautiful planet is under threat in many ways. History shows that the solution is definitely not to be found in autocratic leadership. Let us aim to unite the available worldwide wisdom to tackle the global crises together. Time is running out.This week, the moon reminded me of a wartime child who, along with her contemporaries, will soon be gone, taking our painful memories with us. I look back with some pride at the way that generation of adults survived, drained but determined to make the world a better place. And they did.Please God, don’t let us betray them. We must not forget and we must never let it happen again.Sheila Hancock is an actor and a writerExplore more on these topicsVE DayOpinionSecond world warcommentShareReuse this content"

I’m resolving to put my device away and just dance: I hope others followSat 3 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 15.28 EDTShareI’m making a public vow, which I fear I may abandon the moment Lana Del Rey comes on stage at Wembley in July: to stop recording concerts on my phone. Last Sunday, producer and DJ Kaytranadaresponded to a fan on Xwho was frustrated at motionless concertgoers with their phones in the air, writing: “I think we have come in this age where everybody’s trying to catch a moment for their own social media presence. It shows their appreciation instead of them dancing and enjoying shows like we used to.” Even though I wasn’t at Kaytranada’s show, he had me bang to rights.I have in the past incessantly recorded gigs, insisting to myself that there is no impairment of my enjoyment, or that determinedly rejigging the camera for a panoramic shot of the entire stage was all part of the concert experience. Lost in the spirit of a moment, it can be nice to snap yourself and friends singing along to your favourite artist, and to create a personal archive of a concert’s best bits.But what Kaytranada has really nailed is the fact that often recording concerts to upload footage to social media is meant to betray a kind of cool to your audience and reap the intangible social rewards of being a source of Fomo. Concert recording can be like letting everyone know you’ve been invited to the coolest party – the exclusivity factor baked into the ticket price. Personally, I’m moving on to more subtle and mysterious ways to signal status, like casually dropping the concerts I’m attending in a newspaper.The whole record and upload process has almost been gamified by social media such as TikTok, where clips can go viral and even be picked up by the press. Particularly with large, anticipated tours, there’s almost a race to be the person who captures and releases the best footage of a certain moment, with all the accompanying hopes of fast numbers and engagement. Broke the news of Charli xcx’s fiance George Daniel doing the TikTok Apple dance at her O2 show long before anyone else? Here’syour post embedded in NMEand a thousand new followers; don’t spend it all at once.I was among the first people in the world to see Beyoncé’s Renaissance world tour in Stockholm in 2023 – I uploaded a video of her opening with Dangerously in Love 2 to my former Twitter/X account while she was still mid-song. I got thousands of likes and retweets and people commenting, many pleasantly shocked that she had opened a tour connected to a dance album with an R&B ballad. But what was the point of doing that, really? While I still had fun, I was distracted by my phone during a concert by one of my favourite artists, all for the sake of some ephemeral internet buzz. I haven’t even looked at any of those clips again.View image in fullscreenBeyoncé opens her Renaissance world tour in Stockholm, 10 May 2023.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ParkwoodHow much you get your phone out at a concert is not necessarily inversely correlated with fun, but it can just become a faff and a compulsion. At the end of the night you find yourself with a depleted battery, your camera cluttered with maybe a hundred clips, and a lot of time wasted swiping through each one figuring out which is the best to use to show off on social media. I also had a ticket to Beyoncé’s London show where I felt no need to record the same performance twice and had possibly the best concert experience of my life. But we can’t always attend every tour twice – with today’s prices, it’s a money pit just going once.I suppose, though, that there are those who are performing a kind of public service. Beyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter tour in California this week, and,as with other major concerts, there were several livestreams across Instagram and TikTok from people who have committed to capturing the show from open to close for those fans who can’t attend due to location or expense. There are problems with this; some people complain of “concert spoilers” filling their timelines (though I personally don’t think aconcert can be“spoiled”), and I’m not especially clear at what point it becomes piracy. But with the decline of tour DVDs and uncertainty over whether you’ll ever set your eyes on an iconic stage design beyond press stills again, I can see why recording still feels necessary for posterity.But it doesn’t have to be you. Rest safe in the knowledge that the most dedicated fans, probably with tickets for multiple nights, will shoot and upload the best angles and most surprising moments for you to scroll past later. Maybe limit yourself to one or two clips for theInstagramstory, then lock your phone away, wave your hands in the air and “move them hips”, as Kaytranada says.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsMusicOpinionSocial mediaSmartphonesTikTokInstagramXLana Del ReycommentShareReuse this content"

Conspiracy theorists immediately started circling. A tweet from 2019, in which Giuffre said she wasn’t suicidal, was dredged up. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldestfailson, then amplified the theory to his millions of followers,adding that“other than the Clinton’s [sic] no one has more suiciding going on”.Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who seems to wield ahuge amount of influencein the Trump administration, also started insinuating online that Giuffre had been silenced by dark forces. “We are never getting the Epstein list, are we?”Loomer tweeted.Various other people amplifying this conspiracy theory have noted that Giuffre isn’t the first Epstein survivor to have died in recent years. In 2023, Carolyn Andriano, who had accused Epstein of abusing her when she was 14 and who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell in her trial, was found dead of an accidental overdose in aFlorida hotel room. Andriano testified in 2021 that she had been addicted to “pain pills and cocaine” and taken them “to block out” Epstein’s sexual abuse. Another of Epstein’s victims, Leigh Patrick, alsoreportedly diedof a heroin overdose in Florida in 2017.The fact that three Epstein survivors have died by drug overdose or suicide is enraging and tragic, but it is not a conspiracy. I have a suggestion for the likes of Donald Jr and Loomer: instead of searching for secret plots, why not grapple with some very clear facts? The first being that childhood sexual abuse is associatedwith a wide rangeof physical and mental health conditions, includingsubstance abuse. In a statement praising Giuffre’s courage, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (Rainn)warned that victimsof abuse are “significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long term effects of trauma”.The “conspiracy” that Donald Jr and Loomer are searching so hard to find isn’t hidden, it’s staring them right in the face. Far too often, when a woman accuses a powerful man of abuse she will have her life destroyed, while the man walks away. Society is set up to protect powerful predators and their enablers: misogyny is woven into the fabric of all our institutions. Look at the supreme court, where two of the six men servinghave faced sexual misconduct associations. Anita Hill had herreputation destroyedafter accusing Clarence Thomas, then a supreme court nominee, of sexually harassing her. Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, was forced to flee herhouse to protect her safety. (Both justices deny the allegations.)And, of course, look at the White House. Trump waslegally brandeda sexual predator in 2023 and it didn’t stop him from becoming president again.Look too at all the years that Epstein evaded justice; all the years he rubbed shoulders with some of the most powerful people in the world who didn’t seem to care about his predilection for young girls. Which, by the way, hardly seemed to be a secret. Trump joked about Epstein liking women on the “younger side” back in 2002. Florida prosecutors also reportedly knew that Epstein assaulted young girlsyearsbefore he cut a very lenient deal with them in 2008. In that dealhe pleaded guiltyto state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. The financier had to register as a sex offender and serve a 13-months sentence, but was allowed tospend most of his dayin his office.I can understand why conspiracy theorists are so obsessed with Epstein. After all, the man operated a vast sex trafficking ring with the help of anenormous numberof powerful people. And yet, five years after the sex offender’s death, the only person to have faced any real consequences is Ghislaine Maxwell, who is in alow-security federal prison. Some high-profile men have been embarrassed, sure, but nobody except Maxwell is in prison. It’s not a conspiracy that’s to blame for this: it’s society’s attitudes toward women.Logan Paul has daughter, realizes that women are human tooThe influencer, boxer, and YouTube personality – who has tens of millions of followers – recently spoke out about how his “mind went to some dark places” when he found out his wife was pregnant with a girl. “I don’t want to come across like a woke asshole, but like, dude, women have it hard,”Paul said on his reality show. “Women have it fucking hard. And I empathize with them.”Jill Sobule dies in a house fire age 66Themusician’s 1995 singleI Kissed a Girl is considered the first openly LGBTQ-themed song to crack the Billboard top 20 singles chart.Breast cancer is becoming less deadly for younger women in the USFrom 2010 to 2020, the number ofbreast cancer deathsamong women ages 20-49 dropped significantly, researchers have reported.Breast cancer mortality fell across racial and ethnic groups, but in both 2010 and 2020, non-Hispanic Black women had the highest rate.Why are more than 90% of pilots still men?“Despite more than a decade of initiatives designed to increase the number of women flying planes, just 6.5% of pilots working for UK companies are women,”Amelia Gentleman reports. “There is something stubbornly retro about gender roles in this industry. Female doctors began tooutnumber their male peersin the UK for the first time this year, but preconceptions about what an airline pilot should look and sound like have not shifted.”Texas senate approves legislation to clarify exceptions to extreme abortion banThe new legislation, Senate Bill 31, aims to prevent maternal deaths under the state’s strict abortion ban – and serves as an acknowledgment that women were being denied lifesaving care because of confusion about the limits of the abortion ban. While it’s a step forward, don’t get too excited.ProPublica notes: “The bill stops short of removing what doctors say are the ban’s biggest impediments to care, including its major criminal penalties, and doesn’t expand abortion access to cases of fetal anomalies, rape or incest.” The Texas senate has also just passed perhaps the broadest crackdown onabortion-inducing drugs in the country.Judge in Finland dismisses charges against three men accused of raping a 17-year-old girl outside a hospitalThe girl was taken to Malmi Hospital by an ambulance due to her severe intoxication, the Finnish newspaperHelsingin Sanomatreports. Three men, two of whom were in their 30s, then took the 17-year-old out of the hospital and had violent intercourse with her, which they filmed. The Helsinki district court has held that the girl – who, again, had been brought to hospital because of intoxication, consented to all this and dismissed the charges against the men.Cory Booker can speak non-stop for 25 hours, but has no comment about genocideThe New Jersey senator was heaped with praise by liberals for speaking for 25 hours on the Senate floor last month. “This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said during his speech. “Where do you stand?” Stirring words, indeed. But Booker was awfully quiet this week after Shabtai, the Yale-based society he co-founded, invitedthe Israeli extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir– a man convicted of terrorism–to give a speech. Booker also took a smilingphoto in his office with Yoav Gallant, wanted by the ICC for war crimes, in his office last year. Booker is absolutely right that this is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment. You are either forgenocide, or you are against it. You are either for starving children and murderingjournalists, or you are against it. Booker has made very clear where he stands. If Booker is the “resistance”, we are all in trouble.The week in pawtriarchyThe world’s smallest dog (Pearl, chihuahua, 3.59 inches) and the world’s tallest dog (Reggie, Great Dane, 3ft 3in) recentlygot togetherfor a playdate, and it was ascute as it sounds.

The dismissal of nearly 400 contributors had left the future of the study in question; it had been scheduled for publication in 2028.The NCA had been overseen by the Nasa-supported Global Change Research Program – a key US climate body which the Trump administration alsodismissedlast month. The reports, which have been published since 2000, coordinated input from 14 federal agencies and hundreds of external scientists.In its announcement on Friday, the two societies said: “This effort aims to sustain the momentum of the sixth National Climate Assessment (NCA), the authors and staff of which were dismissed earlier this week by theTrump administration, almost a year into the process.”According to the AMS and AGU, the collection will not replace the NCA but instead create a mechanism for important work on climate change’s impact to continue.“It’s incumbent on us to ensure our communities, our neighbors, our children are all protected and prepared for the mounting risks of climate change,” AGU resident Brandon Jones said.“This collaboration provides a critical pathway for a wide range of researchers to come together and provide the science needed to support the global enterprise pursuing solutions to climate change,” he added.Similarly, the AMS president, David Stensrud, said: “Our economy, our health, our society are all climate-dependent. While we cannot replace the NCA, we at AMS see it as vital to support and help expand this collaborative scientific effort for the benefit of the US public and the world at large.”Speaking to the Associated Press, Katharine Hayhoe, a Texas Tech University climate professor and chief scientist at The Nature Conservancy said the latest collaboration between AMS and AGU is “is a testament to how important it is that the latest science be summarized and available”.Hayhoe, who was a lead author of reports in 2009, 2018 and an author of the one in 2023, added: “People are not aware of how climate change is impacting the decisions that they are making today, whether it’s the size of the storm sewer pipes they’re installing, whether it is the expansion of the flood zone where people are building, whether it is the increases in extreme heat.”In addition to widespread dismissals across federal agencies, federal websites have been purged ofinformation pertaining to climate changeand extreme weather events since Trump took office in January.Explore more on these topicsUS newsClimate crisisTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

A prison, K-shaped with long corridors made of sure, thick walls, and small windows in cold, solitary cells.The design of Pentonville was heralded by the fashionable print media of the day.The new prison will be most conducive to the reformation of prisoners and to the repression of crime … It resolves itself into a greater uniformity of plan and purpose than has yet been exhibited in prison architecture.The Illustrated London Newsin its coverage of the new facility on August 13, 1842.It became a blueprint on which 90 others were built in the next 35 years: the beginning of England’s Victorian prison estate.But while most of the industrial mainstays of 19th-century design have since faded into sepia-tinted vestiges of Victoriana, prisons like Pentonville are far from redundant – in fact they have never been busier.Today, Britain is the most incarcerated country in western Europe. Incredibly, 31 of the jails still in operation in England and Wales were built by the Victorians. They house about 22,000 prisoners, a quarter of the prison population.Inside, their damp, crowded, poorly ventilated cells have become a symbol of the prison system in this country. And the system is in crisis. Violent disorder, phones, drugs and drone smuggling are all urgent issues on HMP’s agenda.In this investigation we explore how centuries-old design is failing those who suffer at the hands of this very modern crisis.The Victorian prison cellA 19th-century solution to a 21st-century problemThe piers or partitions between them are 18 inches thick, and are worked with close joints, so as to preclude as much as possible the transmission of sound.A description of HMP Pentonville in the Illustrated London News, 1843Victorian prisons weredesignedto reform inmates through silent, solitary contemplation incells which were arranged to keep them isolated. Cells were built to house one prisoner, alone.View image in fullscreenInterior of cell, 1842. Illustrated London News, artist unknown.Illustration: Guardian DesignBut as the prison population in England and Wales has ballooned over the centuries, the days when all prisoners were allocated their own individual cell have faded into memory. While the Victorians built or extended 90 prisons to accommodate about 20,000 people, currently there are 122 prisons in total for a population of more than 80,000.Chart showing how the prison population has changed from 1900 to 2024In these conditions prisoners share confined spaces. In 17 out of 31 Victorian prisons in use, more than half of inmates are held in crowded accommodation – defined as two people sharing a cell that is meant to be for one person only.In some jails, like Durham, Usk, Wandsworth and Swansea, it is more than 75% of the prison population.Chart showing prisons where more than half of prisoners share a cellHow much space should a prisoner have? The answer is not easy to find. The Prison Service instructions and frameworks provide no minimum measurements for cells, but theEU’s Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT)recommends that a multi-occupancy cell should provide at least 4 sq metres of living space per prisoner, not including a sanitary facility.The HM Prisons Inspectorate calculates that, as a sanitary facility is about 1-2 sq metres, the cell should offer 4.5 sq metres per person. In 2017, they found that the majority of cells they inspected that year did not meet this standard.Small shared cells are more frequently found in Victorian prisons. In a shared cell measured at HMP Brixton each prisoner had 3.36 sq metres of space – about the size of a small elevator.A cell comparison diagram illustrating EU standards against some measurements of Victorian prisonsCramming prisoners in cells means being creative with the use of space. Guidance for arranging furniture in single cells that need to house more than one prisoner shows how a typical Victorian-built single cell might be arranged when shared by two people. This diagram from the 2012 Prison Service instruction shows stacked beds placed across from small wardrobes with a screen dividing the sleeping area and the toilet.Reproduction of a 2012 diagram showing of how a typical Victorian-built cell might be arranged when shared by two people, showing the arrangement of furnitureThe Ministry of Justice said this diagram was no longer applicable as the 2012 PSI was superseded by a2022 accommodation framework. This new framework does not provide minimum measurement requirements for cells, however.What are the effects of overcrowding?HM Inspectorate of Prisons found in surveys conducted in 2017 that while some prisoners had positive experiences of cell-sharing, for others it caused stress.One of the inmates quoted in the the report said: “Being forced to share a single cell with strangers, whilst also having to use broken, uncurtained toilets; eat one’s meals in this environment; and sometimes being locked up for over 20 hours a day is not respectful or humane.”Architect Roland Karthaus, author of astudy on prison designthat won a Riba award in 2018, said lack of personal space in overcrowded single cells was particularly damaging because it was persistent.He said: “If you’re standing in a tube carriage and your personal space shrinks to accommodate, that is stressful. But you can cope quite happily with being stressed for a short period of time on the tube. If you are in an environment – with severely limited personal space – for the majority of the day, every single day, you have no relief from it, and the cumulative effect is really damaging.”At least two Dutch studieshave found that prisoners housed in double rooms experienced more distant and less frequent staff-prisoner interactions, as well as less perceived privacy, more health problems and more prisoner misconduct.A US studyfound that single-cell inmates exhibited lower levels of the hormones related to the “flight or flight” response than those who shared a dormitory.View image in fullscreenThe interior of a cell with double occupancy in HMP Wandsworth.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverKarthaus suggests that these kinds of conditions can inhibit the prospect of rehabilitation.He said: “The prevalence of physical ill health, drug and substance abuse in people coming into prison is higher than average in the population. So you’re taking unwell people, and you’re putting them in an environment that makes them more unwell – and then your aim is that they will enter society in an improved way.“The environment that essentially contributes to people’s poor health is working against that.”Distance from community‘The best hope of leading a good and useful life on release is someone to love you, somewhere to live and something to do’Victorian prisons were originally built in the outskirts of towns and cities. But as cities grew, they absorbed them. So currently, 70% of the Victorian prisons currently in operation are within the boundaries of major towns and cities.A map showing the location of prisons, and the expansion of urban areas since 1900This means the average immediate surroundings of Victorian prisons are 3.5 times more populated than non-Victorian prisons.As these prisons have become enclosed in cities, they are difficult to expand, which restricts the opportunity to provide better green spaces and outdoor facilities. Their proximity to urban centres also facilitates the importation of drugs, knives and potentially firearms into prisons via drones, through the bars.Nevertheless, the picture is nuanced as newer facilities built further away from community and families have their own limitations when it comes to rehabilitation.A map showing modern prison locations versus Victorian prisonsA prison review conducted by Lord Farmer looked into the importance of prisoners’ family ties to prevent reoffending and reduce intergenerational crime in 2017. It recommended that prisoners should be held in community prisons as near to their homes as possible, citing aMinistry of Justice reportthat found that the odds of reoffending were 39% higher for prisoners who had not received visits compared with those who had.It said: “The closure of some of the old Victorian jails creates significant scope for change in this area, but has the major downside of removing prisoners further from their communities and making it harder for families to visit.”Frances Crook, former CEO of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said proximity to community was vital for rehabilitation. She said: “[Victorian prisons] are close to people’s families, to local services including housing and health, and can be supported by voluntary organisations. They also feel local to the men detained in them.“They are all going to be released sooner or later and as we all know, the best hope of leading a good and useful life on release is someone to love you, somewhere to live and something to do. All this is more achievable if people reside in prisons local to their city homes.”Most Victorian prisons are category B or local, so they are the first option for people sentenced or on remand who have been taken directly from court in their local area. This means many people spend their first night in incarceration in a Victorian prison. Some academics make the case for turning local prisons into open ones, known as category D jails.Prof Dominique Moran, whohas extensively studied Victorian prisonsand has presented her findings to aparliamentary committee, said: “Our open prisons tend to be in out-of-town locations – rural locations – where there’s not a ready supply of things that incarcerated people working towards reintegration can do.“Arguably, there would be all sorts of advantages in having open prisons closer to urban areas. And if you have people in open prisons, by definition, they’re not in their cell all day long. So they would only be coming to these cells to sleep, and that would be minimising the amount of time that they spend in them.”Moran also said the nearness to urban centres made staff easier to recruit and retain than in isolated places.Sight lines and feelings of safetyThe legacy of the panopticonIt will be observed that the Wings or Divisions containing the Cells being connected with the centre, the whole interior of the prison and the door of every cell are seen from one central point. The stairs … do not impede a clear view being obtained … and every movement within the prison, whether of an officer or a prisoner, is therefore under constant observation and control.From theReport of the Surveyor-General of Prisons on the construction, ventilation, and details of Pentonville Prison, 1844The typical K-shaped Victorian prison had wings of small, single cells arranged along landings three or more storeys high, around a central hub from where one single prison officer had clear sight of all the prisoners.You can explore this type of space from the inside with the following 360 view of HMP Reading, which closed in 2014.360° panoramaThe K-block may be a feature of Victorian design, but its appeal among both prisoners and staff seems to remain. One study linked the long galleries and good sight lines to feelings of safety.Moran said: “Not everybody has exactly the same opinion, but a lot of staff talk about the safety that comes from good visibility, and that they get very attuned to the acoustics of that building – they can hear one another talking or shouting or whatever is going off, which means that staff feel confident operating that space.“That translates into incarcerated people also feeling that the staff can see what’s going on and feeling more confident in that environment.”Her study also found that “in Victorian-era prisons, staff were more likely to be out on the landings interacting with incarcerated people, with the result that they knew them better and were better able to support rehabilitation”.However, the philosophy of the Victorian model once again rubs up against the realities of the modern day estate when it comes to maintenance and accessibility. Narrow landings, steep staircases, and the difficulty of installing lifts are problematic for an ageing prisoner population, meaning they have fewer opportunities to leave their wing.The number of people in prison aged 50 or over has nearly trebled, rising from about 5,000 in 2003 toabout 15,000 in 2024.Chart showing the change in prison population in England and Wales by age. The population aged over 50 has grown by 224%Despite its Victorian focus on surveillance, the K-block design has endured. The distinctive blueprint is still used for modern prisons such as HMP Berwyn in Wales, the second largest prison in the UK, which was built in 2017.View image in fullscreenAerial view of HMP Berwyn in Wrexham, North Wales.Photograph: David Goddard/Getty Images“Even in our very newest facilities, we have built Victorian hub-spoke, galleried prisons, just like those built for the separate system, but now in concrete, and with integrated plumbing and wiring”, saysa study on prison design by Karthaus.Temperature and sound stressNineteenth-century prisons can be ‘incredibly noisy and distressing’ for autistic peopleSo admirably is the ventilation of the building contrived and kept up, that there is not the least sense of closeness pervading it, for we feel, immediately we set foot in the place, how fresh and pure is the atmosphere in there.From a description of Pentonville Prison inThe Great World of London by Henry Mayhew,1865Victorian prisons have been altered in many ways throughout the years: sanitation facilities and electricity have been installed, wings have been extended, wire netting has been extended over galleries to prevent suicide, and more recently, anti-drone nets have been installed to stop drug deliveries.But retrofitting modern heating and ventilation standards into 19th-century buildings is difficult, and as a result, prisoners can be subject to uncomfortable temperatures and sound stress, which, like other stressors within the environment, affect wellbeing and can have implications for rehabilitation.Composite image showing different additions made to prisonsFor the Victorians, suppressing all communication between prisoners was vital. Soundproofing was considered essential and walls were made to be 18 inches or “two bricks and half” thick.These thick walls take time to warm up in the winter, and in the summer, they retain and radiate heat. A 2017 report on living conditions from HMIP found that in some Victorian prisons “windows could not be opened properly and cells were poorly ventilated. In summertime, some prisoners reported that they break windows that cannot be opened in order to provide ventilation”.The Victorians had built a ventilation system featuring stoves in the basement that supplied warm air through iron vents in the cell floors, and the foul air was carried off through vents above the cell doors. But according to aHoward League for Penal Reform report into Victorian prisons, alterations and fire safety regulations have meant that many cell vents have been blocked.While the impact of poor temperature regulation has not been studied in prisons, studies of office environments identify thermal comfort as“one of the leading factors impacting general satisfaction with indoor environments.”Apart from the physiological responses, “extreme temperatures have been found to impact our affinity for those around us, and have even been linked to behavioural outcomes such as aggression”.Karthaus’sstudy on prison designstates that “there is some evidence to suggest that people are more likely to help others under more optimal temperature conditions (relative to season). The relationship between temperature, emotional state, and pro- or antisocial behaviour is a complex one, but there is strong overarching evidence for the wellbeing benefits of thermal comfort.”View image in fullscreenThe window of a cell at HMP Norwich.Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesKarthaus has also pointed to the use of hard materials with poor acoustic absorption as another factor which can cause prisoner discomfort.The lack of sound absorption in an environment where shouts and bangs persistently ring out means even indistinct noises echo over time, creating a maddening echo chamber of muffled sound. It can even encourage prisoners to be louder.Karthaus said: “When you have very high reverberation time in a space, it means that nobody can hear what anyone is saying, so everyone is shouting all of the time. If you’re in an environment that is continuously noisy all of the time, and you cannot escape from the noise, that is deeply damaging.”Diagram depicting how sound reverberates on hard surfacesCharlie Taylor, the chief inspector of prisons,said that in particular, 19th-century jails could be “incredibly noisy and distressing” for many prisoners who demonstrate symptoms of autism.He said: “Lots of prisoners have got autistic spectrum disorder and therefore you know that that incredible racket that you get in those prisons is really unconducive to any sort of rehabilitative work.”What now for our 19th-century prisons?Ministers despair at the state of the prison estate across England and Wales, and the crumbling Victorian jails that still house more than a quarter of inmates.After July’s general election, evidence of neglect and dilapidation was everywhere and has been backed by reports from Taylor, the prisons watchdog. He uncovered examples of rat and pigeon infestations, damp and mould. Walls at HMP Winchester were so wet that prisoners could remove their own cell doors or dig through with plastic cutlery.But in the short to medium term, Victorian prisons must be kept open, officials have said. Why? Because current projections show that the prison population is predicted to reach 100,000 by 2029.There is no way that the speed of Ministry of Justice’s building programme will mean that any of the 19th-century prisons could be closed by 2029.Instead, the governmenthas committedto refurbishing the Victorian estate, which officials claim will “bring around 1,000 cells into the 21st century”.By the end of this year, it also expects to bring back online about 350 places in Victorian prisons that are out of use. New prisons are being built while new blocks are being added to existing prisons. The government has set itself a target of building 14,000 more prison places by 2031.In March, the category C jail HMP Millsike was opened in East Yorkshire for 1,500 inmates.Unlike Victorian prisons, it includes workshops and training facilities aimed at getting offenders into work on release and reinforced barless windows to deter drone activity, hundreds of CCTV cameras and X-ray body scanners.Another 700 places are being built at HMP Highpoint near Haverhill, Suffolk, which will make it the largest prison in the UK.At the same time, a review of sentencing by former Tory justice secretary David Gauke is expected to recommend in late spring including scrapping shorter sentences and treating more offenders in the community alternatives to jail.And so Victorian prisons will remain in use for many years along with their associated problems.Additional creditsHeader video:Getty Images/British Film InstitutePrisoners looking out a window in a cell:Peter Macdiarmid/Getty ImagesAerial photo of HMP Cardiff:David Goddard/Getty Images360 degree view photo:Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesRow of barred windows at HMP Wandsworth:Andrew Aitchison/Corbis/Getty ImagesNote: While there are officially 32 Victorian prisons in use, HMP Dartmoor iscurrently closed."

She said the procedure was going to be done using keyhole surgery, and that she had undergone scans earlier, and told fans she would be “totally fine”.Kelly said in the post: “I just wanted to let you know I’m having a wee procedure today.“I’ve not been feeling all that well for a little while, so I had some scans and tests, and I have to have my ovaries and my tubes taken out.”In the post, the presenter said she felt “very lucky to be treated so well” and thanked gynaecologist Dr Ahmed Raafat and hospital staff for their care.According to the NHS, keyhole surgery is a type of procedure in which small cuts are made to diagnose and treat conditions. It is recommended as the recovery time is generally faster than other types of surgery, lasting six to eight weeks.Kelly has since received messages of support from celebrity friends such as TV presenter Julia Bradbury and Loose Women star Katie Piper, who wished her a “speedy recovery”.Good Morning Britain presenter Susanna Reid added: “Sending you all the love in the world.”Kelly celebrated her 40th year in television in 2024, with a special episode of her daytime chat show Lorraine, which she has featured on since 2010.She began her journalism career on the East Kilbride News after turning down a university place to study English and Russian. She then joined BBC Scotland as a researcher in 1983.In 1984, Kelly started in television as an on-screen reporter covering Scottish news and in 1990 she began her presenting career on Good Morning Britain, before getting her own show.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioHealthTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

There have been critics too within Britain’s Muslim community, who, according to the Tell Mama leadership, were intolerant of the organisation’s tolerance.“Throughout the 13 years, people have been kind of making up what Tell Mama does,” said Iman Atta, who has been the organisation’s director since 2016. “They claim that we’re Zionists because we work with Jewish communities, or we’re promoting pedophilia because we work with LGBT groups,” she added.Most recently, questions have been raised about how the organisation spent public money, collated its data, and whether it had become too close to the previous Conservative government, which signed off on its funding.This latest challenge has been existential.On 1 April, Atta wrote to Wajid Khan, the new Labour minister for faith, to reject a further six months of funding from the government, citing a strained relationship with his department and the stress caused to staff by “malicious campaigns” some of which “emanated from individuals and organisations” chasing the funding that Tell Mama has enjoyed.View image in fullscreenIman Atta: ‘You’re getting smeared for actually doing your work.’Photograph: Martin Godwin/The GuardianIt means that, at a time of soaring bigotry, there is now no government-funded group carrying out anti-Muslim hate monitoring in the UK and this is expected to be the case into the summer.Atta said Tell Mama would continue to do its work and look for funds from elsewhere but it fully expects to pare back its services.There will be critics of Tell Mama who are celebrating the outcome.Those might include Shaista Gohir, a cross-bencher in the Lords and chief executive of the Muslim Women’s Network, who has criticised the quality of the organisation’s data and attacked Atta’s “inflation busting” salary rise in 2024, up to £93,000 from £77,000 the year before.Lady Gohir was also behind a 10-page letter to the ministry raising such questions as why Tell Mama was run as a community interest company (CIC) rather than a charity.She wanted to know why it did not publish full accounts on Companies House and asked whether the co-founder of Tell Mama Fiyaz Mughal, who is Atta’s former husband, had received any referrals from the organisation. He is now a counsellor.Sayeeda Warsi, a former Conservative party chair, who as a minister played a role in establishing the Tell Mama model, may also be satisfied.Last year, she followed Gohir to speak in a Lords debate of her “deep concerns” about Tell Mama’s “finances, governance, associations and connections, including with the now-defunct Quilliam Foundation – which has associations with thinktanks in the United States that are peddling anti-Muslim hatred and Islamophobia”.For her part, Atta said she found it all difficult to understand. A Palestinian who moved to the UK in 2008, she had been travelling back and forth to Jerusalem to see her mother, who died last in August from complications relating to dementia.She saw the rockets overhead and then would come home to critics asking why she was silent over the Palestinian cause. The atmosphere, she says, has been toxic.But she is fierce in her defence of Tell Mama’s record and points to a range of public sources that appear to justify her position.The government had never criticised the level of detail in Tell Mama’s data. Reports were published online. The police had spoken of it as being invaluable, and her salary had gone up due to the huge rise in work load in the wake of 7 October attacks. “I don’t have weekends,” she said.Faith Matters, the CIC that runs Tell Mama, was set up more than a decade ago that way so that it could work in a range of social justice areas and not be restricted to one charitable cause. The ministry had full sight of their finances.Atta is particularly indignant about the suggestion Mughal, benefited from counselling referrals. “We wouldn’t, that’s a conflict of interest,” she said.As to the alleged, connection to the Quilliam Foundation there was one appearance in 2013 by Tell Mama’s founder at one of its events where he was invited to promote the anti-hatred reporting service. “And that’s it,” she said.A spokesperson for the ministry of housing, local government and communities said they were still keen for Tell Mama to continue.“We offered Tell MAMA £500,000 to continue supporting its expert work in this space for the first half of this financial year, which was declined”, she said. “We are grateful for their work since 2012 and welcome an application again to look at new proposals.”The defence is robust, the government adamant in its support, so why the war of words among high-profile figures who appear to share the same mission of fostering better engagement with British Muslim communities?It was, in Atta’s view in some instances, a “smear campaign”, perhaps motivated by a desire by some for the £1m-a-year funding agreed by the last Conservative government.Her detractors deny this. “I think that’s probably me [Atta is referring to],” says Gohir, “At the end of the day, this has got nothing to do with funding. I mean, of course, now there’s an open bid Muslim Women’s Network will apply, because we run a helpline already. We already get hate crime calls and discrimination calls, so why not? But that’s not why I did this.“We contacted them, we weren’t getting the data, so we were then finding our own data by doing FoIs to police forces, you know, and then when I was writing to government, I wasn’t getting my questions being answered. And it’s my right as a taxpayer, as a Muslim taxpayer.”Whatever the rights of the wrongs of the criticisms, and Gohir said her question about referrals to Atta’s former husband had been a hunch rather than based on any knowledge, it was not this alone that brought Tell Mama to the decision to pull away.What appears to have made the situation untenable was what has all the hallmarks of a classic Whitehall bungle. The last government had agreed in March last year to provide Tell Mama with a further year’s grant funding.The money is usually paid in arrears in instalments every three months on receipt of invoices and evidence of work. But it needs a grant funding agreement to be signed. Due to last year’s general election, no such agreement emerged from the government in the early months of this financial year.Nothing then emerged through the summer but Tell Mama continued to do its work, without being paid, not least because of the riots after the Southport stabbings. Then on 23 September, Atta received a letter from the ministry saying that a grant agreement had been prepared but the new government wanted to put the contract out to competitive tender for 25/26.It wasn’t welcome news after working with the government for 11 years. But it was not necessarily the end. In December, a grant funding agreement was produced. It contained an “exit plan” in the event that Tell Mama did not win the competitive tender.The government was proposing that Tell Mama be prepared to transfer over their software, hardware and key employees to whatever body took over the function, she said.A “handover”, said Atta. “I was shocked.”A government spokesperson said this was a misinterpretation. But at a meeting on 23 December, Atta told the officials that the terms were unacceptable, the demands were eventually removed and an apology offered, she said. But as Atta was ready to sign in March, Gohir again raised her concerns in the Lords.Lord Khan put out a statement giving Tell Mama a clean bill of health and praising its work and a six-month grant extension was offered. Atta signed the agreement to allow Tell Mama to be paid for the service over the last year. But she said the alleged “smearing” of her organisation felt relentless. It felt like she was going through a personal “trauma”, Atta added.It was a relief, she said, to finally tell the minister, who had personally been helpful, that they were declining the offer of further funding and would not be applying for the contract.“I had team members coming up like: we’re just really tired,” she said. “Because you’re getting things on the online world, you’re getting the threats, you’re getting the far right, you’re getting the Islamist extremists, and then you’re getting smeared for actually doing your work.”Explore more on these topicsIslamophobiaIslamHate crimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Sixty minutes later he was back, and over the next hour or so he and his mate took turns sharing the fish he had caught and sitting on their three eggs.The appearance of thesetwo ospreys on farmland in the Usk valley in mid-Walesis seen as a milestone in the recovery of the species.It is believed to be the first time a pair has nested and produced eggs in these parts for more than 200 years, and the site is thought to be the farthest south in the UK for a pair that has not been deliberately reintroduced.“It’s lovely to see them, isn’t it?” said Louise Milne, one of the team of 60 volunteers keeping an eye on the ospreys. “They are a wonder of the world.”Milne said ospreys usually pair for life, and once a nest has been established it may be used for decades. At the end of the summer the adults – and chicks, if they thrive – will fly separately from the UK to winter in west Africa. The chicks have an innate knowledge of where to go.“To think of them flying thousands of miles, dealing with the cross winds, being blown out into the Bay of Biscay, vying for space on the beaches and lagoons in west Africa – it’s not surprising you get attached to them and try to protect them while they’re here,” said Milne.This corner of Powys turns out to be an excellent spot for ospreys. As well the fish in the Talybont reservoir, there are brown trout in the River Usk and bream in Llyn Syfaddan (Llangorse Lake).The female and male ospreys take turns to eat food and sit on their three eggs.Photograph: Usk Valley OspreysOn the morning the Guardian visited, the male osprey was seen heading towards the reservoir. He returned with a still-wriggling fish, showed it to his mate on the nest then took it over to a favourite perch nearby to eat his share. “It’s like when the oxygen masks come down in a plane,” said Milne. “You help yourself before helping others.” If the eggs hatch, the male will soon have three more mouths to feed. “He’ll have to up his hunting skills,” said Milne.Later he had a turn sitting on the eggs while the female took the fish to a perch for her turn.After being persecuted in the UK to the brink of extinction, a pair of ospreys naturally recolonised Scotland by successfully nesting at Loch Garten in 1954. There are now thought to be about 300 pairs in Scotland.Ospreys began recolonising northWales20 years ago. Over the past decade, the number of sightings of them farther south in Wales has increased.Young ospreys began to identify the Usk valley as a potential breeding site because of its excellent fishing sites, and in 2023 a nest was spotted at the top of an oak tree near the village of Talybont-on-Usk – but no eggs. In 2024, two ospreys were again seen at the nest but did not breed, possibly because they had arrived late or were not the right age.This spring, the same two ospreys spotted in 2024 were back, and went on to produce the three eggs.Their comings and goings are watched carefully by theUsk Valley Ospreys charity,which has been preparing for this happy moment by setting up a webcam trained on the nest, recruiting teams of “watchers” to keep an eye from a canal towpath 400 metres away, and getting an exclusion zone set up around the site to stop people getting too close.RSPB Cymru said it believed the Usk ospreys were the most southerly breeding pair. There arebreeding ospreys at Poole Harbour in England, but the birds there were translocated from Scotland.Andy King, the chair of Usk Valley Ospreys, was wary of getting too excited as it would be weeks before any chicks hatched. “It’s best to be a bit cautious,” he said.But he added that it was good news the birds were there – and showed that the rivers, reservoir and lake had good fish stocks.“They’ve seen the lovely oxbows and the sweeping nature of a very natural course of the river. They’ve been attracted by that. That’s why they’re here in this quiet valley. And people are delighted to see them.”Explore more on these topicsBirdsWalesWildlifeRiversAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Fans watching professional rugby matches, for example, can generally consume alcohol while sitting in the stands.“Its been 40 years since alcohol was banned in view of the pitch,” Charters said.“Perhaps it is time for a modern approach to a modern game. The days of hooliganism are gone. Fans of other sports can drink in the stands but football fans cannot.”Charters said limited trials of drinking zones in view of the pitch should be looked at.A trial allowing the consumption of alcohol in view of the pitch has already taken place in the women’s game, which is not covered by the 1985 ban.Four clubs – Bristol City, Southampton, Birmingham City and Newcastle United – participated in the trial for certain games in the latter part of the season.Charters accepted it would not work on every occasion but said there were instances were the policy could be reviewed.“For me, we should always keep family areas free of that, but let us give fans who want to drink in the stands the chance to do so responsibly, or at least let us have a conversation about it,” he told the Commons.During the debate, Charters also said that “there is no greater problem” facing football fans in England than ticket prices.The MP called for a £30 away ticket cap – which is already in place in the Premier League – to be applied across the EFL and National League.The FA has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSportAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

But for today’s learners, the journey to getting on the road is proving longer, more uncertain and more expensive than ever.What was once a fairly straightforward process, from lessons and the theory test to the practical exam, now involves record waiting times, rising costs and having to compete with automated software bots to secure a test slot.The average waiting time to take a driving test reached 20 weeks in February, according to figures obtained by the AA Driving School. Amid growing anger, last month the government promised to make thousands of extra driving tests available each month, with the aim of reducing average waiting times to seven weeks by the summer of 2026.For many, the delays are adding to the bill. The long gaps between lessons and test dates mean learner drivers are left paying for extra lessons just to stay test ready.Here is a breakdown of some of the costs you can expect to pay when learning to drive.Provisional licenceCost of applying: £34The first step to getting on the road is applying for a provisional licence, which is required before starting lessons. It costs £34 online, or £43 if you apply by post. You can do this on theGov.UK website, where you will be directed to create a DVLA account.View image in fullscreenYou need a provisional licence on the way to getting a full licence.Photograph: mundissima/AlamyTheory testCost: £23. Revision app: £4.99You don’t need to pass your theory test before starting practical lessons but studying for it alongside your driving lessons can be helpful. Before you book your practical exam, you will need to pass your theory test.You can take your theory test as soon as you have a driving licence number from your provisional licence, although some road experience can be helpful.It will cost you £23 to book your theory test.According to the RAC, it can take up to 20 hours to revise for a theory test. You can use books and apps to revise and take practice tests. The official Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) theory test book for car drivers costs£18.99, and the official DVSA theory test kit app for iPhone and Android costs £4.99.The DVSA administers tests in England, Scotland and Wales, while the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) handles them in Northern Ireland.You can get the books secondhand for less than £4, or borrow them from your local library, or use free resources such as YouTube videos to test yourself before the exam.View image in fullscreenA no U-turn road sign. Some road experience can be helpful before taking a theory test.Photograph: Robert Read Road Signs/AlamyDriving lessonsAverage cost: £1,575 but can vary hugelyThe cost of practical lessons can vary depending on the driving school, location and whether you opt for regular lessons or an intensive course.There’s no set number of hours you must complete before taking and passing your test. It all depends on how quickly you learn.According to the DVSA, it takes an average of 45 hours of driving lessons and some additional hours of private practice to pass a test.RED, a well-known driving school, reckons most automatic vehicle learners need between 20 and 40 hours of lessons before they are test ready.The RAC says a reasonable price for a driving lesson is typically between £25 and £45 an hour, depending on where you live, and that most learners will need about 45 hours of lessons on average. You can sometimes get the cost down by buying lessons in bulk. If you were to pay the average, that comes to about £1,575.View image in fullscreenThe DVSA says it takes an average of 45 hours of driving lessons and some additional hours of private practice to pass a test.Photograph: Sam Oaksey/AlamyWe asked the AA Driving School for average prices in different parts of the country. While these figures reflect the averages, AA Driving School franchise instructors set their own rates.In Edinburgh, the average hourly rate for lessons in the EH postcode in a manual car is £38, and £40 for an automatic.Learners in Cardiff can expect to pay £35 an hour for a manual car in the CF postcode area, and £36.50 for an automatic.The TR and PL postcode areas of Cornwall the average is £34 for a manual and £32 for an automatic, according to the data.In London – all postcode areas within the M25 – manual lessons typically cost £40 an hour, and £42 for an automatic.Intensive coursesCosts vary, perhaps £2,000-plusAn intensive driving course, also known as a crash course, is a condensed programme designed to help learners prepare for their driving test in a few days or weeks.With the Local Intensive Driver Training driving school, for example, there are several intensive package options available, based on the amount of experience you have. Fifty hours is recommended for a novice. When we looked at a course in June this year in Hornchurch, east London, spread over nine to 15 days, and with a driving test on 9 July 2025, it cost £2,175, including the test fee.For a 10-hour fast-track course and test, which is “intended for experienced drivers or candidates who recently failed their driving test”, you would pay £575.Private practice with learner driver insuranceCosts vary greatlyAccording to the government, most learners need about 22 hours of extra private practice to be test ready. You can get those hours in by using a friend or family member’s car, as long as you are properly insured as a learner on their policy.Adding a learner driver to a parent’s car insurance policy used to be the go-to option, and for some, it still is. But insurers aren’t always keen on provisional licence holders – some won’t allow it at all, and when they do, it can come with a hefty premium.View image in fullscreenIs there a family member or friend who can help you learn to drive?Photograph: Hongqi Zhang/AlamyIf you are using someone else’s car to practise, a separate learner driver insurance policy can be a safer option, as it means any claims won’t affect the car owner’s insurance or no-claims bonus, as long as they meet all of the stipulations of the policy.The RAC says the cost will vary depending on your individual situation and vehicle. It has put the average cost of learner insurance at about £20 for one day, £36 for one week’s cover, about £82 for four weeks’ and £117 for eight weeks’. A few weeks should be enough time for, say, 11 two-hour practice sessions.Some price comparison websites such as Confused.com and MoneySuperMarket, allow you to compare the cost of learner insurance. You will usually need to input some information about the learner and car, such as the model and the make, to get a quote.Or you can compare the cost on several providers’ sites yourself by getting quotes.Practical driving testCost: £62 or £75Driving tests cost £62 on weekdays, or £75 for evenings, weekends or bank holidays.Driving test delays are still causing frustration for learners across the UK. In some areas, people are waiting a minimum of six months to book a test, according to the AA.Tests are made available 24 weeks – almost six months – in advance, and yet many learners are stuck endlessly refreshing the booking service. Some end up paying for apps that snap up cancellations, or they fork out for tests on the hidden market.The first-time pass rate for the UK practical driving test is said to be about 48.5%The government aims to bring typical waiting timesdown to seven weeks by the summer of 2026, while rules on bookings have also been tightened up to combat the bots and to reduce the number of rescheduled tests.For now, securing a test often feels more like a lottery than a straightforward step towards getting on the road.The first-time pass rate for the UK practical driving test is said to be about 48.5% – meaning roughly half of learners pass on their first try. However, pass rates vary depending on where you take the test. Some centres have significantly higher success rates than others.For instance, the Isles of Scilly have thehighest pass rate in the UK, at 87.5%, whereas the Plymouth LGV test centre has a pass rate of 19.5%, and for Chingford in east London it is 35.8%.‘Lesson prices had jumped massively since 2018’View image in fullscreenGlen worries that he will miss out on work opportunities if he can’t drive.Photograph: suppliedGlen, 24, is an accounting associate in Glasgow. When he was 17 and had the summer between his highers (the Scottish equivalent of A-levels) and going to university in Glasgow, he decided to start driving lessons.It was 2018 and he paid £28 an hour for lessons in a manual car. “I had saved up money and had the whole summer before going to uni to get it out of the way. And back then, lessons and tests were quite available.”He took 15 hours of lessons before taking his test. “My instructor thought I was definitely ready, and I felt ready,” he says. However, he failed. After that, what with moving to Glasgow, university and work, driving fell down his list of priorities, and Covid certainly didn’t help.“I just didn’t really need to drive. Covid came in halfway through that anyway, so I wasn’t really able to. And then the backlog of instructors and tests was ridiculous after Covid, so I didn’t even bother,” he says. At this point, he had spent about £540, including the test fee.It wasn’t until six years later, at the end of 2024, that he took up lessons again. To beat the backlog, Glen booked his second test as soon as he started doing them.View image in fullscreenGlen started taking driving lessons again last year.Photograph: macana/AlamyWhen looking for lessons this time round, he found the price had “jumped massively” to £41 an hour. “It’s wild,” he says. “I’ve heard of worse and I’ve heard of better but that seems to be the kind of standard round here.” He did 15 lessons again, which he says “wasn’t like restarting” as it “did come back very quickly”, before his test in March. Unfortunately, he did not pass.“I was totally, totally ready for the test, totally confident. My instructor was confident in me but it’s all that pressure on the actual day. I was just like a bag of nerves when I got in the car.“I think my nerves were already building up on the day because I’d heard about how bad getting a test was. I booked that March test when I started the lessons in November.“And then the morning of the test, I was hearing about August, September until you could get another one at that point,” he says. “Getting a cancellation is almost impossible. It’s pretty disheartening.”Going forward, Glen also worries that he will miss out on work opportunities if he can’t drive. “For my type of job, a lot more opportunities lie in warehouses and all that in the middle of nowhere, so you would need a car for that. So if I end up, say, failing in September, at this rate there wouldn’t be another chance until spring next year.In total, he estimates he has spent £1,160 or more on learning to drive and taking the tests. “That’s my main concern this time around. Hopefully I can pass next time but if it’s a six-month wait between tests, it adds even more pressure and money.”Explore more on these topicsMotoringConsumer affairsCar insuranceInsuranceUK cost of living crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Al Shawa has only been able to communicate with her grandchildren on video calls.The family, who now live in Glasgow, fledSyriain 2015. They had lost their baby after a bombing at their home in Damascus and were unable to take Al Hamwi’s mother with them.The Home Office rejected an application for a refugee family reunion made after the terminal cancer diagnosis, which Al Shawa received towards the end of last year. The family appealed and a judge in the first-tier tribunal of the immigration court agreed in April.The family were overjoyed and relayed the news to Al Shawa, who began to make preparations to come to the UK. But they were devastated when the Home Office sought permission to appeal against the judge’s ruling; a move Al Hamwi said was “breaking my heart”. The further appeal may have taken about eight months – time doctors do not expect Al Shawa to have.But now the Home Office has told the family’s lawyer it is withdrawing its application, that the grandmother can come to the UK, and that it will expedite the issuing of a visa. The family are hoping it will be processed at a centre in neighbouring Jordan this weekend and then Amonajid will collect Al Shawa her from there.Refugeesare not permitted to return to the country they fled, so Al Hamwi and Amonajid cannot re-enter Syria to be with Al Shawa there.“My mum really perked up when she heard the news and started to eat more,” said Al Hamwi. “All she wants to do before she dies is to see us and the kids.”Amonajid welcomed the Home Office U-turn and the indication that it will expedite the visa. “I appreciate the Home Office for listening to Ola and me,” he said. “The kids are so excited they are finally going to meet their grandmother. She will be sleeping in their bedroom and they are fighting over who will sleep next to her.”The family’s solicitor, Usman Aslam of Mukhtar & Co, said: “We welcome the Home Office decision to withdraw from this case and, moreover, to assist in expediting it. We now hope that a daughter and mother can spend whatever time the mother has left together. Refugees are no different from anyone else. They too have lives, families and dignity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But his recent posts on Truth Social, the social media platform he founded in 2021, have become increasingly bizarre: the president using the lack of scrutiny afforded by the platform’s small user base to truly let loose.In the hundreds of “Truths” since he took office, Trump has variously used Truth Social toreimagine himself as a kingand to urge Americans to“BE COOL!”as the stock market tanked in the wake of histrade war, the president’s seemingly random use of capital letters, punctuation and inaccurate spelling consistent across the messages.Trump’s posts broadly fit into three categories: attacking perceived foes, reposting praise and posting no-context images or videos of himself, like an elderly relative in a family group chat.One hundred days in, Donald Trump faces a problem: he can rage, but he can’t govern | Jonathan FreedlandRead moreJudges – or “radical left judges”, as Trump would have them – have come in for particular criticism, the president eschewing normal decorum to lambast those members of the judiciary who won’t let him deport people without due process.“What is going on with our Courts? They are totally OUT OF CONTROL,” Trumpwroteon 18 April, responding to ajudge’s rulingthat the government cannot deport noncitizens to a country other than their place of origin without due process.Trump then made the extraordinary, and untrue, claim that Joe Biden had flown more than half a million undocumented immigrants to the US in one 24-hour period, before adding:“This Radicalized Judge is saying that Sleepy Joe Biden can fly more than half a million Illegals into America, IN ONE DAY, but we have to hold many years of long and tedious trials to fly each and every one of them back home. Where is the JUSTICE here???”That was one of just several furious complaints about judges not letting Trump do as he pleases, but his focus also went beyond the judiciary to the executive branch.Letitia James, the New York attorney general, has been a frequent target in recent weeks. Trump has repeatedly posted stories from rightwing news sites which accuse James of alleged mortgage fraud. James has said the accusations are“baseless”– while also finding herself described by Trump’s thumbs as a“wacky crook”, among other insults.Yet Trump’s Truth Social account does, sometimes, offer tender moments. No one, for example, treated the death of Pope Francis with more reverence thanDonald Trump.“Melania and I will be going to the funeral of Pope Francis, in Rome. We look forward to being there!” Trumppostedhours after the death of the pontiff. He followed that up by posting a video of a speech he gave at the White House, during which Trump praised Pope Francis as “a good man”while standing next to the Easter Bunny.The posts come thick and fast – Trump frequently writes on Truth Social more than a dozen times a day – interrupted only by adverts for “dream singles” and “international singles”. Amid the complaining about the rule of law and personal score-settling, sometimes Trump announces things that would be good for people who are not on Truth Social,which is most people, to know.“ALERT: All purchases of Iranian Oil, or Petrochemical products, must stop, NOW!” Trump wrote on Thursday afternoon. He warned that countries that purchase oil from Iran would be subject to “secondary sanctions”, before signing off in the manner of a passive-aggressive tenant writing to their landlord:“Thank you for your attention to this matter, PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.”It was an important notice. Unfortunately, only about 5 million people use Truth Social each month, so Trump may have been screaming into the void. The diatribes about judges and tariffs, and the all-caps, slightly hysterical entreaties of “Vladimir, STOP!” after Russia launched its latest attack on Ukraine, account for much of the content.But they are interrupted by a sprinkling of no-context posts – photos and videos posted to Trump’s account with little explanation: the messaging style of an elderly relative in a group chat.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

No information was provided, similarly to his actions in March, when Trump postedan imagethat had been heavily edited, apparently with the intention of giving him a jawline, with the words “Fight Fight Fight”. There was no text accompanying the photo.Of course, a favorite Trump pastime is reposting praise of himself. Luckily for a man who has managed to turn the Republican party from a sober political institution into what is essentially a cult, there is plenty to go around.On 18 March, heposted a screengrabof an X post from a user called @Dndbreakfast which said: “A reminder of what a warrior looks like” above a photo of Trump after a bullet grazed his ear in July last year. It was unclear where Trump found @Dndbreakfast’s X post, as he does not follow them on X.Beyond that, if there is a final common feature among Trump’s use of Truth Social, it is his freeform, frequently unhinged posts. In early February, Trump banged out a lengthy missive which was ostensibly about the economy and trade but read as if it were being shouted at townsfolk through a bull horn.“The ‘Tariff Lobby,’ headed by the Globalist, and always wrong, Wall Street Journal, is working hard to justify Countries like Canada, Mexico, China, and too many others to name, continue the decades long RIPOFF OF AMERICA, both with regard to TRADE, CRIME, AND POISONOUS DRUGS that are allowed to so freely flow into AMERICA,”was the first sentence.Trump rambled a bit more before declaring: “THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA! WILL THERE BE SOME PAIN? YES, MAYBE (AND MAYBE NOT!). BUT WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, AND IT WILL ALL BE WORTH THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID. WE ARE A COUNTRY THAT IS NOW BEING RUN WITH COMMON SENSE – AND THE RESULTS WILL BE SPECTACULAR!!!”The results of the tariffs are yet to be seen. But Trump’s thoughts and views, disseminated hourly on his little-used social media network, are certainly spectacular.This article was amended on 3 May 2025. An earlier version mistakenly said that Letitia James oversaw Donald Trump’s prosecution over hush-money payments.

Since then, at least 2,326 people have been killed, bringing the death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, according to the health ministry in Gaza.Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge denied by the radical Islamist organisation. It also accuses Hamas of stealing and selling aid to fund its military and other operations.The war was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October 2023. Militants killed more than 1,200 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.Aid officials have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with famine again looming. On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the “verge of total collapse”.“This situation must not – and cannot – be allowed to escalate further,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s deputy director of operations, said in a statement.There has been no progress in faltering negotiations for a new ceasefire-for-hostages deal in recent weeks, and reports in Israeli media suggest Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, will soonapprove a new broader offensiveas well as a new plan drawn up by Israeli officials for renewed distribution of aid in Gaza involving private contractors and a small number of “hubs” to be constructed in the south of the territory.Humanitarian officials in Gaza told the Guardian last week that the proposed Israeli aid plan was impracticable and unethical.“The current scheme just won’t work unless there are a lot more distribution hubs and even then we cannot be a party to something that may drive massive and possibly permanent displacement within Gaza,” one senior humanitarian official said.The US president, Donald Trump, is thought to be likely to press Israel for some concessions on aid entering Gaza before he visits Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar this month. A week ago, he told Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”.Why has Israel resumed large-scale airstrikes on Gaza?Read moreAnalysts are divided on whether warnings issued to tens of thousands of Israeli reservists to expect to be called up in the coming days or weeks are designed to put further pressure on Hamas to make concessions in talks or are evidence that a new offensive in Gaza is imminent.Israel’s military is already overstretched after 18 months of war, with a shortfall of about 7,000 combat soldiers. Government officials describe a “seven-front war” thatcould last another year.On Saturday morning, sirens sounded in Israel for the second day running, warning of an incoming missile launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Air defences intercepted the missile.Separately, Israel’s military said on Saturday its forces deployed in southern Syria were ready to protect the Druze minority, without specifying whether this was a new deployment or giving further details on the number of troops on the ground.After deadly sectarian clashes near Damascus earlier this week,Israel has conducted multiple strikes it says were meant to protect the Druze communityand warned Syria’s Islamist rulers against harming the minority group.On Saturday, the Israeli military said that “five Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated to receive medical treatment in Israel overnight” after sustaining injuries on Syrian territory.A Druze official in the southern Syrian city Sweida said those evacuated had been wounded “in clashes in Sahnaya”, the site of recent sectarian violence near Damascus, but were afraid of being sent to hospitals in the Syrian capital out of fear of being detained.Israel launched a new wave of more than 20 airstrikes in Syria late on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Early on Friday, Israel had launched an attack near the presidential palace in Damascus, which Syrian authorities condemned as a“dangerous escalation”.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned on Thursday that Israel would respond forcefully if Syria’s new government failed to protect the Druze minority.Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria. It has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in theGolan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed.Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country. The strategy is controversial, however, with some officials arguing that a stable Syria would better serve Israel’s interests.The government in Damascus took power after ousting Assad and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in al-Qaida’s jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multiconfessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

And Carney, who dealt with politicians, some hostile, as a central banker, has now become one, occupying a role in which he’s all but guaranteed to disappoint someone.On Monday,Carney led Canada’s Liberal party to a victory that only months ago few would have thought possible. Running as the candidate best-equipped to defend Canada’s sovereignty against Donald Trump, he emerged with a minority government.After a congratulatory phone call on Wednesday, Donald Trump called Carney a “very nice gentleman”, said the prime minister “couldn’t have been nicer” and predicted “we‘re going to have a great relationship”. Notably, he did not refer to Carney as “governor” – a slight he appeared to have reserved for the former leader Justin Trudeau. The pair will meet at the White House on Tuesday – their first in-person encounter in Carney’s role as prime minister.Carney gave a eulogy for Canada’s old relationship with the US. Now he must redefine itRead moreCarney used his first post-election press conference to once again quash any idea Canada was interested in becoming the 51st US state, a proposal repeatedly floated by Trump.“It’s always important to distinguish want from reality,” Carney said on Friday, referring to a firm belief that Canada joining the US will “never, ever happen”.View image in fullscreenMark Carney during an election night event at TD Place in Ottawa, Ontario, early on 29 April 2025.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesStanding up to the erratic US president –prone to dressing down allies on a whim– will be a key task for Carney. But experts say his economic challenges might prove far more testing than managing Trump.“There’s actually only so much we can do if the Americans decide to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot and inject uncertainty into their economy, the North American economy and the global economy,” said Robert Gillezeau, a professor of economics at the University of Toronto.“And let’s imagine we got the best-case scenario – the Trump regime says: ‘We messed up, tariffs are off the table, we’re going to go back to a reasonable and rational global approach to economics.’ We’d still probably be in a fairly deep recession. Tariffs matter, but the uncertainty also matters. And at this point, in terms of business investment, nobody has any idea what the hell they’re going to do.”As a veteran central banker who helped establish stability amid first the 2008 financial crisis and then Brexit, Carney’s argument to Canadians was that he was the consummate fixer. “I am most useful in a crisis,” he said on the campaign trail. “I’m not that good at peacetime.”It was an argument that convinced many voters, who gambled that what the country needed was a safe pair of hands.View image in fullscreenEntrance to the House of Commons in the West Block on Parliament Hill, in Ottawa on 8 March 2025.Photograph: NurPhoto/Getty ImagesCarney ran – and won – as a newcomer to politics and sought to draw a clear line between himself and his Liberal predecessorJustin Trudeau– but he nonetheless is steering a government into its fourth term.To run again, he would be asking voters for a fifth consecutive Liberal win in a country that “believes it healthy for different parties to govern”, said Gillezeau.“There’s a real likelihood that he gets between two and four years as prime minister. And because he’s been thinking for long about entering politics, I suspect he’s aware of that – and so there is a meaningful chance that he does make good use of the time.”By midweek, it became clear the Liberals had fallen just four seats short of a majority government, with some races decided by a handful of votes.For a brief period of time as votes were counted, it appeared as though the Liberals would be forced to rely on the Bloc Québécois,a separatist party that is politically toxic outside Quebecand whose leader recently claimed Canada was an “an artificial country with very little meaning”.Parliamentresumes on 26 May, with King Charles travelling to Canada to formally open proceedings the following day - “an historic honour that matches the weight of our times”, said Carney.Once the grind of legislating begins, Carney can partner with three parties to pass bills, giving his minority government far more stability. The most likely partner for the Liberals are the New Democrats, who faced a wipeout but managed to win seven seats held by incumbents. Those federal seats, alongside the Liberal’s 168, give the two parties more than enough to pass legislation.“Minority governments will take political sophistication to navigate. It’s about seeing the whole chessboard listening and taking counsel from many people,” said Jordan Leichnitz, a former senior strategist with the New Democratic party. “This will give us a glimpse into whether Carney has the intangible skills that make somebody a durable political leader and able to survive in this environment. Because there’s a question mark over whether he has any interest or is capable of doing this. And not everybody who voted for Carney quite knows what they got.”View image in fullscreenMark Carney chats with construction workers in Edmonton, Alberta, on 20 March 2025.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIn its electoral collapse, the NDP also lost both its leader, Jagmeet Singh, and official party status, which grants certain parliamentary privileges, including the ability to ask questions during question period and to sit on key committees. With the Bloc and Conservatives both potentially hostile to the Liberals, they could use the committees to grind government to a halt.“It’s in the power of the Liberals to lower the threshold for party status and grant it to the NDP. Doing so wouldn’t be out of the goodness of their heart, but instead reflect an understanding of political considerations,” said Leichnitz. “And we’ll see soon if this government – and Carney – has these instincts.”The nature of his victory and the unusual cobbling together of his voter base – a mix of progressives fleeing the NDP and older voters typically voting Conservative, gives the prime minister a shorter than typical honeymoon.While Trump figured prominently in the early days of the federal election to Carney’s benefit, many of the issues that previously fueled growing support for the Conservatives are likely to bubble back to the surface in the coming months.Housing remains unaffordable, the cost-of-living crisis hasn’t yet abated and wage growth feels stagnant to young workers. A somewhat chastened Conservative party, whose leader, Pierre Poilievre, lost his own seat, will want electoral revenge.And despite winning seats in every province, the prime minister also faces a hostile Prairie region, where a small but vocal minority are agitating for oil-rich Alberta to secede from the country.“Carney could be in a Keir Starmer situation where he’s elected, but it’s a loveless victory and he has a very short window in which to deliver what voters think they should be getting from him,” said Leichnitz. “If you don’t deliver soon and people began peeling away, it can be really difficult to recover from that. And so in many ways, I think his honeymoon ended the minute he stepped off the stage after giving his victory speech.”"

He is 94 years old.Buffett, the fifth-richest person in the world, shocked an arena full of shareholders on Saturday when he announced that he would step down as the CEO and chair of the trillion-dollar conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025. He will recommend to the 11-person board that his vice-chair, Greg Abel, who currently oversees most of the company’s investments, be named as his successor, Buffett said.The thousands of investors at the arena in Omaha,Nebraska, gave Buffett a lengthy standing ovation in recognition of his 60 years of leading the company.“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said.“I have no intention – zero – of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,” Buffett said. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.”Buffett made the announcement at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer session, and did not take any queries about his retirement plans. The only board members who knew about the announcement in advance were his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, he said. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, was unaware, but stood to join the crowd in applauding his boss.Abel, 62, who was born in Alberta, Canada, has been Buffett’s designated successor as CEO since 2001. He is a 25-year Berkshire veteran and already manages all of the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses including dozens of fossil energy, chemical, real estate and retail operations. But despite Buffett’s advanced age, the announcement came as a shock as the Berkshire CEO previously insisted that he had no plans to retire.Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy and other sectors.Buffett, a Democrat, has previously said that heplans to donate99.5% of his remaining wealth to a charitable trust overseen by his daughter and two sons when he dies. According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $165.3bn.Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.Buffett said Trump’s trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.“We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world.

That’s not democracy – it’s tyranny in disguise. What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes.”Rubio went on to say: “Germany should reverse course.”Rubio comes a long way to become most dominant US diplomat since KissingerRead moreIn aresponseon X, the German foreign ministry pushed back against the US secretary of state, saying: “This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.”Germany’s response to Rubio comes after its domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV),designatedthe AfD as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force on Friday.The BfV’s decision marks a step up from its previous designation of the country’s anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin and largest opposition party as a “suspected” threat to Germany’s democratic order.According tothe BfV, the AfD’s xenophobic stances based on an “ethnic-ancestry-based understanding” of German identity are “incompatible with the free democratic basic order” as indicated by the country’s constitution.The spy agency added that the AfD “aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, to subject them to unconstitutional unequal treatment and thus to assign them a legally devalued status”.It also said: “This exclusionary understanding of the people is the starting point and ideological basis for ongoing agitation against certain individuals or groups of people, through which they are defamed and despised indiscriminately and irrational fears and rejection are stirred up.”During February’s general election in Germany, which was rocked by extensiveUS interferenceincluding public votes of confidence by staunch AfD supporterssuch as Elon MuskandJD Vance, the AfDamassedapproximately 21% of the vote, finishing second.The far-right party’s rise to popularity in Germany has come as a result of abroader waveof growingrightwing extremismacross Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The rebels went on to control most population centres in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country.A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of beleaguered government forces in 2015 but with little success.On Saturday, Bin Mubarak posted on X that he had met the PLC’s Alimi and resigned.He also shared his resignation letter in which he said: “I could not exercise my constitutional powers and take the necessary decisions to reform government institutions or implement rightful governmental changes.”The Houthis are currently waging a campaign of missile attacks on Israel and are targeting shipping in key waterways in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza.Bin Mubarak said that despite the obstacles he had managed to achieve “many successes in a short space of time”, citing fiscal and administrative reforms and an anti-corruption drive.However, analyst Mohammed al-Basha, of the US-based Basha Report Risk Advisory, told AFP Bin Mubarak had been “in constant friction with the Presidential Leadership Council”.“Bin Mubarak wanted to be more than prime minister – he wanted the powers of the presidency. That aspiration isolated him politically,” Basha said.The Yemeni official sources who spoke to AFP said Bin Mubarak had suspended the budgets of several ministries including defence, citing corruption, further fuelling tensions.“His drive for greater power – viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition – led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most council members,” Basha said. “Over time, this power struggle eroded trust.”Bin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the US, is a staunch adversary of the Houthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him for several days.Previously he was chief of staff of the presidential office and Yemen’s envoy to the UN.He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on 5 February 2024.His departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen’s internationally recognised government – a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion”, Basha said.The war in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting decreased significantly after a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022.Since the war in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it.The Houthis paused their attacks during a two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March a threat to resume attacks over Israel’s Gaza aid blockade triggered a renewed andsustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yementhey control.Explore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Whatever their strategy, the aim is the same: to spot the red-capped cardinals emerging from Synod Hall and try to elicit from them a clue as to who will succeed Pope Francis.The men responsible for picking a new pontiff are enjoying rock-star status in Rome this week as they prepare forconclave: the secret, centuries-old ritual of electing a leader of the Catholic church that is due to begin on 7 May.Marina García Diéguez is among the journalists partaking in the daily stakeout. She is a conclave novice, but was quick to suss out the cunning ways the cardinals try to avoid the gaggle of reporters.“Each one has his own strategy,” said Diéguez, who works for the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser and Mediaset España. “Some already have cars with blacked-out windows waiting for them, so they can make a sharp exit. Others remove their red skullcaps and leave by foot, taking a route that crosses St Peter’s Square, where they can get lost among the tourists, before escaping through Via della Conciliazione.” It was at that point, she advised, that you stood a good chance of catching one.View image in fullscreenCardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan of Hong Kong is approached by reporters outside the Vatican.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APDiéguez had managed to obtain quotes from a couple, including Fernando Filoni, an Italian cardinal whose name cropped up this week among the favourites for pope. The Guardian’s attempt to give chase was not as successful. “I don’t speak English, which at this precise moment, is a very good thing,” said an Argentinian cardinal, before politely adding, in Italian: “But we are working very well together,” and striding off.About 180 cardinals from all over the world have been gathering each morning this week at Synod Hall to get to know each other and to share their visions of the church, but ultimately to establish a clear pope contender. Of that number, 133 are eligible to vote after two dropped out of the conclave for health reasons.Eight in 10 of the voters were appointed by Francis, with 20 becoming cardinals only in December. Francis made a point of selecting cardinals from places where there had never previously been one, such as Myanmar, Haiti and Rwanda. Until this past week or so, many had never met.View image in fullscreenJorge Enrique Jiménez Carvajal, a Colombian cardinal, addresses the media in St Peter’s Square, Rome.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APDuring conclave, the men will be sequestered in their humble lodgings at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where Pope Francis lived during his 12-year papacy, and the Sistine Chapel, where the voting takes place.The cardinals swear an oath of silence before each pre-conclave meeting and will do so again when the election begins.But until they are sequestered, it is in the bars and restaurants in the area surrounding the Vatican where the real talking happens, with some mischievous cardinals exploiting the press while they can to leak titbits or to discredit the main candidates.Al Passetto di Borgo, a restaurant in Borgo Pio, has been a favourite among Rome’s clergy for years. According to a framed newspaper article hanging on the wall, this was the place where cardinals, over carbonara and tiramisu, plotted to ensure the election of Joseph Ratzinger in the 2005 conclave.Seán Patrick O’Malley, an American cardinal who leads a commission tasked with preventing clerical abuse against minors, was among the diners this week. Aged 80, O’Malley is too old to vote but has been named by some church-watchers as a possibility for pontiff. Another diner was Donald Wuerl, who in 2018resigned asarchbishop of Washington over his handling of a sexual abuse scandal.Showing a photo on his phone of a plain-clothed Wuerl in Al Passetto di Borgo, the restaurant’s owner, Antonello Fulvimari, said: “He’s been coming here since 1969.”View image in fullscreenRaniero Mancinelli, a Roman tailor, is on his own initiative making outfits for the next pope.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APThe only information Fulvimari had been able to glean from his prestigious clients this week was that they wanted the conclave over “as soon as possible”. “They all want to get home,” he added. “But this is where the real decisions get made.”Another popular restaurant is Marcantonio, although according to a waiter, the presence of cardinals has petered out because of journalists.Cardinals who want to spread rumours tend to resort to the veteran Vatican reporters from the Italian press. They have sought to diminish the credibility of some leading contenders – for example Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state – by claiming they have health issues. Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines and a strong favourite, has also had a rough ride from conservative cardinals aftera videoof him singing John Lennon’s Imagine emerged on the internet.Another meeting point is reportedly Caffe dei Papi, a coffee bar tucked away from the main hubbub on Via Vespasiano. “But I never know when they are here,” said Ilda, the bar’s manager. “I just read about it in the newspaper.”Unsurprisingly, the main chatter in the bar has revolved around who will be elected pope. “I think it should be someone who embraces everyone,” said Ilda.Vincenzo Aru, a building concierge who works nearby, is a lapsed Catholic and therefore indifferent. “I’m just happy they’ve cleaned the streets,” he said. “The only time that happens around here is when a pope dies.”Explore more on these topicsThe papacyPapal conclaveVaticanCatholicismItalyReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak haskilledtwounvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.“We’re living in a post-herd-immunity world. I think the measles outbreak proves that,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.“Measles – because it is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, the most contagious human disease really – it is the first to come back.”The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)reported935 confirmed measles cases across30 jurisdictions.Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and the US now account for the overwhelming majority of roughly 2,300 measles cases across the World Health Organization’s six-country Americas region, according to the health authority’supdatethis week. Risk of measles is considered high in the Americas, and has grown 11-fold compared with 2024.Only slightly behind, datareleased earlier this weekfrom the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO also noted that measles cases across Europe were up tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That data also indicated that the 2024 measles cases in Europe followed a seasonal pattern, which was not previously noted in 2021 through 2023.Of the European cases, which reportedly hit 35,212 for 2024, 87% were reported in Romania. The ECDC said the dip in vaccine rates has impacted the recent spike in measles, with only three countries, Hungary, Malta and Portugal, having coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.“This virus was imported, traveling country to country,” said Leticia Ruíz, the director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua, Mexico, according to theAssociated Press.Many cases are in areas with large populations of tight-knit Mennonite communities. The religious group has a history of migration through the American south-west,Mexicoand Canada.Mennonite teaching does not explicitly prohibit immunization, according toan expertin the religion. However, as some in the Mennonite community in Texas resist assimilation and speak a dialect of Low German, community members may have limited contact with public health authorities, leading to lower vaccination rates.Immunologists fear the rate of infection of such diseases – and the unnecessary suffering they bring – will increase as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, spreadsmisleading claimsabout vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases,undermines public confidencein vaccines’ benefits, threatens to make some vaccines less accessible,guts publichealth infrastructureand pushesleading vaccine expertsout of the department.The National Institutes of Health said it would launch a“universal” influenza vaccine trialwith $500m in funding, but the news comes as the administrationdisplays hostilitytowardCovid-19 vaccines.“Here,Robert F Kennedy Jris exactly who he has been for the last 20 years. He’s an anti-vaccine activist, he is a science denialist and a conspiracy theorist,” said Offit.“He has a fixed belief that vaccines are doing more harm than good – as he’s said over and over again.”Although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine. Just this week, Kennedy told a crowd that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced usingdecades-old sterile fetal cell linesderived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There, he mademisleading claimsabout measles treatment, including that the antibiotic clarithromycin and steroid budesonide had led to “miraculous and instantaneous recovery”.The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective. Still, Kennedy has said he willask the CDCto study vitamins and drugs to treat the viral disease.Measles is a virus. There is no cure for the viral disease and it is not considered “treatable” by leading physicians’ groups, such as theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics(AAP).“There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It’s misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,” the AAPhas saidof Kennedy’s claims.Measles kills about one in 1,000 children who become infected with the disease, and has similar rates of brain swelling, called encephalitis, that can result in lifelong disability. Measles infectionsuppresses the immune system, which can lead to other infections.Measles vaccination is believed to have saved more than93 million livesworldwide between 1974 and 2024 and reduced overall childhood mortality.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMMRInfectious diseasesRobert F Kennedy JrCanadaMexicoHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Her aunt Milly, a previous record holder in the same category, until she died in 2020, also was under 4in (10.16cm) tall.‘When she first gave me her paw, my heart melted’: here’s what I’ve learned about taking on a rescue dogRead moreBoth Milly and Pearl weighed 1oz (28.35 grams) at birth.“I was not expecting to once again have the record,” said Vanesa Semler of Orlando, Florida, owner of both tiny dogs. “That would be like unbelievable.”Guinness arranged the two-day meet-up between Pearl and Reginald – who also goes by Reggie and measures in at a whopping 3ft 3in (1 meter) – last month at his home inIdahoFalls.Even though Pearl loves dogs, even big dogs, Semler said she was anxious because of Reginald’s size.View image in fullscreenPearl wasn’t fazed by the size difference with Reginald.Photograph: Nataljie Behring/AP“For me, [it] was a huge, pleasant surprise from day one because Reggie is like Pearl, in bigger size,” she said. “He is so gentle, so friendly.”Reggie, for his part, might have been more interested in the Guinness film crew that accompanied Pearl than the tiny dog herself.“I would say he likes people a little bit more than he likes other dogs,” said Sam Johnson Reiss, his owner.Pearl’s tiny size was also strange for the big boy.“He was like very cautious, like a little anxious,” Reiss said. “He was very careful, like he didn’t step on her or anything or anything crazy. He was just very aware that she was there.”Reggie’s super size was evident early on, especially on a dog park visit when he towered over other great danes despite being only nine months old.View image in fullscreenReginald and Pearl out for a stroll.Photograph: Nataljie Behring/AP“They would be shorter than him, and they were like full-grown,” Reiss said.There might have been a little jealousy shown over toys and beds, but Reggie and Pearl found common ground during their two days roaming the Idaho farm together.“I think she found a good friend,” Semler said.Semler said Pearl is her prima donna, with the chihuahua even picking out the clothes she wants to wear every day by placing her paw on the outfits laid out before her. That comes in handy when news crews are lining up for interviews.“For us, she was always our diva,” Semler said. “Now she’s a diva for everyone.”Pearl doesn’t have the top diva title quite yet, with Reiss saying Reggie – who has a new Instagram account – has his own diva moments.“He’s pretty high-maintenance,” Reiss said. “Reggie’s just cheeky, like he’s kind of mischievous and silly and definitely tells you when he wants something.”Explore more on these topicsGuinness World RecordsDogsIdahoPetsAnimalsnewsShareReuse this content"

The show, Point Blank, is based on original sketches created by Dylan between 2021 and 2022. They depict people playing instruments, couples, sportspeople – along with rooms and places where Dylan spent time.The drawings were painted over with vivid colours to create “living, breathing entities that have emotional resonance, colours used as weapons and mood setters, a means of storytelling”, Dylan said.“The idea was not only to observe the human condition, but to throw myself into it with great urgency,” he added.The studies include a mirror reflecting a set of lips, a saxophonist and a cowboy with a pistol hanging on his belt in front of a rising sun.Some of the drawings are tangled up as blue, red and neutral monochromatic studies, reminiscent of Pablo Picasso’s early blue period.View image in fullscreenOne of the works from the Point Blank exhibition.Photograph: HalcyonThe Point Blank series began as a book and includes accompanying prose.Kate Brown, the creative director at Halcyon, said: “These works on paper feel like memories, intangible windows into the life and imagination of one of the greatest storytellers who ever lived.“People who attend the exhibition will discover that they provoke stories from our imagination. We consider the circumstances of the protagonists and ponder our movement through the spaces that the artist depicts.”The Halcyon Gallery previously exhibited Dylan’s series Drawn Blank, which featured graphite drawings made when travelling between Europe, Asia and the US from 1989 to 1992 – and later reworked with paint.Dylan describes the process of making his work as a way to “relax and refocus a restless mind” during busy tours.Paul Green, the president and founder of Halcyon, said: “It is nearly 18 years since Halcyon first started working withBob Dylanand it has been an extraordinary experience to watch this cultural icon develop into such a critically revered and important visual artist so closely.“This latest body of paintings feels like a more intimate connection to the artist than in any of his previous work and it is a great privilege to share them with the public for the first time.”The exhibition is free of charge and will open on 9 May.Explore more on these topicsBob DylanArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

I wanted to show howIn early 2020, separated from my family and friends during the pandemic, I made up my mind to write a love storyMorgan JerkinsSat 3 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 08.01 EDTShareIn early 2020, I made up my mind that I wanted to write a love story. Separated from my family and friends during the height of the pandemic and emotionally raw from living alone, I wanted to write something where I already knew the ending from the beginning: the characters would win. How they got there would be the most difficult part. I was inspired by the oeuvres of Toni Morrison and Gabriel García Márquez, and I wanted my fourth book to be vast in scope, rich in history and intertwined with familial lineages. But the work would demand plot development as well as historical research and I needed someone to help me.I began interviewing assistants and came across a fellow Black female Harlemite from the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Immediately, we clicked over a video chat and soon after, she emailed me a document she said I just had to see. The attachment revealed a four-page, cursive letter that dated back to 4 February 1863. Gorgeously maintained and preserved, the letter was written by a woman named Maria who took dictation from an enslaved man named James Tate of West Point, Georgia.The recipient is Tate’s wife, Olivia, who is enslaved on another plantation. James tells her that his master has urged him to move on and forget about Olivia, but he’s assuring her that he will never do that.This is it, I said to myself. That letter would be the foundation for my next book. Despite James’s master having a vested interest in James producing children so that his labor force would be maintained, James would not give up on Olivia. James’s body may not have belonged to him, but his heart was his own – something that the plantocracy or the law could not reach.View image in fullscreen‘This is it, I said to myself. That letter would be the foundation for my next book.’Photograph: New York public libraryLetter-writing among African American families is a centuries-old tradition. James Tate existed in a pattern of enslaved people who tried to reach their beloveds because stability was a fleeting dream. Whether it was a wife in Texas expressing worry for her husband’s military service for his bondsmen enslaver in 1862, or a Charleston-based daughter looking to reunite with her mother in 1867, the Black family has constantly been under threat, their unions neither protected nor acknowledged in a court of law. Nevertheless, they wrote during slavery and wrote some more to find their loved ones after the American civil war.I had done so much research on this delicate part of history that I didn’t know how my imagination could recreate it for the book. Then randomly, as I was cleaning my home, I “saw” him: a Black Union soldier riding gallantly through the fields of Mississippi back to one of the wealthiest slave ports in the US: Natchez. The image came to me so vividly. I imagined what would have been the humidity of that June in 1865 when the war was called, and felt my nose getting irritated from all the weeds that that horse would have had to navigate. I knew the soldier by name: Harrison. He was returning to his beloved, Tirzah, a literate, enslaved woman, because that was his one and only promise to her. But when he returns to the plantation where he once toiled, everyone is gone. The main house is rotting and nothing but the wind passes through the slave cabins. So begins the love story that endures, the zeal that serves as the undercurrent for the tale.View image in fullscreenPeople walking alongside a railroad line in Natchez, Mississippi, in August 1940.Photograph: Marion Post  Wolcott/Library of CongressAs someone who’s had a deep fondness for family history, I’ve often grown frustrated with archives. There’s always a missing part: the second half to a document was burned in a fire, another’s whereabouts are unknown. Maybe a key detail has been stolen or a line is grotesquely blotted out. A person disappears, a life reassigned to fabulism and hypotheses. I become obsessed with finding hard, definitive facts. My head becomes hot and tense with the dogged persistence that there has to be something there even if the path is circuitous.Every time this trial and error happens, I grieve for the only truth I can count on in my quest: in order for Black life to be animated in this historical research, Black life had to have been valued in the first place. The US is guilty of being an amnesiac herself, her institutions emerging and thriving due to the sacrifice and degradation of an entire race.But the beauty in my disappointment arises when I understand that resilience persists. Love persisted. If it didn’t, how could that letter from Georgia have been preserved in a family for more than 150 years, and make its way to the largest repository for African diasporic information in Harlem, and then to me in my quaint apartment that bordered on Central Park? Who knows what kind of difficulties this one family had to withstand in order to not only keep this letter, but also to preserve it.I became inspired all over again once I remembered: I remembered that love had to have existed like this in my family, too, even if there were no letters. If they didn’t, how was I even born, much less how did I have the capacity to write this novel?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

TheTrump administration is targeting the Smithsonian InstitutionandBlack history is being removed from federal agencies– an erasure from the public sphere. Our accomplishments are being flattened and distorted into rightwing discourse that promotes the idea that we never deserved or worked hard to achieve them. Worst of all, the legacy of slavery, the twists and turns of Black triumph under cruel white supremacy is being either sanitized or outright banned in multiple states.I am afraid that my book will get banned somewhere. I’m afraid of more archives being lost as federal funding gets re-allocated or slashed altogether. What will I do? What must we do as a nation? But then I recall that my body is a living, historical document. Someone was captured from the coasts of Africa, survived the horrific belly of a ship as it traveled across the Atlantic Ocean, labored under the blistering heat in the deep south and continued loving and expanding in the American north. I am here because someone, as the old folks used to say, kept on keeping on. Someone had to have been loved as Harrison or as James Tate had in my own family because that’s what kept us alive. Their earnestness carries on throughout generations.For four years of my life, I kept on keeping on beyond the shock of the pandemic. I researched the civil war, reconstruction, the exoduster movement, the Great Migration, the Great Depression, Jim Crow and the Covid era and positioned them as the backdrops of American history as two lovers and their descendants bond, twist, separate and merge under the weight of these periods. I wanted to show how love continues in spite of unnecessary pain and difficulty, in spite of external forces that threatens to break them apart, in spite of everything.I wanted a happy ending because I’ve seen that love in my own family – I rose up in it. Now, I wanted to deliver that goodness to another reader, while taking them on an adventure.And those types of endings aren’t just figments of my imagination.James Tate eventually reunited with Olivia. They are buried in the same cemetery. Side by side.

Katie Holmes is an undertaker! And Kumail Nunjiani is the new Tiger King! The super cool, celebrity-packed show is even wilder than everRebecca NicholsonSat 3 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe best thing aboutPoker Faceis that it doesn’t bother trying to shore up what it knows is a flimsy premise. Fans of the first season will recall that Charlie Cale, Natasha Lyonne’s wisecracking 70s detective homage, has an in-built ability to detect a lie as soon as someone tells it. Instead of trying to explain this gift away as the result of a gamma storm or spider bite or covert government experiment, it now accepts that, yeah, she has a “freaky little lie detector trick”, that’s the extent of the idea, got a problem with that? These days, Charlie waves away any queries about it with an “Eh”, a shrug and a cheeky nudge of the baseball cap and aviator shades.After using her talent to work her way through a series of increasingly preposterous case-of-the-week murders last time, then ending up with the mafia putting out a hit on her, Charlie begins the second season (starting 8 May, 9pm, Sky Max) on the lam once more, only now goons with guns keep popping up and shooting at her. For what could have been a high-concept show, Poker Face is surprisingly fuss-free about all of this, and barely lets a violent mob-based subplot get in the way of what Charlie does best. That is, wandering around small-town America, working out who is a killer and how/why they did it, then exposing them for their terrible crimes. She has to dodge bullets on occasion, sure, but she always keeps her eyes on the prize: coughing out the word “bullshit” and cracking the case.Poker Face is created byKnives Outdirector Rian Johnson and, much like that franchise, it has become a place for A-listers to cut loose and be daft. The first episode featuresCynthia Erivo, and to get its money’s worth the show has her playing quintuplets, former child stars contesting the will of their recently deceased evil momager. Later, Katie Holmes pops up as the frustrated wife of a morbid funeral director, played by Breaking Bad’s Giancarlo Esposito, and Kumail Nanjiani goes all-in as an award-winning Florida cop who also happens to be a lot like the Tiger King, Joe Exotic. Best of all, Rhea Perlman returns as mob boss Beatrix Hasp, and she works so well with Lyonne that it’s a shame they couldn’t have done the whole season together.There is a long-standing debate about whether comedy ever gets the praise it deserves. Funny films rarely win Oscars; funny shows regularly get pushed out of best comedy categories by “comedy” series that aren’t actually very funny at all (cough, The Bear). So it is immensely enjoyable to watch something like Poker Face, which is television of serious quality and precision that opts for comedy, wordplay and slapstick over the arid melancholy of serious drama. And while most TV likes to think it’s about the underdog, Poker Face actually walks the walk. Charlie’s life on the run rarely takes her to big cities. She tours towns and rural areas, working her way through the gig economy, getting by as an apple-picker, a car park attendant, even a corpse for hire. The only downside to season two is that it’s gone a bit industry: there are a couple of meta episodes about film sets and TV stars, but even when it goes there, it at least makes the story about the crew and the people doing the gruntwork.Much like the shows it pays tribute to – Columbo and Murder, She Wrote – each episode of Poker Face works as a standalone story, with its own murder to solve, though it does take three episodes to wrap up last season’s cliffhanger and push off in its own direction. When it does, the story gets even sillier. It’s a rare show that makes you scribble down notes such as “meth alligator”, “shrimp-flavoured Vienna sausage” and “explosive vape”. The love of puzzles that fuelled the Knives Out whodunnits appears here, but it inverts the premise. It shows us who did it at the start, so there’s no mystery in that respect. The pleasure is in working backwards, and filling in the Charlie-based gaps, so we can figure out how she figures it out.Lyonne and her swagger make Poker Face cool but, fundamentally, it’s Jonathan Creek with a love of 70s cinema – and I mean that as a compliment. Stylish and nerdy, witty and clever, it is rock-solid, hard-working entertainment.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Since being spiked with LSD back in the 1960s, which also influenced his distinct take on left-fieldsoul music, the 82-year-old says he could still feel the impacts of it up until just a few years ago. “I was paranoid of crowds and paranoid of being alone,” he says. “I had high anxiety and could be sitting in a room with you and if I looked at you long enough, you’d start looking like some kind of monster.”For a long period of time it was only through the help and support of his late wife that he was able to hold it together. “I didn’t trust but one person in life, and that was Yvonne,” he says. “I wouldn’t do anything without her. She’s why I’m still alive. Yvonne was my god.” There are similarly touching sentiments expressed about her in the offbeat, funny and strangely poignant newdocumentaryabout the cult artist and his curious world: Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted.‘He lived his whole life in that fire’: the tragic story of ‘lost’ singer Jackson C FrankRead moreSwamp Dogg is a musician like few others. Part golden-voiced crooner, part experimental satirist, part flat-out oddball, he has made music that spans soul, rock, country, disco, R&B and Auto-Tune boogie. Growing up in Virginia, he cut his first record when he was just 12 as Little Jerry Williams. He did A&R and production work for major labels and went on to write songs for Gene Pitney, Doris Duke and Johnny Paycheck. Feeling burned out, unfairly treated and frustrated by the industry, as well as chemically altered from his LSD experiences, he rebranded as Swamp Dogg in 1970. From then on he embarked on a much more singular musical trajectory that fused the madcap peculiarities of Frank Zappa with a deep love of old school soul and country.Since then he has worked withBon Iver, been a manager and mentor to the World Class Wreckin’ Cru, which featured a youngDr Dre, and he’s sold novelty records of dogs singing – well, barking – Beatles songs to pet shops in Spain. His record covers – such as him stuffing himself naked inside a giant hot dog – regularly feature on lists ofworst ever album sleeves. The album cover to 1971’s Rat On!, of him riding a giant white rat, is also painted on the bottom of his swimming pool (hence the name of the film). And there is also a recent cookbook he’s written that he describes as “an idea 50 years in the making”. If You Can Kill It I Can Cook It features soul food recipes such as Baked Beans Bo Diddley.“I guess I do feel like I am eccentric,” he says with a chuckle when asked if he agrees with the description that often follows him around. “Although I pull back on a lot of things that I know are crazier than a motherfucker.”Pulling back is something that doesn’t always come easily to Swamp Dogg. Back in the 1970s he joined Jane Fonda’s anti-VietnamFree the Army tourand he feels it set him back years in the industry. “I’m trying not to be as political,” he says. “I’m still a little political but not as much because it backfired. It got me thrown off of Elektra records and that’s what stopped people from wanting to do live interviews with me on radio and television.” Does he have any regrets about how he approached that? “I would do it the same again but I would do it harder,” he says. “But with more backup this time. Because before it was like I called a meeting and nobody showed up for it.”I’m happy that I’ve stayed true to myself. And I’ve got a lot of faith in what I do and I want to leave a hell of a legacyDespite a turbulent career that, for the most part, has seen him confined to the fringes, he feels like he’s landed in a sweet spot when it comes to carving out a space from autonomy and idiosyncrasy. He remains prolific too, having released three albums in the last five years. “More people seem to know me now than ever before and I still feel like I’m cooking,” he says. “Some concerts I play and I see all these people coming in and [there’s that many] it’s like they must be thinking Snoop Dogg is going to be here. I love the audience so much. I’m so happy to play for them. It makes me want to work like a motherfucker.”So what keeps him so motivated and hard-working at an age when many, after 70 years in the industry, would gladly be thinking about retirement? “Poverty,” he says, bluntly. “I think about poverty and I get dizzy. Laying in bed watching television, and all of a sudden, you realise I ain’t had no money coming in for a couple of months. That drives me. The thought of being poor makes me want to work because being poor will get your ass no matter what age you are. There’s no sympathy for octogenarians.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photo courtesy of Magnolia PicturesOne of the really moving elements about the documentary is the domestic situation that he has at home. In a neighbourhood in Los Angeles where they joke that all the porn films are shot, he has neighbours such as Johnny Knoxville and Mike Judge who swing by, and he lives with his friends and musical collaborators Guitar Shorty and MoogStar. “Guitar Shorty came here for a couple of months and it turned into 18 years,” he says. Swamp Dogg never charged him a penny in rent. “Because I’ve been there,” he says. “I’ve slept on people’s couches and on their front porch and all that kind of shit. I’ve been all the way down to the bottom. But I would always find a way out because I don’t like not having nice things, even when you can’t afford them.” One such example of this tendency is illustrated in the film when he was at the peak of success and owned nine cars. “I thought the world would become mine,” he reflects of that period.Borrowed Time: Lennon’s Last Decade review – reverential reminiscence takes its timeRead moreYou get a sense that the company and camaraderie of his pals, bandmates and housemates have replaced the deep loss felt over his wife. He concurs with this, before joking: “and they also never looked like monsters to me”. Sadly, Guitar Shorty has since died, along with another friend and collaborator, John Prine, who also appears in the film. “I guess I’m next,” he says. “But I’m trying to walk a straight line and do the things that keep me healthy and my mind, and my whole being, happy. I try to eat right, don’t drink, don’t do drugs …” he stops himself. “Damn, you might say I’m boring as a motherfucker.”In reality, Swamp Dogg is anything but. And you get the sense that he is starting to realise that embracing eccentricity, and making music purely on his own terms, while forging a truly unique career path, has perhaps paid dividends. “I’m happy that I’ve stayed true to myself,” he says. “And I’ve got a lot of faith in what I do and I want to leave a hell of a legacy. That’s why I cut so many albums. I’ll take a shot and hope it works out. It seems to be working.”Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted is out in Los Angeles cinemas on 2 May and in New York City on 9 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsMusicDocumentary filmsSoulMusic documentaryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

This Korean staple is traditionally made by salting cabbage to preserve it and add crunch, then fermenting it in a pungent paste often made from glutinous rice porridge,gochugaru(Korean chilli flakes), onion and enough garlic to keep a vampire at bay. Fish sauce is another common addition, as is, sometimes, even raw seafood such as crab or squid, but most kimchi sold in the UK is plant-based, and so appeals to a much wider audience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The magic behind kimchi lies in the lactic acid bacteria naturally present on vegetables. These beneficial microbes are encouraged to thrive during fermentation, creating the complex, tangy flavours and deep umami that make kimchi so distinctive. All kimchi brings bold flavour, but only raw, unpasteurised ones deliver the probiotic benefits that come from live fermentation, so look for the words “raw” and “unpasteurised” on the label. Gochugaru, meanwhile, is what gives kimchi its signature vermilion hue. The brightness of its red-orange colour is a good visual cue as to how much chilli has been used and, as a result, how spicy the kimchi is.The UK has welcomed kimchi with open arms, and its popularity has soared, with many local home-based producers now crafting freshly fermented, small-batch kimchi alongside those from the classic Korean brands. According to the statistics portal Statista, the value of South Korea’s kimchi exports has more than doubled in the past decade, a sure sign of its growing global appeal. For this review, I tasted a mixture of renowned Korean brands and small, UK-based fermenters, rating them primarily on flavour. A great kimchi should be boldly tangy from the lactic acid fermentation, balanced by a subtle natural sweetness from ingredients such as carrot and rice flour. Texture matters, too – I look for a satisfying crunch throughout – as, of course, does funk: kimchi should have a sweet-sour aroma with depth and character, without veering into raw brassica territory.The best kimchiBest all-rounder:Ollie’s kimchiView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 350g at Ollie’s Kimchi£6.50 for 350g at That Fat Cow★★★★★Bold and punchy, with a bright red colour and chunky cut, this is slow-fermented for extra depth and complexity. It’s vegan and boosted with umami from soy sauce and miso, which add balanced sweetness alongside the carrots. Full and well-rounded: tangy, savoury and umami-rich, with a satisfying, medium-hot heat. Even with the longer fermentation, the texture holds up well, offering a decent bite. This is well seasoned, has big flavour and hits that sweet spot between funk and freshness. A big, full-flavoured jar that delivers. I’ve named it the best all-rounder because it’s the cheapest of the well-fermented local varieties.Best splurge:The Cultured Collective classic kimchiView image in fullscreen£5 for 250g at Ocado★★★★★A vivid, glossy kimchi with serious crunch and a bright lactic fizz that makes it one of the most satisfying and flavourful out there. This UK-made non-vegan one includes fish sauce and rice flour, lending it a deeper umami complexity and a gentle sweetness that sets it apart. Well-structured and vibrant, with a satisfying bite throughout, especially in the crunchy cabbage stalks. Delivers on flavour, too: medium-to-hot spice, a bold fermented aroma, punchy garlic notes and a well-seasoned balance of salt and tang. A standout jar that’s alive, expressive and deeply moreish.Best bargain:Jongga Mat kimchiView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 80g at Hmart★★★★☆This classic Korean kimchi brand, founded in 1987, offers a mellow, approachable, gentle heat, soft bite and well-balanced flavour. Brilliant red-orange and glossy, it’s coated in a thick sauce (thanks to thickener E415), with no MSG, high-fructose corn syrup or preservatives (unlike some larger commercial brands). It contains added lactic acid bacteria to support fermentation, and while it’s not the liveliest, it still delivers a pleasant tang, with a clean and savoury flavour, a subtle sweetness and just enough heat to keep things interesting.And the rest …Mr Kimchi traditional kimchiView image in fullscreen£12.90 for 2 x 330g jars at Mr Kimchi£23.80 for 3 x 330g jars at Amazon★★★★★This is delivered fresh, allowing you to ferment it in your own kitchen – a brilliant way to explore the simplicity and rewards of fermentation. I tried the traditional Korean recipe made with fish sauce and glutinous rice flour, though Mr Kimchi also hasa vegan version. It delivers an authentic Korean experience, freshly made in the UK, allowing for a proper ferment that deepens flavour. Satisfyingly crunchy, with a vivid, red colour, and the generous amount of gochugaru brings a lively medium heat. Vibrant, garlicky and with a well-balanced, tangy acidity. Rice flour adds a mild natural sweetness that rounds things off beautifully.Jamie Ferments kimchiView image in fullscreen£8.50 for 450g at Jamie Ferments★★★★★Bursting with life, quite literally. When I opened the jar, it fizzed and popped with activity, a sign of a raw, unpasteurised ferment at its peak. I tasted the vegan and traditional versions and found them equally delicious. The vegan version swaps fish sauce for a mix of soy sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds, which brings a lovely, nutty depth. It has a vivid red hue, is glossy, crunchy and well-structured, with a bright, expressive flavour: clean lactic acidity, mellow umami, a medium heat and a gentle natural sweetness from the rice flour. A joyful, fizzy ferment with loads of character – one of the best on the shelf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

While flavour comes first, minimal processing is important, too, because it helps to preserve the beneficial bacteria cultivated through fermentation. Raw and alive, it delivers a gentle fizz, mellow aftertaste and gentle heat. The orange liquor is light, but has good coverage. This kimchi is well-structured, chunky and has a satisfying crunch. It has a mild to medium spice level, soft tang and a hint of natural sweetness from the fermenting veg. Fresh, young – perhaps the result of a short ferment – and a little shy of funk for lovers of bold kimchi, but a great place to start for the uninitiated.Bibigo sliced kimchiView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 150g at Sainsbury’s£2 for 150g at Ocado★★★☆☆Bold, glossy and with great flavour and a satisfying crunch that holds up despite its long shelf life. Made by South Korean brand Bibigo, it’s less lively than some, but still has a slight fizz of fermentation. The thick, orange paste coats the well-structured slices evenly, giving them a polished appearance. The flavour is balanced and punchy – medium-spiced, with a noticeable tang, mellow umami, and just the right level of saltiness to enhance rather than overwhelm. Its more complex ingredients list includes calcium lactate and xanthan gum, which may rule it out for wholefood lovers, but it delivers on taste and texture.Biona organic kimchiView image in fullscreen£5.20 for 350g at Ocado£5.20 for 350g at Tesco★★★☆☆A solid, minimally processed, long-life vegan kimchi made using organic ingredients and without preservatives. Mild yet satisfying, with a yellow-orange hue, medium to mild spice and a very subtle lactic fizz (though I assume it’s pasteurised). For a long-life product, it retains some crunch and a pleasant texture. The mild, tangy sourness and balanced acidity add depth, while the less traditional addition of tomato brings umami and a slight Campbell’s soup aroma.Vadasz raw kimchiView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 400g at Ocado£4.50 for 400g at Tesco★★★☆☆A bright orange-red, raw vegan kimchi with a fine cut and glossy coating that makes it ideal as a topping – think burger, sandwich or toastie. Has a rounded, mellow umami, a gentle fizz and balanced tang. Mild to medium spice levels and, while it’s on the saltier side, the seasoning enhances rather than overwhelms. It has a medium bite that’s not super-crunchy but is still satisfying, with a subtle sweetness and tomato-like aroma that give it a softer, more accessible character. A solid fridge staple with versatility.Yutaka Korean kimchiView image in fullscreen£2.45 for 200g at Morrisons£3.50 for 200g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆A minimally processed, long-life product that’s perfect for adding a gentle kick to midweek meals. This vegan kimchi has just a whisper of fermentation fizz and a fleeting tang. The flavour is mellow – mildly sour and sweet, low in umami, with understated heat and salt. Its soft orange hue and thin sauce reflect a light touch on the chilli, while its small to medium chopped pieces hold a satisfying bite, though they fall short of a full crunch. Subtle in aroma and softly spoken in character, this is a calm condiment rather than a fiery ferment.Explore more on these topicsKorean food and drinkThe food filterFoodPickling, fermenting and preservingVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

(Your typical 10-minute cleansing and moisturising routine can only fix so much when it comes to evening out skin tone.) That is, until I discovered Relevant’s Lights Out mask, which you apply at night and leave on while you sleep for an overnight glow-up. It quenches your skin and leaves everything a bit more even and radiant.Murray Clark,seniorstyleeditor, British GQAnti-frizz shampoo and conditionerView image in fullscreenDavines Love Smoothing Anti Frizz Duo£47.50 for 2 x 250ml at Luxurious Look£47.95 for 2 x 250ml at AmazonAs someone with thick hair that can get frizzy, I’ve tried lots of hydrating, de-frizzing shampoos and conditioners. Some helped, but none worked like this shampoo and conditioner from Davines. I have used them for a few years now, and they have transformed the quality of my hair in a way I didn’t think was possible. They make my hair manageable as they are super hydrating and de-frizz like magic, even in London weather, which is no small feat.They are made using quality ingredients, and you can really feel it in the texture. They are also cruelty-free, which is important to me. I will continue using them for ever.Dr Federica Amati,nutritionalscientist and author ofEvery Body Should Know ThisMicellar waterView image in fullscreenBioderma Sensibiomicellarwaterfor sensitiveskin£10.40 for 250ml at Boots£13 for 250ml at SephoraThe ultimate multitasker for sensitive skin. I discovered it during the peak YouTube beauty blogger era in the 2010s,when everyone was French pharmacy obsessed, and it’s been a gamechanger ever since. Many micellar waters have caused breakouts for me, but this has not. Its gentle micellar technology effortlessly removes makeup, dirt and sunscreen without stripping the skin. Nor will it make your eyes burn. With soothing ingredients like cucumber extract and a pH that respects the skin barrier, it leaves my face clean, calm and refreshed. It’s so gentle and is even perfect for when my skin is sensitised from retinol overuse.Dr Ewoma Ukeleghe,cosmetic doctor and beauty contributor for ElleVitamin C serumView image in fullscreenSkin RocksThe Antioxidant£70 for 30ml at Skin Rocks£70 for 30ml at Space NKI’m big on vitamin C, in food and skincare. It’s essential for collagen production, skin repair and overall health, but for years I couldn’t find a topical version that worked for me. Most were too harsh for my sensitive skin, leaving it irritated or breaking out. Then I went on Caroline Hirons’ podcast, and she gave me a bottle of Skin Rocks The Antioxidant serum. From the first use, I could tell it was different. No stinging, no redness – my skin just looked bright and even. Now I use it every morning after cleansing, followed by moisturiser and SPF. It has been the gentlest and most effective vitamin C serum I’ve tried, and I recommend it to anyone who’s struggled to find one that works.Emily English, nutritionist and author ofLive to EatShea butterView image in fullscreenEléngé shea butter£50 for 350ml at EléngéI’m someone who seeks out skincare products that are as natural as possible and feed my skin nutrients because it doesn’t react well to lots of harsh chemicals. I heard about Eléngé’s shea butter when a friend said it had helped to clear up her son’s eczema. It’s the best shea butter I’ve tried, and I have tried so many before, including lotions and creams. I’ve used it daily for about five years, all over my body, and my skin absolutely loves it. I rave about it all the time. It’s moisturising and goes a long way.Portia Ferrari, model, beauty editor and yoga instructorTopical retinoidView image in fullscreenDifferin 0.1%adapalene(prescription only)£28 for 45g at Boots Online Doctor£29.95 for 45g at the Independent PharmacyI have what I call clog-prone skin. I’ve always had mild to moderate breakouts of flesh-coloured bumps, often triggered by using skincare and makeup products. In 2020, I used a moisturiser that gave me clogged pores. I started looking into retinoids, which I had previously disregarded because I was 24, and they have a strong association with older skin. They’re actually primarily an acne treatment. I decided to try them.I started with a strong over-the-counter retinoid, 0.1% retinaldehyde. Retinaldehyde requires fewer “steps” to convert into retinoic acid when it’s on the skin. This makes it work faster, but means it can be more irritating. After using 0.1% retinaldehyde for two years, I decided to try tretinoin 0.015%, which is a prescription-only retinoid. While I liked it, I found it irritated my skin, so I moved to adapalene (commonly known as Differin), which is still prescription-strength but is known to be less irritating.If I have a breakout now, I don’t have to endure it for long because the retinoid speeds up the skin cell cycle, so anything that happens to your skin is over much faster. It’s like having your foot on the gas for skin cell turnover: scarring goes away faster, spots go away faster, spots don’t happen as much in the first place. As a result, you get fresher skin. Since using adapalene, my skin has just got better and better.Natalie O’Neill,beauty content creatorBody lotionView image in fullscreenGarnier Body Repair 24H Restoring lotion£2.99 for 400ml at Superdrug£2.99 for 400ml at AmazonThis incredible body lotion is my most used skincare product ofall time. I’ve lost count of how many bottles I’ve got through. It has been around for 25 years, and my mum and nana used it almost as evangelically as I do. I cover myself in the stuff every morning, and it nourishes, smooths and conditions my skin without any stickiness. I’ve tried hundreds of body products on the market, from budget to luxurious, and this is the one I always return to. It’s light and absorbs quickly, so you don’t get a greasy residue that stops you getting dressed, and it isn’t overly scented. For about a fiver, you can’t go wrong.Caroline Hirons, aesthetician, writer and founder ofSkin RocksBreathing balmView image in fullscreenWater Meadow Breathing Balm£25 for 100ml at Liberty£55 for 100ml at BertioliWhen I visited Thyme, a hotel and spa in the Cotswolds, I discovered its Bertioli products, including the Water Meadow Breathing Balm. In all honesty, I slightly rolled my eyes: I grew up in India, where pranayama (the breath work that is a crucial part of yoga practice) is fundamental and powerful; I couldn’t imagine needing an accessory of any kind to support it. That is, until I popped open the lid and took a deep breath – the fragrance of mint and thyme soothes and calms me, virtually transporting me to an English garden. It’s an immediate connection to nature via scent. And it’s addictive. Nothing can compare with yoga for grounding the mind, body and soul, but this little jar of breathing balm is a great hack for when you’re just too tired or jet-lagged, or need a pick-me-up on a long flight or car journey.Divia Thani,globaleditorialdirector,Condé NastTravelerCalm patchesView image in fullscreenCalm Patches£15 for 10 at Ross J Barr£15 for 10 at Victoria HealthA life-affirming addition to my daily wellness toolkit.

I wear them on flights for reassurance; when watching TV to maximise chill; or even if I need to sit down to write a feature and focus – they get me in the zone.

I’d had access to all sorts of skincare as a fashion model, but this liquid exfoliant,containing 5% glycolic acid, was in a new league. It’s supercharged skincare that gives me an instant glow, an overnight facial – all of the cliches, but completely justified in this case. I still use this 15 years on (you can now get it with added vitamin C, which brightens skin and protects it from pollutants), and have lost track of the times I’ve recommended it to friends and family.

During my three pregnancies, though, I found a concoction that did. I used Palmer’s coconut oil and cocoa butter body lotion, mixing the products in one hand before applying to the skin on my abdomen twice daily. It took a bit of time, but it was so worth it. I carried particularly big with my third son, but to this day do not have any stretch marks on my stomach.Emma Coleman, aestheticianInfrared face maskView image in fullscreenLED Light Therapy Face Mask Series 1£299.99 at CurrentBody£299.99 at AmazonBear with me. I appreciate that at almost £300, this infrared light-emitting face mask is expensive, but it is designed to reduce signs of ageing, saving you money on expensive facial interventions like Botox, laser or microneedling. I just wear it four times a week for 10 minutes, and it leaves me looking fresh every day in a way that even my multi-step anti-ageing skincare routine never has. My skin is plumper, fine lines are reduced, and my face looks more youthful.Nahid de Belgeonne, author ofSoothe: TheBookYourNervousSystemHasBeenLongingForCleansing balmView image in fullscreenPro-Collagen CleansingBalmFrom £29 for 50g at Elemis£39.20 for 100g at Look FantasticIt is such a luxurious, nourishing cleanser and brings out the glow in my skin. What’s really innovative, though, is the range of aromatic fragrances it comes in: lavender,mint,green fig,black cherry, androse, my all-time favourite. As you scoop the product up and bring it to your face, it feels like an at-home spa cleanse rather than a functional skincare routine step. It has changed and redefined what I expect from a cleanser.Laura Sheridan, ChampneysgroupspadirectorBenzoyl peroxideView image in fullscreenAcnecide Face Gel£7.49 for 15g at Look Fantastic£9.99 for 15g at BootsAs a dermatologist, I often recommend the over-the-counter treatment Acnecide (benzoyl peroxide 5%) to patients with acne-prone skin. It’s a gamechanger because, whereas other non-prescription treatments focus on exfoliation or oil control, this one treats the root cause of acne by killing the bacteria responsible (Cutibacteriumacnes). It’s relatively gentle. Many of my patients have struggled with spots for years, only to see dramatic improvements within weeks of using it. I have acne and keep a tube in my bathroom drawer to use between cleansing and moisturising when I have a breakout. A small amount on the affected areas, lightly rubbed in, is all you need.Dr Anjali Mahto, consultant dermatologist and founder ofSelf LondonSupplementsView image in fullscreenNAD+Optima Max dietary supplement£179.99 for 90 tablets at NAD DirectNAD+ has been transformative, dramatically improving my focus, reducing fatigue, and enhancing overall wellbeing.

They’re self-heating scented eye masks, and I love to use them at the end of a busy day when I’m tired. They’re totally different from anything else I’ve ever tried. Sometimes, I put them on in the bath and feel as if I’m having a relaxing spa experience. Because they’re heated, there have been times I’ve even used them on the back of my neck as a heat compress. I find they’re affordable, and each one of the four scents has different benefits. I’ve not found a better tool to help me let go of the stresses of my day.

Prince, my long-legged tabby, was at war with Stanley, my housemate’s much smaller, black and white cat. While Stanley just sat around, comfortable and insouciant, Prince was furiously, ineffectively, trying to mark some territory. The best spot for this, he felt, was the new carpet just below the cat flap. The house was soon dominated by the smell of cat piss, wet carpet and the sound of giant fan dryers.So I moved, with my cat, to one last share house, then bought a house in Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. This was 25 years ago, when a single woman without much money buying her own home did not seem outlandish.I was commuting to work in Sydney, getting home at 9.30pm and getting up at 6am to do it all again. I had achieved my goal, but I was utterly exhausted.I should have spent time looking for a local job but I was drawn to an online dating site instead, because that seemed easier and more fun.‘It’s some sort of cosmic joke’: Tracy Sorensen wrote a book about surviving cancer. Now it has returnedRead moreThat’s how I met Steve. He was a national parks ranger based in Bathurst, a further 1.5 hours west of where I lived. Our first meeting in a Katoomba cafe was top secret. It was 2002 and online dating still carried a lot of stigma.I already knew – it was in his profile, just text, no pictures – that he wore thick glasses and was bald on the top of his head with a thin ponytail at the back. I’d found his self-description funny and refreshing after scrolling through samey walking-on-the-beach profiles.For our second date, we went on a bushwalk. I found myself looking at his well-shaped calves, no doubt from walking up and down trails.Afterwards, we sat on my back verandah as the light faded. I thought he’d be impressed by my bit of the bush, where birds – magpies, currawongs, sulphur-crested cockatoos, the odd galah couple – swooped past or sat on the railing. But Steve was seeing something else. The house and surrounding bush added up to a serious fire danger.Within weeks, fire was lapping at the bush not far from my house. I had a backpack of essentials, plus the cat cage, ready beside the door.I was dithering. Should I stay or should I go?A knock at the door. I thought it might be emergency services with some clear advice. But it was Steve in his national parks uniform. He wasn’t officially on duty in this location, but he’d been waved through the roadblocks. My own personal fireman!The cat and I didn’t have to evacuate. Steve went to work clearing the gutters and hosing the back of the house. The fire began to behave itself, not coming up the creek line as my neighbours and I had feared.A few weeks later, Steve was back again at my place. I had four pet chickens that were good layers but susceptible to scaly leg mite (SLM). My handsome glossy black chook had developed crusty, gnarly legs, her skin cracked with deep ravines. One way to treat this was to slather the legs of the bird with Vaseline.When I mentioned the SLM to Steve, he sprung into action. I held my black chook to stop her from struggling while he worked the Vaseline, giving each leg a nice thick coating to kill the mites by depriving them of air to breathe. Treating chicken lice is messy and difficult, with no obvious heroic vibes. It was clear to me that Steve was a safe pair of hands, whether wielding a jar of Vaseline or a fire hose. I was charmed.View image in fullscreen‘Steve may have been safe, but he was never boring’ … Tracy and Steve at the Royal Bathurst Show in 2002.Photograph: Ali FoleyI moved in with Steve towards the end of 2003, about a year after we’d met.Steve continued as a ranger. I got used to receiving messages stating “All ops normal” sent out automatically to spouses when rangers were doing dangerous stuff such as being winched into fires from a helicopter. I encountered a possum in the freezer: Steve said it was roadkill, but in good condition, so he was going to send it to the taxidermist. I was delighted by all of this, and learning a lot. Steve may have been safe, but he was never boring. I found work at the local newspaper and teaching journalism at the local university. We travelled to Europe, South America, India and made our way around Australia, camping.The moment I knew: I thought I was too cool for love. My rock idol knew better | Trent DaltonRead moreIn 2010, I discovered I had the BRCA1 gene mutation; I had risk-reducing surgery (breasts and ovaries removed), then got ovarian cancer anyway, in 2014. I had 8.5 years’ remission beforethe cancer came back in 2023. This has been hard, but Steve has been steadfast. I knew he would be, from the moment he smeared Vaseline over the legs of an unhappy chicken.And Prince? He died of kidney failure a couple of months after I moved to Bathurst. He was a little bugger, but I’ll always thank him for nudging me in a westerly direction.Tracy Sorensen is the author ofThe Lucky GalahandThe Vitals(Pan Macmillan)Tell us the moment you knewShare your experienceDo you have a romantic realisation you'd like to share?

I thought of myself as a digital nutritionist.”In an interview with the Guardian, Regehr said she supported school smartphone bans and the growing campaign for a smartphone-free childhood, but these were not enough alone and more education was needed to help families think critically about their digital choices.“Because even if you hold off giving a kid a smartphone until after they are 15, they will turn 16. And we have a responsibility to give them the tools they need to navigate this space effectively,” she said. “We do need to provide them with education about how these things work.”Her book, subtitled “Why we’re all addicted to screens and what you can do about it”, is designed to help fill that gap, and will be accompanied by new educational materials that will be introduced in schools later this month.Almost all schools in England have nowbanned mobile phone useby pupils in school hours, according to the first national survey on the subject, commissioned by Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England.Prompted by concerns about the effect on children’s mental health, attention span and online safety, the survey of more than 15,000 schools found that 99.8% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools had some form of ban.“I support the work of Smartphone Free Childhood,” said Regehr, who is programme director of digital humanities at UCL and has previously researched how algorithms used by social media platforms are rapidlyamplifying extreme misogynistic content. “My fear is that when you implement a ban, it can let schools and legislators off the hook because they think the job is done.”Regehr’s book is dedicated to her two young daughters. “My goal is for my kids to look back on our generation as wildly unhealthy and tech-enslaved, just as we look back on a generation previous smoking in hospital delivery rooms and not wearing seatbelts.“I am trying to make a cultural change so that their lives are better. This is the biggest threat to their health and wellbeing, and it’s something that I want to tackle and I believe we can see a cultural change. People just need the information.”Smartphone Nation: Why We’re All Addicted to Screens and What You Can Do About It by Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is published by Bluebird on 15 MayExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaChildrenParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

There are 20 spent orange halves on the worktop, and an inch of juice in a glass below the squeezer.“Is it working?” I say.“Sort of,” says the middle one.“I might have bought the wrong kind of oranges,” my wife says.“Did you buy wax ones?” I say.Twelve hours later, I find myself alone. My wife has decided, with very little warning, to take a train to Dorset to stay with a friend. Everyone else has already packed off. The house is empty, apart from the animals lying on the kitchen floor watching my every move. I can’t remember the last time this happened to me; it must have been more than a year ago.I don’t mind spending time alone, but I can’t pretend I’m good at it. Within 45 minutes I am talking to myself. Anything over 48 hours and I start to eat with my hands.But whenever I’m obliged to spend a fixed period alone, a bigger problem presents itself: I don’t know how to use the time. Sitting in my office shed, I find myself paralysed by indecision.It’s not as if I have no options. I have too many options – tax paperwork, minor home repairs, unanswered emails. I could clean my office – an annual event now three years overdue. I could cut the grass, but I won’t get any credit for that.I leave my office, cross the overgrown lawn, step into the kitchen and look around. Three lounging animals raise their heads.I’m sitting in my office holding a banjo while watching global financial indices plummet in real time. A ringside seat to the end of the worldI could, I think, try to find a more long-term solution to the dishwasher problem – there’s something wrong with the door latch, so it only works if you seal it shut with packing tape first.“But in a way, that is a long-term solution,” I say, to no one, “because I’ve got plenty of packing tape.” The new dog thumps its tail against the floor twice.“I’m not talking to you, of course,” I say. “But this door thing, it’s such a stupid problem. Why can’t my problems be more intelligent?”“Miaow,” says the cat.“I didn’t mean to open up the floor for debate,” I say. “I was just passing through.”I could have a bath, I think, or read the book group book, or both. I could choose one of the five Scandinavian drama series I am currently halfway through watching, and finish it off in one sitting. I could, I remind myself, just return to my office and do some actual work – it is, after all, 3pm on a Tuesday. But work is my primary excuse for being unavailable to do other things. If no one’s here to make demands on me, what’s the point?The old dog stands, sneezes, and pees on the floor at my feet.“Great,” I say, lifting the dog and depositing it in the garden.After cleaning up the piss, I end up back in my office sitting at my desk, holding a banjo but not playing it, while watching global financial indices plummet in real time. This has become my default hobby: a ringside seat to the end of the world.I receive a text from a language app suggesting that now might be a good time for an Italian lesson.“It’s been two years,” I say.I get an email from my accountant, asking for my now very overdue tax paperwork.“Ugh,” I say. “The pressure.”My wife sends me a picture of four seedlings sitting in a box at some kind of country garden sale.Her text says: “Do you want these?”I answer: “What are they?”“Some kind of bean,” she writes.“Yes please,” I write. There is a pause in our communication. On my computer screen, various financial indicators are performing a synchronised dive in slow motion.“Sorry we’d already left,” my wife writes.I think: I could plant my own seedlings, or get to the fish shop before it closes, or do those stretches for my back. The new dog sticks its head round the door and yawns performatively.“I’m actually right in the middle of something,” I say.The dog enters, pushes its snout under my left elbow and lifts.“We can go for a walk in a minute,” I  say. “But as I’ve explained before, I’m an important businessman, and I …”“Miaow,” says the cat, from the doorway.“THIS IS MY TIME,” I say.Explore more on these topicsLife and styleThe Tim Dowling columnfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As you delve into the layers of almond sponge, ganache and buttercream that form the opera cake, you may see how it was inspired by the ornate balconies of thePalais Garnieropera house; while the Paris-Brest, a wheel-shaped choux, was first made in 1910 to commemorate the famously brutal cycle race. Seek out a rum baba – a brioche-like treat soaked in rum‑infused syrup – and you might be told the story of how it was created by Nicolas Stohrer, the chef of the exiled Polish king Stanislas. The patisserie that bears his name has been at51 rue Montorgueilsince 1730 and is officially classed as a historic monument.Among the 21st-century stars of the Parisian pastry scene areCyril Lignac, who makes a sublime caramel eclair;Yann Couvreur, who takes thechouquette(similar to a profiterole) to the next level by filling it with vanilla cream; andCedric Grolet, whosetrompe l’oeilpatisseries are as astonishing to the eye as the taste buds – they look just like the fruits and nuts of their flavours. Those with dietary requirements need not miss out either. Vegans are very well catered for atLand&Monkeys, while there is a huge range of gluten-free cakes, pastries and breads atNoglu.Where to stayThe family-runHotel Saint-Paul Rive Gauchehasdoubles from€198room-only,sawdays.co.ukSaladeniçoisein Vieux NiceView image in fullscreenMaking socca – chickpea-flour pancakes – another speciality of Nice, at Chez Theresa.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyHeaven help anyone who expects to see potatoes and French beans in a salade niçoise whenin Nice; the real thing contains neither (such a suggestion may be met with a“quelle horreur”from a local). There is much debate about what it should contain, however; some Niçois will only use tunaoranchovies, not both, and only canned, not fresh; others insist it should contain a certain kind of olive.While the locals battle it out in their kitchens, you can enjoy the welcoming atmosphere in the family-run restaurants of Vieux Nice, where your only dilemma is what to order. Look out for theCuisine Nissardesign (it shows a woman in a straw hat with a basket of vegetables), which denotes that dishes have been made traditionally with good-quality ingredients. AtRestaurant Acchiardo(mains from €17), the family are proud to tell the story of their Italian great-grandmother Madalin, who walked across the Alps in the early 20th century for a job with an aristocratic English family, and later set up the restaurant. Their salade niçoise includes rocket, basil, tomatoes, artichoke, egg, anchovies and tuna, and makes a great starter before their mains, such as beef fillet “Madalin style”, with anchovies, garlic and parsley. Another must-try dish in Nice is the chickpea-flour pancake socca, which you can buy by the slice atChez Theresa(€3) in the Cours Saleya market, or atChez Pipo(€3.80), and nibble it as you wander around the old town and the port.Where to stayHotel Windsorhasdoubles from€90room-only,hotelwindsornice.comOystersin Bassin d’ArcachonView image in fullscreenChez Boulan, a typical cabane à huître on the Bassin d’Arcachon.Photograph: A GariteaiTrue fans of gourmet bivalves will know that their flavour changes depending on where they grow, which means you can have fun visiting different areas of France to savour them, whether that be Cancale in Brittany or the Étang de Thau near Montpellier.

Order a platter and a glass of chilled white wine, and swig them back as you admire Europe’s tallest sand dune, the Dune de Pilat, across the water.

See if you can shimmy through the narrow gap between the building and the column on the corner of rue Mercière at the start of your trip, because there’s no way you’ll fit through it by the end, especially if you indulge in the city’s signature dish,choucroute garnie. This plate of fermented cabbage topped by different cuts of pork and sausage is a staple on the menus of the city’s traditional wine taverns, orwinstubs, with their gingham tablecloths, carved wooden furniture and excellent wine lists, where you can spend a good part of a day enjoying the cosy atmosphere.Among the best isChez Yvonne(mains from €18.50), which dates from 1873 and later became a favourite of former French president Jacques Chirac, who once invited Boris Yeltsin to dine with him there. For his choucroute, chef Serge Cutillo has carefully chosen each cut of meat from top local butchers. If you want to try a non-pork version, book a table at the ancient restaurantMaison Kammerzell(mains from €20.50), which celebrates its 600th anniversary in 2027 and looks like it comes straight out of a Grimm fairytale. Its speciality is a decadent buttery fish choucroute with halibut, salmon and smoked haddock, which makes a pleasant change from the meat feasts elsewhere, though they serve other versions with meats including confit duck leg (see the Dordogne, below).Where to stayOkko Hotelhasdoubles from€76room-only,okkohotels.comConfit decanardin the DordogneView image in fullscreenConfit de canard in the Dordogne.Photograph: Pauline Cutler/AlamyDishes using ducks and geese have been a staple in the south-west of France since the middle ages and it became particularly easy to rear the birds after maize was brought to France from the Americas and grew easily in the warm climate ofthe Dordogne. The best-loved dish isconfit de canard, in which the legs of a duck (or goose,oiein French) are salted and then cooked and preserved in their own fat. Once reheated, the tender meat just falls off the bone. It features on menus in bistros and restaurants in the region’s villages and towns of honey-coloured stone, such as La Roque-Gageac and Tremolat, where you can find a great version atLe Bistrot de la Place(€28 as part of a three-course meal). The best thing about the dish, though, is that it is easy to take home in tins and jars ready to reheat. Look out for it in the excellent markets at Sarlat-la-Canèda (Wednesday and Saturday) and Issigeac (Sunday). You can also visit producers on their farms; atLa Garrigue Hautethey serve dishes featuring their carefully reared ducks and geese from early June to late September (three-course menus from €28).Where to stayHotel EdwardPremierin the charmingvillageofMonpazierhasdoubles from€97room-only,hoteledward1er.comGâteaunantaisin NantesView image in fullscreenGateau nantais is flavoured with sugar, vanilla and rum.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe city of Nantes has mastered reinvention, with incredible street art installations andLes Machines de L’Île, a cultural project that includes a 12m-high mechanical elephant and ocean-inspired steampunk carousel. Yet its signature cake pays testament to its past as a shipbuilding powerhouse. The city was responsible for building thousands of ships involved in the slave trade, andgâteaunantais, the city’s signature cake, is made with ingredients from the Caribbean, such as sugar, vanilla and rum.

There is also a moving exhibition at theChâteau des ducs de Bretagne, which shows the brutal conditions on the ships. As the name of the chateau suggests, the city also has a historically Breton identity, so it’s a good place to tuck into buckwheat galettes and crêpes – there are good ones at both outposts ofLe Loup, le Renard et la Galette(mains from €13).

In Castelnaudary, people proudly tell a charming tale about its invention during a siege in the course of the hundred years war, during which all available ingredients were piled into a pot for a sustaining meal and the enemy was held at bay. They celebrate it with gusto at theFête du Cassoulet, five days of concerts, parades and eating as much of the stew as you can in the town’s squares and market halls during August. The tourist office also has information about theRoute du Cassoulet, a 170km loop that allows you to find local restaurants and meet duck producers and the craftspeople who make the essentialcassolepot, from which the stew takes its name. It also includes a stop at fellow cassoulet town Carcassonne.At theToulouse à Tablefestival (May-November), meanwhile, you can join in with an attempt to set a world record of serving 3,031 individual pots of cassoulet to enthusiastic diners atLe Grand Banquetin the Jardin du Grand Rond park on 17 May. If you’d rather eat your cassoulet in solitude, pick up a pot at the Marché Victor Hugo to take back to your lodgings. Alternatively, take a food tour withTaste of Toulouseor book into one of the many restaurants that serve it.

Much loved for its gentle heat, it is dried and ground to flavour dishes and products from charcuterie to chocolate, and is used liberally in a local dish calledaxoa(pronounced ah-cho-ah), a stew of chopped veal, onion and peppers, with a warming smoky-sweet flavour. Try it in the village of Espelette itself, at restaurants likeAintzina, which means “long ago” in Basque, where it’s served with crispy garlic potatoes for extra piquancy (mains from €20).Chefs across France love to sprinklepimentin their dishes, and it’s worth taking a jar home to pep up something as simple as scrambled eggs or guacamole. Shops in the village all sell it in powdered form, as well as in jellies, ketchups and sauces, and it’s worth visiting theAtelier du Pimenton the outskirts to find out more about how it’s grown and dried. If you visit in autumn, you’ll see flame-red peppers growing on the neat rows of vines and drying on racks before they’re ground into powder.Where to stayThe welcomingHotel Arrayain thevillageofSarehasdoubles from£110room-only,en.arraya.comTartiflettein the AlpsView image in fullscreenTartiflette is an alpine classic.Photograph: Margouillatphotos/Getty ImagesWhen you’ve been skiing or hiking in the mountains, there’s no better way to refuel than with a serving oftartiflette. This creamy, oven-baked dish, layered with potato, onion, cheese and bacon, is food for the soul and originates in the Aravis mountains, where it was rather unromantically invented in its modern form in the 1980s to promote its key ingredient, Reblochon cheese (though it is based on an 18th-century dish,péla).The story behind the raw cow’s milk cheese, with its soft texture and nutty flavour, is more intriguing. It was first made in the 13th century because, legend has it, mountain-dwelling farmers had to hand over milk to their landlords, and so would not fully milk their cows. They would then do a duplicitous second milking for themselves, with which they’d make the cheese – in old Frenchreblochermeans to squeeze an udder again. The resort ofLe Grand Bornandis in the heart of the Aravis mountains, and so an ideal place to try it.La Ferme du Pépé(mains from €21.50) is set in a cosy farmhouse that dates from 1800 and is proud of itstartifletteand other Savoyard specialities, including fondue and raclette.Where to stayThe cosyHotel Le Deltahasdoubles from€110room-only,hotel-delta74.comPoulet Gaston GérardinDijonView image in fullscreenPoulet Gaston Gerard is the happy result of a culinary accident.Photograph: Image Professionals GmbH/AlamyBurgundy is where you’ll find deeply comforting dishes such as beef bourguignon andoeufsenmeurettes.There are also recipes made with its superior breed of chicken, thepoulet de Bresse, such as coq au vin.

In 1930, Gérard invited Curnonsky, the leading food critic of the time, to dinner, only for his wife to knock a pot of mustard into the pan. In a swift move of culinary ingenuity, she rescued the dish with the help of some cream, white wine and Comté cheese. Curnonsky then named it after her husband. Thankfully, some restaurants in Dijon return the honour to her on their menus. As you would expect from such rich ingredients, it’s quite a wintery dish.

He has joined up, he says, to try to liberate the territory ofUkrainefrom the Russian invaders: “When the thief is coming to your house and you are afraid he might harm you or kill your wife, you will take actions and, if necessary, kill the thief.”The mild spring day, somewhere in Kharkiv region, belies the seriousness of the conversation. Luntik is one of a dozen or so young recruits, all aged between 18 and 24, who have agreed to join Ukraine’s army before the age of 25, at which men can be forcibly mobilised. The lure is a bonus of 1m hryvnia (nearly £18,000), 0% mortgages and a short one-year contract; the scheme, launched in February, is a fresh effort to repopulate Ukraine’s frontline.View image in fullscreenLuntik (centre) and fellow recruits during a training course at the shooting range.View image in fullscreenLuntik is a model recruit for the 92nd brigade, though his family story, like so many others three years into the full-scale Russian invasion, is difficult. His parents died before he grew up and he was raised by foster parents in Lviv. He lost one of his brothers, Serhii, 22, in fighting near Bakhmut earlier in the war, “shot by a bullet in the neck”, but despite this, he says he is not afraid of death. “I didn’t come here to play cat and mouse. I know all the risks. I understand there is a situation where I might not come back” Luntik says.View image in fullscreenYoung recruits of 92nd brigade during training.View image in fullscreenOn today’s frontline, the typical Ukrainian soldier is far older, often in their 40s or 50s, frequently fighting with drones or other technologies that require patience and endurance, not physical strength. For the first two years of the war, the minimum age for potential conscription was 27, the maximum 60. It was lowered to 25, but the Biden and Trump administrations both pressed for it to be lowered to 18, arguing Ukraine was not doing enough to address shortages of personnel.Recruits from the 92ndView image in fullscreenRecruits practising trench assault.View image in fullscreenThough Russia and Ukraine’s armed forces are estimated to be roughly of a similar size – just over 600,000 – the Kremlin can draw on a far larger pool of people, particularly from the country’s poorer regions. Russia’s population, 140.8 million, is roughly four times those remaining in Ukraine (35.6 million). Most of the Ukrainians who were willing to join up and fight did so a long time ago, and many others who have not been drafted would rather leave the country than risk losing their lives in a war that, for all the talk about a ceasefire, continues to grind on.View image in fullscreenOne of the young recruits practising a tactical drill.Though 10,000 young people initially expressed interest, fewer than 500 have signed up,an adviser to Ukraine’s president has said, though a further 1,500 are said to be in the process of doing so. In the past month or so, the country’s best-regarded units have been allowed to recruit young people – “Mum, I joined Azov,” reads a fresh campaign from one – but it is not clear this has much of a positive impact on numbers either, raising the question of why the extra money and short tour of duty has not proved particularly attractive.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr takes a short break during training.Volodymyr is 22, going on 23, he says, and is another of the new recruits. He says he wanted to join the army because “if my children ask me some day: ‘Dad what were you doing during the war?’ I just want to have a proper answer for them. I want them to understand I was defending my country, the same as our fathers.” But he acknowledges that even though he was keen to sign up, it took a while and the new scheme for him to do so.Before the war, Volodymyr spent time as a DJ between the ages of 16 and 18, followed by a short spell working in construction in Volyn region, which borders Poland to the west. After the full-scale invasion, he signed on for a territorial defence unit based there, but realised there was no prospect of the war coming to his part of the country. Wanting to do more, he tried to join the Third Assault Brigade, but said he was talked out of it by friends. “They said if you go there you might die soon,” and so he hesitated until the new contact offer arrived.View image in fullscreenYoung recruits getting ready.View image in fullscreenOleksiy Moskalenko, an analyst at the Come Back Alive foundation, which provides support to Ukraine’s military, said that young people were often subject to a lot of pressure from friends and family, and the long years of war made it clear to people that “it is easy to lose your life”. In February, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that 46,000 Ukrainians had been killed and 390,000 wounded and there is no shortage of stories of newly trained soldiers losing their lives within days or weeks of reaching the frontline, sometimes on hopelessly risky missions.View image in fullscreenA pensive moment for a young soldier.But Moskalenko also argues that “younger people were more disconnected from the public discourse” because blotting out the war in their minds is “a strategy to survive – it’s rational to distance yourself from it”. At a lower intensity, Ukraine’s war with Russia has been running since 2014, he adds, meaning it has always been part of the background of young people’s lives. It helps, he adds, that “it is always an option to hide, to run, or find other ways not to be recruited” – though Ukraine is trying to make it harder for adult men to leave the country.The young recruits say they are not expecting to be sent to the frontline until June. Luntik will be in a reconnaissance unit, he says, while Volodymyr has been earmarked for a more dangerous infantry role, where combat life expectancy can be short. Both say they expect to rejoin the military after they serve their initial year, albeit after a short break for a holiday.But as Luntik emphasises: “The first thing I need to do is survive.”Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeRussiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Crenshaw is a leading expert on critical race theory (CRT), a framework used to analyze racism’s structural impact. She has fought against book bans, restraints on racial history teaching and other anti-DEI efforts since the beginning of the Republican-led campaign against CRT in 2020.“Our goal this week has been to flood the zone, as we call it, with Black history,” Crenshaw said about the campaign. “We have long understood that the attacks on ideas germinating from racial justice were not about the specific targets of each attack … [but are] an effort to impose a specific narrative about the United States of America, one that marginalizes, and even erases, its more difficult chapters,” she added.The weeklong campaign will conclude with a demonstration and prayer vigil in front of NMAAHC on 3 May.Leading up to the protest, AAPF, the NAACP’s Legal Defense Fund and six other advocacy groups signed onto a statement criticizing Trump’s “attempted mass erasure of Black history and culture”, according to a press release published 28 April. In March, Trumpordered an overhaulof the Smithsonian Institution, the world’s largest museum network, in order to demolish what he described as “improper, divisive or anti-American ideology”. He singled out NAAMHC, a museum that has been lauded since its opening in 2016.The coalition’s affirmation read, in part: “We affirm that Black history is American history, without which we cannot understand our country’s fight for freedom or secure a more democratic future. We must protect our history not just in books, schools, libraries, and universities, but also in museums, memorials, and remembrances that are sites of our national memory.”“I wasn’t shocked by it,” said Crenshaw of Trump’s executive order against NAAMHC. “I never did think that these attacks on civil rights, on racial equality, would find a natural limit because there is no limit.”Within this week’s movement, AAPF has led sessions to educate people on Trump’s dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, an element of the broader campaign. About 1,500 people attended a virtual event titled Under the Black Light: Beyond the First 100 Days: Centering Racial Justice and Black History in Our Fight for Democracy. There, panelists, including civil rights leaders and academics, discussed how attendees could organize against Trump’s mounting censorship of history. Coffee meetups and a sign-making session were organized as additional parts of the campaign, providing further conversations between participants and academics about how Trump’s initial executive orders connect to a larger thread of eroding racial justice.The group has also launched a “Black history challenge” where participants are encouraged to find a historical site or artifact and “put it into memory”, or recognize it, “as part of Black history’s role in American history”. As a part of the challenge, Crenshaw posted a video on social media of Bruce’s Beach, in Manhattan Beach, California. There, in 1912, a Black couple purchased oceanfront property and built a resort for Black people. The property was later seized by the city under the auspices of eminent domain. “It’s important to tell these stories so people understand that it’s not a natural reality that many Black folks don’t have beachfront property or that we don’t have transnational hotel chains owned by Black people,” said Crenshaw. “These things are actually created by the weaponization of law to impose white, exclusive rights and privileges.”The weeklong campaign comes as theTrump administrationhas attempted to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts at all levels of local and federal government since the start of his second term. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from any public schools that do not end their DEI programming. He later signed executive orders to crack down on diversity efforts at colleges and universities.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ve always understood that what the end game was, was the elimination of any recognition that our country has had and still has challenges with respect to racial and other forms of justice.”In response, advocacy groups have come together to channel their outrage into the collective action of the campaign and protest. “We want to be sure that we can preserve, beyond artifacts, the true experiences of those that have [undergone] the oppressive past of African Americans, and how that experience of resilience is important today,” said Reverend Shavon Arline-Bradley, president of the National Council of Negro Women (NCNW).A partnership, especially given the importance of the NMAAHC, felt like the most significant way forward, said Arline-Bradley. “This really is a collective, multiracial, multicultural, multi experience, coalition that is saying no. When you take away our history, when you take away African American history, then you really are trying to take away culture.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsProtestBlack US cultureRaceTrump administrationMuseumsUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The decision suddenly halted programming in 49 languages to more than 425 million people.It used to be that the US would put pressure on other countries for undermining free expression … no longerMarty BaronIn Moscow, Margarita Simonyan, the hardline editor-in-chief of the state broadcaster RT described it as an “awesome decision”. The Global Times, an English-language Chinese state media publication, crowed that the broadcasters had been discarded by the White House “like a dirty rag”, ending their “propaganda poison”. Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, whose regime has been accused of repressing political opposition, described Trump’s move as“very promising”.Domestically, Trump has continued to target the media, whether by taking outletsincluding CBS News and ABC to court, attempting toblock political access to the White House by the Associated Press, or defund National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service – institutions he has described as“radical left monsters”.For many senior media figures around the world, there has been a tipping of the scales as authoritarian regimes are emboldened by a US administration not only attacking the media at home, but also withdrawing from the fight for free information overseas.As the world marks Press Freedoms Day on May 3, observers are now warning that in countries where free media is weak, America’s withdrawal from this geopolitical balancing act will have far-reaching effects.Quick GuidePress Freedom: why does it matter?ShowPress freedom is inworrying declinein many parts of the world, with widespread attacks on journalists - last year was thedeadliest on record- and the shutting down of news outlets due to economic hardship.We are running aseries of piecesexploring the threats and challenges faced by media around World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, created to remind governments of their duty to uphold freedom of expression.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.View image in fullscreenSteve Capus, Radio Free Europe’s head, with photos of jailed RFE staff: Russia’s Nika Novak, Ihar Losik in Belarus and Azerbaijan’s Farid Mehralizada.

It was something that the United States government actually stood for, and it was also seen as a model for free expression.“Now, it’s not seen as a model at all. Authoritarian leaders, or those who want to be autocrats, have recognised that they’ll receive absolutely zero pressure from the United States. It’s basically given licence to other countries to be far more aggressive in attacking the press.“I think there is no question that it’s emboldened other leaders around the world. In other countries as well, we’re seeing the rise of authoritarianism,” he adds.View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s Mark Lowen reporting from Istanbul in March. He was held for 17 hours and deported.

For them, literally, the United States has disappeared.”Herman describes the drive to shut down VOA and other media bodies as a “constitutional emergency”, adding that he has heard from former listeners that they have already experienced Chinese broadcasts on some of the frequencies it formerly used.While a federal judge has blocked the attempt to dismantle VOA, RFE/RL and other related organisations, the uncertainty continues and a government appeal is expected. Meanwhile, the EU has been unable to step in to replace the lost funding.View image in fullscreenSonam Singeri, a Radio Free Asia employee, speaks outside a court in New York in March after a lawsuit was filed accusing the Trump administration of unlawfully closing VOA.Photograph: GettyThe exit of US-funded media has come at the same time as theBBCWorld Service, which has also played a powerful role in bringing independent media to audiences, faces its own financial squeeze from the erosion of the licence fee.Jonathan Munro, global director of BBC News , says: “Three-quarters of countries around the world don’t have free media, and that figure is getting worse, not better.“It’s not just the lack of free media. It’s the proactive and aggressive march of disinformation and misinformation, which arrives on people’s phones 24 hours a day. That’s a cocktail for a very badly informed, or misinformed, global population.”Trump’s aid cuts will lead to a surge in propaganda and misinformation, say press freedom groupsRead moreMunro says authoritarian regimes were already reacting to the withdrawal of the west and growing their own presence.“There’s a real ambition fromChinaand Russia in particular,” he says. “Iran and Turkey are growing players in this space, the Chinese are very active in African markets, the Russians are very active in the Middle East, as indeed are the Chinese. They’re both increasingly active in Latin America. Some of that is space that we’ve had to vacate over the years because of financial decisions.”Given Trump’s early determination to push back against media at home and defund US-backed free media overseas, some of the damage being done could be irreversible, says Baron.“It’s highly destructive, with no good rationale whatsoever and it will be very hard to recover.“Trump has proven to be really skilled at destroying things, and he clearly is on a campaign to destroy an independent press.”"

Then came Trump’s tariffsFrom the local sports team to local businesses, Saginaw is intimately intertwined with its northern neighborStephen Starrin Saginaw, MichiganSat 3 May 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 11.01 EDTShareThere are few entities that embody the close, fraternal ties between the US andCanadaquite like the Saginaw Spirit junior ice hockey team.In a place whose fortunes have been more down than up in recent decades, the Dow Event Center hockey arena in Saginaw,Michigan, comes alive with more than 5,000 fans once these young stars take to the ice. A huge banner depicting the players adorns the main street into the city.Nearly all the players, aged 16 to 20, come fromCanada, and stay with local Saginaw families during the regular playing season, which runs from September to April.“They are family, almost literally,” says Jimmy Greene, the Spirit’s vice-president of marketing and community relations, “because players come over here and stay with American families. It’s more than just sport.”One of the top prospects of this year’sNational Hockey Leagueentry draft is forward Michael Misa, the Spirit’s 18-year-old Canadian captain. Last year, the Saginaw Spirit won the Memorial Cup of the Ontario Hockey League for the first time. In the season that recently finished, the Spirit played 28 times on Canadian soil.So the fallout from DonaldTrump’s tariffsregime on Canadian goods has been felt more keenly in Saginaw than most other communities – as has the fight over the Canadian election, with the US president’s jibes over Canada becoming the US’s 51st state looming over the contest amid a fierce backlash against such comments.‘We are not the 51st anything’: viral Canada ad gets Trump-inspired updateRead more“We’ve had this relationship for decades and all of a sudden, in the last couple of months, it’s been uprooted,” says Greene.“Of course, you’re going to be concerned because you just don’t know [what will happen next]. At some point, it’s going to end up costing us. I just don’t know what extent and by how much.”As the largest city in the northern half of Michigan located within a short drive of three Canadian border crossings, Saginaw has closer ties to Canada than perhaps any other community of its size. Canadian companies own close to 4,000 acres (1,600 hectares) of farmland in the county, and last year,Saginaw establishedits first sister-city ties with a Canadian counterpart.What’s more, it is akey political bellwetherand manufacturing county that helped push Donald Trump over the line in last November’s presidential election, but today the community faces uncertainty around the trade war with Canada.Michigan, with its vast automotive manufacturing industry, is set to be affected by Trump’s trade battle with Canada more than perhaps any other US state.After Trump announced 25% tariffs on Canadian vehicles and parts – with some exemptions – Ottawa responded withits own 25% tariffon certain US automotive products. Canada says the tariffs are unjustified, but on 23 April Trump warned that the tariff figures could go up.While Trump hasclaimedthe US doesn’t need goods produced by its northern neighbor, Canada buys more American products than any other country, at$356bnworth of purchases. Nearly 40% of Michigan’s exported goods go to Canada. In 2023, $1.7bn worth of goods made in the Saginaw metropolitan area were exported, one of the highest amounts for any Michigan city, with much of that sent to Canada.Nexteer Automotive employs around 5,000 people in Saginaw while Means Industries, an automotive parts company headquartered in the city, also has a base in London, Ontario. Repeated calls and emails sent by the Guardian to Saginaw’s chamber of commerce seeking information on specific local industries potentially affected by the tariffs were not responded to.‘Sport right now triumphs over politics’Saginaw is no stranger to economic ups and downs.On a recent Friday afternoon, the downtown area is almost dead. Despite the recent success of the hockey team, there isn’t a sports bar for blocks in any direction as most of Saginaw’s commercial activity is now concentrated around miles of strip malls north of downtown.For Brad Pyscher, an officer at a correctional facility and former union president who, on a recent Saturday afternoon, is manning the Saginaw county Republican party office in one of these strip malls, the tariffs on Canada were something of a shock.“People are concerned, and they hope this works itself out,” he says. “The shock and awe [of the tariffs] really took everyone by surprise.”The 54-year-old says he had voted independent all his life before backing Democrat Barack Obama, and then Trump for president in 2016.“The thing with Trump, whether you like him or don’t like him, there’s transparency,” he says. “I’m drawn to him because he is not a politician.”But Pyscher concedes that Trump could have negotiated with Canada before “hitting them with that shock and awe. I think it’s on purpose, to let the world know he can do it,” he says.“[With] Canada, it should have been negotiated a bit better, a lot better. I’m expecting the deals with Canada to come soon, and we can all put this behind us.”Trump has said one of his main motivations for issuing tariffs on Canada was to stop the flow of illicit drugs into the US. However, reports indicate the opposite may be happening. Last month,$11m worth of cocaine was seizedat the Port Huron border crossing, 80 miles (130km) east of Saginaw – on its way into Canada. In December, around 1,000lb (450kg) of cocaine were also seized in a semi-truck attempting to enter Ontario from the same border crossing.Back in the world of ice hockey, Greene of Saginaw Spirit says he feels most people he interacts with have been able to park their political feelings, starting with the organization’s Canadian players, who have been essential to the team’s recent success.“I think we all made a concerted effort, while not to keep [the players] dumb and naive, we did enough to make them feel comfortable in our environment and away from the political stuff. We kept them in a mindset of sport,” he says.But Greene also realizes the strained ties with Canada fueled by the White House’s policies are a very real dynamic.“I’m not immune to the idea that at some point Canada had some hostile feelings towards us, but people have, until this point, been able to park the politics away from sport. I think sport right now triumphs over politics,” he says.“Because we play in Canada, and [because of] the tariffs. I’m more concerned about how they feel about us. Our feelings towards Canada have been and always will be favorable and friendly. I’m concerned not just because of the economic tariffs, but because of the emotions that come from that. I’d be foolish to pretend otherwise.”Saginaw residents are hoping the kind of fraternal ties that were on display across the city last May, when hundreds of Canadian hockey fans from as far away as Saskatchewan descended on the region for the Memorial Cup, won’t become a thing of the past.“Everybody’s been super friendly. You guys have been incredible hosts,” one Canadian hockey fan who drove 11 hours from Quebec for the tournamenttold local media.Explore more on these topicsMichiganCanadaTrump tariffsUS politicsUS foreign policyAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Centered in west Texas, the measles outbreak haskilledtwounvaccinated children and one adult and spread to neighboring states including New Mexico and Oklahoma.“We’re living in a post-herd-immunity world. I think the measles outbreak proves that,” said Dr Paul Offit, an expert on infectious disease and immunology and director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.“Measles – because it is the most contagious of the vaccine-preventable diseases, the most contagious human disease really – it is the first to come back.”The US eliminated measles in 2000. Elimination status would be lost if the US had 12 months of sustained transmission of the virus. As of 1 May, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)reported935 confirmed measles cases across30 jurisdictions.Nearly one in three children under five years old involved in the outbreak, or 285 young children, have been hospitalized.Three large outbreaks in Canada, Mexico and the US now account for the overwhelming majority of roughly 2,300 measles cases across the World Health Organization’s six-country Americas region, according to the health authority’supdatethis week. Risk of measles is considered high in the Americas, and has grown 11-fold compared with 2024.Only slightly behind, datareleased earlier this weekfrom the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and WHO also noted that measles cases across Europe were up tenfold in 2024 compared to 2023. That data also indicated that the 2024 measles cases in Europe followed a seasonal pattern, which was not previously noted in 2021 through 2023.Of the European cases, which reportedly hit 35,212 for 2024, 87% were reported in Romania. The ECDC said the dip in vaccine rates has impacted the recent spike in measles, with only three countries, Hungary, Malta and Portugal, having coverage of 95% or more for both doses of the measles vaccine.“This virus was imported, traveling country to country,” said Leticia Ruíz, the director of prevention and disease control in Chihuahua, Mexico, according to theAssociated Press.Many cases are in areas with large populations of tight-knit Mennonite communities. The religious group has a history of migration through the American south-west,Mexicoand Canada.Mennonite teaching does not explicitly prohibit immunization, according toan expertin the religion. However, as some in the Mennonite community in Texas resist assimilation and speak a dialect of Low German, community members may have limited contact with public health authorities, leading to lower vaccination rates.Immunologists fear the rate of infection of such diseases – and the unnecessary suffering they bring – will increase as the US health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, spreadsmisleading claimsabout vaccines and vaccine-preventable diseases,undermines public confidencein vaccines’ benefits, threatens to make some vaccines less accessible,guts publichealth infrastructureand pushesleading vaccine expertsout of the department.The National Institutes of Health said it would launch a“universal” influenza vaccine trialwith $500m in funding, but the news comes as the administrationdisplays hostilitytowardCovid-19 vaccines.“Here,Robert F Kennedy Jris exactly who he has been for the last 20 years. He’s an anti-vaccine activist, he is a science denialist and a conspiracy theorist,” said Offit.“He has a fixed belief that vaccines are doing more harm than good – as he’s said over and over again.”Although Kennedy has tepidly endorsed the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to prevent measles, he has also made false and inflammatory claims about the vaccine. Just this week, Kennedy told a crowd that it contains “aborted fetus debris”. The rubella vaccine, like many others, is produced usingdecades-old sterile fetal cell linesderived from two elective terminations in the 1960s.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There, he mademisleading claimsabout measles treatment, including that the antibiotic clarithromycin and steroid budesonide had led to “miraculous and instantaneous recovery”.The overwhelming scientific consensus is that the best way to treat measles is through prevention with the MMR vaccine, which is 97% effective. Still, Kennedy has said he willask the CDCto study vitamins and drugs to treat the viral disease.Measles is a virus. There is no cure for the viral disease and it is not considered “treatable” by leading physicians’ groups, such as theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics(AAP).“There is no cure for measles, and it can result in serious complications. It’s misleading and dangerous to promote the idea that measles is easily treated using unproven and ineffective therapies like budesonide and clarithromycin,” the AAPhas saidof Kennedy’s claims.Measles kills about one in 1,000 children who become infected with the disease, and has similar rates of brain swelling, called encephalitis, that can result in lifelong disability. Measles infectionsuppresses the immune system, which can lead to other infections.Measles vaccination is believed to have saved more than93 million livesworldwide between 1974 and 2024 and reduced overall childhood mortality.Explore more on these topicsUS newsMMRInfectious diseasesRobert F Kennedy JrCanadaMexicoHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The supreme court sent the case back to an appeals court, and it was not clear when a new ruling would come.On Friday, Yoon’s former prime minister, Han Duck-soo, announced his entry into the presidential race, hoping to leverage his higher profile. Han, while not a member of the conservative party, has been mentioned as a potential partner of the party to join forces against the liberals in the presidential race.The election was triggered bythe removal of Yoon from the presidency in Aprilby the constitutional court, which ruled he committed a grave violation of his duties by declaring martial law on 3 December with no justifiable grounds.Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

Azerbaijan’s president, Ilham Aliyev, whose regime has been accused of repressing political opposition, described Trump’s move as“very promising”.Domestically, Trump has continued to target the media, whether by taking outletsincluding CBS News and ABC to court, attempting toblock political access to the White House by the Associated Press, or defund National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service – institutions he has described as“radical left monsters”.For many senior media figures around the world, there has been a tipping of the scales as authoritarian regimes are emboldened by a US administration not only attacking the media at home, but also withdrawing from the fight for free information overseas.As the world marks Press Freedoms Day on May 3, observers are now warning that in countries where free media is weak, America’s withdrawal from this geopolitical balancing act will have far-reaching effects.Quick GuidePress Freedom: why does it matter?ShowPress freedom is inworrying declinein many parts of the world, with widespread attacks on journalists - last year was thedeadliest on record- and the shutting down of news outlets due to economic hardship.We are running aseries of piecesexploring the threats and challenges faced by media around World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, created to remind governments of their duty to uphold freedom of expression.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.View image in fullscreenSteve Capus, Radio Free Europe’s head, with photos of jailed RFE staff: Russia’s Nika Novak, Ihar Losik in Belarus and Azerbaijan’s Farid Mehralizada.

It was something that the United States government actually stood for, and it was also seen as a model for free expression.“Now, it’s not seen as a model at all. Authoritarian leaders, or those who want to be autocrats, have recognised that they’ll receive absolutely zero pressure from the United States. It’s basically given licence to other countries to be far more aggressive in attacking the press.“I think there is no question that it’s emboldened other leaders around the world. In other countries as well, we’re seeing the rise of authoritarianism,” he adds.View image in fullscreenThe BBC’s Mark Lowen reporting from Istanbul in March. He was held for 17 hours and deported. Eleven local reporters were among 1,850 people detained in Turkey’s protests.Photograph: BBCVOA’s chief national correspondent, Steve Herman, points out that VOA was often the only connection to the US in some countries. “In the more repressive societies where there is absolutely no alternative to get news and you can’t get on the internet, I wonder what they think happened in the United States. For them, literally, the United States has disappeared.”Herman describes the drive to shut down VOA and other media bodies as a “constitutional emergency”, adding that he has heard from former listeners that they have already experienced Chinese broadcasts on some of the frequencies it formerly used.While a federal judge has blocked the attempt to dismantle VOA, RFE/RL and other related organisations, the uncertainty continues and a government appeal is expected. Meanwhile, the EU has been unable to step in to replace the lost funding.View image in fullscreenSonam Singeri, a Radio Free Asia employee, speaks outside a court in New York in March after a lawsuit was filed accusing the Trump administration of unlawfully closing VOA.Photograph: GettyThe exit of US-funded media has come at the same time as theBBCWorld Service, which has also played a powerful role in bringing independent media to audiences, faces its own financial squeeze from the erosion of the licence fee.Jonathan Munro, global director of BBC News , says: “Three-quarters of countries around the world don’t have free media, and that figure is getting worse, not better.“It’s not just the lack of free media. It’s the proactive and aggressive march of disinformation and misinformation, which arrives on people’s phones 24 hours a day. That’s a cocktail for a very badly informed, or misinformed, global population.”Trump’s aid cuts will lead to a surge in propaganda and misinformation, say press freedom groupsRead moreMunro says authoritarian regimes were already reacting to the withdrawal of the west and growing their own presence.“There’s a real ambition fromChinaand Russia in particular,” he says. “Iran and Turkey are growing players in this space, the Chinese are very active in African markets, the Russians are very active in the Middle East, as indeed are the Chinese. They’re both increasingly active in Latin America. Some of that is space that we’ve had to vacate over the years because of financial decisions.”Given Trump’s early determination to push back against media at home and defund US-backed free media overseas, some of the damage being done could be irreversible, says Baron.“It’s highly destructive, with no good rationale whatsoever and it will be very hard to recover.“Trump has proven to be really skilled at destroying things, and he clearly is on a campaign to destroy an independent press.”"

For example, one site reviewed by Guardian Australia which has “Sydney” in its name, lists a contact email for another site with “Dublin” in its name.We should call this what it is: digital retail fraudErin TurnerLast November, one online store claimed on its Facebook page that: “After years of having a physical store only in the heart ofMelbourne, we decided to open our webshop!”.However, on its website, it says it is “based in Lennik, Belgium”. It lists an address for a house 30 minutes from Brussels but also says “some of our products are located and shipped from within Australia, while others are shipped from China”.Another online store claims on its website to be “based in the heart of Melbourne”. But it lists two addresses, one for an office building in central Amsterdam and another for a townhouse about 20kms away.The returns form for a third site instructs the customer to pay return postage to address in Zhejiang, China. The same address is listed on five other websites – one uses “Aussie” in its name, while another uses “London”.On third-party review websites, customers have claimed they were instructed to send returns to the same Zhejiang address after purchasing products from sites claiming to be based in Norway, Canada, Germany, and New Zealand.A 60-year-old Brisbane woman, who asked not to be named, said she spent about $350 on shoes and clothing from the site last year after seeing their advertising on Facebook. She says she received the items, but they were “rubbish”.After trying to arrange a refund, she contacted PayPal and her credit card provider.The woman said the company sent PayPal the details of their refund process, which listed the Zhejiang address and instructed her to make a false customs declaration, stating the value of the goods is under $5.“Anything above $5 will be destroyed immediately, resulting in no possible refund,” the form said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMorning MailFree daily newsletterOur Australian morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She was yet to secure a refund.The majority of the identified ghost stores – based on analysis by Guardian Australia, evidence from customers, and a running list of sites compiled by the Scam Alerts Australia Facebook group – have been built using the Shopify e-commerce platform.The chief executive of the Consumer Policy Research Centre, Erin Turner, said online platforms must do more to stop “fraudulent players” from using their services.“Platforms like Shopify and Instagram are making money as these ghost stores pay for advertising and support,” she said.“We should call this what it is: digital retail fraud. Without coordinated action from digital platforms and regulators, these fraudsters will keep gaming the system.”Guardian Australia contactedMetaand Shopify for comment, but the companies did not respond by deadline.Digital marketing strategist Briony Cullin said she had seen the volume of social media advertising for this type of online store increase over the past six months. She has reported the ads for 13 different businesses to Meta. Each time, she said she has been notified that the ad would not be taken down.One of the “support” messages Cullin received from Meta, seen by Guardian Australia, said the company used a “combination of technology and human reviewers” to process reports.“There needs to be some balance for consumers here,” Cullin says. “It’s a huge problem that they’re not taking any responsibility for and that’s terrible.”Maison Canberra and the other stores referred to in this article were contacted for comment.Do you know more?

Along with sections of the Australia media, they pushed for a version of Trump’s unapologetic politics here.Sensing a shift to the right across the electorate,Peter Duttonand the Coalition finalised policies to slash the federal public service and root out “woke” ideology in schools and social policy. They fine-tuned messages about the Indigenous welcome to country and accused Labor of dangerous overreach in the transition to renewable energy.Sign up for the Afternoon Update: Election 2025 email newsletterBut, despite predictions of an inevitable slide into minority for Labor, Anthony Albanese’s remarkable election victory showed voters aren’t interested in appeals to the fringes. Instead, Australians were eager to reward a focus on the mainstream.For months, Labor’s national secretary, Paul Erickson, had been building an election campaign around cost-of-living assistance and better Medicare services, encouraging Albanese to talk up urgent care medical clinics and cheaper childcare and Tafe courses.While the Coalition sought to demonise public servants supposedly slacking off in Canberra and struggled to explain Dutton’s plan to build seven nuclear power plants, Labor smashed them for voting against household payments and tax cuts announced in the March budget. The unpopular work from home policy, which led too many voters to believe their own workplace flexibility was under threat, will be remembered as one of the great stinkers of Australian election campaigning.2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoLike John Howard before him, the times look like they suit Albanese. Few leaders will get as lucky, in the form of a truly terrible opposition campaign.But his experience showed as well. Trump’s “liberation day” tariffs announcement had loomed as a risk to Albanese’s reelection bid, but he successfully managed the hit, criticising Trump’s plans and pledging to negotiate a better deal for exporters once he was back in The Lodge.As Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency slashed and burned, Labor played havoc with Dutton’s approval rating, deriding him as “Dogey Dutton” and accusing the Liberals of harbouring even more radical ideas. The now former member for Dickson wasn’t helped by frontbencher Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and her promise to “make Australia great again.”Like the undecided voter who asked Albanese and Dutton how they would protect Australia from Trump’s erratic decision-making in the first leaders’ debate on 10 April, fear of an unstable world was front-of-mind around the country.Andrew Bolt says it was the voters who were wrong as Sky News commentators grieve Dutton election loss | Amanda MeadeRead moreAlbanese successfully argued calm leadership was Australia’s best approach to the unpredictability the US president has cultivated as his personal calling card. His unflashy approach to the job might be regarded as a key asset.Albanese’s victory speech alluded to Dutton’s flirtation with the Maga approach. He told the Labor faithful his government would continue to choose an Australian way forward. One of his biggest cheers came as he promised to continue to recognise Indigenous heritage and leadership every day in the job.The politics of division might be front of mind for the Coalition as they pick up the pieces. Queensland senator James McGrath, hardly a moderate in the joint party room, had the unenviable task of explaining the historic loss on the ABC’s broadcast.He warned the Coalition should be firmly in the centre-right, and avoid importing division and distrust. “We must resist that path [and] focus on where middle Australia is,” he said.That’s where the voters are too.

In 2025, Labor people had briefly whispered about taking Dickson, with a major campaign effort and serious heavy-hitters deployed there for numerous visits – but late in the piece, expectations were tamped down.As the ABC’s Antony Green called Ali France to win over Dutton, a cheer erupted from the Labor red-shirted faithful that was nearly as raucous and joyful as when the veteran psephologist called the election itself for Albanese.2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoLabor had been optimistic about holding on to government, whether in slight minority or majority, butthe scale of victory– that may yet keep growing – stunned even some pollsters in the room. Seats fell like dominoes. The Coalition, already partially hollowed out after 2022, is reduced to a shell; safe seats cannoned to Labor, the moderate wing of the party decimated, Dutton losing not only the election but his job.“Today, the Australian people have voted for Australian values. For fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all,” Albanese bellowed to the room of supporters, raising his hands in triumph. “For the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need.”‘We’re going to be happier soon’Labor people screamed as seats were called. The likes of Bennelong, a razor-thin seat that had been marked as notionally Liberal after a boundary redistribution, was returned to Jerome Laxale by a commanding 60-40 margin; Bridget Archer, the popular Liberal moderate, ejected from Bass; Anne Urquhart, the Labor senator who chanced her arm by running for the safe Liberal seat of Braddon, helped wipe out the Coalition from Tasmania; Deakin, Bonner, Forde, Menzies, the type of Liberal seats Labor hadn’t really talked up, projected to keep falling their way.Seats held against stiff challenges that Dutton had targeted with his cost-of-living pitch – Gilmore, Hawke, Hunter, McEwen, Lyons, Paterson and Shortland – all failed to fall. Most came back to Labor with increased margins.Anthony Albanese wins 2025 federal election with Labor securing majority in ‘win for the ages’Read moreOn the stage, hours before the result was called, a technical coordinator gave a brief rundown of some logistics for the night. Beginning her remarks and trying to get the crowd’s attention, she jokes that people are already feeling happy, “I’ve got a funny feeling we’re going to be happier soon tonight.”Labor people had briefed out in recent days that Dutton was more unpopular than Morrison – particularly in key Tasmanian seats – and that an increased majority was on the cards.One senior Labor source says the party had data from early this year that Labor could take Dickson. That effort was hidden in plain sight, Albanese visiting Dutton’s seat on the first and last days of his election campaign. In an interview with Guardian Australia last month, we asked if he was just trying to “troll” Dutton.“We’re very serious about it,” he told us.‘A man who shows what real strength is’In the room, Labor people hugged, screamed, danced and cried. “It’s time” shirts were a common feature; as were towering pyramids constructed of cans of “Albo Ale”.Albanese sipped from a glass of water as he gave his speech, laden with references to “Australian values”, “kindness”, saying Australians had “chosen optimism and determination”. The direct comparisons didn’t have to be made, people knew what he meant.Labor people put it down to Dutton’s negative campaign, his culture wars, his lack of positive vision for the country, his confused and confusing policy offering. When Dutton’s concession speech was broadcast to a quiet room, hundreds in the crowd waved their hands in mock goodbye to the Liberal leader.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toAfternoon Update: Election 2025Free daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key election campaign stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

A man of courage, a man of compassion. A leader with the conviction of who we are.”By the time of Albanese’s remarks, the crowd was delirious. His discussion of “the Australian way”, of centring progressive values of equality and equity, and recommitting to renewable energy and reconciliation, set the stage for what a second-term Labor government will look like.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese celebrates with partner Jodie Haydon (right), son Nathan and foreign minister Penny Wong (left) at Labor’s election night event in Sydney.Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAPAlbanese didn’t make new policy promises tonight. Labor’s existing policy slate, while decried by some as humble, will take time to implement. Continuing the energy transition, ensuring the central housing policies actually build some houses, and continuing work toward closing the gap on Indigenous life outcomes, will take enough time and effort.There was no promise or commitment, as there had been in 2022, to implement the Uluru statement from the heart; instead, a commitment to “reconciliation” was the closest Albanese came. Jim Chalmers, speaking later on the ABC, said Labor approached its second term with “humility”; Albanese spoke of Australia turning a corner, hinting at better days ahead.Returned with an increased majority, Albanese enters a lofty pantheon of Australian politicians. He claims a piece of history, the first PM re-elected since John Howard; he will become, in his second term, one of the biggest heroes in the Labor mythology.Albanese becomes arguably the most influential political figure since Howard, with a mandate for his policies, and an opportunity to bed down the reforms of his first term and to take his Labor project further, with newer and bolder reforms.It is unclear where the Senate will sit. Despite the Greens going backwards in the House of Representatives, Albanese will likely still have to negotiate with minor parties in the upper house – but Albanese will likely enjoy one of the most progressive parliaments ever.His position in history will be decided by how he uses those numbers delivered to him by Australians tonight.Josh Butler is a Guardian Australia political reporter and chief of staff, based in CanberraExplore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Anthony AlbaneseLabor partyAustralian politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Hebecomes the first Australian prime minister to serve consecutive terms since 2004.View image in fullscreenAnthony Albanese takes to the stage with his son Nathan and partner, Jodie Haydon.Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAPWith counting continuing into Sunday morning, Labor was projected to win comfortably more than 76 of the 150 lower house seats needed to form a majority government, with an increased share of votes bucking a recent trend against the two major parties.Addressing the party faithful in Sydney, Albanese said voters had chosen Australian values, including “fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all”.“Australians have voted for a future that holds true to these values, a future built on everything that brings us together as Australians, and everything that sets our nation apart from the world,” he said.In an apparent reference to Trump’s policies, Albanese said he would “choose the Australian way”.“We do not need to beg or borrow or copy from anywhere else. We do not seek our inspiration from overseas. We find it right here in our values and in our people,” he said.Labor was certain to add to the 77 seats it held going into the election, with the opposition Liberal/NationalCoalitionprojected to receive its lowest ever national vote and to lose further seats.In a six-minute concession speech, Dutton accepted “full responsibility” for the party’s wipeout, which included losing his own seat, and said that the party had unfortunately been “defined by our opponents in this election”.“It’s not our night, as I point out, and there are good members, good candidates, who have lost their seats or their ambition, and I’m sorry for that … we have an amazing party, and we’ll rebuild.”The Australian conservative party’s lossmirrored that of the recent election in Canadawhere the centre-left Liberal party won a fourth-term despite being well behind in the polls in the leadup to the election.Like Dutton, Canada’s Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre,lost the seat he had held since 2004in an election dominated by the impact of Trump’s presidency.Meanwhile, most if not all of the inner-city “teal” independents elected at the previous poll in 2022 seemed certain to retain their seats, with several other independents, some in regional areas, having a good chance of adding to their number.View image in fullscreenOpposition leader Peter Dutton concedes defeat alongside his sons, Harry and Tom.Photograph: Dan Peled/Getty ImagesHowever, it was a disappointing night for the Greens, who were projected to lose two of the three Brisbane seats they sensationally won in 2022, even as their national vote remained static at around 13%. Even the apparently safe Melbourne seat of their leader, Adam Bandt, seemed in a certain amount of jeopardy.Dutton was first elected in 2001 and is one of his party’s most senior members. He has held a number of ministerial positions, including defence and immigration, since 2013.He had consistently led in the national polls since the end of 2023, but the US’s decision to place tariffs on Australian exports made associations with Trump detrimental to the opposition party’s brand.The opposition leader avoided mentioning the US president during the election campaign, even as some of hissenior colleagues referred to Trump’s slogansat political rallies.Months before the campaign officially kicked off, Dutton hadannounced a government efficiency unitto scale back “waste”, mirroring the Elon Musk-led so-called “department of government efficiency” in the US.The opposition’s Indigenous affairs spokesperson, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who used Trump’s slogan during the campaign, accused the media of “slinging mud” and “smearing” the party for making links to the US president.“Donald Trump doesn’t own those four words,” the senator said on ABC, referring tothe Make Australia Great Again sloganshe used.0:48Labor wins the Australian federal election 2025 – videoCounting to determine the final shape of the House of Representatives and the Senate (the upper house) will take several days, if not weeks in the case of a few seats.Voting is compulsory in Australia and is based on a preferential voting system.

Independents had three, with six still in doubt. The Liberals had seen a swing of nearly 2% away from them.The Liberals had campaigned hard in the state, running advertisingtying Anthony Albanese to the long-serving and poor-polling state Labor government, led by Jacinta Allan, in the hope of clawing back outer suburban seats such as Aston, Chisholm, Dunkley and McEwen, and gaining seats such as Bruce, Hawke and Gorton.Anthony Albanese claims a piece of history as scale of Labor victory stuns raucous crowd | Josh ButlerRead moreEven senior members of Victorian Labor expected a swing away from the party of about 1.5%-2.5% – with some members of the state caucus actively considering a leadership challenge against Allan if several seats were lost.But instead, there was a swing of about 1.8% towards the party, on top of the 54.8% two-party-preferred result in 2022, itself a high-water mark.Labor was expected to hold Chisholm, Dunkley and Aston, as well as winning the seats of Deakin and Menzies from the Liberals.In Deakin, one of the most marginal seats going into the election, Labor’s Matt Gregg was expected to defeat the Coalition housing spokesperson, Michael Sukkar, while in Menzies, Labor’s Gabriel Ng was on track to take the seat from the Liberal MP Keith Wolahan.2:25Australian federal election 2025 recap: Albanese wins, Dutton concedes, Greens in the air – videoVictorian Labor insiders claim the result in the eastern suburbs is a repudiation of the Coalition’selection commitment to cut funding to the Suburban Rail Loop– one of the state government’s flagship infrastructure projects, which runs through the three electorates.In Macnamara, which stretches across Melbourne’s inner bayside suburbs, Labor’s Josh Burns was expected to retain the seat, defying expectations that a result would take days, as it was among the tightest three-cornered contests in the country in 2022.About 10% of the electorate’s population is Jewish, making it the second-largest Jewish electorate in the country. Thecommunity was angeredby what it said was Labor’s failure to stand firmly with Israel amid the war in Gaza, sparked by the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023.Burns, one of the few Jewish MPs in federal parliament, also faced a relentless campaign from Advance Australia and J-United during the campaign. But there has been a 5% swing towards him.“I honestly didn’t think this night would happen. We had blue to the right and green to the left, but the red army turned up,” Burns told party faithful at Port Melbourne Bowling Club.“We have had a lot thrown at us and the lesson is one where you have to be true to yourself and this party.”View image in fullscreenGreens leader Adam Bandt addresses the crowd at the party’s election night event in Melbourne.Photograph: Diego Fedele/AAPThe Greens leader, Adam Bandt, suffered a 5.4% swing against him in his seat of Melbourne, leaving the seat in doubt on Saturday night. Bandt remained ahead on primary votes, but Liberal preferences were expected to flow to Labor.Bandt did not address the swing against him when speaking to supporters, but said the party was confident it would retain between one and four MPs in the lower house. He said he was confident the Greens would retain the Queensland seat of Ryan.The Greens were also behind in the seat of Wills late on Saturday night, despite a huge campaign mounted by the former state leader Samantha Ratnam.“From the numbers we have tonight, we have had at least a 10% swing towards us,” Ratnam told the Greens election party in Melbourne. “We still have a lot of counting to go – watch this space.”Andrew Bolt says it was the voters who were wrong as Sky News commentators grieve Dutton election loss | Amanda MeadeRead moreThe Liberals’ attempt to win back ground from the teals also looked set to fail, with Amelia Hamer in Kooyong and Tim Wilson in Goldstein both behind Monique Ryan and Zoe Daniel respectively.Speaking at Trades Hall, Allan said Victoria had yet again defied the polls.“A lot of commentators and conservative politicians have built a career on kicking down on our state, our party and our unions – and every time we prove them wrong,” the premier said.“The incredible results for Labor in our state aren’t despite what’s happening in Victoria, but because of what’s happening here in Victoria.”Tony Barry, a former senior Liberal staffer now with the political consultancy RedBridge, blamed the Liberals’ poor showing in Victoria on the state branch, which has been bitterly divided since the former leader John Pesutto expelled Moira Deeming from the party room in 2023.At the end of 2024 Deeming won her defamation action against Pesutto, who then lost the leadership of the party. She was promoted by the new leader, Brad Battin, as his “representative to the western suburbs” days before the federal prepoll opened.“The great problem for theLiberal partyas a whole is to rebuild such a broken institution,” Barry said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian election 2025Australian politicsVictoriaLabor partyLiberal partyAustralian GreensnewsShareReuse this content"

In the more than 50 years that have elapsed, the territory, which unilaterally declared independence in 1983, has been recognised by no other country but Turkey.Ahead of his visit officials had said that Erdoğan’s focus would be on the opening of the big government complex, financed by Ankara with the aim of promoting international acceptance for the isolated entity.On Saturday the Turkish president insisted that in the wake of decades of failed peace talks between Greek and Turkish Cypriots only “a two-state solution” could be discussed to resolve the west’s longest running diplomatic dispute.“The two-state solution is the joint vision of Turkey and northern Cyprus,” he said. “Any new negotiation process must be between two sovereign states.”Friday’s demonstration, which followed almost daily protests over the hijab law, was organised by more than 100 trade unions and civil societies many of which still advocate the island’s reunification as a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.“Partly because of Kemalism but also because of eighty-two years of British colonial rule, Turkish Cypriots are by far the most secular Muslims in the world,” said Hubert Faustmann, professor of history and political science at the University of Nicosia in the internationally recognised south.For Turkish Cypriots who have long opposed Ankara’s ever-expanding influence in the north, the regulation, he said, was further proof of the leader’s determination to not only erode long-held secular traditions but ultimately alter their own identity.“What we are witnessing is a cultural clash,” Faustmann said. “The legislation on headscarves is seen as part of a package of continuous attempts by Erdoğan to unwind the secular character of the community.”With the backlash showing no sign of abating, Turkish Cypriots appear determined to have the measure repealed – even if it has been vigorously defended by the community’s leader, Ersin Tatar, a close Erdoğan ally who argues the law protects students from discrimination.“If we are to save ourselves we have to continue this struggle,” said Şener Elcil, a veteran former trade unionist.Increasingly, he lamented, Turkish Cypriots had been made to feel like a minority “in our own land” as a result of hundreds of thousands of mainland settlers moving to the north.“Religion was never a point of division on this island but after years of building mosques that Turkish Cypriots don’t even go to, they want to make it one in our schools,” he added. “Now, more than ever, we need to stand up to Erdoğan and have our voices heard.”Explore more on these topicsCyprusRecep Tayyip ErdoğanEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

That’s not democracy – it’s tyranny in disguise. What is truly extremist is not the popular AfD – which took second in the recent election – but rather the establishment’s deadly open border immigration policies that the AfD opposes.”Rubio went on to say: “Germany should reverse course.”Rubio comes a long way to become most dominant US diplomat since KissingerRead moreIn aresponseon X, the German foreign ministry pushed back against the US secretary of state, saying: “This is democracy. This decision is the result of a thorough & independent investigation to protect our Constitution & the rule of law. It is independent courts that will have the final say. We have learnt from our history that rightwing extremism needs to be stopped.”Germany’s response to Rubio comes after its domestic intelligence service, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV),designatedthe AfD as a “confirmed rightwing extremist” force on Friday.The BfV’s decision marks a step up from its previous designation of the country’s anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin and largest opposition party as a “suspected” threat to Germany’s democratic order.According tothe BfV, the AfD’s xenophobic stances based on an “ethnic-ancestry-based understanding” of German identity are “incompatible with the free democratic basic order” as indicated by the country’s constitution.The spy agency added that the AfD “aims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society, to subject them to unconstitutional unequal treatment and thus to assign them a legally devalued status”.It also said: “This exclusionary understanding of the people is the starting point and ideological basis for ongoing agitation against certain individuals or groups of people, through which they are defamed and despised indiscriminately and irrational fears and rejection are stirred up.”During February’s general election in Germany, which was rocked by extensiveUS interferenceincluding public votes of confidence by staunch AfD supporterssuch as Elon MuskandJD Vance, the AfDamassedapproximately 21% of the vote, finishing second.The far-right party’s rise to popularity in Germany has come as a result of abroader waveof growingrightwing extremismacross Europe.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Whatever their strategy, the aim is the same: to spot the red-capped cardinals emerging from Synod Hall and try to elicit from them a clue as to who will succeed Pope Francis.The men responsible for picking a new pontiff are enjoying rock-star status in Rome this week as they prepare forconclave: the secret, centuries-old ritual of electing a leader of the Catholic church that is due to begin on 7 May.Marina García Diéguez is among the journalists partaking in the daily stakeout. She is a conclave novice, but was quick to suss out the cunning ways the cardinals try to avoid the gaggle of reporters.“Each one has his own strategy,” said Diéguez, who works for the Spanish radio station Cadena Ser and Mediaset España. “Some already have cars with blacked-out windows waiting for them, so they can make a sharp exit. Others remove their red skullcaps and leave by foot, taking a route that crosses St Peter’s Square, where they can get lost among the tourists, before escaping through Via della Conciliazione.” It was at that point, she advised, that you stood a good chance of catching one.View image in fullscreenCardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan of Hong Kong is approached by reporters outside the Vatican.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APDiéguez had managed to obtain quotes from a couple, including Fernando Filoni, an Italian cardinal whose name cropped up this week among the favourites for pope. The Guardian’s attempt to give chase was not as successful. “I don’t speak English, which at this precise moment, is a very good thing,” said an Argentinian cardinal, before politely adding, in Italian: “But we are working very well together,” and striding off.About 180 cardinals from all over the world have been gathering each morning this week at Synod Hall to get to know each other and to share their visions of the church, but ultimately to establish a clear pope contender. Of that number, 133 are eligible to vote after two dropped out of the conclave for health reasons.Eight in 10 of the voters were appointed by Francis, with 20 becoming cardinals only in December. Francis made a point of selecting cardinals from places where there had never previously been one, such as Myanmar, Haiti and Rwanda. Until this past week or so, many had never met.View image in fullscreenJorge Enrique Jiménez Carvajal, a Colombian cardinal, addresses the media in St Peter’s Square, Rome.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APDuring conclave, the men will be sequestered in their humble lodgings at Casa Santa Marta, the guesthouse where Pope Francis lived during his 12-year papacy, and the Sistine Chapel, where the voting takes place.The cardinals swear an oath of silence before each pre-conclave meeting and will do so again when the election begins.But until they are sequestered, it is in the bars and restaurants in the area surrounding the Vatican where the real talking happens, with some mischievous cardinals exploiting the press while they can to leak titbits or to discredit the main candidates.Al Passetto di Borgo, a restaurant in Borgo Pio, has been a favourite among Rome’s clergy for years. According to a framed newspaper article hanging on the wall, this was the place where cardinals, over carbonara and tiramisu, plotted to ensure the election of Joseph Ratzinger in the 2005 conclave.Seán Patrick O’Malley, an American cardinal who leads a commission tasked with preventing clerical abuse against minors, was among the diners this week. Aged 80, O’Malley is too old to vote but has been named by some church-watchers as a possibility for pontiff. Another diner was Donald Wuerl, who in 2018resigned asarchbishop of Washington over his handling of a sexual abuse scandal.Showing a photo on his phone of a plain-clothed Wuerl in Al Passetto di Borgo, the restaurant’s owner, Antonello Fulvimari, said: “He’s been coming here since 1969.”View image in fullscreenRaniero Mancinelli, a Roman tailor, is on his own initiative making outfits for the next pope.Photograph: Gregorio Borgia/APThe only information Fulvimari had been able to glean from his prestigious clients this week was that they wanted the conclave over “as soon as possible”. “They all want to get home,” he added. “But this is where the real decisions get made.”Another popular restaurant is Marcantonio, although according to a waiter, the presence of cardinals has petered out because of journalists.Cardinals who want to spread rumours tend to resort to the veteran Vatican reporters from the Italian press. They have sought to diminish the credibility of some leading contenders – for example Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state – by claiming they have health issues. Luis Antonio Tagle, a reformer from the Philippines and a strong favourite, has also had a rough ride from conservative cardinals aftera videoof him singing John Lennon’s Imagine emerged on the internet.Another meeting point is reportedly Caffe dei Papi, a coffee bar tucked away from the main hubbub on Via Vespasiano. “But I never know when they are here,” said Ilda, the bar’s manager. “I just read about it in the newspaper.”Unsurprisingly, the main chatter in the bar has revolved around who will be elected pope. “I think it should be someone who embraces everyone,” said Ilda.Vincenzo Aru, a building concierge who works nearby, is a lapsed Catholic and therefore indifferent. “I’m just happy they’ve cleaned the streets,” he said. “The only time that happens around here is when a pope dies.”Explore more on these topicsThe papacyPapal conclaveVaticanCatholicismItalyReligionChristianityfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The rebels went on to control most population centres in the impoverished Arabian peninsula country.A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in support of beleaguered government forces in 2015 but with little success.On Saturday, Bin Mubarak posted on X that he had met the PLC’s Alimi and resigned.He also shared his resignation letter in which he said: “I could not exercise my constitutional powers and take the necessary decisions to reform government institutions or implement rightful governmental changes.”The Houthis are currently waging a campaign of missile attacks on Israel and are targeting shipping in key waterways in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians over the war in Gaza.Bin Mubarak said that despite the obstacles he had managed to achieve “many successes in a short space of time”, citing fiscal and administrative reforms and an anti-corruption drive.However, analyst Mohammed al-Basha, of the US-based Basha Report Risk Advisory, told AFP Bin Mubarak had been “in constant friction with the Presidential Leadership Council”.“Bin Mubarak wanted to be more than prime minister – he wanted the powers of the presidency. That aspiration isolated him politically,” Basha said.The Yemeni official sources who spoke to AFP said Bin Mubarak had suspended the budgets of several ministries including defence, citing corruption, further fuelling tensions.“His drive for greater power – viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition – led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most council members,” Basha said. “Over time, this power struggle eroded trust.”Bin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the US, is a staunch adversary of the Houthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him for several days.Previously he was chief of staff of the presidential office and Yemen’s envoy to the UN.He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on 5 February 2024.His departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen’s internationally recognised government – a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion”, Basha said.The war in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting decreased significantly after a UN-negotiated six-month truce in 2022.Since the war in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it.The Houthis paused their attacks during a two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March a threat to resume attacks over Israel’s Gaza aid blockade triggered a renewed andsustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yementhey control.Explore more on these topicsYemenMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Since then, at least 2,326 people have been killed, bringing the death toll since the war broke out to 52,418, according to the health ministry in Gaza.Israel has accused Hamas of using civilians as human shields, a charge denied by the radical Islamist organisation. It also accuses Hamas of stealing and selling aid to fund its military and other operations.The war was triggered by a surprise attack launched by Hamas into Israel on 7 October 2023. Militants killed more than 1,200 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people, 58 of whom are still held in Gaza, including 34 whom the Israeli military says are dead.Aid officials have warned of a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, with famine again looming. On Friday, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) warned that the humanitarian response in Gaza was on the “verge of total collapse”.“This situation must not – and cannot – be allowed to escalate further,” Pascal Hundt, the ICRC’s deputy director of operations, said in a statement.There has been no progress in faltering negotiations for a new ceasefire-for-hostages deal in recent weeks, and reports in Israeli media suggest Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, will soonapprove a new broader offensiveas well as a new plan drawn up by Israeli officials for renewed distribution of aid in Gaza involving private contractors and a small number of “hubs” to be constructed in the south of the territory.Humanitarian officials in Gaza told the Guardian last week that the proposed Israeli aid plan was impracticable and unethical.“The current scheme just won’t work unless there are a lot more distribution hubs and even then we cannot be a party to something that may drive massive and possibly permanent displacement within Gaza,” one senior humanitarian official said.The US president, Donald Trump, is thought to be likely to press Israel for some concessions on aid entering Gaza before he visits Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar this month. A week ago, he told Netanyahu to be “good to Gaza”.Why has Israel resumed large-scale airstrikes on Gaza?Read moreAnalysts are divided on whether warnings issued to tens of thousands of Israeli reservists to expect to be called up in the coming days or weeks are designed to put further pressure on Hamas to make concessions in talks or are evidence that a new offensive in Gaza is imminent.Israel’s military is already overstretched after 18 months of war, with a shortfall of about 7,000 combat soldiers. Government officials describe a “seven-front war” thatcould last another year.On Saturday morning, sirens sounded in Israel for the second day running, warning of an incoming missile launched by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, who say the attacks are in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Air defences intercepted the missile.Separately, Israel’s military said on Saturday its forces deployed in southern Syria were ready to protect the Druze minority, without specifying whether this was a new deployment or giving further details on the number of troops on the ground.After deadly sectarian clashes near Damascus earlier this week,Israel has conducted multiple strikes it says were meant to protect the Druze communityand warned Syria’s Islamist rulers against harming the minority group.On Saturday, the Israeli military said that “five Syrian Druze citizens were evacuated to receive medical treatment in Israel overnight” after sustaining injuries on Syrian territory.A Druze official in the southern Syrian city Sweida said those evacuated had been wounded “in clashes in Sahnaya”, the site of recent sectarian violence near Damascus, but were afraid of being sent to hospitals in the Syrian capital out of fear of being detained.Israel launched a new wave of more than 20 airstrikes in Syria late on Friday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group. Early on Friday, Israel had launched an attack near the presidential palace in Damascus, which Syrian authorities condemned as a“dangerous escalation”.Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, warned on Thursday that Israel would respond forcefully if Syria’s new government failed to protect the Druze minority.Since the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in December, Israel has launched repeated airstrikes on Syria. It has also sent troops to what was a demilitarised zone in theGolan Heights, on Syria’s south-west border with Israel, seizing key strategic terrain where Syrian troops were once deployed.Analysts in Israel say the strategy aims to undermine the new Syrian government while also protecting and so co-opting a potential proxy ally within the country. The strategy is controversial, however, with some officials arguing that a stable Syria would better serve Israel’s interests.The government in Damascus took power after ousting Assad and is dominated by the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which has its roots in al-Qaida’s jihadist network. Though Syria’s new rulers have promised inclusive rule in the multiconfessional, multi-ethnic country, they face pressures from extremists within their own ranks.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaGazaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Al Shawa has only been able to communicate with her grandchildren on video calls.The family, who now live in Glasgow, fledSyriain 2015. They had lost their baby after a bombing at their home in Damascus and were unable to take Al Hamwi’s mother with them.The Home Office rejected an application for a refugee family reunion made after the terminal cancer diagnosis, which Al Shawa received towards the end of last year. The family appealed and a judge in the first-tier tribunal of the immigration court agreed in April.The family were overjoyed and relayed the news to Al Shawa, who began to make preparations to come to the UK. But they were devastated when the Home Office sought permission to appeal against the judge’s ruling; a move Al Hamwi said was “breaking my heart”. The further appeal may have taken about eight months – time doctors do not expect Al Shawa to have.But now the Home Office has told the family’s lawyer it is withdrawing its application, that the grandmother can come to the UK, and that it will expedite the issuing of a visa. The family are hoping it will be processed at a centre in neighbouring Jordan this weekend and then Amonajid will collect Al Shawa her from there.Refugeesare not permitted to return to the country they fled, so Al Hamwi and Amonajid cannot re-enter Syria to be with Al Shawa there.“My mum really perked up when she heard the news and started to eat more,” said Al Hamwi. “All she wants to do before she dies is to see us and the kids.”Amonajid welcomed the Home Office U-turn and the indication that it will expedite the visa. “I appreciate the Home Office for listening to Ola and me,” he said. “The kids are so excited they are finally going to meet their grandmother. She will be sleeping in their bedroom and they are fighting over who will sleep next to her.”The family’s solicitor, Usman Aslam of Mukhtar & Co, said: “We welcome the Home Office decision to withdraw from this case and, moreover, to assist in expediting it. We now hope that a daughter and mother can spend whatever time the mother has left together. Refugees are no different from anyone else. They too have lives, families and dignity.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

By giving clinicians a comprehensive view of patient pathways, we can identify and address delays immediately.NHS cancer patients denied life-saving drugs due to Brexit costs, report findsRead more“As Cancer 360 expands to more hospitals nationwide, I’m confident we’ll see meaningful improvements in both treatment times and patient experience.”It is understood that trusts will not be forced to use the tool, but those not meeting NHS standards on cancer – including that 85% of cancer patients should have started their treatment within 62 days of being referred – may be asked to consider how Cancer 360 could help them meet targets.The DHSC said Cancer 360, as well as helping patients get a faster diagnosis, would help cut treatment delays and thus boost survival rates.Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, welcomed the rollout, saying: “With nearly 3.5 million people living with cancer in the UK – a number that continues to rise – the need for faster diagnosis and timely treatment has never been more urgent.“Too many people still face unacceptable disparities in their cancer care, from diagnosis to treatment and support. We welcome the rollout of any technology that will help improve outcomes, reduce delays, and give people with cancer greater control over their wellbeing.”Prof Phil Banfield, the council chair at the British Medical Association, said: “Initiatives like this show great promise in bringing disjointed, disconnected, and outdated NHS systems into the 21st century.”He added: “For these reforms to really make a difference though, we need to make sure the health service has the wider investment and staff that it needs to benefit from these advances.”The technology has been piloted at Royal United hospital in Bath, and Chelsea and Westminster hospital. It was said to have helped the latter meet the faster diagnosis standard, whereby 75% of patients should receive a diagnosis or ruling out of cancer within 28 days of referral.The technology secretary, Peter Kyle, said: “I’ve seen first-hand the stress and heartbreak that cancer causes in my own family.“Dependent on archaic pen-and-paper systems, life-saving diagnostics appointments hung on whether a Post-it note lost its stick, or a piece of paper went missing. That put lives at risk. And, with the technology we have today, there’s no reason for any part of our healthcare service to run in such a way.”The health secretary, Wes Streeting, said the government was investing £26bn in the NHS, adding: “It’s a long road but we’re already getting our NHS back on its feet, giving patients over 3 million more appointments, hiring 1,500 new GPs and starting the rollout of new tech that will save lives.”Explore more on these topicsCancerHealthNHSEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The party also won two mayoral races and secured a fifth MP in Runcorn and Helsby with Sarah Pochin.Responding to Farage’s comments,Unisongeneral secretary Christina McAnea said: “Unions are there to ensure no one can play fast and loose with the law.“Any staff working for councils now controlled by Reform, and who aren’t yet members, should sign up so they can be protected too.”Farage has said he wants a British equivalent of Doge – referring to the Elon Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, which is slashing government spending in the US, in every council.“We want to give council tax payers better value for money. We want to reduce excessive expenditure,” he said.On Saturday, a newly elected Reform UK councillor said Durham county council would be “getting the auditors in” right away to slash spending in areas like net zero and green initiatives.“We’re getting the auditors in to see … actually what those jobs are, and if they’re good value for money, and if they’re not, well, the answer is, ‘Yeah, goodbye’,” Darren Grimes, a Durham councillor and former GB News presenter told the Today programme.McAnea said the new Reform UK councillors have “much to learn about local government” and will “quickly discover there’s nothing left to cut and many authorities are balancing on the edge of the financial precipice”.She said: “This is not the US. Thankfully, workers in the UK have laws to protect them from bad employers.“And soon employees will get even more protection from unscrupulous bosses when the government’s new employment rights come in.“Most local authorities would love to be doing their core work, as Mr Farage says. But they simply don’t have the staff nor the resources to do even that.”The newly elected Greater Lincolnshire mayor, Andrea Jenkyns, has also cited her intentions to cut inclusion officers at the authority. She secured her position after receiving nearly 40,000 more votes than the Conservative candidate, Rob Waltham.A source from Staffordshire county council, which converted to Reform after the party secured 49 seats in this week’s election, told the Guardian that the authority did not currently employ any staff who focused on diversity initiatives.Regarding McAnea’s comments, a Reform UK spokesperson told the Guardian: “Union members across the country voted for Reform UK on Thursday.“Instead of attacking us, they should try and understand why so many of their members are supporting us and joining as members.”Explore more on these topicsUnisonTrade unionsNigel FarageReform UKWorkers' rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

We ask that their privacy be respected at this time.”Jenkins said a cordon was in place while police carried out inquiries to establish “the full circumstances surrounding the incident” and said officers would be in the area to “offer reassurance to the public”.Anyone who has information that could help the investigation has been urged to contact Northumbria police by sending a direct message on social media or by using the “live chat” or “report” functions on theforce’s website.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is the 16th state to make all students eligible to receive public funds for private education.“Today is the culmination of a movement that has swept across our state and across our country,” Abbott said during a signing ceremony at the governor’s mansion. “The day has arrived that empowers parents to choose the school that’s best for their child.”The so-called universal school choice programs are all in states whose legislatures are dominated by Republicans, who for years have accused public schools of indoctrinating children with liberal ideology.Advocates say school vouchers put control of children’s education into the hands of parents. Opponents say they drain money from public schools and predominantly benefit wealthier children. More than 1 million US students use state money or benefit from tax credits to pay for private school, according to EdChoice, an advocacy group supporting vouchers. The new Texas law means all 5.3 million children in the state’s elementary and high schools are eligible for vouchers, far more than in any other US state. Texas has the country’s second-largest public education system. About 50 million students are taught in public schools across the US, according to federal data. Donald Trump signed executive orders in January directing the Department of Education to prioritize federal funding for school choice programs and instruct states on how to use federal grants to support private and religious schools.Trump strongly supported the Texas bill and repeatedly urged legislators to pass it. Most Texas students are now eligible for up to $10,000 a year to attend private schools beginning in the 2026-27 school year. The law requires private school students to take a nationally recognized standardized test, and annual audits of schools that accept vouchers. No more than 20% of the voucher program spending can go to families making 500% or more of the federal poverty limit, which amounts to a household income of about $160,000 for a family of four.Supporters have pushed for school vouchers in Texas for more than 30 years. Until this year, Democratic opponents allied with rural Republicans who cited concerns that funding private schools would drain funds from public districts in small towns with few private schools.Abbott organized pro-school-choice Republicans to challenge anti-voucher Republicans in primaries in last year’s elections. His efforts helped unseat 15 incumbent Republican House members.“No other governor has led on school choice like Governor Abbott,” said Jorge Borrego, the K-12 education policy director at the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation.Borrego noted that Abbott had also pushed the legislature to hike public school funding. A separate bill passed by the Texas House and sitting before the Senate would hike funding for public schools by $7.7bn over the next two years.The new funding would certainly be welcomed, said Libby Cohen, executive director of Raise Your Hand Texas, an education advocacy group long opposed to vouchers.“But what’s important to keep in context is, for public schools to simply keep up with inflation since 2019, they would need just shy of $20bn in new school funding,” she said.Texas ranks 47th in the country in per-pupil spending, according to the National Education Association’s annual report released this week.Texas schools receive funding based upon how many students they have, as is typical across the US. If public schools lose students to private educators because of vouchers, they will lose money, Cohen said.White House opens inquiry into Chicago school program aimed at helping Black studentsRead moreRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, said the Trump administration is “threatening to slash funding to the neediest students” by withholding federal money for schools that engage in diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.The Texas law will send “billions of dollars to private schools that can pick and choose who they educate”, she said.Jon Valant, director of the Brookings Institution’s Brown Center on Education Policy, said the push for universal voucher systems in conservative states is more worrying than Trump’s effort to shut the Department of Education.Voucher payments rarely cover the full cost of private schools, meaning only richer families can participate, he said. “That could mean we end up with a terribly stratified school system where those who can afford to pay the difference are in a wealthy private system, while the public school system is left to crumble.“In a joint statement from the conservative Heritage Foundation thinktank, Lindsey Burke, director of its Center for Education Policy, and research fellow Jason Bedrick said the law “empowers families to choose the learning environments that align with their values and work best for their children”.Explore more on these topicsUS newsUS educationTexasSchoolsnewsShareReuse this content"

They already face the prospect of years in prison after they were convicted of federal charges last year.Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, fled a January 2023 traffic stop after he was yanked out of his car, pepper-sprayed and hit with a stun gun. Five officers who are also Black caught up with him and punched, kicked and hit Nichols with a police baton, struggling to handcuff him as he called out for his mother near his home.Memphis police ‘regularly violate constitution’, says justice departmentRead moreFootage of the beating captured by a police camera also showed the officers milling about, talking and laughing as Nichols struggled. His death led to nationwide protests, calls for police reforms in the US and intense scrutiny of police inMemphis, a majority-Black city.The officers are charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression. Prosecutors have argued that the officers used excessive force in trying to handcuff Nichols. The officers also had a duty to intervene and stop the beating and tell medical personnel that Nichols had been struck in the head, but they failed to do so, prosecutors say.Former Memphis officers Desmond Mills Jr and Emmitt Martin also were charged in the case. They have agreed to plead guilty to the state charges and are not standing trial. They also pleaded guilty in federal court, where sentencing for all five officers is pending.Defense attorneys have sought to chip away at accusations that the officers used unnecessary force to subdue Nichols. They have argued that Nichols was actively resisting arrest by running away and failing to give his hands to officers so that he could be handcuffed. They also have argued that their use of force complied with police department policies.Cameron was called to the stand by the defense lawyer for Haley, who was at the traffic stop and arrived at the location of the beating after Martin had kicked and punched Nichols in the head as Nichols was being held by Smith and Bean.Cameron said Nichols had not yet been handcuffed and Haley used proper force in kicking Nichols once in the arm. The veteran police trainer said Haley kicked Nichols in order to facilitate the handcuffing of Nichols by the other officers.However, under cross-examination by prosecutor Paul Hagerman, Cameron acknowledged that the punches and kicks by Martin to Nichols’ head had been unnecessary, excessive and an example of deadly force. Officers who saw those head blows had had a duty to intervene and stop the beating at that point, Cameron said.The prosecutor also asked Cameron about Haley’s comment to “beat that man” as he got out of his car and approached Nichols. Cameron said he believed Haley made the comment in order to get Nichols to comply with being handcuffed after Nichols repeatedly ignored expletive-laced orders to do so.Mills, who hit Nichols three times with a police baton, testified on Tuesday that he regrets his failure to stop the beating, which led to Nichols’s death three days later from blunt-force trauma. Dr Marco Ross, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy, testified on Wednesday that Nichols had suffered tears and bleeding in the brain.The trial comes months after the US justice department said in December that a 17-month investigation found that the Memphis police department uses excessive force and discriminates against Black people.Explore more on these topicsTyre NicholsMemphisUS policingRaceUS crimeTennesseenewsShareReuse this content"

He is 94 years old.Buffett, the fifth-richest person in the world, shocked an arena full of shareholders on Saturday when he announced that he would step down as the CEO and chair of the trillion-dollar conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway at the end of 2025. He will recommend to the 11-person board that his vice-chair, Greg Abel, who currently oversees most of the company’s investments, be named as his successor, Buffett said.The thousands of investors at the arena in Omaha,Nebraska, gave Buffett a lengthy standing ovation in recognition of his 60 years of leading the company.“I think the time has arrived where Greg should become the chief executive officer of the company at year end,” Buffett said.“I have no intention – zero – of selling one share of Berkshire Hathaway. I will give it away eventually,” Buffett said. “The decision to keep every share is an economic decision because I think the prospects of Berkshire will be better under Greg’s management than mine.”Buffett made the announcement at the end of a five-hour question-and-answer session, and did not take any queries about his retirement plans. The only board members who knew about the announcement in advance were his children, Howard and Susie Buffett, he said. Abel, who was sitting next to Buffett on stage, was unaware, but stood to join the crowd in applauding his boss.Abel, 62, who was born in Alberta, Canada, has been Buffett’s designated successor as CEO since 2001. He is a 25-year Berkshire veteran and already manages all of the conglomerate’s non-insurance businesses including dozens of fossil energy, chemical, real estate and retail operations. But despite Buffett’s advanced age, the announcement came as a shock as the Berkshire CEO previously insisted that he had no plans to retire.Buffett has led the Omaha-based company since 1965, and is credited by many with transforming Berkshire from a flailing textiles manufacturer into a $1.03tn conglomerate with dozens of businesses in insurance, railroad, energy and other sectors.Buffett, a Democrat, has previously said that heplans to donate99.5% of his remaining wealth to a charitable trust overseen by his daughter and two sons when he dies. According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $165.3bn.Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.Buffett said Trump’s trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.“We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s unclear what impact Trump’s tariffs will have on Berkshire’s 189 operating businesses and shareholder profits.Buffett, a longtime Democratic mover and shaker, did not endorse Kamala Harris in 2024 or Joe Biden in 2020. He had previously endorsed Barack Obama twice and Hillary Clinton.Buffett has faced his share of controversies including anti-trust investigations and criticism from fire victimsafter Berkshire’s PacifiCorp utilityfailed to shut off power lines during a Labor Day weekend windstorm in 2020, leading to deadly wildfires spreading in Oregon and northern California.Speaking before the retirement bombshell, Abel said that “keeping the lights on” is no longer a priority for the conglomerate’s utilities when the threat of wildfires becomes excessive.“It’s around protecting the general public and being sure the fire doesn’t spread further,” he said.Explore more on these topicsWarren BuffettThe super-richNebraskanewsShareReuse this content"

When they look at my case, all Americans should ask themselves: what is left of our democracy, and who will be targeted next?” saidMahdawi in an op-ed for the New York Times.Mahdawi, a Palestinian human rights advocate based in Vermont, was detained and ordered deported by theTrump administrationon 14 April despite not having been prosecuted for any crime – and without due process.

Unlike the others, Mahdawi avoided being sent to a Louisiana detention facility after the Ice agents narrowly missed the flight, allowing his attorneys to challenge the deportation order in Vermont.“Despite spending 16 nights in a jail cell, I never lost hope in the inevitability of justice and the principles of democracy. I wanted to become a citizen of this country because I believe in the principles that it enshrines,” writes Mahdawi.“The American government accuses me of undermining US foreign policy, a patently absurd pretext for deportation for political speech that theTrump administrationdislikes. The government is scraping the bottom of the barrel in its attempts to smear me. My only ‘crime’ is refusing to accept the slaughter of Palestinians, opposing war and promoting peace. I have simply insisted that international law must be respected. I believe the way to a just and long-lasting peace for Palestinians and Israelis is through diplomacy and restorative justice.”Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the occupiedWest Bank, where as a child he bore witness to the death of his brother after he was denied access to medical care, and the detention and imprisonment of multiple close relatives including his grandfather and father by Israeli forces.Moving to the US in 2014 was his first experience of freedom, he said.“Ultimately, I sought American citizenship not only because I did not want to lose the freedom I enjoyed as a permanent resident but even more so because I believe in the principles and values of democracy, which this country stipulates in its founding documents,” he wrote in the Times.“These very freedoms are under attack today, both for me and for others like me.

This week, his first quarter report card came in, and the new age is off to a chaotic start.Gross domestic product (GDP)shrankfor the first time in three years during the first quarter, abruptly turning negative after a spell of robust growth as trade distortions and weaker consumer spending dampened activity.It took the US president all of 43 minutes to distance himself from the dismal reading, released on Wednesday morning.“Our Country will boom, but we have to get rid of the Biden ‘Overhang’,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, his social media platform. “This will take a while, has NOTHING TO DO WITH TARIFFS, only that he left us with bad numbers, but when the boom begins, it will be like no other. BE PATIENT!!!”By Trump’s telling, any bad numbers are the fault of Joe Biden – but this attribution does not extend to the good ones.March’s strong jobs reportdemonstrated how “the private sector is roaring back under President Donald J. Trump”, according to a statement issued by the White House. “IT’S ALREADY WORKING,” the president declared the day it was published.But April’s less buoyant jobs report,released on Friday, prompted a more tepid response. He wrote: “Just like I said, and we’re only in a TRANSITION STAGE, just getting started!!!”So which is it? Is the “golden age” of America well under way? Or will it take a while?a graph of jobs in the us from 2021 to 2025Growth in the first three months of the year – no matter how much Trump wants to blame the 19 or so days he was not yet in office – was significantly challenged by the new administration’s plans to overhaul the world economy. US goods imports surged 41% as companies scrambled to pre-empt tariffs, while consumer spending on durable goods fell 3.4% assentiment came under pressure.And the first quarter figures raised troubling questions about the second. Activity weakened largely as firms braced for the lion’s share of Trump’s tariffs, which he only unveiled in early April. How those firms, and their customers, ultimately respond to those tariffs –and the confusion around them– is widely expected to have a greater impact on growth.Trump’serratic rolloutof 10% tariffs on goods from much of the world, and 145% on China, “have altered the picture dramatically” since the end of the first quarter, Oliver Allen, senior US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, observed. “Any support to spending from pre-tariff purchases will unwind soon now that substantial new tariffs have been imposed.“Consumers’ spending will also be weighed down by a hit to confidence and real incomes from higher prices, while intense uncertainty will put the freeze on business investment, and exports – especially to China – will suffer.”a graph of quarterly change in gdp from 2021 to 2025It is too soon to say whether tariffs, which the administration insists will revitalize theUS economy, will, in fact, set the stage for a recession: two consecutive quarters of contraction. On Trump’s watch, the landscape shifts rapidly from one day to the next, let alone during an entire quarter.Trump is right, to a point: most of his tariffs are not to blame for the stunning reversal of growth in the first quarter. The US only hiked duties on China and imposed its blanket 10% levy on many other countries last month, days into the second quarter.The foundations of a potential Trumpcession were not laid in the early months of the year by the tariffs themselves, but by his administration’s execution of them.Fromrepeated jerks and joltsaround sweeping duties on Canada and Mexico to announcing “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of nations which wereultimately imposed for less than a day, widespread confusion and uncertainty is now embedded into the world’s largest economy. Businesses inside it and outarenothappy.Scott Bessent, Trump’s treasury secretary, has coined an interesting term for this playbook of threats, theatrics and social media broadsides. “President Trump creates what I would call ‘strategic uncertainty’ in the negotiations,” he told a press briefing on Tuesday. “As we start moving forward, announcing deals, then there will be certainty. But certainty is not necessarily a good thing in negotiating.”However useful Trump and his officials find “strategic uncertainty” during trade negotiations, it has different consequences for those paying bills they wererepeatedly assuredwould swiftly fall, trying to grow a business in a market with leaders locked in a war of words with the White House, or planting a crop without knowing what the economic realities will be by the harvest.a graph of s&p 500 from 2021 to 2025Trump returned to office after winning the backing of rural and lower-income voters in significant numbers last November. He needs to preserve his base if Republicans are to maintain power in Washington during his second term.Polling suggests these groups are concerned. A PBS News/NPR/Marist survey,published this week, found 48% of rural voters disapproved of Trump’s handling of the economy. The same was true for 57% of voters with a household income of less than $50,000.As apprehension grows, the US president has sought to play down the risks. In one of the more peculiar moments in another bizarre week, he appeared to play down the threat of empty store shelves.“Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls, y’know,” Trump said during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. “And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”China has “ships that are loaded up with stuff, much of which – not all of it, but much of which – we don’t need”, he continued.It is typically up to the American consumer, not their president, to decide what they do and don’t need to buy. For a man whose fortune and image are built around conspicuous consumption, the comments seemed very off-brand. “Skimp on the Barbie” read the front page of the often Trump-friendly New York Post. It is still early days for Trump. But already the Biden “overhang” argument is wearing thin. It will be up to US voters, not their president, to deliver a verdict on his handling of the economy.Explore more on these topicsUS economyDonald TrumpEconomicsTrump administrationTrump tariffsUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

According to Forbes, Buffett has a net worth of $165.3bn.Earlier on Saturday, Buffett warned about the dire global consequences of Donald Trump’s tariffs, telling thousands of investors gathered at the annual meeting that “there’s no question that trade can be an act of war”.Buffett said Trump’s trade policies have raised the risk of global instability by angering the rest of the world.“It’s a big mistake in my view when you have 7.5 billion people who don’t like you very well, and you have 300 million who are crowing about how they have done.“We should be looking to trade with the rest of the world. We should do what we do best and they should do what they do best,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Times Square event was presented by SNK Corporation (the game’s developer) and The Ring (now owned by Al-Sheikh) with Golden Boy (Oscar De La Hoya’s promotional company) as the lead promoter. Given the dangers inherent in boxing, “Fatal Fury” is a questionable name for a fight card. But SNK underwrote much of the cost of the promotion and was its primary sponsor.The fight card – headlined by three championship bouts – was part of the ongoing Saudi effort to dominate professional boxing. Times Square was chosen as the venue because it’s a magnet for media attention as “the crossroads of the world”. But the event was a study in contradictions.Saudi-backed boxing card takes over Times Square – in picturesRead moreThe most publicized fighter on the card was Ryan Garcia, who has 12.1m followers on Instagram and talent to burn. But “King Ry” has been plagued by personal demons and last year posted a series of conspiracy-theory rants on social media that focused on satanic ritual sex, aliens and time travel. He recounted being tied down and forced to watch middle-aged fat men raping young boys in Bohemian Grove, referenced his own crucifixion, spoke in tongues and told his followers that a sports drink called Prime contains cyanide and that anyone who drinks Prime is “working for Satan”.Garcia recently finished serving a one-year suspension imposed by theNew YorkState Athletic Commission as a consequence of his having tested positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug in conjunction with his fight against Devin Haney at Barclays Center last April. More troubling, on 4 July of last year, Garcia posted on X: “Fuck all niggers and Fuck all Muslims. You ain’t gonna catch me apologizing for nothing. Shoot me if you want. I don’t give a fuck. I want everybody to come try me. Somebody, please touch me. I hate niggers, I’m anti-Black. Niggers, I’m KKK, I hate niggers. Hey, let’s go bring George Floyd back to life and kill that nigger again.”That’s not the image Saudi Arabia wants to project to the world, although Garcia was on his good behavior for most of the “Fatal Fury” promotion and acknowledged at the kick-off press conference, “This is my first fight to get my respect back.”There was also a contradiction – later resolved – in that New York City has implemented a “congestion pricing” program to ease the problem of massive automobile congestion in midtown. Yet the event as initially envisioned threatened to block traffic in Times Square and cause a monstrous traffic jam.The “Fatal Fury” fight card was originally planned for Father Duffy Square – a plaza bounded by 45th and 47th Streets between Broadway and Seventh Avenue in Times Square. Initially, the promotion maintained that the event would consist of three 12-round championship fights that started at 5pm and ended by 7pm (which was impossible barring one or more early knockouts). Vehicular traffic in the immediate area would be shut down for an undetermined period of time.Ryan Garcia stunned by Rolando Romero in seismic Times Square upsetRead moreAsked on 4 March how the promotion had gotten the city to agree to shut down traffic, De La Hoya replied, “It took a lot of money.”The original permit application further stated that as many as 999 people would be allowed in a restricted area around the ring. That would include New York State Athletic Commission officials, production personnel, the fighters’ camps, selected media and VIP guests. The pedestrian plaza on Broadway between 45th and 48th Streets would be closed and an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 people would be within direct eyesight of the ring.The promotion also rented every available video screen in Times Square with the intention of showing the fights on the screens.Policing would be overseen by the New York Police Department’s Times Square detail with mobile NYPD field forces being brought in from around the city as needed.But there was pushback.The sidewalks in Times Square are jammed on Friday evenings. Tourists, theatergoers and hustlers jockey for space. People stop to watch almost anything. A street performer known as “the naked cowboy” (who wears nothing but underwear and a cowboy hat while strumming a guitar) draws hundreds of onlookers at any given time. Within that milieu, “Fatal Fury” was regarded by many in authority as a civic inconvenience.The Times Square Alliance (TSA) is a charitable 501(c)(3) corporation founded in 1992 whose stated mission is to “improve and promote Times Square”. Each year it oversees numerous outdoor events, most of which are little noticed. The exception is the New Year’s Eve ball-drop ceremony attended by hundreds of thousands of revelers and viewed throughout the world.The TSA was onboard with the concept of fights in Times Square but wanted to safeguard the interests of its members. As explained by its vice president for communications TJ Witham, “The Alliance works closely with the city and its agencies on events to make sure all goes smoothly and that our neighborhood can continue to operate while the event is happening.”View image in fullscreenFans gathered in Times Square outside the fenced-in arena hoping to catch a glimpse of the action.Photograph: Frank Franklin II/APIn other words; the Times Square Alliance wanted to minimize disruption and maintain uninterrupted access to theatres, restaurants and other commercial establishments. In late-March, according to a source at the NYPD, the TSA told De La Hoya to stop encouraging fight fans to come to Times Square on 2 May.No event of this nature had taken place in Times Square before. And the area was a difficult site to work with. This wasn’t like producing a Super Bowl half-time show in a contained area set aside in its entirety for rehearsals and the performance itself. The project required that those in charge think outside the box and was a constantly evolving work in progress.The point person in dealing with the city on behalf of the promotion was Ed Pereira – the CEO of iVisit Media (a global marketing and event-planning company retained by Turki Al-Sheikh to coordinate the production).The guiding principle was: His Excellency wants this done. Find a way to do it.An intricate web of permits had to be woven together. Myriad New York City government departments and agencies had to sign off on the project before the event could take place. The New York City Police Department, the Mayor’s Office for Media and Entertainment and the Street Activity Permit Office had particularly large roles to play. In theory, the Mayor’s Office of Citywide Event Coordination and Management would coordinate communication and cooperation among the many city entities involved. But much of that burden fell on Pereira and iVisit’s permitting partner, Ideko (a New-York-based event production company).Pereira says that the people in city government who he dealt with were “cooperative but firm”. Within that framework, there must have been times when he felt as though putting the puzzle pieces together was akin to herding 30 cats across a football field while a game was in progress.Several significant pivots were required of the promotion.The city wanted to minimize the impact of the event on traffic and took the position that Broadway and Seventh Avenue would remain open for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic throughout the festivities.Also, since putting the fights in Father Duffy Square would have disrupted traffic, the city required that the ring be set up several blocks to the south in a smaller plaza between 43rd and 44th Streets just north of the US Army Recruiting Office. That lowered the number of seats in the ringside area from 999 to approximately 300.Then the NYPD said it didn’t want the fights shown on Times Square video screens because that would cause rubber-necking and impede the flow of traffic. There was, as described by one participant, “heated conversation” about the issue. The police prevailed.Two undercard fights were added to the card, bringing the total number of bouts to five. A revised permit application said the fights would take place between 5pm and 10pm.A modest breeze can turn Times Square into a wind tunnel. Thus, the canopy above the ring had to be specially constructed. If it rained, the boxers under the canopy would stay dry unless there were gusts of wind. Everyone else would get wet. The early-week forecast was for rain on Friday evening. Fortunately, fight night was dry.The promotion agreed to pay for private security to ensure that order was maintained inside the enclosed ring area. “We’re police officers, not bouncers,” a NYPD employee explained to the Guardian.The city also said that final permits wouldn’t be officially granted until shortly before the event which gave the city considerable leverage in negotiations and diminished the possibility of a late “bait and switch” by the promotion.A 10-foot-high chain link fence covered with a liner so pedestrians and drivers couldn’t see inside was erected around the plaza where the fights would take place. From the outside, the area could have been mistaken for a construction site.Seats inside the ringside area were hard to come by. Some went to New York State Athletic Commission officials and video production personnel. A handful were reserved for fighters’ camps with the unusual restriction that a fighter’s family and friends (usually limited to five per fighter) were escorted by security personnel into the restricted area just before that fighter’s fight and escorted out immediately afterward to make room for the next group of family and friends.View image in fullscreenFriday’s fights played out in front of a live audience of about 300 spectators.Photograph: Frank Franklin II/APThe rest of the seats were reserved for people who worked for the promotion and VIP guests (who were gifted a fight-night credential in a specially designed box).The Intercontinental Hotel one block west of Times Square was the staging ground for the fighters on fight night. Each fighter had a police escort from the hotel to the ring – the only time that vehicular traffic was stopped.The fights themselveswere disappointing.Teófimo López looked exceptionally good in decisioning Arnold Barboza in the first of the evening’s three featured bouts. But Lopez was so dominant and Barboza’s survival skills were sufficiently good that there wasn’t much drama in the encounter. Next, Devin Haney stunk out the joint, winning a 12-round decision by avoiding confrontations against a slow, past-his-prime José Ramírez who couldn’t figure out how to cut off the ring against a faster opponent who didn’t want to engage. Then Ryan Garcia looked sluggish and out-of-shape in losing a unanimous decision to 8-1 underdog Rolly Romero in a dreary 12-round contest. That spoiled plans for a rematch between Garcia and Haney later this year.In sum, the event was an impressive logistical accomplishment. But it was more hype and glitz than special.Turki al-Sheikh is said to be eyeing 12 July and a yet to be determined date in August for two more fight cards in New York. There’s talk that the first of these events will be held in Central Park (possibly at Wollman Rink) and the second in Brooklyn. Fight cards at Alcatraz and Mt Rushmore are in the early planning stages.And a final thought …The powers that be behind the Times Square event said again and again that they were doing it because they wanted to do something “special and iconic for the fans”.This wasn’t done “for the fans”. It was done to make the biggest media splash possible by putting a fight card in Times Square. It wasn’t a civic event like the New Year’s Eve ball drop – a group happening that focuses worldwide attention on New York and brings millions of tourist dollars into the city. It wasn’t “for the people” like the historic Simon & Garfunkel concert on the Great Lawn in Central Park attended by an estimated 500,000 people.Only a handful of privileged guests had tickets for the Times Square fight card. That’s the equivalent of staging Muhammad Ali v George Foreman at President Mobutu Sese Seko’s private compound in Zaire in front of several hundred VIP guests instead of in the Stade du 20 Mai before 60,000 screaming fans.Boxing was “for the fans” when Joe Louis fought Max Schmeling at Yankee Stadium in front of 70,043 enthralled spectators.Boxingwas “for the fans” when Jack Dempsey fought Luis Firpo at the Polo Grounds (82,000 fans), George Carpentier at Boyle’s Thirty Acres (80,183 fans) and Gene Tunney at Sesquicentennial Stadium (the staggering total of 120,757 fans). Boxing was “for the fans” when Don King put 132,247 wildly enthusiastic partisans in seats for Julio Cesar Chavez v Greg Haugen in Mexico City’s Azteca Stadium.And let’s not forget; this was a pay-per-view event. An expensive one.Earlier this year, Turki al-Sheikh promised fight fans that Riyadh Season would cut the cost of pay-per-view fights significantly and made good on that pledge by pricing a very good fight card headed by the rematch between Artur Beterbiev and Dmitry Bivol at $25.99 in the United States. But that gesture was short-lived. The Times Square pay-per-view event was priced at $59.99. Alternatively, fans could pay $90 and also see a card headlined by Canelo Álvarez v William Scull (a 25-1 underdog) the following night.The New Year’s Eve celebration in Times Square isn’t on pay-per-view.Thomas Hauser’s email address isthomashauserwriter@gmail.com.

He went on to become one of the PGA Tour’s longest hitters and one of the top Black golfers of his generation.Dent died on Friday at age 85, a week before his birthday, his grandson posted on Facebook. The PGA Tour said on its website that Dent suffered a stroke the day after Augusta National announced plans for Tiger Woods to design a par 3 course at The Patch.“What I learned about playing golf has probably kept me all through life,” Dent told the USGA for a story in 2012. “You had to be honest. You had to work at it. You just couldn’t pick up today and not come back ’til next week. And if you broke a rule, you had to turn yourself in.”Dent worked hard enough on his game that he entered a few United Golfers Association tournaments, a league devoted to Black players, moved to California and took lessons from former US Open champion Johnny Goodman.He finally earned his PGA Tour card through qualifying school in 1970, and while he never won on tour, he kept a full schedule of at least 22 tournaments for the next 16 years. His best result was in the 1972 Walt Disney World Open Invitational, when he trailed Jack Nicklaus by two shots going into the final round. Nicklaus shot 64 and won by nine.Dent won the Michelob-Chattanooga Gold Cup Classic in 1983, a Tournament Players Series event for players who were not fully exempt – the tour had gone to the all-exempt tour that year instead of the majority of the field going through Monday qualifying.Dent never met any of the qualifying criteria to play in the Masters, but he made the cut in eight of the 11 majors he played – six at the PGA Championship, five at the US Open.He was best known for his prodigious length, and Dent won the inaugural World Long Drive Championship in 1974.After turning 50, he won 12 times on the PGA Tour Champions. Al Geiberger said after Dent shot 64 to win his first Champions event, “Jim Dent ought to be outlawed (for) the way he can hit the ball.”“A lot of people will remember Jim Dent for how far he hit the ball, and he really did,” said Miller Brady, president of the PGA Tour Champions. “Yet his long-term success, especially on our tour, proved Jim was more than just long off the tee.”The fourth of six children, Dent lost both parents by the time he was 12 and was raised by his aunt, Mary Benton. She was opposed to him caddying at The Patch and told him, “If you learn how to caddie, you’re going to learn how to gamble.”“Kids think they’re the smartest people in the world,” Dent said in the USGA story. “Second thing I learned how to do when I learned how to caddie was shoot dice and play cards. She was dead right.”He worked at Augusta Country Club, and Dent recalled how caddies could play if they were willing to cut crabgrass out of the greens. Among the players he caddied for at Augusta National for the Masters were Bob Goalby and Bob Rosburg.Augusta named the road leading into The Patch as Jim Dent Way in 2020 as a tribute. Two years later, Dent was inducted into the Caddie Hall of Fame.His son, Jim Dent Jr, now is the head pro at The Patch.Augusta National is pouring support into upgrading the municipal course under the work of architects Tom Fazio and Beau Welling. It will include a longer, conditioned course with a new short-game area and clubhouse. Woods is designing a Par 3 course called the Loop at The Patch to honor Augusta National caddies who played there.Explore more on these topicsGolfPGA TourUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Certainly he could do no more than the complete commitment he demonstrated in delivering a remarkable lap for pole position at the Miami Grand Prix. He was equally pleased in the process to be able to confirm that becoming a new father had had no impact on his pace, but the world champion remained unequivocal that he still expected more from his Red Bull team after they were found wanting at his expense inSaturday’s sprint race.Verstappen claimed pole with an immense lap at the Hard Rock stadium, in what was an enormously competitive session. Anything short of perfection would have been costly and he was on rails, just beating the McLaren of Lando Norris into second and the Mercedes of Kimi Antonelli into a superb third place by the tiniest of margins, six hundredths of a second. McLaren’s Oscar Piastri was fourth and Mercedes’ George Russell fifth.McLaren’s Norris wins chaotic Miami sprint race as Hamilton grabs thirdRead moreVerstappen set the pole with a blistering final lap in Q3, threading the needle in Miami with an attacking assurance that was a reminder of just how quick he can be when he has confidence in his ride – something that has been sorely lacking on many occasions this season. The Dutch driver, who became a father for the first time with the birth of his daughter Lily in the last week, felt satisfied that he had answered suggestions bandied around that becoming a father would slow him down.“It’s been good to be able to spend a few days at home before coming here,” he said. “When she’s just born you want to make sure everything is OK. Clearly it didn’t make me slower as well, being a dad, so that’s a positive. We can throw that out of the window as well for people mentioning it.”This was also the perfect comeback for the world champion after he was penalised in the sprint race for an unsafe release in the pit lane, dropping him from fourth to 17th place. With Norris and Piastri taking a one-two it dropped Verstappen to 21 points behind Piastri in the world championship but, with the pole, he has a great opportunity to claw some of it back on Sunday.He was unsurprisingly pleased, especially with track position being so crucial in Miami. After managing only sixth in Bahrain with a car that lacked balance and a pit stop problem, he was blunt that he did not believe he could compete for the title as things stood. The team had held discussions after that race to consider how best to address the issues but have been honest in that no quick fix was expected, with a disconnect between wind tunnel predictions and real world performance at the heart of their inability to solve the problems.Yet they came back well with pole and second in Saudi Arabia and had been hopeful of further improvement from the new floor they brought to Miami and it appears it has, at very least over the single lap, narrowed the gap to McLaren.Verstappen acknowledged as much but maintained the team could ill-afford any errors.“We need to make less mistakes and we need to find more performance,” he said. “I think it’s quite straightforward, it’s just not easy to extract or find. That’s how it is, but we keep pushing, keep trying to bring bits to the car to make it faster.“What we are trying to achieve is a better balance in the car. Now this track is not always the easiest to say that you have improved or nailed something, because it’s just a really weird layout but it was not negative. From my feeling we’re not there yet. We need quite a bit more to be really in a fight.”Verstappen opened strongly on his first run in Q3, very quick through the opening two sectors and Piastri could not quite match him, just one hundredth of a second down. Norris, however, was on real form, especially in the middle sector but was also just pipped, three-thousandths of a second back in second.View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton was knocked out in Q2.Photograph: Mario Renzi/Formula 1/Getty ImagesFor the final runs it was still all to play for as the track rubbered in and Verstappen went out and duly went quicker, Norris could not quite match him in the opening sector and nor could Piastri.Verstappen had provisional pole as Norris went quicker in the middle sector but could not quite pull it off for the final third after he took too much kerb at turn 17. Piastri did not improve, while Antonelli delivered another superb lap to claim third for Mercedes. Verstappen’s time of 1 minute 26.204 seconds was just six-hundredths up on both Norris and Antonelli.The pole may prove key for the race in what remains a very closely fought title fight, where Piastri leads Norris by just nine points with Verstappen in third.Lewis Hamilton’s hopes of a strong qualifying after taking third in the sprint were dashed as he failed to make it to Q3, going out in 12th, his first exit in Q2 since he joined Ferrari this year.Carlos Sainz and Alex Albon were sixth and seventh for Williams, Charles Leclerc eighth for Ferrari, Esteban Ocon ninth for Haas and Yuki Tsunoda tenth forRed Bull.

There was precious little rotation from the manager before Wednesday night’s Champions League, semi-final second leg away against Paris Saint-Germain, the tie that cast long shadows here. Arteta wanted to keep his starters in the groove, to generate momentum for the Parc des Princes with a win. So much for the theory.Arteta rested Jurrien Timber, who had picked up a minor knock in the1-0 first-leg defeat against PSGbut that apart, he went with pretty much his best available line-up. It was certainly a contrast to the approach of his PSG counterpart, Luis Enrique, who made 10 changes for his team’s Ligue 1 game at Strasbourg. PSG, who have already sewn up the title, lost 2-1.Arteta’s refusal to ring Arsenal changes keeps doom spiral firmly locked in | Ed AaronsRead moreIt was looking good for Arsenal when Declan Rice marked his 100th appearance for the club with the opening goal on 34 minutes. Arteta had recalled Thomas Partey after his European suspension and his presence had a liberating effect on Rice in midfield, allowing him to play in his more familiar driving role.And yet it would all come crashing down for Arsenal as Andoni Iraola oversaw a stunningBournemouthturnaround from the midway point of the second-half – basically from the moment he introduced Antoine Semenyo and Alex Scott from the substitutes’ bench. That said, his Bournemouth team had asked questions before then.Bournemouth had only ever tasted defeat in away matches against Arsenal. But they would depart with a victory that gave their hopes of a first ever European qualification a tonic. It was almost a footnote that it also added up to aPremier Leaguedouble over Arsenal – after their 2-0 home win over them last October.View image in fullscreenDeclan Rice gives Arsenal the lead.Photograph: John Walton/PASemenyo was the provider for the equaliser, his long throw headed home by Dean Huijsen and Scott was behind what proved to be the winner, his corner bundled in by Evanilson. Did the striker use a hand? Arteta thought so but the VAR, after a lengthy check, gave the all-clear. At long last, Bournemouth had caught a break from the technology; Evanilson, too. He was sent off in last weekend’s1-1 home draw against Manchester Unitedon the advice of the VAR; a decision thatwas later rescinded.Bournemouth were 1-0 up at the time.Iraola’s team are realistically chasing an eighth-placed finish, which could be enough for a place in next season’s Uefa Conference League. Their belief has soared – in stark contrast to that of Arsenal.The north London club are supposed to be the set-piece kings but the concessions here were their 11th and 12th from dead-ball deliveries in the league this season. Even more worrying, it was the tenth game in which they had led and failed to win; a total of 21 points squandered. In only one previous season have they thrown away as many points from winning positions, which was in 2019-20. Could Arsenal yet find themselves looking over their shoulders for a top-five finish and a return to next season’s Champions League?It was the worst possible outcome for Arteta, going strong with his selection and getting nothing, even if he could enjoy the performance of Rice, whose desire to surge forward was an impossible-to-miss detail. Rice lacked end product initially but it did not affect him. He kept coming and his finish for the breakthrough goal was clinical; never in doubt from the moment he fastened on to Martin Ødegaard’s reverse ball and ran around Kepa Arrizabalaga. Ødegaard had found the space on the half turn following a pass from Partey.Quick GuideArsenal v Bournemouth match statsShow• This was the first time Bournemouth have ever avoided defeat away against Arsenal in all competitions (L8).• Arsenal have dropped 21 points from winning positions in the Premier League this season, their joint-most ever in a single campaign (also 21 in 2019-20).• Dean Huijsen’s equaliser was Bournemouth’s first shot on target in this match, and their first Premier League goal from a throw-in since  2017.• Declan Rice made his 100th appearance for Arsenal in all competitions. His opener was his 15th goal for the club, as many goals as he managed in 245 games for West Ham.OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.It was a sickener for Bournemouth, for whom this was arguably a bigger game given their European aspirations via the league. They played a full part in a lively first half and they created the first big chance, Evanilson heading high from Milos Kerkez’s whipped cross on 26minutes. He was all alone in front of goal having given Jakub Kiwior the slip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But they still needed William Saliba to stretch into a last-man slide tackle on Dango Ouattara before Rice’s goal. There was also the moment in first-half stoppage time when David Raya erred with a pass out from the back and Evanilson had the chance to measure a chip with the goalkeeper off his line. He overcooked it.Iraola was an animated presence throughout. He watched Arsenal bring the intensity at the start of the second half, Bukayo Saka going close with a curling shot but then came the substitutions that changed everything. Semenyo’s first act was to blaze up the right only to show too much of the ball to Saliba, who cleared for a throw-in.View image in fullscreenDean Huijsen’s header beats David Raya to bring Bournemouth level.Photograph: Crystal Pix/MB Media/Getty ImagesThe Bournemouth winger’s next act was to hurl the throw-in into the box whereupon Huijsen, drifting back from near the goal to the six-yard line, craned his neck to direct his header home. It was a stunning piece of athleticism and precision.Bournemouth sensed blood. Marcus Tavernier, who Iraola had moved from the right to the No 10 position after Semenyo’s introduction, went close with a shot that deflected over. When Scott curled over the corner, Bournemouth forged ahead. Tavernier won the flick-on and Evanilson was stronger than Ødegaard at the far post, managing to get something to the ball, forcing it home. Raya was guilty of a fumble into the bargain. Arsenal were broken.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueArsenalBournemouthmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Those who do not think they are corrupt, think they are incompetent. Standards, apparently, have never been lower. Clubs and their fans rage about conspiracies. But even in the present context, the scenes at the end of lastSaturday’s Copa del Rey finalwere unprecedented as Antonio Rüdigerthrew an ice-packat the referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea.And to think this is a club that used to pride itself on its sense of itsseñorio, its gentlemanliness, to the extent that in Steve McManaman’s day players were given a code of conduct; the familiar line used to be whinging about referees was for thecry-babies of Barcelona.But this season alone Real Madrid haveboycotted the Ballon d’Or ceremonyafter it became apparent that Vinícius Júnior would not win, allegeda refereeing conspiracyagainst them and thenrefused to perform pre-match media dutiesbefore the Copa del Rey final while fuelling rumours that they would not turn up for the game.Real Madrid TV had also, as it does with all referees before every game, highlighted past decisions De Burgos Bengoetxea had made against them, reducing him to tears in his pre-match media appearances. In the heat of the moment, players do occasionally lose the run of themselves, even if not quite as shamefully as Rüdiger did. Far more toxic are those destructive acts of pettiness instituted at executive level, not least because they create an environment in which players and fans, conditioned to believe they are being persecuted, are far more likely to react badly.View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s president, Florentino Pérez.Photograph: Real Madrid TV/EPAAt the heart of it all, the ageing general in his labyrinth, sits Florentino Pérez, who has been Madrid president for all but three years of this century. He has been wildly successful, with seven Champions League titles and a revenue 25% higher than that ofthe next wealthiest club in the worldand yet he is at war with everybody, a 78-year-old watching the world changing around him, insisting it is all fixed against him.It is an ancient theme but this is a very modern story of populism and propaganda, of the failure of traditional journalism and the rise of social media, of hyper-partisanship and self-interested power destroying a culture.It was startling during the Super League fiasco to see how Pérez’s nonsense would be faithfully reported by a complaisant local media, even as the rest of the world saw delusion. But even Marca and AS are not so wholeheartedly supportive any more, with the reliablymadridistaAS editor Alfredo Relaño, writing a column for El País last week in which he criticised Pérez for not pursuing Barcelona harder for having José María Enríquez Negreira, the then vice-president of the referees technical committee, on their payroll between 2003 and 2010.In other times, it is possible to imagine Madrid making more of Barcelona’s shambolic financial situation, the questionable audits and the reluctance of Uefa to take action against them. But Pérez needs Barcelona, because they are the only club left backing his doomed Super League project.Lose Joan Laporta and Pérez would be completely alone. He has messed up another great side: just as the team that had won two Champions Leagues in the early 2000s was undermined by the sale of Claude Makélélé, the preference for celebrity over balance, so the team that won the league and Champions League last season has been undone by the failure to replace Toni Kroos and by the addition of Kylian Mbappé, a third left-sided forward who wants to cut in and struggles to perform defensive duties.That is not the only failure. The renovated Bernabéu may look impressively futuristic, but it cost €1.76bn (£1.51bn). VIP boxes have not been built and concerts cannot be staged there after protests from neighbours; two of the income streams that could have helped pay off the debt have been severely compromised.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The refusal to perform media duties before the Copa del Rey final was part of a broader pattern. Rights holders paid to have their studios in the ground and to conduct post-match player interviews, Madrid deny them and yet nothing is done. There is a staggering and highly corrosive lack of responsibility or self-reflection, while Madrid fill the gap with influencers who produce content rather than performing the journalistic duty of holding power to account.Decline on the pitch has been followed by decline off it. There is a temptation to trace this back to José Mourinho’s time at the club. He was not the first manager to inhabit a post-truth world, but he was the first openly to acknowledge that a game begins in the press conference that follows the previous match. But he was a symptom not a cause. One of the reasons Barcelona rejected Mourinho in 2008 and Manchester United rejected him in 2013 was a fear that he did not fit the values of the club. For Madrid, the situation in 2010, with Barcelona rampant and Pep Guardiola reinventing football, was so dire they felt they could not afford such morality. What followed were two years of sulphurous battle that did eventually topple Barça and Guardiola, but at enormous cost.Madrid knew what Mourinho would do; they appointed him with their eyes open. Perhaps his example broke down some barriers and made it easier for the club once again to embrace self-interested petulance, but he was brought in by Pérez because Madrid were losing; he did not infect them. And now Madrid are losing again, Pérez has once again started lashing out at enemies, some real, but most imagined, most useful fictions to explain away the club’s decline.Add in the baleful influence of social media, and the modern tendency for people to pick a side and support them no matter what, and the result is a tribalism so toxic that it renders football effectively ungovernable and potentially, given the absurd pressures on referees, unplayable.One of the reasons the Victorians saw sport as having an educational role was that it taught equanimity in defeat. Not to know how to lose is childish, yet it is a lesson a septuagenarian in Madrid has seemingly still not learned.Explore more on these topicsReal MadridInside footballRefereesCopa del ReycommentShareReuse this content"

However, Arne Slot’s thoughts are already turning towards next season’s title defence. “It’s the end of the season,” he said on Friday, “but we also have to look at this as the start of next season.”With that in mind, theLiverpoolhead coach plans “a certain rotation” for the champions’ final four games against Chelsea, Arsenal, Brighton and Crystal Palace. Having stuck with the same core group throughout the title-winning campaign, here is a look at the changes Slot could, and should, have lined up:The Alexander-Arnold successionWhile there remains even the remotest possibility of persuading Trent Alexander-Arnold to follow Mohamed Salah and Virgil van Dijk in signing a new contract – and nothing is done until his signature is on a Liverpool or Real Madrid contract – then the first choice right-back starts and is made to feel as much a part of the club’s future as its successful present. Any move to the contrary could be seen as an admission of defeat in Liverpool’s efforts to score a hat-trick of key contract extensions.View image in fullscreenShould Trent Alexander-Arnold head to Real Madrid in the summer, Liverpool must keep a pathway open for academy talent, such as Conor Bradley.Photograph: Kieran McManus/ShutterstockShould that fight be lost, however, then Conor Bradley gets the game-time that Slot admits the Northern Ireland international desperately needs. The 21-year-old has shown he possesses the talent and temperament to replace Alexander-Arnold should the latter head to the Bernabéu, and Liverpool are always mindful of keeping a pathway open for academy talent.But Bradley’s body needs testing with a consistent run of games. He missed the title-clinching defeat of Tottenham with a training-ground knock and remains a slight doubt for Sunday’s visit to Chelsea. He had only just returned from a second hamstring injury of the season, too. Bradley’s longest run in the team under Slot is two games and he has been substituted in six of 11 starts in all competitions.Two games per week, every week at the highest level, represents a considerable step up. As Slot admitted: “It is going to be very important for him to become an even better player than he is now to play many games in a row. Unfortunately for him, there is another full-back who is world class at this club as well with Trent Alexander-Arnold. That is probably the only reason he hasn’t played back-to-back-to-back games yet because he definitely has the quality to do so.“I think the next step for him in his development is to play every single week and feel that pressure. Then, at a certain moment, it probably doesn’t feel like pressure any more. That might be his next step but as long as Trent is here, it’s going to be a difficult step for him to make.”Give Endo and Elliott overdue startsThere is no place for sentimentality in a title race but with the job done against Spurs and Anfield in party mode, Slot decided to show a little. The head coach introduced Curtis Jones, Diogo Jota, Wataru Endo, Harvey Elliott and Darwin Núñez in the closing stages to spread the feel of a title-clinching contest around his squad. He can now go further and hand Endo and Elliott the starts their contributions have deserved.Arne Slot hopes title triumph will help Liverpool secure transfer targetsRead moreDespite regular praise from Slot, neither player has started a Premier League game this season. The pair have hidden their understandable frustration well. Their attitude and readiness has been exemplary, even when overlooked for what appeared a clear opportunity to start, namely Southampton at home.Endo and Elliott are players that every title-winning squad depends on and a first start of the campaign would be a fitting way for Slot to show his appreciation. It would not be merely a sentimental gesture, either. How Elliott performs in the No 10 role against the calibre of Liverpool’s upcoming opponents, for example, would be a useful exercise for the Dutchman. Equally, Endo’s ability to build a rapport with Alexis Mac Allister or Ryan Gravenberch would be instructive as Liverpool and the Japan captain consider their respective options this summer.Make a decision on ChiesaThe opportunity to buy the Italy international in a £12.5m deal last summer was a punt worth taking by Liverpool, but it is fair to say the gamble has not paid off. Four Premier League substitutes appearances, with no starts and no goals in the title-winning campaign, illustrates this brutally.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa shoots but fails to score in the FA Cup third-round tie against Accrington Stanley at Anfield.Photograph: Peter Byrne/PAFederico Chiesa was not match sharp when he arrived on Merseyside, having been frozen out by Juventus in pre-season. He was brought in as cover for Mohamed Salah and, by the time he was up to speed, there was no prospect of Slot resting the phenomenal 32-year-old. Salah stepping aside in the final four games appears unlikely with the forward determined to win European football’s Golden Boot and secure his place as the Premier League’s leading goalscorer.But perhaps Chiesa could get his long-awaited opportunity in a central striking role? He made a goalscoring impact in that position when introduced against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. Liverpool will target a new centre-forward this summer and there is uncertainty over the futures of both Núñez and Jota. Chiesa could also decide to leave after only one season unless he is able to provide effective cover in a second forward position.Try a tactical experimentAbsolute belief in his methods has brought Slot this far, so he is unlikely to deviate from his approach now that his first season in English football has ended with a Premier League winner’s medal. In fact, he categorically ruled out making a tactical switch at Stamford Bridge. “No tactical changes,” Slot said on Friday. “We were off two days, trained Wednesday, were off on Thursday and now train two days. If we changed tactics after three training sessions it would end up in a mess. If we would change something in terms of tactics then pre-season is the moment for that.”So what is he looking for during the final weeks of the season? “We could maybe see a player in a certain position, what he does in that position combined with someone else,” Slot explained. “It is not going to be a big change, there’s not going to be seven or eight new starters. It’s going to be mostly the same and seeing how a few players do in a difficult game like Chelsea away and where they are in their development.” Jarell Quansah and Elliott could be a beneficiary of that approach as Slot starts preparing for next season.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolArne SlotanalysisShareReuse this content"

Scott Parker, though, was determined to remain positive.“I’m absolutely delighted,” said theBurnleymanager. “The main objective was to get three points and end the season on 100 points. Two defeats all season, 33 games unbeaten, 16 goals conceded, that’s all I could ask for .“If you’d said to us at any point that 100 points this year wouldn’t get you the title we’d all be thinking, ‘no chance’.

A woman turned back as she reached the exit and waved goodbye. Goodison’s penultimate fixture, however, proved an occasion for Ipswich to savour as they make a dignified return to the Championship.Everton were two goals up and cruising towards a first home win in three months when Julio Enciso changed the complexion of the contest with a stunning finish. David Moyes’s side suddenly had doubt where previously they had control and a late header from substitute George Hirst completed the recovery for Kieran McKenna’s spirited side.

We never shook Ipswich off.”Arsenal v Bournemouth: Premier League – liveRead moreThere was a party atmosphere inside Goodison for the final Saturday 3pm kick off in the stadium’s 133-year history. Initially, at least. The celebratory mood was in no small part thanks to Everton supporters group The 1878s, volunteers who have decorated the ground with banners and flags for the past three years and produced a magnificent display for one last time. Such was the emotional pull of the occasion that members of The Russian Toffees were present. They had driven 12 hours to get out of Russia and caught a flight from Georgia.Carlos Alcaraz created the opening goal for Beto with a superb inswinging cross from the left. Neither Luke Woolfenden nor Cameron Burgess paid enough attention to the powerful striker standing between them and Beto steered a fine header into the bottom corner.

The winger, working his way back to full fitness after a four-month injury lay-off, doubled Everton’s lead with an exquisite shot from 25 yards. McNeil was urged to shoot the moment he received Nathan Patterson’s first time pass in space on the right. He obliged with an outstanding drive that flew into Alex Palmer’s right-hand corner, the goalkeeper completely deceived by the swerve on the shot.Quick GuideEverton v Ipswich match factsShow● Following their 2-2 draw against Manchester United in February, Everton have failed to win consecutive Premier League home games in which they led by two or more goals for the very first time in the competition.● Ipswich overturned a two-goal deficit to gain a result in a Premier League game for the first time since October 2001 against Southampton (3-3).● Everton’s Beto scored his 10th Premier League goal in his 57th appearance, with six of them coming in his last 13 games.● Only the former Palace midfielder Luka Milivojevic has scored more goals in the Premier League with 100% of them coming with a specific body part (28/28 with right foot) than Dwight McNeil (21/21 with his left foot).OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The threat from Ipswich to that point had been limited to Liam Delap making his presence felt on Everton’s central defenders. Having picked up a yellow card for a furious reaction to a challenge from Jake O’Brien, who was also booked for the shoving match that followed, Delap clattered into Jarrad Branthwaite seconds later. The striker left Branthwaite in a heap with a collision to the chest but avoided the second yellow card that Goodison was baying for.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The on-loan forward had squandered an easier chance two minutes earlier when cutting inside Patterson and James Garner only to drag his shot wide of the near post. The contrast with his next attempt on Jordan Pickford’s goal could not have been greater. Receiving the ball 30 yards out, Enciso cut across a tame challenge from Idrissa Gueye and unleashed a magnificent shot that curled away from Pickford and crashed in off the underside of the bar. The strike was so good that Evertonians applauded.View image in fullscreenJulio Enciso is congratulated by the Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford after scoring Ipswich’s first goal with a stunning strike.Photograph: Cody Froggatt/PAMcKenna said: “It was a great goal but it probably doesn’t happen if the group stops believing and drop their heads. We didn’t give Everton too much after that and we were good value for a point.”Everton controlled the second half without seriously testing Palmer, though Iliman Ndiaye and Beto were both close to connecting with McNeil deliveries. Moyes introduced the fit-again Dominic Calvert-Lewin in a bid to seal victory but, seconds later, Ipswich equalised from a rare foray into the Everton half. The sucker-punch was delivered by Delap’s replacement after Omari Hutchinson had beaten Gueye to the by-line and whipped in a cross that looped off the midfielder’s boot.

After missing out on a Champions League semi-final and an FA Cup final over the previous two matches, Unai Emery’s team enhanced their chances of a top-fivePremier Leaguefinish that would return them to Europe’s elite competition after Youri Tielemans’ first-half header dented Fulham’s own bid for continental competition.Villa have now equalled their 17-match record unbeaten home run in the Premier League, set under Emery two years ago, and are level on points with Nottingham Forest, who visit Crystal Palace on Monday, and Chelsea, at home to Liverpool on Sunday, on 60 points.Yet Emery, the Villa manager, intimated that the Champions League might have been out of reach if they had lost this game. Asked whether it would be an advantage to be playing Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in the final two league games either side of the Europa League final those two plan to be contesting, Emery replied: “Bournemouth next week – so, so difficult. Then we will see. Don’t win today, then forget it. [It is about] always the next one. We want to be close for Europe but there is Nottingham Forest, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle. We will fight for it, Europe and, hopefully, Champions League.”View image in fullscreenUnai Emery applauds the home fans after the win over Fulham.Photograph: Harry Murphy/AVFC/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesTielemans has started all but two of Villa’s 54 matches this season. “His commitment with us is fantastic,” Emery said. “[With] his qualities, how we are trying to get him in our structure is very important. Last year, he was not playing as much as he deserved to get his rhythm, and in different positions. This season he can be more consistent [in central midfield] and can dominate from those positions.”Even to qualify for any European competition for a third successive season for the first time since Martin O’Neill’s reign 15 years ago would represent the progress under Emery. But, after followinga Europa Conference semi-final last seasonwitha memorable run to the Champions League quarter-finalsthis time, ending up in the Europa League come the end of summer would feel like something of an anticlimax for Villa.So taking the lead through Tielemans early in this pivotal game was just the pep they needed. The early kick-off added to the bank holiday feeling. As the sunny morning gave way to the chilly afternoon, Villa needed to show they had recharged their batteries after that flat Wembley performance when they were so supine inlosing to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup semi-final.Quick GuideAston Villa v Fulham match factsShow● Aston Villa are unbeaten in their last 17 home games in the Premier League (W10 D7), their joint-longest run in the competition.● Fulham have lost six of their last 10 Premier League games (W4), as many as in their first 25 games of the season (W10 D9 L6), including four of their last five on the road, as many as their prior 18 matches (W8 D6 L4).● Only Arsenal and Crystal Palace (both 16) have scored more Premier League goals this season from set pieces (excluding penalties) than Aston Villa (15).● Youri Tielemans delivered his tenth Premier League goal involvement of the season (three goals, seven assists), his joint-most in a single campaign in the competition (also in 2020-21 and 2021-22).OptaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Morgan Rogers set about attackingFulhamwith vim, and played an incisive low diagonal ball for Marco Asensio whose reluctance to shoot with his right foot did at least earn a corner. John McGinn floated the cross in with his left foot and from near the front post Tielemans was not unduly troubled by markers as he headed powerfully home his fifth Villa goal of the season.View image in fullscreenYouri Tielemans heads home the winner for Aston Villa.Photograph: Harry Murphy/AVFC/Aston Villa FC/Getty ImagesThe Villa No 8 came closest to doubling the lead when, in first-half stoppage time, he curled a superb 25-yard shot that Bernd Leno tipped aside.Fulham came out to play more in the second half which made the game feel like basketball. Ollie Watkins spurned two great chances, missing the ball entirely from Matty Cash’s low cross from the right wing within a minute of the restart and later allowing Leno to save when released by Rogers’ superbly swerved low pass.Ryan Sessegnon’s drive into the bottom corner of the Villa goal was disallowed for his accidental handball and Harry Wilson had a couple of very presentable chances for Fulham. But Villa survived, Donyell Malen crashing a shot against the crossbar midway through the eight minutes of added time as Villa held on for the crucial victory.Fulham have lost four of their last five away games and must now hope eighth place will earn them a place in the Europa League, for which they must battle it out with Brighton, Bournemouth and Brentford. “The second-half reaction was very good for us,” Marco Silva, the Fulham manager, said. “There were two great chances for Harry Wilson to equalise and we showed great spirit.

Jordan Ayew added a second before half-time to leave Southampton still needing one more point to avoid a share of the competition’s lowest-ever total – Derby’s 11 from 2007-08.“The performance provided the three points,” said Ruud Van Nistelrooy, the Leicester manager. “The first goal was finished in style and it gave us that lead that we needed and the first goal at home in a long, long time. We were ready to break that cycle.”Taylor Harwood-Bellis had a decent chance to headSouthamptoninto a sixth-minute lead, but his effort from Mateus Fernandes’s corner was comfortably saved by the Leicester goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk.Hirst caps Ipswich fightback to spoil Everton’s Goodison farewell partyRead moreHowever, there could not have been a more popular opening goalscorer as Leicester finally found the net at home in the league for the first time since Bobby De Cordova-Reid’s equaliser against Brighton on 8 December 2024. In the 16th minute, Luke Thomas put Bilal El Khannouss in behind down the left and his low ball into the box was smashed high into the net by Vardy who moved within one goal of his Leicester double-century.The Southampton interim manager, Simon Rusk, said: “The first goal just seemed to knock the confidence out of the team. Maybe that’s a result of the season as a whole in that it seemed to be a step too far psychologically perhaps. We can try to affect confidence levels as much as we can, but the reality is we’re working together as a group that’s won two games all season.”There was then a bizarre incident when the referee, David Webb, took an accidental blow to the head from Ayew, who only had eyes on play, and required treatment – after Vardy had blown his whistle to stop the match. Webb could not continue, so the fourth official, Sam Barrott, took charge for the remainder of the contest.View image in fullscreenJamie Vardy blows David Webb’s whistle after the referee took an accidental hit to the head from Jordan Ayew.Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty ImagesLeicester were quickest to find their feet again after the 12-minute delay and doubled their lead after 44 minutes when Ayew hit a powerful drive into the bottom corner from outside the box after the Ghanaian had struck a free-kick into the wall. The lively El Khannouss almost scored a third for the hosts in first-half stoppage time when his attempted cross looped on to the top of the bar.Southampton’s performance could only improve after the break and they came close to pulling a goal back when Stolarczyk did well to keep out Paul Onuachu’s header from Kamaldeen Sulemana’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At the final whistle, everyone of a Bristol City persuasion had to wait a little longer for confirmation, the sold-out home crowd and those on the pitch.A draw at home to Preston, who averted relegation on the final day, would be sufficient providing Blackburn came up short. Liam Manning, his assistant Chris Hogg and a throng of players huddled around Harry Cornick, the striker not in the squad, whose phone carried updates from Bramall Lane, where a Blackburn goal would have changed everything.Rudoni double sends Coventry past Middlesbrough and into the playoffsRead moreThen came the guttural roar and relief, news Blackburn could not find a winner in more than 10 minutes of stoppage time at Sheffield United. The squad bobbed in celebration, the home fans flooded the pitch, presumably relaying the message of what this all means as they bear-hugged players.A red and white haze courtesy of flares and smoke bombs billowed into the sky. The pitch emptied before Bristol City’s players were re-introduced to the field as playoff semi-finalists, with Sheffield United their opponents, the first leg here on Thursday.Arguably the moment of the day came more than 45 minutes after full-time, when Manning and his six-year-old son, Isaac, made tracks towards the Section 82, the core supporters in a throbbing corner of the South Stand, who invited the pair to celebrate together and truly kickstart the party with a series of fist pumps.“I had to force him to do it … he said about doing it during the week and then he bottled it a little, so I had to give him a nudge,” said Manning, who suffered personal tragedy withthe loss of his baby son Theo last October. “It’s been a tough year for me so it was a special moment to be able to do that with my family at the end.View image in fullscreenLiam Manning and his son, Isaac, applaud the fans at full-time during a lap of honour.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/Shutterstock“I nearly cried about three times today. It has been emotional. A huge amount of credit to the lads – they have got me through the last six months. I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t be sitting here if it wasn’t for them.”A while afterwards, with the on-pitch end-of-season awards wrapped up, Drink Up Thy Zider, a staple victory anthem, sounded over the speakers. Outside in the fan village, the Wurzels could scarcely have picked a better day for an hour-long set in the Somerset sunshine. “A reminder to all supporters to stay off the pitch at full-time,” came the address from the stadium announcer approaching the final whistle. Who was he kidding? The red half of the city will drink in the achievement across the bank holiday before returning here on Thursday.A win would have rendered results elsewhere redundant but Preston stunned the home side by surging into a two-goal lead. By the end, the outcome trumped the result but the Bristol City captain Jason Knight’s strike, a minute after Ross McCrorie had made it 2-1, will stick in the memory. Knight ripped a right-foot rocket against the crossbar as the hosts pushed for an equaliser. “I need him to improve his shooting because an inch lower and he would have made my life a lot easier,” Manning said, grinning. “I’m looking forward to a beer right now.”Until McCrorie pulled a goal back in the 69th minute, everything had been going pear-shaped for the hosts. Preston had just doubled their advantage through Milutin Osmajic and so all eyes were on the scores involving Millwall and Blackburn. McCrorie then equalised, racing on to a superb pass by Knight, who richly deserved the players’ player and the player of the season prizes.View image in fullscreenMilutin Osmajic is mobbed after Preston’s second goal.Photograph: Graham Hunt/ProSports/ShutterstockThe fact Luton were 5-1 down at West Brom after 61 minutes in effect secured Preston’s place in the division next season, even though Luton, who suffered successive relegations,rallied back to 5-3. “You’re staying down with the Preston,” the away fans sang gleefully minutes before Osmajic struck. Bristol City have far grander ambitions for the rest of this campaign.Explore more on these topicsChampionshipBristol CityPreston North Endmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

But Lampard made sure his small part was a significant one; making decisive interventions to dictate the direction of the game, as he has throughout a season of striking achievement.Coventry were 17th and two points off the relegation places when Lampard was “given a chance” by owner, Doug King, in November after 18 months out of the game. 16 victories in 31 league games later and they finished the season in fifth place. A two-legged tie against Sunderland awaits, with the home leg first next Friday, but there was little celebration from Lampard, who has an eye on more success yet.Bristol City end Championship playoffs wait and Preston dodge the dropRead more“I have always respected Coventry because of the history and tradition of the club,” Lampard said, looking back over the previous six months. “I remember watching the cup final in 87, one of my first ones. But I didn’t quite realise this fanbase. I didn’t quite realise the sound they make here. So, listen, I’m pleased that I am a small part in the club’s success because I think what’s happening now with the fans engaging and the players doing what they need to do has been a great thing for us. We’re not there yet, clearly, but from 17th to fifth, it needs everybody together to manage to do that.”A double for Jack Rudoni earned the three points, the all-action midfielder one of the players who has benefited from Lampard’s guidance. Clearly the Coventry squad still reflects Mark Robins’ influence over seven seasons, but nobody is better placed to offer advice on arriving in the box than the Premier League’s record goalscorer from midfield.View image in fullscreenJack Rudoni opens the scoring for Coventry.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“I think Thursday me and him just stayed out working on little cutbacks and finishes in different areas and it’s good because today showed that when you do that, you score; it happens,” Lampard said. The second goal was indeed a low finish from a cutback on a breakaway. The first goal came just before half-time, a header into the bottom corner after Rudoni pulled away from the crowds to meet a Tatsuhiro Sakamoto cross.Coventry were made to work for their victory. Initial domination was slowly throttled byMiddlesbrough, who themselves had come into the game with the chance of entering the playoffs if they could secure three points. While Rudoni and Sakamoto were most dangerous in the opening half hour, Boro’s Finn Azaz and Morgan Whittaker imposed themselves in the match’s middle third.Conceding before half-time was not ideal for Middlesbrough but could have equalised after half-time only for Azaz’s fierce shot to be parried to safety by goalkeeper Ben Wilson on the hour. Wilson also made a crucial interception to cut out Whittaker in a move that led to the second goal, with only minutes remaining in the game. Wilson, who had suffered a serious knee injury earlier in the season, was making his first appearance since October.Lampard’s decision to drop Brad Collins for Wilson was bold but paid off. Equally, his decision to bring on Brandon Thomas-Asante for Ellis Simms in the second half turned the game. Asante’s pace gave Coventry a direct outlet that killed Boro’s momentum and it was the 26-year-old who chased down Wilson’s clearance to put Rudoni’s second goal on a plate.For Boro, a period of calm may be required to get perspective on their season. Carrick said that a lack of consistency had been his team’s undoing and he pointed to an organised but progressive performance here as signs that the team have foundations on which to develop. Equally there will be those looking at league finishes over Carrick’s tenure of fourth, eighth and 10th and wondering if it is heading in the right direction.View image in fullscreenFrank Lampard is embraced by owner Doug King at the final whistle.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA“It was quiet in the dressing room, the boys were upset. It hurt them, it’s a sickening feeling,” Carrick said afterwards. “I care about the players a lot. It’s just how I am. We can definitely go forward together after today. As a group we’ve done some good work over the past three years, I do feel we’ve got a lot to build on.” Asked if he was planning for being at the Riverside Stadium next season, the answer was a definitive: “Yes.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipCoventry CityMiddlesbroughmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Hetold The Athleticin 2023 that Olise, now at Bayern Munich, had introduced him and his brother to the game at the club’s training ground. “That’s when I started studying it, watching YouTube videos of the best chess openings, things like that. We’re always playing something at the training ground.”Eze is one of several high-profile football figures to profess a love for the sport, with Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah admitting in 2023 he was “addicted” to online chess. “I play every day, literally every day,” Salah told Sky. “But I am not saying my username. I put my name and some other numbers so some people they ask ‘are you Mo Salah,’ I say ‘yes,’ they don’t believe it, and say ‘you are lying.’ I say ‘yes, I’m lying.’”Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold, meanwhile, lost to the world No 1, Magnus Carlsen, in 17 moves in a game that lasted five minutes in 2018. Carlsen, a big football fan who topped the official Fantasy Football rankings ahead of 7.3m others in 2020,said last yearthat there are “a lot of decent chess players” in professional football. “Martin Ødegaard plays a little bit … He’s not a bad player, but he’s kind of private about it.”Eze and Palace will face Manchester City in the FA Cup final on 17 May, aiming to win the club’s first major trophy.

Arsenal have conceded 12 of their 31 Premier League goals this season from set-pieces (excluding penalties). Only four clubs have conceded more in the competition.“We certainly wanted to create a really good vibe [for Paris], a positive result would really help us to build what we wanted towards Wednesday,” Arteta said. “What we have created now is a lot of rage, anger, frustration and a bad feeling in the tummy. So, make sure that we use that for Wednesday to have a massive performance in Paris, win the game and be in the final.”Arsenal led through Declan Rice but Arteta lamented their ability to kill off a Bournemouth team who gave their hopes of a first ever European qualification a boost. “On top of that, you defend the box really poorly … the way we’ve done it in the two set pieces that we have conceded again,” Arteta said. “Certainly, what happened today is that we defended the way we’ve done, very few set pieces but very poorly [defended]. In the league, you’re going to get punished.”Arteta said he picked his strongest available line-up because, unlike his PSG counterpart Luis Enrique, who made ten changes for a 2-1 defeat at Strasbourg, Arsenal still have plenty to play for in the league. They are not certain of a top-five finish that would return them to next season’s Champions League. Their final three league games are Liverpool (away), Newcastle (home) and Southampton (away).“PSG have won the league so they have the luxury to do that,” Arteta said. “We still have a lot to do in the Premier League. Because mathematically we are not qualified. We haven’t had the right to finish second yet so we still have a lot to do.”Arteta rested Jurrien Timber because of a minor knock that the defender suffered in the first-leg against PSG. Arteta claimed he was not confident about Timber’s fitness for Paris. “Confident? At the moment, no, because he wasn’t able to play here and we play them in four days,” Arteta said. “What is the issue with him? I cannot tell you.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

How am I competing with the No 1 player in the world, who wins six tournaments a year, over three days? I’ve got to be proud of myself.”Williams has been struggling with his eyesight and said: “I’m due to have lens replacement surgery on 12 June – deposit paid – but I’m going to have to have a think.

When play resumed Trump took the 29th frame to keep his hopes alive and also won the next with a 116 clearance after Williams missed a red to the middle with his first chance to seal victory.Trump had the chance to pile on the pressure after a superb red to the middle in frame 31, but missed a difficult thin black and Williams grabbed the opportunity in style with a clearance of 123 to seal victory.Williams won his first world title in 2000 – when Zhao was just three years old – and his most recent in 2018, when he famously conducted his winning press conference naked – apart from a towel – to fulfil a promise made earlier in the tournament.“It’s unbelievable. Twelve months ago I wasn’t even here. I watched it in a caravan,” Williams said at the time, having contemplated quitting the sport the previous year after losing in the final round of qualifying.Ronnie O’Sullivan believes Zhao has what it takes to become the first Chinese winner of the world championship, and with it a “megastar”, after the 28-year-old beat the seven-time champion to reach the final. Zhao has had an extraordinary journey to the Crucible showpiece, which gets under way on Sunday and concludes on Monday, with his latest remarkable achievement his victory over O’Sullivan with a session to spare.View image in fullscreenZhao Xintong has reached the final after coming through four qualifying rounds and breezing through the draw at the Crucible.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesHaving fought through four qualifying rounds as he continues his comeback after a 20-month ban for his involvement in a betting scandal, Zhao has since seen off Jak Jones, Lei Peifan, Chris Wakelin and O’Sullivan to become the second player from China to reach the world final after Ding Junhui, wholost to Mark Selbyin the 2016 final.Zhao, who is playing as an amateur in Sheffield, showed his class against O’Sullivan on Friday as he won all eight frames in the morning to open up a 12-4 lead before finishing the job in the evening to knock out his hero. O’Sullivan thinks Zhao, who won the UK Championship in 2021, is capable of going all the way and feels it would be good for the sport if he did get his hands on the trophy.He said: “I think it would be amazing. I think if he did win he would be a megastar. He’s still very big in China as it is. But if he becomes world champion it would just be amazing for snooker and for his life as well. He can definitely get over the line. I think he’ll have more of a test [in the final].

The Saints director of rugby, Phil Dowson, also believes several of his players have “undoubtably” enhanced their British & Irish Lions selection chances before Thursday’s tour squad announcement.Henry Pollock and Fin Smith, along with hat-trick try-scorer Tommy Freeman, could not have made a better impression on a high-pressure stage and Dowson believes Pollock’s exuberance is beneficial to any team. “It’s infectious and spreads throughout the team,” said Dowson. “Leinster are one of the best sides in Europe and the world. For our players to perform on that stage and execute under that pressure speaks volumes for them.”Northampton stun Leinster with heroic victory to reach Champions Cup finalRead morePollock, who won his first senior England cap in March, was understandably ecstatic afterwards. “I tell you what … that was a battle,” said Pollock. “Jesus. I’ve never played in a game that hard in my life. That’s what dreams are made of. As a boy I grew up watching this competition. To do it with my boyhood club, to get in the final … honestly, it’s getting a bit emotional talking about it, because it’s so special.”“This is what sport’s about. This is why you play the game. You do it because you love it. You love the fans, the atmosphere, the sport. Going up against the best back row in the world. I couldn’t ask for much more. I’m so proud. The team were just amazing, 1 to 23. Bring on Cardiff! All week we’ve been saying: ‘Why not us?’Smith said he and his team had been motivated by the general expectation that Leinster would brush them aside. “All week we were reading stuff: Leinster by 35, Leinster by 40. We looked at that and thought: ‘Bring it on.’ The fact we are so close makes it all the sweeter. No one else believed. No one else believed. We just sat, stayed nice and calm all week. We said we had a job to do, and we turned up and did it.”View image in fullscreenFin Smith carries the fight to Leinster.Photograph: David Rogers/Getty ImagesHe also hopes the result will now influence this week’s Lions’s selection. “One hundred per cent. Wait and see. I don’t think we did ourselves any harm today. Look, I’m going to give you a boring answer but fingers crossed. We’ll be watching that telly but we definitely didn’t do ourselves any harm.”Freeman will definitely be on the plane next month but is currently more focused on ensuring Northampton press on and win theChampions Cup. “We know if we get our game on the pitch, we can take anyone on. They said Leinster by 30 but here we are. If we put our game on the pitch, we stress defences. We ran for each other, we showed love for each other, we showed heart. We did that for 80 minutes and we got the result.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Fans watching professional rugby matches, for example, can generally consume alcohol while sitting in the stands.“Its been 40 years since alcohol was banned in view of the pitch,” Charters said.“Perhaps it is time for a modern approach to a modern game. The days of hooliganism are gone. Fans of other sports can drink in the stands but football fans cannot.”Charters said limited trials of drinking zones in view of the pitch should be looked at.A trial allowing the consumption of alcohol in view of the pitch has already taken place in the women’s game, which is not covered by the 1985 ban.Four clubs – Bristol City, Southampton, Birmingham City and Newcastle United – participated in the trial for certain games in the latter part of the season.Charters accepted it would not work on every occasion but said there were instances were the policy could be reviewed.“For me, we should always keep family areas free of that, but let us give fans who want to drink in the stands the chance to do so responsibly, or at least let us have a conversation about it,” he told the Commons.During the debate, Charters also said that “there is no greater problem” facing football fans in England than ticket prices.The MP called for a £30 away ticket cap – which is already in place in the Premier League – to be applied across the EFL and National League.The FA has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsSportAlcoholnewsShareReuse this content"

It was a blow to the Dutchman’s title defence as he dropped to 21 points behind Piastri who leads the championship.

However, just past the midway point the race turned.With the track drying swiftly, taking slick rubber was an option by lap 11 and Ferrari opted to bring Hamilton in early and he he moved up to third.

The Briton came in just when the safety car was called after Fernando Alonso crashed out, giving him almost a free stop. Enough to squeeze out of the pit lane just in front of Piastri to take the lead, which he held behind the safety car to the flag.For Hamilton, who has endured a trying time in the Ferrari since he took victory at the sprint race in Shanghai, it was something to enjoy for the team and gave him some optimism that he could further improve in qualifying. “Every moment counts,” he said. “It’s definitely been not so great obviously since China.”“Coming into this weekend we have made some changes, but we have more to do in order to be fighting more consistently at the front. We just need to knuckle down and I do believe that we can get some better results.”It is Norris’s second sprint race win, having taken the first in Brazil last year, and closes the gap to championship leader Piastri to nine points.Before the sprint race the McLaren team principal, Zak Brown, upped the ante in his spat with Red Bull by demanding a change in F1 regulations to prevent teams making what he described as “bogus allegations”.On Friday, Brown made a light -hearted reference to suggestions last year that McLaren were injecting water into their tyres to keep them cool, believed to have originated from Red Bull, a practice McLaren vigorously denied. On the pit wall Brown was seen drinking from a water bottle labelled “tire water”.On Saturday, however, he described it as poking fun at a “serious issue” and that allegations made should go through a strict official process via the FIA and should be accompanied by a financial cost deducted from a team’s budget cap to deter unfounded accusations.View image in fullscreenLando Norris talks to Lewis Hamilton, who finished on the podium after the sprint race.Photograph: Marco Bello/Reuters“That process should be extended to all allegations to stop the frivolous allegations which are intended only to be a distraction,” he said. “If you had to put up some money and put on paper and not back channel what your allegations are, that would be a way to clean up the bogus allegations that happen in this sport which are not very sporting.“If someone does believe there’s a technical issue by all means you’re entitled to it, put it on paper, put your money down. It should come against your cost cap if it turns out you’re wrong.”Brown cited a figure of $25,000 (£19,000) as what he believed would be a sufficient deterrent. “Would I spend 25 grand on a distraction tactic or development of my own race car? I’d spend 25 grand on my race car all day long,” he said. “It doesn’t need to be hundreds of thousands, but it needs to be meaningful enough that you’re taking away performance you spend on your car.”After penalties were applied post-race, George Russell was fourth for Mercedes, Lance Stroll fifth for Aston Martin, Yuki Tsunoda sixth for Red Bull and Pierre Gasly eighth for Alpine.Explore more on these topicsFormula OneMotor sportUS sportsLando NorrisMcLarenLewis HamiltonFerrarinewsShareReuse this content"

There were still a few bits I could have done better but I was super happy with how I put all the sectors together. Every weekend I learn massively. Last week, having a break really helped me to gather information and process it all and recharging the batteries, it was really good.“The whole qualifying I felt I was able to make a step lap by lap. I’m much more aware of how to do a consistent warmup and extract more out of the tyres but there’s a lot to improve. Every weekend I get more confident with the car, can play with it more and explore the limits.

The son of Marco, a sportscar racer, Mercedes spotted the youngster in Bologna after he made a huge impact in karting, signing him for their drivers academy at 11.He made his racing debut at 15 years old after claiming a number of titles and that earned him a drive in F2 for Prema Racing, where his talents blossomed as Oliver Bearman’s teammate. A sprint victory in the rain at Silverstone and a maiden win at the Hungaroring impressed the F1 paddock, but the real head turner came with his performance at Spa-Francorchamps and a bold overtaking move at the notorious Eau Rouge.When Hamilton floored the sport with the news that he would be leaving Mercedes for Ferrari in 2025, the young Italian’s name began to be connected with the vacant seat. Mercedes acted swiftly and, shortly after Antonelli’s 18th birthday, announced at the Italian Grand Prix an Italian would indeed replace Hamilton, although the driver’s bubble was punctured somewhat by aheavy crash on his practice debutat Monza.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I thought of myself as a digital nutritionist.”In an interview with the Guardian, Regehr said she supported school smartphone bans and the growing campaign for a smartphone-free childhood, but these were not enough alone and more education was needed to help families think critically about their digital choices.“Because even if you hold off giving a kid a smartphone until after they are 15, they will turn 16. And we have a responsibility to give them the tools they need to navigate this space effectively,” she said. “We do need to provide them with education about how these things work.”Her book, subtitled “Why we’re all addicted to screens and what you can do about it”, is designed to help fill that gap, and will be accompanied by new educational materials that will be introduced in schools later this month.Almost all schools in England have nowbanned mobile phone useby pupils in school hours, according to the first national survey on the subject, commissioned by Rachel de Souza, the children’s commissioner for England.Prompted by concerns about the effect on children’s mental health, attention span and online safety, the survey of more than 15,000 schools found that 99.8% of primary schools and 90% of secondary schools had some form of ban.“I support the work of Smartphone Free Childhood,” said Regehr, who is programme director of digital humanities at UCL and has previously researched how algorithms used by social media platforms are rapidlyamplifying extreme misogynistic content. “My fear is that when you implement a ban, it can let schools and legislators off the hook because they think the job is done.”Regehr’s book is dedicated to her two young daughters. “My goal is for my kids to look back on our generation as wildly unhealthy and tech-enslaved, just as we look back on a generation previous smoking in hospital delivery rooms and not wearing seatbelts.“I am trying to make a cultural change so that their lives are better. This is the biggest threat to their health and wellbeing, and it’s something that I want to tackle and I believe we can see a cultural change. People just need the information.”Smartphone Nation: Why We’re All Addicted to Screens and What You Can Do About It by Dr Kaitlyn Regehr is published by Bluebird on 15 MayExplore more on these topicsSmartphonesInternetSocial mediaDigital mediaChildrenParents and parentingnewsShareReuse this content"

I’m resolving to put my device away and just dance: I hope others followSat 3 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 15.28 EDTShareI’m making a public vow, which I fear I may abandon the moment Lana Del Rey comes on stage at Wembley in July: to stop recording concerts on my phone. Last Sunday, producer and DJ Kaytranadaresponded to a fan on Xwho was frustrated at motionless concertgoers with their phones in the air, writing: “I think we have come in this age where everybody’s trying to catch a moment for their own social media presence. It shows their appreciation instead of them dancing and enjoying shows like we used to.” Even though I wasn’t at Kaytranada’s show, he had me bang to rights.I have in the past incessantly recorded gigs, insisting to myself that there is no impairment of my enjoyment, or that determinedly rejigging the camera for a panoramic shot of the entire stage was all part of the concert experience. Lost in the spirit of a moment, it can be nice to snap yourself and friends singing along to your favourite artist, and to create a personal archive of a concert’s best bits.But what Kaytranada has really nailed is the fact that often recording concerts to upload footage to social media is meant to betray a kind of cool to your audience and reap the intangible social rewards of being a source of Fomo. Concert recording can be like letting everyone know you’ve been invited to the coolest party – the exclusivity factor baked into the ticket price. Personally, I’m moving on to more subtle and mysterious ways to signal status, like casually dropping the concerts I’m attending in a newspaper.The whole record and upload process has almost been gamified by social media such as TikTok, where clips can go viral and even be picked up by the press. Particularly with large, anticipated tours, there’s almost a race to be the person who captures and releases the best footage of a certain moment, with all the accompanying hopes of fast numbers and engagement. Broke the news of Charli xcx’s fiance George Daniel doing the TikTok Apple dance at her O2 show long before anyone else? Here’syour post embedded in NMEand a thousand new followers; don’t spend it all at once.I was among the first people in the world to see Beyoncé’s Renaissance world tour in Stockholm in 2023 – I uploaded a video of her opening with Dangerously in Love 2 to my former Twitter/X account while she was still mid-song. I got thousands of likes and retweets and people commenting, many pleasantly shocked that she had opened a tour connected to a dance album with an R&B ballad. But what was the point of doing that, really? While I still had fun, I was distracted by my phone during a concert by one of my favourite artists, all for the sake of some ephemeral internet buzz. I haven’t even looked at any of those clips again.View image in fullscreenBeyoncé opens her Renaissance world tour in Stockholm, 10 May 2023.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ParkwoodHow much you get your phone out at a concert is not necessarily inversely correlated with fun, but it can just become a faff and a compulsion. At the end of the night you find yourself with a depleted battery, your camera cluttered with maybe a hundred clips, and a lot of time wasted swiping through each one figuring out which is the best to use to show off on social media. I also had a ticket to Beyoncé’s London show where I felt no need to record the same performance twice and had possibly the best concert experience of my life. But we can’t always attend every tour twice – with today’s prices, it’s a money pit just going once.I suppose, though, that there are those who are performing a kind of public service. Beyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter tour in California this week, and,as with other major concerts, there were several livestreams across Instagram and TikTok from people who have committed to capturing the show from open to close for those fans who can’t attend due to location or expense. There are problems with this; some people complain of “concert spoilers” filling their timelines (though I personally don’t think aconcert can be“spoiled”), and I’m not especially clear at what point it becomes piracy. But with the decline of tour DVDs and uncertainty over whether you’ll ever set your eyes on an iconic stage design beyond press stills again, I can see why recording still feels necessary for posterity.But it doesn’t have to be you. Rest safe in the knowledge that the most dedicated fans, probably with tickets for multiple nights, will shoot and upload the best angles and most surprising moments for you to scroll past later. Maybe limit yourself to one or two clips for theInstagramstory, then lock your phone away, wave your hands in the air and “move them hips”, as Kaytranada says.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsMusicOpinionSocial mediaSmartphonesTikTokInstagramXLana Del ReycommentShareReuse this content"

And that seems to be the interpretation of electoral results across the industrialised world.From the seismic shifts in recent US and German elections to the rise of Reform and the Green party in the UK, electorates are signalling that they reject the status quo.As the song says: “We all wanna change the world.”And yet, there is an important caveat in the next few lines of the lyrics penned by Lennon and McCartney that are just as important almost 60 years later.“But when you talk about destruction, don’t you know that you can count me out.”As private wealth has accumulated since the 1950s, only the radical few have been prepared to see jobs disappear and their wealth diminished while they wait for the supposed benefits of political and economic upheaval. And no amount of pleading from leaders to wait for the good times will overcome that resistance.For several years now we have witnessed the call for revolution from those who consider themselves insulated from its effects, until that is, the level of destruction they voted for takes a toll on their own finances.That was the case with Brexit, and buyer’s remorse is now widespread.While it takes time for people to react, financial markets have become more sensitive.Over the past month we have seen the custodians of global wealth – fund managers and pension funds – react with almost palpable anger to Donald Trump’s attempts at revolution, just as they did when former prime minister Liz Truss embarked on a borrowing spree to revolutionise the UK’s economy.Andy Haldane, the former chief economist of the Bank of England and outgoing boss of the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce (RSA), says financial markets have become a bulwark against leaders’ excesses.Writing in the Financial Times, he said the interconnectivity of world trade and the costs of tearing up supply chains sparked fears of a return to high inflation, spooking investors.“The excess sensitivity of financial markets [applies] a double-lock. By telescoping and amplifying these costs, they serve as a real-time disciplining device on politicians claiming they can weather the short-term pain. This makes capitulation speedier than in the past.”Last month the US president vented his anger at financial markets,accusing them of undermining his economic project with panic selling.Coining a new term, he said on his Truth Social platform: “Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!).”Haldane is not the only one to say that the loss of more than $6tn from global stock markets by the end of April, which wreaked pain on ordinary savers and undermined consumer confidence, helped halt the tariff scourge.As a senior fellow at the free-market American Enterprise Institute (AEI), Desmond Lachman analyses the subject from a different perspective, butcomes to the same conclusion. He said US consumers will be next to put a block on Trump’s intentions.Despite his feisty rhetoric, Trump understands that he has less room for manoeuvre than he wanted. And his U-turns have had their reward.The stock market recovery this week is built on US officials saying they have approached Xi Jinping for talks over escalating tariffs. That humiliating climbdown comes after Trump’s claims that China had much more to lose from tariffs than the US.A resumption of Washington’s support for Ukraine’s war effort, after a deal to share the badly battered nation’s mineral wealth, has also calmed markets.Lower tariffs between the world’s two largest economies and a reassertion of the old international order, one that maintains Russian aggression breached international law, is good for business.Sensible policies have reasserted themselves and we have the markets to thank for that.Yet, while it might seem like a good outcome for those who gained from the old system, those who consider themselves losers are left with a festering anger.Politically, they might not achieve an electoral majority. Too many middle income households will support the old ways because that is what delivered them housing and pension assets they could only dream of 60 years ago.The poorer half of the income distribution – those who have seen their low incomes flatline for almost two decades – might still have some power, especially if they opt for social unrest.Lennon and McCartney wouldn’t have been surprised. They were writing the White Album while the 1968 student riots raged across Europe.Young people are one of the biggest losers from the 21st century economic lottery. They are voting green in the south and east and reform in the west and north in ever-greater numbers. What will they do when voting gets them nowhere?Explore more on these topicsEconomicsDonald TrumpLiz TrusscommentShareReuse this content"

Conspiracy theorists immediately started circling. A tweet from 2019, in which Giuffre said she wasn’t suicidal, was dredged up. Donald Trump Jr, the president’s eldestfailson, then amplified the theory to his millions of followers,adding that“other than the Clinton’s [sic] no one has more suiciding going on”.Laura Loomer, a far-right influencer who seems to wield ahuge amount of influencein the Trump administration, also started insinuating online that Giuffre had been silenced by dark forces. “We are never getting the Epstein list, are we?”Loomer tweeted.Various other people amplifying this conspiracy theory have noted that Giuffre isn’t the first Epstein survivor to have died in recent years. In 2023, Carolyn Andriano, who had accused Epstein of abusing her when she was 14 and who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell in her trial, was found dead of an accidental overdose in aFlorida hotel room. Andriano testified in 2021 that she had been addicted to “pain pills and cocaine” and taken them “to block out” Epstein’s sexual abuse. Another of Epstein’s victims, Leigh Patrick, alsoreportedly diedof a heroin overdose in Florida in 2017.The fact that three Epstein survivors have died by drug overdose or suicide is enraging and tragic, but it is not a conspiracy. I have a suggestion for the likes of Donald Jr and Loomer: instead of searching for secret plots, why not grapple with some very clear facts? The first being that childhood sexual abuse is associatedwith a wide rangeof physical and mental health conditions, includingsubstance abuse. In a statement praising Giuffre’s courage, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (Rainn)warned that victimsof abuse are “significantly more likely to attempt suicide or suffer other long term effects of trauma”.The “conspiracy” that Donald Jr and Loomer are searching so hard to find isn’t hidden, it’s staring them right in the face. Far too often, when a woman accuses a powerful man of abuse she will have her life destroyed, while the man walks away. Society is set up to protect powerful predators and their enablers: misogyny is woven into the fabric of all our institutions. Look at the supreme court, where two of the six men servinghave faced sexual misconduct associations. Anita Hill had herreputation destroyedafter accusing Clarence Thomas, then a supreme court nominee, of sexually harassing her. Christine Blasey Ford, Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s accuser, was forced to flee herhouse to protect her safety. (Both justices deny the allegations.)And, of course, look at the White House. Trump waslegally brandeda sexual predator in 2023 and it didn’t stop him from becoming president again.Look too at all the years that Epstein evaded justice; all the years he rubbed shoulders with some of the most powerful people in the world who didn’t seem to care about his predilection for young girls. Which, by the way, hardly seemed to be a secret. Trump joked about Epstein liking women on the “younger side” back in 2002. Florida prosecutors also reportedly knew that Epstein assaulted young girlsyearsbefore he cut a very lenient deal with them in 2008. In that dealhe pleaded guiltyto state charges of procuring a person under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution. The financier had to register as a sex offender and serve a 13-months sentence, but was allowed tospend most of his dayin his office.I can understand why conspiracy theorists are so obsessed with Epstein. After all, the man operated a vast sex trafficking ring with the help of anenormous numberof powerful people. And yet, five years after the sex offender’s death, the only person to have faced any real consequences is Ghislaine Maxwell, who is in alow-security federal prison. Some high-profile men have been embarrassed, sure, but nobody except Maxwell is in prison. It’s not a conspiracy that’s to blame for this: it’s society’s attitudes toward women.Logan Paul has daughter, realizes that women are human tooThe influencer, boxer, and YouTube personality – who has tens of millions of followers – recently spoke out about how his “mind went to some dark places” when he found out his wife was pregnant with a girl. “I don’t want to come across like a woke asshole, but like, dude, women have it hard,”Paul said on his reality show. “Women have it fucking hard. And I empathize with them.”Jill Sobule dies in a house fire age 66Themusician’s 1995 singleI Kissed a Girl is considered the first openly LGBTQ-themed song to crack the Billboard top 20 singles chart.Breast cancer is becoming less deadly for younger women in the USFrom 2010 to 2020, the number ofbreast cancer deathsamong women ages 20-49 dropped significantly, researchers have reported.Breast cancer mortality fell across racial and ethnic groups, but in both 2010 and 2020, non-Hispanic Black women had the highest rate.Why are more than 90% of pilots still men?“Despite more than a decade of initiatives designed to increase the number of women flying planes, just 6.5% of pilots working for UK companies are women,”Amelia Gentleman reports. “There is something stubbornly retro about gender roles in this industry. Female doctors began tooutnumber their male peersin the UK for the first time this year, but preconceptions about what an airline pilot should look and sound like have not shifted.”Texas senate approves legislation to clarify exceptions to extreme abortion banThe new legislation, Senate Bill 31, aims to prevent maternal deaths under the state’s strict abortion ban – and serves as an acknowledgment that women were being denied lifesaving care because of confusion about the limits of the abortion ban. While it’s a step forward, don’t get too excited.ProPublica notes: “The bill stops short of removing what doctors say are the ban’s biggest impediments to care, including its major criminal penalties, and doesn’t expand abortion access to cases of fetal anomalies, rape or incest.” The Texas senate has also just passed perhaps the broadest crackdown onabortion-inducing drugs in the country.Judge in Finland dismisses charges against three men accused of raping a 17-year-old girl outside a hospitalThe girl was taken to Malmi Hospital by an ambulance due to her severe intoxication, the Finnish newspaperHelsingin Sanomatreports. Three men, two of whom were in their 30s, then took the 17-year-old out of the hospital and had violent intercourse with her, which they filmed. The Helsinki district court has held that the girl – who, again, had been brought to hospital because of intoxication, consented to all this and dismissed the charges against the men.Cory Booker can speak non-stop for 25 hours, but has no comment about genocideThe New Jersey senator was heaped with praise by liberals for speaking for 25 hours on the Senate floor last month. “This is not right or left. It is right or wrong. This is not a partisan moment. It is a moral moment,” Booker said during his speech. “Where do you stand?” Stirring words, indeed. But Booker was awfully quiet this week after Shabtai, the Yale-based society he co-founded, invitedthe Israeli extremist Itamar Ben-Gvir– a man convicted of terrorism–to give a speech. Booker also took a smilingphoto in his office with Yoav Gallant, wanted by the ICC for war crimes, in his office last year. Booker is absolutely right that this is not a partisan moment, it is a moral moment. You are either forgenocide, or you are against it. You are either for starving children and murderingjournalists, or you are against it. Booker has made very clear where he stands. If Booker is the “resistance”, we are all in trouble.The week in pawtriarchyThe world’s smallest dog (Pearl, chihuahua, 3.59 inches) and the world’s tallest dog (Reggie, Great Dane, 3ft 3in) recentlygot togetherfor a playdate, and it was ascute as it sounds.

The rest of us are stuck in the real worldSat 3 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 15.27 EDTShareIt’s tempting to believe that tech billionaires’ embrace of Donald Trump and the far right is a sudden rupture with the usual political ideology of Silicon Valley. Op-edsin the New York Timesandelsewherehave made this case. Even Marc Andreessen, one of the billionaires in question,claims that this is what happened– he said that it was a change in the Democratic arty that pushed him and his fellow oligarchs into the arms of the GOP.Yet this is a serious misunderstanding of the situation. There wasn’t a sudden shift in the politics of tech – itwas a homecoming. While it’s true that Silicon Valley has long supported Democratic candidates for political office – and that rank-and-file tech workers still vote overwhelmingly for Democrats – the fundamental ideology underpinning the culture of Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists and CEOs has always had a far-right libertarian core. This is even true for Andreessen: while he likely believed what he said while he was saying it, his own words and actions make it clear that he wasn’t giving an accurate assessment of his own motivations, much less anyone else’s. His venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has long opposed government regulation of any sort that touches on their investments; Andreessen himself posted a “techno-optimist manifesto” that, despite its claim to be politically neutral, promotes an authoritarian vision of unfettered power for tech oligarchs. He even lovingly paraphrases Filippo Marinetti, the co-author of the Fascist Manifesto.But the place where the longstanding rightwing ideals of the leaders of the tech industry are most obvious are in their visions of the future.Elon Muskdreams of Mars; Sam Altman claims super-intelligent AI is around the corner. It’s easy to dismiss these as fantasies, deliberate distractions from their present actions. But this is another mistake, closely related to the first. These futures are central to the tech billionaires’ worldview. And these ideas about the future have always contained a political element aligned with dreams of total autocratic control.‘Headed for technofascism’: the rightwing roots of Silicon ValleyRead moreTake Mars.Musk has been fairly specificabout it: he says he wants a million people living on Mars by the year 2050 in a self-sufficient colony, serving as a backup for humanity in the event of a catastrophe on Earth. He has framed this as an existential struggle, claiming that SpaceX’sStarship rocket “is the key to making life multi-planetary & protecting the light of consciousness”. Jeff Bezos hasderided Musk’s plans for Mars, instead saying that we should aim athaving atrillionpeoplein space several generations from now, living in a fleet of giant space stations, each with interiors the size of a major city. The alternative, he says, is a brutal future of population control, rationing and “stagnation”.Bezos is right to pan Musk’s plans for Mars: they will not work.Marsis awful. The gravity is too low, the radiation levels are too high, there’s basically no air and the dirt is made of poison. But Bezos’s plans don’t work either, for a similar litany of reasons. And more fundamentally, there’s no good argument for humans to leave Earth in the first place. The idea of Mars as a backup for humanity in the event of a disaster on Earth is laughable, precisely because Mars is so awful – there’s in effect no disaster, not even nuclear war or a massive asteroid strike, that could make Earth less hospitable for humans than Mars. And the math behind Bezos’s fears of stagnation and rationing – which are really fears about the end of growth – aren’t significantly alleviated by going to space, where resources are just as finite as they are here on Earth.What these fantasies of space do allow are visions of total corporate control free of governments, a libertarian paradise.Musk’sStarlink user agreementhasa clause maintaining that “the parties recognize Mars as a free planet and that no Earth-based government has authority or sovereignty over Martian activities”. (This is indirect violation of international treaties governing space.) Residents of Musk’s Mars colony would be wholly dependent on SpaceX for everything, even the air they breathe; it would be a more total company town than any possible here on Earth. Meanwhile, Bezos’s fleet of space stations wouldn’t be a company town – they would be a company civilization. And with the constant peril of decompression and asphyxiation at hand, Musk and Bezos (or their corporate heirs) would have a ready-made excuse to exercise autocratic control over the residents of these space habitats.The tech oligarchs are confident their godhead will arrive and deliver us to paradise. This offers them moral absolution for their actions and gives them a sense of meaningSpace is the location of the tech billionaires’ futuristic dreams, but AI is the magic that fuels them. Such AI is always depicted as being able to do as least as much as humans can, if not more. Yet there’s little reason to think that AI like that is coming anytime soon. Ina recent survey of AI researchers, 76% said that neural networks, the general architecture that underlies nearly all advanced AI, are fundamentally unsuitable for creating “AGI”, a hypothetical AI that can do everything humans can do. Even more of those researchers said that “the current perception of AI capabilities” is overblown. Nonetheless, in the world of Silicon Valley CEOs and venture capitalists (and amongcredulous journalistsandpolicymakers), there is a widespread belief that AGI is coming very soon, within afewyears.This unquestioned faith in AGI is linked to a broader myth about the future of technology in general. Once AGI arrives, the story goes, it will quickly and inevitably become super-intelligent, far surpassing individual humans or even humanity as a whole in its capabilities. This will lead to an explosion in scientific and technological development that dwarfs the Industrial Revolution, known as the Singularity. The Singularity will reshape the lives of all humans, enabling seemingly magical results like easy space travel, immortality or near-immortality, perfect virtual reality and limitless energy, all within a few years or less – and the AI’s super-intelligent beneficence will render democracy obsolete.This vision of technological salvation is baked into the heart of Silicon Valley’s collective unconscious, and has been for decades. Futurist groups in the 1980s and 90s whispered promises of a singularity powered by machine intelligence over early internet email lists, alongside diatribes against democracy and affirmative action and paeans to free markets. The idea of a singularity and all its attendant miracles can be traced back through these groups to mid-20th-century science-fiction – with its trappings of robots and rocket ships conquering the final frontier – and back beyond that to apocalyptic Christian religiousmovements of the late 19th and early 20th century. These ideas about the future were originally about using technology to ascend to heaven and live forever in the presence of God. They have come down to today’s tech oligarchs with AI playing the role of the deity and space as a substitute for paradise, but they are no less of a religion than they were a century ago.The rise of end times fascism | Naomi Klein and Astra TaylorRead moreThe tech billionaires’ unshakable faith in this religion of technological salvation leads them to believe the end of this world, and the advent of a perfect one, is nigh. AI and space colonization will lead to utopia, algorithmically guaranteed. This is why they need to believe that AI is amazing, beyond the fact thatit’s propping up a bubble– it’s central to their entire worldview. Theymustbelieve that AI can be used to replace essential government workers, improve productivity in the workplace and accelerate scientific research, despite all evidence to the contrary.Tech billionaires are even gambling the planet on the imminent arrival of AGI. Eric Schmidt, the billionaire venture capitalist and former CEO of Google,claimsthat pursuing AGI is the best path forward to solve the climate crisis, despite the enormous carbon footprint of AI data centers, because of his certainty that AGI will fix the problem for us after its imminent arrival. Sam Altman agrees, andhe’s even explainedhow he thinks that would work. “I think once we have a really powerful super-intelligence, addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult for a system like that,” he says. “If you think about a system where you can say, ‘Tell me how to make a lot of clean energy cheaply,’ ‘Tell me how to efficiently capture carbon,’ and then ‘Tell me how to build a factory to do this at planetary scale’ – if you can do that, you can do a lot of other things too.”Altman’s plan to solve global warming by asking a nonexistent machine for three wishes is not something our civilization can afford to indulge. The tech oligarchs are confident that their godhead will arrive and deliver us to paradise. This offers them moral absolution for their actions and gives them a sense of meaning. But their faith offers nothing for the rest of us, who cannot afford to live anywhere other than the real world.Adam Becker is a science journalist, astrophysicist, and author ofMore Everything Forever: AI Overlords, Space Empires, and Silicon Valley’s Crusade to Control the Fate of HumanityExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionElon MuskJeff BezosMarsSpacecommentShareReuse this content"

But Palestinian films are facing intimidation campaignsSat 3 May 2025 07.00 EDTShareRecently, The Encampments opened at the Angelika Film Center in New York to arecord-settingbox office for an independent film – along with a storm of controversy. For us, as the distributor, the atmosphere was far from celebratory. The theater was forced to hire additional security, notify police and prepare staff for harassment in response to protests and threats from people who hadn’t even seen the film.What is so dangerous about Palestinian films?The Encampments offers unprecedented access to the student protest movement for divestment against Israel’s genocide inGazathat began at Columbia University and spread nationwide. It captures the raw, unfiltered reality of the encampments and the students who risked their futures to speak out. It directly challenges the dominant, distorted narrative portraying these protests as violent or antisemitic, revealing instead a disciplined, principled movement rooted in solidarity, anti-racism, free speech and human rights – with many Jewish students at the core.I’m a Jewish Israeli in the US standing up for Palestine. By Trump’s logic, I’m a terror supporter | Eran ZelnikRead moreThat, it seems, is enough to make many feel threatened.We’re now in an era in which even mentioning the word “Palestine” is treated as a provocation. Donald Trump has openly used “Palestinian”as a slur to attack opponents. Under his second administration, suppression and fearmongering are reaching levels more typical of a dictatorship than a democracy. Student activists such asMahmoud Khalil, featured in the film, andRumeysa Ozturkhave been snatched by plainclothes Ice officers, disappeared from public view and threatened with deportation for criticizing Israel. This isn’t dystopian fiction. This is the United States in 2025.And yet, films like The Encampments are being met with hostility. Before opening weekend, an angry patron vandalized the Angelika lobby and berated staff. Meanwhile, social media ads for the film are being censored. Behind it all is a pattern: politically motivated efforts to silence Palestinian voices. It’s not just wrong, it’s a threat to our most fundamental freedom: the right to free speech.When the Academy-shortlisted documentary From Ground Zero, which we also distribute, was released, it was widely praised for its humanist lens and deliberate avoidance of politics. Despite that andnear perfect reviews, CUFI (Christians United for Israel) sent letters to Academy voters urging them not to support the film and pressured theaters to pull it. After a screening was scheduled in Gainesville, Florida, the venue received threats from donors to withdraw funding. It’s extremely unfair for venue owners to be put in such a situation by politically driven pressure campaigns. We hope that despite attempts to intimidate them, theaters will not succumb to the pressure, and instead will make the right moral and business decision to show these films, for which there is clearly an appetite.The pressure doesn’t end with threats or vandalism. Hamdan Ballal, co-director of the Oscar-winningNo Other Land, wasbeaten by Israeli settlers and soldiers, seemingly in retaliation for filming what Israel wants hidden. According to Ballal, his name and the word “Oscar” were shouted during the attack. And just last week, we were devastated to learn that the Gaza-based journalistFatima Hassounawas killed in an Israeli airstrike the very same week a film featuring her as the main subject was accepted into the Cannes film festival.In Miami Beach, the city’s mayorthreatened to shut down O Cinemafor screening No Other Land. When elected officials dictate what art can or cannot be shown, we’re no longer dealing with discourse – we’re dealing with censorship.And yet, the tides are slowly turning. Attempts to silence these films have failed. No Other Land won an Academy Award. The assault on Ballal prompted international outcry. The mayor of Miami Beachbacked down. CUFI’s letters were largely ignored. And films such as From Ground Zero, No Other Land and The Encampments are proving through box office performance that there is a strong demand.Still, there is a long road ahead. Arabs and Muslims remain deeply underrepresented in the film industry, both in front of and behind the camera. Zooming in further, Palestinians in specific are virtually invisible, withMo Amerstanding as a rare and singular exception.Why are so many world leaders silent on Gaza? | Fiona KatauskasRead moreThis is the crux: Palestinian films aren’t dangerous because they incite violence. They’re “dangerous” because they offer a perspective contrary to the dominant narrative of the US government andIsrael. The Encampments is not just a film – it’s a test. Of courage, of integrity and of whether this country still believes in freedom of expression. Theaters that screen it are doing more than showing a documentary. They are standing up for the idea that cinema should remain a space for free speech and artistic expression.The question is: do all voices actually have an equal right to be heard – and if so, when will industry leaders stop being complicit in their silencing? The answer should have come long ago – but it’s not too late.Hamza and Badie Ali are the co-founders of Watermelon Pictures, a Palestinian-owned film label dedicated to amplifying underrepresented voicesThe Encampments will open in the UK in early 2025.Explore more on these topicsColumbia UniversityOpinionUS campus protestsIsrael-Gaza warUS universitiesGazaDonald TrumpNew YorkcommentShareReuse this content"

She wanted my opinion on a brightly coloured jacket she was eyeing. Laughing because I was in my usual uniform of whatever black clothes were clean, I told her it looked great and urged her to buy it. But she wavered, admitting that although she’d begun hunting out more unusual clothes since retirement, she was also in the process of shedding her belongings.I’d heard about “Swedish death cleaning” from friends whose parents were downsizing in anticipation of what they’d leave behind, and I blurted out the fact that my father had died suddenly, and my brother and I were in the painful process of cleaning out his house. I’m not sure why I felt compelled to reveal my loss, but as I talked, a sting of tears threatened.As my patient was dying, this is how we failed her | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreThe woman obviously noticed because she stopped flicking through a rack of skirts to give me her full attention. In a gravelly voice she explained that before she’d retired, she’d worked for many years as a psychologist, helping families deal with death. Her job had often involved mediation between fighting siblings, because even those who were close struggled with the differences in their approach to sorting through an estate. Some of us are impatient and just want it done, while others have to handle every item before allowing anything to be binned. I’d had some experience with this when my mum died, and I’d manically hunted for her letters as a way of preserving her, but hearing it confirmed from a stranger in an unexpected place was somehow reassuring.While other people continued to shop around us, the woman gave me the advice she used to give her clients. Make three piles. One pile for what my brother and I both agreed could be thrown out or given away. One pile for what we both definitely wanted to keep. And one pile for the great undecided. She also said we shouldn’t remove anything from the house until it made it into one of the piles that we both agreed upon.Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningI told her that it was too late for us. We’d already started emptying rooms in a highly haphazard way, excavating drawers, cupboards and filing cabinets and discovering school reports and photographs that we thought were lost to the years. Our days at the house were partly spent sneezing because of the dust, partly in a state of reverie as we lost ourselves to memories we hadn’t considered since we were children, and partly complaining about the seemingly never-ending task we’d begun.I joked that Dad was as far from a Swedish death cleaner as was possible to be. Instead, he’d kept everything. From all the birthday cards and notes my children had written him since they could hold a pen, to T-shirts worn on holidays in another time. His house had a certain order to it and was livable, but it was clear that he’d clung on to many things for sentimental reasons and not for practical ones.As we talked, I realised that although it would now be easier for us if Dad had sorted things before he died, the process of emptying his house was allowing me to see him differently. There are complex reasons why we file one love letter and not another, scribble a note on the back of a photograph to remind us of a treasured day, and store recipes of foods so familiar we can almost taste them when we read the list of ingredients. We may never know the reason why someone has kept these things, but we can at least use their belongings to map out what mattered most to them.Theoretically a Swedish death clean means a lighter load for those tasked with emptying your space after you’re gone, but it can also mean the loss of mementoes, treasures and historical ephemera that can help the living to put together the puzzle of who you were. I’ve discovered things about Dad I didn’t know. Sure, some things I didn’t need to know, but others have helped to make the pain of losing him slightly easier.The woman nodded like she understood but told me she was still set in her plan to minimise what she owned so that nobody else would be stuck with it. Before we could continue talking, her daughter appeared, and it was clear that she was eager for them to leave. I asked if she thought her mum should buy the brightly coloured jacket and she shook her head. Smiling, she told me that it was too hot in far north Queensland for a padded coat. And besides, her mum already had enough clothes. She really didn’t need any more.Nova Weetman is an award-winning children’s author.

I’m resolving to put my device away and just dance: I hope others followSat 3 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 15.28 EDTShareI’m making a public vow, which I fear I may abandon the moment Lana Del Rey comes on stage at Wembley in July: to stop recording concerts on my phone. Last Sunday, producer and DJ Kaytranadaresponded to a fan on Xwho was frustrated at motionless concertgoers with their phones in the air, writing: “I think we have come in this age where everybody’s trying to catch a moment for their own social media presence. It shows their appreciation instead of them dancing and enjoying shows like we used to.” Even though I wasn’t at Kaytranada’s show, he had me bang to rights.I have in the past incessantly recorded gigs, insisting to myself that there is no impairment of my enjoyment, or that determinedly rejigging the camera for a panoramic shot of the entire stage was all part of the concert experience. Lost in the spirit of a moment, it can be nice to snap yourself and friends singing along to your favourite artist, and to create a personal archive of a concert’s best bits.But what Kaytranada has really nailed is the fact that often recording concerts to upload footage to social media is meant to betray a kind of cool to your audience and reap the intangible social rewards of being a source of Fomo. Concert recording can be like letting everyone know you’ve been invited to the coolest party – the exclusivity factor baked into the ticket price. Personally, I’m moving on to more subtle and mysterious ways to signal status, like casually dropping the concerts I’m attending in a newspaper.The whole record and upload process has almost been gamified by social media such as TikTok, where clips can go viral and even be picked up by the press. Particularly with large, anticipated tours, there’s almost a race to be the person who captures and releases the best footage of a certain moment, with all the accompanying hopes of fast numbers and engagement. Broke the news of Charli xcx’s fiance George Daniel doing the TikTok Apple dance at her O2 show long before anyone else? Here’syour post embedded in NMEand a thousand new followers; don’t spend it all at once.I was among the first people in the world to see Beyoncé’s Renaissance world tour in Stockholm in 2023 – I uploaded a video of her opening with Dangerously in Love 2 to my former Twitter/X account while she was still mid-song. I got thousands of likes and retweets and people commenting, many pleasantly shocked that she had opened a tour connected to a dance album with an R&B ballad. But what was the point of doing that, really? While I still had fun, I was distracted by my phone during a concert by one of my favourite artists, all for the sake of some ephemeral internet buzz. I haven’t even looked at any of those clips again.View image in fullscreenBeyoncé opens her Renaissance world tour in Stockholm, 10 May 2023.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for ParkwoodHow much you get your phone out at a concert is not necessarily inversely correlated with fun, but it can just become a faff and a compulsion. At the end of the night you find yourself with a depleted battery, your camera cluttered with maybe a hundred clips, and a lot of time wasted swiping through each one figuring out which is the best to use to show off on social media. I also had a ticket to Beyoncé’s London show where I felt no need to record the same performance twice and had possibly the best concert experience of my life. But we can’t always attend every tour twice – with today’s prices, it’s a money pit just going once.I suppose, though, that there are those who are performing a kind of public service. Beyoncé kicked off her Cowboy Carter tour in California this week, and,as with other major concerts, there were several livestreams across Instagram and TikTok from people who have committed to capturing the show from open to close for those fans who can’t attend due to location or expense. There are problems with this; some people complain of “concert spoilers” filling their timelines (though I personally don’t think aconcert can be“spoiled”), and I’m not especially clear at what point it becomes piracy. But with the decline of tour DVDs and uncertainty over whether you’ll ever set your eyes on an iconic stage design beyond press stills again, I can see why recording still feels necessary for posterity.But it doesn’t have to be you. Rest safe in the knowledge that the most dedicated fans, probably with tickets for multiple nights, will shoot and upload the best angles and most surprising moments for you to scroll past later. Maybe limit yourself to one or two clips for theInstagramstory, then lock your phone away, wave your hands in the air and “move them hips”, as Kaytranada says.Jason Okundaye is an assistant newsletter editor and writer at the GuardianExplore more on these topicsMusicOpinionSocial mediaSmartphonesTikTokInstagramXLana Del ReycommentShareReuse this content"

On World Press Freedom Day, be aware of the peril involved in seeking the truthSat 3 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 14.18 EDTShareLast month, Georgian presidentMikheil Kavelashviliapproved a new lawinflicting criminal charges, including prison sentences and fines, on any organisation or individual who fails to comply with the country’s “foreign influence” bill.The news didn’t trouble the front pages of the international press and went largely unnoticed, but it marks a significant inflection point in the decline of global press freedom.The original bill,first adopted in May 2024, mandated all independent media and NGOsreceiving over 20%of their funding from abroad to register as “acting in the interest of a foreign power”. The previous month, Kyrgyzstan had adoptedan almost identical piece of legislation. In August,it was Venezuela’s turn. Turkeytabled a draft bill in October, before Paraguaysigned its into action in November.Over the span of just seven months, countries in easternEurope, central Asia and South America were awash with these laws, all with the same basic premise – organisations and individuals receiving foreign funding must make themselves known to the government.On the face of it, this seems like a justifiable measure to protect national security. Foreign interference is a very real threat for many countries, especially during election cycles. Just this year, a host of foreign actors wagedmass disinformation campaigns on Germany’s elections, spreading false accusations that candidates for the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) were victims of election fraud.But the devil is in the detail. And – as is so often the case with these laws – there very deliberately isn’t any.The US used to be the gold standard for press freedom. Not any more | Kai FalkenbergRead moreTheir power lies in vague, broad wording. Wording that can, and has been, easily weaponised to inflict legal penalties and crippling stigma to such an extent that it renders the work of anyone implicated effectively impossible. Especially journalists.Take the archetypal example:Russia’s “foreign agent”law. Initially adopted in the aftermath of protests againstVladimir Putin’s returnas Russian president in 2012, the law stipulates a “foreign agent” to be any individual or organisation that receives foreign funding and engages in “political activities”. Yet, the definition of political activities is so vague as to encompass absolutely anything that could influence public opinion, from hosting an educational event to simply printing opinion polls.Once labelled as such, a journalist or newsroom would have to register with the justice ministry, submit regular reports on their activities, finances and interactions, facing fines and prison sentences if they so much as miss a deadline.Their assets can be frozen, bank accounts closed and the donations or grants that once kept them afloat cut off. They are even barred from entering educational facilities such as schools, universities or kindergartens.And then there’s the social stigma. This is baked into the very label itself – “foreign agent”. It is purposely couched in the rhetoric of espionage, designed to evoke memories for those old enough to remember the fate of citizens branded as such during Soviet-era purges: arrests, executions and gulags.For many, the strain is too much to bear. At least 93 independent media outlets are knownto have been forced into exile from Russia.In Belarus, which adopted its evenharsher version of this lawin 2023, the majority have left.But even in exile they cannot escape the label. By law, they are required to include a disclaimer on all published materials, stating “this is the product of an organisation designated as a foreign agent”.Even so much as a personal Facebook post. This often deters audiences back home from reading their reporting, afraid of attracting increased state surveillance through association. The tag is such a visceral part of many Russian and Belarusian exiled journalists’ identity that some now print it on T-shirts or even tattoo it on their bodies.The impact on future generations of budding journalists from these countries is also devastating, limiting their aspirations and ability to develop skills in an industry that is vilified, leaving a void in which there is no counter to state propaganda.It would be naive to think this is a problem solely reserved for autocratic states, however. As disinformation campaigns and electoral interference become more prevalent, many democracies are also considering this type of legislation – Italy and the UK,to name two.View image in fullscreenMikheil Kavelashvili, Georgia’s president, in Tbilisi, Georgia, 14 December 2024.Photograph: Georgian Parliament Press Service/EPAThey have every right to do so. But it is vital that the finer details are fleshed out. As we have seen over recent years, a country that is democratic now can quickly backslide into authoritarianism. When this happens, autocratic leaders will take advantage of these loosely defined, albeit well-intentioned, laws to stamp out dissent.There is some evidence to suggest that strategic domestic and international pressure campaigns – especially if tied to the continuance of foreign direct investment into those countries – may be effective in pushing back against foreign agent-style laws. Turkey’s draft 2024 bill, for example, hasbeen subsequently withdrawnfor the time being thanks to a coordinated effort from legal associations, human rights advocacy groups and media freedom organisations.But in many countries the damage is already done. More than anything now, these journalists and newsrooms, whether in exile or staying home to fight on, need legal representation and guidance.Since 2022, the Thomson Reuters Foundation has been supporting exiled independent newsrooms to set up their operations in new jurisdictions and to build their legal resilience to withstand these “lawfare” attacks.For many,Georgiaseemed like a natural place for them to initially reset. Russian nationals, for example, could travel freely to the country and the land border crossing made it practical to move quickly. Yet, this year, we have been devastated to find some of the first newsrooms we helped set up in exile there are being forced to flee once more.Journalists are quite literally being chased across borders by foreign agent-style laws, hounded and harassed from one country to the next. These are profoundly worrying times, but we are scaling up our work.

But in a party that brooks no dissent, that message isn’t getting throughJohn McDonnell was shadow chancellor for Labour from 2015 to 2020Sat 3 May 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 06.14 EDTShareThe response from Labour spokespeople so far to theloss of Runcorn and Helsby– and to the election results as a whole – has been especially tin-eared. There doesn’t seem to be any understanding of the deep-seated emotion in the reaction of Labour supporters to the party’s behaviour in government over the past 10 months. There used to be talk of the need for emotional literacy in politics. What we are witnessing is a staggering level of emotional illiteracy.Labour supporters feel deeply that their party has turned its back on them. It’s not just that they feel they are not being listened to. It’s that the Starmer and Reeves government is doing things that they believe noLabourgovernment should ever do.After 14 years of enduring year after year of austerity under the Conservatives, there was such a collective sigh of relief in getting rid of the incompetent, corrupt and brutal Tories. There might not have been much in the way of inspiring politics fromKeir Starmerin the run-up to the election last July, but at least we had a Labour government.The problem now is that, at times, the government is unrecognisable as a Labour government. This isn’t the traditional argument about whether the Starmer administration is behaving like old Labour or New Labour. It’s whether it’s Labour at all in the eyes of people who have supported us or would want to support us.The strategy dictated by Starmer’s office appears to be that, to neutralise Reform, Labour has to position itself as close to Nigel Farage’s party as possible. The argument is that this will give Labour the breathing space of the next few years to deliver the investment and noticeable improvement in our public services that will garner the support needed to win the next election.The plan was that the large-scale investment required to radically improve our public services would come from growth and a limited range of tax redistribution measures. The problems with this strategy became pretty obvious very quickly.If Labour seeks to ape Reform, then voters will largely opt for the real deal and vote Reform, while at the same time Labour will alienate supporters who are aghast at the party adopting Reform-like positioning on immigration.If the growth and investment in the economy are not on the scale needed, then the only other way to secure these resources is through borrowing or redistribution of wealth. Having a fiscal rule that restricts borrowing becomes largely a technical argument, but when books are balanced through cuts in the winter fuel allowance, a national insurance “jobs tax” andcuts to disability benefits, no amount of citing improvements in NHS waiting-list figures can overcome the betrayal Labour supporters feel.The problems with the strategy are so obvious, but the usual mechanisms for communicating signs of discontent are broken. In normal circumstances the feedback from Labour’s membership in the constituencies or from MPs and councillors would flag up an emerging problem.This self-correcting mechanism within the party failed to operate because the centralised control of the party under Starmer has meant that political debate in constituency Labour parties is closed down or ignored and dissent expressed by Labour MPs is met with threats of the withdrawal of the whip. As the large number of newly elected MPs took time to find their feet, it naturally meant that their voices have been relatively quiet.The overall impression now is that the government lacks not just any political strategy but also any sense of purpose. People are also questioning the moral compass of a government that increases poverty among children by keeping the Conservatives’ two-child limit and among pensioners by means-testing the winter fuel allowance, as well as one that puts the welfare of hundreds of thousands of disabled people at risk by cutting their benefits.It’s time for Labour party members and elected representatives to stand up and call for a resetting of Labour’s strategy but also, just as importantly, to reclaim the party for democracy so that we do not cut ourselves off from our supporters like this again. A first, significant step to symbolise that change would be for the Labour leadership to listen to our people and drop the cuts to disability benefits.John McDonnell is the independent MP for Hayes and Harlington.

It was CJFQ 29:4; my old brain has forgotten many things, but that number is deeply engrained. The details of what happened next are confused, until the door at the bottom of the stairs in my billet was slammed closed by my unwilling hosts, and I lay trembling on that settee. As an adult, my first reaction to everything is fear, which I put down to my wartime childhood, along with my ability to survive. After two runaway escapades I was allowed to return to London, preferring bombs to bullying locals.View image in fullscreenSheila Hancock as a child.This month, we are commemorating the 80th anniversary ofVE Day, and I worry that we will turn it into a yet another jingoistic celebration of the second world war. Yes, in 1945 we were relieved that the bombs and doodlebugs and rocket weapons had stopped, and we heard there was fun going on in the West End of London – but where I lived it was less jubilant. The war there felt far from over: we were still waiting anxiously for the return of the young lad next door from the rumoured horror of a Japanese prisoner of war camp, and many of my friends were trying to accept as fathers strange men they barely knew. The unspeakable details of the Holocaustwere being revealed, and I imagine the grownups were utterly exhausted and often grief-stricken. For five years, they had lived under the threat of occupation. Churchill said we wouldfight them on the beachesand never surrender, but he did not deny that we could be invaded. In fact, it was a miracle we were not. And that threat is what the grownups lived with, and presumably, being unequipped, knew they could not withstand.I remember in the early days of the war asking my dad about some concrete blocks that had appeared on the pavement, and some black metal cylinders along the kerb. He explained, somewhat unconvincingly, that the blocks would be dragged into the road to stop the Nazi tanks, and the cylinders would be lit to make a smokescreen that would, together with the barrage balloons filling the skies, impede their planes. Being close to some weapons factories and the docks, our area around Bexleyheath was the scene of many dogfights between Spitfires and Nazi planes. There was even a searchlight and mobile ack-ack gun stationed on the path behind our house. When we were in our garden air raid shelter, the noise of that guncertainly scared the wits out of us, if not the Germans.Because I now deeply fear the dangerous signs of history repeating itself, I want everyone to remember that war is terrible. On VE Day 1945, the world was looking at the complete destruction of many cities, some by us.Tens of millionsof people were dead or homeless. It was hard to wholeheartedly rejoice in May 1945.Sorry to be a spoilsport. I actually hope everyone comes together and has a lovely time on the 80th anniversary. I think I probably quite enjoyed myself in 1945. The kids had a street party tea, with junket and blancmange (whatever happened to them?), with evaporated milk as cream, and a few chocolates. A feast in those strictly rationed days.View image in fullscreenSheila Hancock’s father in his air raid warden uniform.Photograph: SuppliedBut what I most remember is when the tables were removed, and someone brought out a wind-up gramophone and put it on the garden wall. The grownups did some stately ballroom dancing. Holding one another in their arms! Clinging to one another. I even saw my dad kiss my mum on the forehead. Unheard of behaviour. Were they expressing relief at being near the end of an appalling few years? Or were they giving one another strength to face the inevitable struggle to dress the mental and physical wounds of war, and build the better, fairer, more peaceful world they wanted to create?Now, our beautiful planet is under threat in many ways. History shows that the solution is definitely not to be found in autocratic leadership. Let us aim to unite the available worldwide wisdom to tackle the global crises together. Time is running out.This week, the moon reminded me of a wartime child who, along with her contemporaries, will soon be gone, taking our painful memories with us. I look back with some pride at the way that generation of adults survived, drained but determined to make the world a better place. And they did.Please God, don’t let us betray them. We must not forget and we must never let it happen again.Sheila Hancock is an actor and a writerExplore more on these topicsVE DayOpinionSecond world warcommentShareReuse this content"

No – and Keir Starmer knows thatJamie BurtonIt would be wrong for Labour to collude in the attack on the European convention. It’s fuelled by myths and false narrativesSat 3 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 14.19 EDTShareHere’s a recent quote from a Downing Street source: “We have to be able to say something on this that isn’t just defending the status quo.”The aide was discussing theEuropean convention on human rights(ECHR), a postwar treaty to protect the freedoms of people in Europe, ratified by the UK in 1951. Although it was also central to Keir Starmer’s entire pre-political career, his government is looking to water down some of the key provisions.Yvette Cooper, the home secretary, has announceda review into the “application of human rights law… to make sure that the immigration and asylum system works effectively” so that “there is a proper sense of control in the system”. A white paper is expected later this year.It doesn’t take a political genius to work out this is aboutNigel Farageand his Reform UK party. Farage has been adept at conflating the deporting of foreign criminals with asylum seekers arriving on small boats, when in fact they are entirely separate matters. By claiming the ECHR prevents foreign criminals from being deported, he appears to have succeeded in making human rights a problem for the government.And this is where the real danger lies for Labour, because the perceived need to do – or say – something has led many a politician to do the wrong thing.It’s worth spending a bit of time understanding how the law works and why the “problem” Labour is now addressing, if not amplifying, has been significantly exaggerated and misrepresented. Current rules require the Home Office to make a deportation order against any foreign criminal serving a prison sentence of 12 months or more. Only “exceptionally” can automatic deportations be avoided if they would breach the ECHR, which in practice typically means the right to family life contained inarticle 8.The number of people able to invoke this protection is relatively small. Most appeals fail and, of those that succeed, only about one in three are successful on human rights grounds. In the 13 years between 2008 and 2021, the last period for which records are available, that wasa total of 2,400 such cases out of 21,500 appeals.But even some of these failed appeals are used anecdotally by the media and politicians to claim the system is being exploited. There was a widely reported case of a man resisting deportation on the grounds that his sondisliked foreign chicken nuggets. But in court, the judge described this argument as not getting “anywhere near the level” required for deportation to be resisted.Indeed, parliament has already set a high bar in this area. Anyone making an article 8 claim must not only have been lawfully resident in the UK for most of their life, but need also be so socially and culturally integrated that there would be “very significant obstacles” to living in the receiving country. Even if they have a child or partner in the UK who has British citizenship or has been living here for at least seven years, they still have to show it would be “unduly harsh” either for the child or partner to be separated from them. Individuals who have received a sentence of more than four years must show that there are “very compelling circumstances” over and above all the other criteria. Cases that succeed typically involve someone who was born in the UK, came as a child, or has a family member with such profound needs that separation would have devastating consequences.Some reportssuggest that Denmark has managed to achieve a more restrictive regimewhile remaining within the tramlines set by the ECHR, but this is untrue. Although Denmark did try to restrict the scope for balancing different rights, it failed to safeguard the ultimate discretion of the courts to block deportation in exceptional cases after being blocked by the ECHR’s final arbiter, the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Three years ago,in a case called Savran, a decision by Danish courts was ruled illegal because it gave scant consideration to how a mentally ill applicant had integrated in Denmark since arriving as a child.The European court has been demonstrably robust in defending the right of countries who have signed up to the ECHR to reach their own judgments as to where the balance lies in respect of family life, so long as basic human rights principles are not violated. And in Britain, even the independent review of theHuman Rights Actordered by the Conservatives found no evidence that our courts were overreaching in this area.The upshot is that unless this Labour government wants to exclude any type of balancing exercise and remove the discretion of the courts entirely, it won’t be possible to make any notable reduction to the already small number of those able to rely on article 8.And to be clear: even if article 8 was expunged entirely, it would make little difference to overall immigration figures, which largely reflect the government’s view on the economic needs of the country. Neither would it affect those arriving by small boats, the vast majority of whom have no other means of applying for asylum in the UK.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage speaking during PMQs, 30 April 2025.Photograph: House of Commons/AFP/Getty ImagesSo, we’re left with the sight of the government trying to thread the needle between reducing the numbers of human rights appeals against deportation and remaining consistent with the ECHR. If the government argues that article 8 is being exploited, it will be both acknowledging a “problem” that does not really exist and refusing to do the only thing capable of addressing it. That won’t win back support among any group of voters, whether it’s those peeling off to Reform or the even larger numbers nowreportedly backingthe Liberal Democrats and the Greens.Labour is at risk not so much of losing control over immigration but the narrative around human rights – one subject the prime minister knows better than anyone. One hopes he will stick up for what he has always believed, and keep making the positive case that human rights are an integral part of a compassionate and inclusive society.Jamie Burton is a barrister at Doughty Street Chambers.

I also prioritised buying older furniture that’s built to last, especially items made with solid wood and sturdy joinery.Secondhand furniture comes without that distinctive “new furniture smell”, which is actually a sign that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are being released into the air, some of which are harmful to health.Most VOCs are released (through a process called off-gassing) within the first few days and weeks, making secondhand furniture a less toxic choice.Check with certifying bodies when buying newIf you can’t or don’t want to buy secondhand, get smart about what to look for when buying new.Australian Furniture Association (AFA) CEO, Patrizia Torelli, says a good place to start is with third-party certification bodies such asGood Environmental Choice Australia, FurnTech’sGreen Tick programandB Corporation. “They can verify any sustainability claims,” she says.You can also request product specification sheets to check which materials and chemicals were used during the manufacturing process – the answers can be shocking.A 2022Chemicals of Concern Industry Reportfound that commonly used furniture coatings, fumigants, glues, dyes, solvents, moisture and flame retardants pose a risk to human and environmental health.The report found regular use of worrying chemicals, including formaldehyde and Pfas. Six of the worst offenders have since been banned via the federal government’sIChEMS Register.“You might purchase a lovely fabric lounge suite, it’s got all the lovely add-ons like water repellent and so on – that’s where the chemicals are,” Torelli says.Dirty laundry: what really happens to your clothes when you donate them to charity?Read moreLocally made furniture tends to be less toxic, she says, because reputable Australian producers are increasingly phasing out harmful chemicals. Plus, many overseas products must be sprayed with fumigants upon entry to Australia.Ask questions and check end-of-life optionsTorelli recommends asking yourself the following questions to help determine whether a piece of furniture has been made ethically and sustainably:Was it made locally in Australia?Is it made from quality renewable or recycled materials?How easy is it torepair or refurbish?What are the end-of-life options for recycling or reuse, to keep it out of landfill?Many leading furniture brands offer repair services, and some even have take-back programs, where they’ll refurbish unwanted older pieces or dismantle them to reuse parts.Still, it’s a lot to consider when you just want a new couch – but the process could become far easier in the future. AFA and the Australian Furnishing Industry Stewardship Council (AFISC) are pushing for aFurniture Passport Australia System, a digital tracker that would trace products’ material origins, compliance certifications, environmental impact and potential for repair, reuse or recycling.“If you went to any retail outlet, you could scan the product code and it would tell you everything – where it was made, what’s in it, how it can be repaired – helping create a more sustainable furniture life cycle,” Torelli says.Until then, it’s on us as consumers to ask questions, dig a little deeper – and look beyond the price tag to what each piece really costs.Explore more on these topicsAustralia newsChange by degreesHomesPollutionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At a BBC event, the only one who’d talk to us was David Attenborough, then director of programmes, who told us the more they tried to stop it being seen, the greater would be our cult following. He was right. Years later, David, now the most respected man in television, was to receive an award at the Canadian embassy. He strolled in alone, unnoticed. I told him I admired him for arriving with so little fuss. Almost apologetically, he said, “Oh, I came here yesterday as well. It was the wrong night.”View image in fullscreenWith Michael Palin in 2002.Photograph: Richard Kendal/BBCMaria Isabel Sánchez VegaraAuthor of children’s book David Attenborough: Little People, Big DreamsWhen David was just a boy, a friend sent him a dried seahorse for his fossil collection. The tiny treasure sparked a decision – he would become a naturalist. That was 90 years ago. It’s a beautiful reminder that even the smallest gift, shared with wonder, can ignite a passion that lasts a lifetime.Will WhatleyCaptain of RRS Sir David AttenboroughSir David taught me not to take yourself too seriously. While we were building the Royal Research Ship Sir David Attenborough, I had the idea that he could record the onboard announcements – and he kindly agreed. Newcomers get a good chuckle when we play his message about the status of the toilets.Doug AndersonWildlife cameramanFor 30 years I’ve worked as a wildlife cameraman beneath the waves, in silence and shifting light. Yet in my mind David Attenborough often speaks – giving voice to wonder, turning moments into meaning. When the sea is unkind, when doubt sets in, I still hear him, calm and clear: “Stay with it, Doug. Trust the process. Trust the journey.”View image in fullscreenFilming Life on Earth in 1979.Photograph: BBC Picture PublicityJane FondaActor, activistI have watched every one of his documentaries. There is so much to learn and love, but particularly how he shows us the interconnectedness of the natural world: everything matters, and we must fight to save it all.Simon ArmitagePoet laureateDavid’s broadcasting style isn’t just about the science of the natural world. His voice is one of wonder that we have the good fortune to exist in the same space and time as these bewildering, beautiful creatures.Hamza YassinStrictly winner, children’s TV presenterDavid Attenborough taught me everything about the natural world as a young boy arriving in the UK from Sudan. He instilled the excitement in me to follow my dream of becoming a wildlife cameraman.Emily EavisCo-organiser of Glastonbury festivalThere is a spark, a shimmer of youth in him – you can see it when he talks to children. When he came to Glastonbury, we were lucky enough to meet him and my youngest kid asked, “Which is your favourite country and where would you most like to live?” He said, without hesitation, “Great Britain”, listing all the reasons, including our wonderful seasons, astonishing wildlife and the diversity in landscapes.View image in fullscreenAt Glastonbury in 2019.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianChloe CobhamFormer neighbourMy dad lived next door to David Attenborough when I was six. One afternoon, we discovered what my father remembers to be a chipmunk in our kitchen. Unsure what to do, my dad rang his doorbell. To our shock and delight, he was round in a flash and rescued it. Some years later, I wrote to him about a science project, regaled the chipmunk tale and asked some inane questions about jellyfish. He quickly responded with a handwritten letter assuring me he remembered the incident and answering my queries.Sam LeeSinger, writer, naturalistIt was Sir David’s first job, as a folk song collector for the BBC, that inspired me. These songs are examples of ancient forms of land stewardship. Could their old truths be central to his campaign today to bring about societal change to protect our beleaguered wildlife?Ben FoglePresenter, adventurer, authorDavid is the reason I do what I do. As a child, he rewilded me, providing a bridge between my urban home and the jungles and deserts of faraway places. The first time I met him was the day my wife was due to give birth to our second child. She suggested I join her first, then go and interview my hero. It was the best day of my life … for two reasons!View image in fullscreenFilming in the Suguta valley in northern Kenya in 2013.Photograph: David Chancellor/BBCDave ReayClimate scientistDavid has shaped my entire life. He’s shown me life on Earth is miraculous, beautiful, brutal; that all species matter and in harming nature we harm ourselves. He’s also made clear that I make awful cups of tea.Robin Hanbury-TenisonSurvival International founderDavid’s The Tribal Eye series was one of the first to reveal the wisdom of indigenous societies, how much they have contributed to culture and how much better they are than us at protecting the environment.Jane GoodallConservationistHe has done more than anyone to educate people around the globe about the magic of the natural world, so more and more are working to protect the environment and the ecosystems that support life.View image in fullscreenWith Jane Goodall in 2010.Photograph: Wenn Ltd/AlamyJay GriffithsWriterFrom the start, he spoke to animals in friendship and presented them to us as friends.

And if things went wrong, as they often did, so was his huge chuckle!António GuterresUNsecretary-general“If working apart, we are a force powerful enough to destabilise our planet,” David once said, “surely, working together, we are powerful enough to save it.” He has taught us we must unite to tell leaders enough is enough. Act now to protect people and nature.Beccy SpeightRSPB CEOIn Wild Isles,he waves goodbye to a Manx shearwater chick taking off on a 6,000 mile flight. “Good luck, good luck!” he chuckles. “What an astonishment!” So human, rooting for the individual bird while also teaching us the wonder its journey represents.View image in fullscreenBirdwatching in 1995.Photograph: Marinepics Ltd/ShutterstockBen GoldsmithEnvironmentalistMy love of wildlife has been nourished by David’s documentaries since childhood. The best moments I spent with my late father were watching footage of wildlife, including from our garden: blue tits raising their young, ponds teeming with frogs, foxes fighting.Simon BarnesNature writerI was once asked to speak at a World Land Trust fundraiser. So was its patron – which is why I refused: “You can’t ask me to follow David Attenborough.” They insisted – and it was then I realised I’ve been following him all my life. The world would be a better place if everyone else was to follow him, too.Bella LackEnvironmentalistI have seen young people increasingly disenchanted, wrestled from the biophilic human tendency to lean towards the natural world. It’s Sir David who has stirred up the restless curiosity that brought us back.Amy-Jane BeerRight to Roam activist, nature writerSir David is the closest we have to a real-world Gandalf or Merlin. Aided by longevity, tech-wizardry and a host of animal familiars, his quests have enriched, bewitched, inspired and motivated generations.Michael MorpurgoAuthorHe has opened hearts and minds to the connection we share with every species, and renewed in us the understanding that we are the sisters and brothers of all those with whom we share this planet. He has passed on his knowledge and love of the wild world, and given us a chance as a species to redeem ourselves.View image in fullscreenWith orangutans at London zoo in 1982.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesEd MilibandUKsecretary of state forenergy andnet zeroNobody has done more to fill us with awe about our world, or to inspire us to protect and preserve it for future generations.

We need leaders like this more than ever, to speak out for the natural world with compassion and purity of vision.Joe LycettComedianBefore doing something I’m unsure about, I think: would David Attenborough approve? If not, I (usually) don’t do it. Among all his achievements, his role as our national moral compass is the most important.Simon KingConservationist, presenterIn an age of celebrity for celebrity’s sake, David is atypical. Despite being one of the most famous people on the planet, he remains humble and puts the focus of his passion – the natural world – front and centre.View image in fullscreenWorking on Zoo Quest in 1954.Photograph: © David AttenboroughAlan TitchmarshGardener, author, presenterSir David fostered in this Yorkshire lad a love of the natural world. I have met him several times and recall one pat on the back when, after I’d interviewed him, he nodded at me and said, “A safe pair of hands.” I feel bashful about repeating it but treasure our encounters.Megan McCubbinBroadcasterEven though he’s travelled the globe seeing rare and endangered wildlife, he still comes home to admire the blackbirds in his garden. An important reminder to recognise the extraordinary in the ordinary.Mike DilgerNaturalist, broadcasterAs a mediocre student, I won a school award for “trying hard” and bought Life on Earth by a certain D Attenborough. This fabulous book lit a fire in my 12-year-old soul, that 46 years on still blazes away, with a burning desire (like him) to spark an interest in the natural world in anyone willing to listen.Kate HumbleTV presenterWhen you see something you’ve never seen before, you need a guide. Someone with authority, but who doesn’t talk down to you. Someone with knowledge they want to share. Someone with infectious enthusiasm, always curious, always with a sense of wonder. Someone who tells the story without making themselves the story. And that’s David.View image in fullscreenWith Kate Humble in 2010.Photograph: Hilary Jeffkins/BBCDiane BoydAuthorAs a wolf and carnivore biologist, I was amazed byDavid’s show on pitcher plants, which ingest insects and mice through mimicry and entrapment. Who knew these beauties could be so dangerous?Christy LefteriAuthor of The Beekeeper of AleppoI have been haunted by David Attenborough’s stark warnings about the climate crisis. I learned from him that fires should regenerate a landscape, but instead they are becoming destructive, ferocious. I visited a burned-down forest near Athens where once lived birds of prey and foxes and weasels and butterflies and bats and snakes and lizards. A wildfire had ripped through, transforming it to ash and ghosts.Craig BennettThe Wildlife Trusts CEOThe Victorian tradition of natural history was very much about cataloguing species, almost in isolation from their environment. But as a child of the 70s and 80s, watching The World About Us with boiled eggs and toast for Sunday night tea, Sir David taught me to celebrate the infinite connections of Life on Earth.Stephen MossFormerwildlife TVproducer“Ah, you’re the birdman!” were David’s first words to me, swiftly followed by, “I don’t really know much about birds.” Not false modesty, but because he has always seen himself as a popular communicator rather than an academic expert. He does, of course, have an immense avian knowledge, as I discovered while interviewing him for the series Birds Britannia, during which he offered his insights into what birds truly mean to “the health of the human spirit”, while delighting in the noisy parakeets in his garden.View image in fullscreenWith daughter Susan and cockatoo Georgie in 1957.Photograph: Smith Archive/AlamyRowan WilliamsTheologian, poetThere are people who seem to think concern for the natural world somehow sidelines characteristically human concerns. David Attenborough makes it clear deep attention to our environment nourishes all that is most humane and generous in us – and if we lose this capacity for caring attention, we lose our souls.Benedict AllenWriter, explorer, film-makerHe once said to me, “In the end, Benedict, I’m a professional communicator. And I chose to communicate what I passionately care about: our planet.” I thought that was perfect. Also, I love that he inspired my friend’s daughter with a long, heartfelt letter, replying to her scribbled little note as a very young fan. She’s now a grownup, and an ecologist.Ben OkriAuthorThe chief thing learned from David Attenborough is that longevity in the service of a leading interest is one of the most powerful things in the world. Year after year, just when you would think there is nothing more to be said about the mole or the seal, the tiger cub or the zebra, David finds a new lyricism in the ordinary denizens of the natural world going about their business wholly unaware of being observed and gushed over by this passionate Englishman.View image in fullscreenWith Ben Okri at the Observer Magazine ethical awards in 2009.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianInger AndersenExecutive director of the United Nations Environment ProgrammeAs part of Blue Planet II, Sir David captured the beauty of our oceans and the threats they are facing, including the impacts of plastic pollution. It helped build momentum behind a global call to action.Lucy LapwingBroadcaster, naturalistIn admiring David, I’ve learned it’s OK to be critical of your heroes. David has inspired millions, but he’s not infallible. People have called for him to be more outspoken, and it’s working: recent documentaries have highlighted the plight of the natural world in the face of the climate and consumption crises. I’ve also learned the spider-tailed horned viper has a tail that resembles an arachnid. Nature is incredible.Chantelle LindsayConservationist, presenterDavid’s voice and vast knowledge have long been a soundtrack to my journey of connecting with nature.

He was responsible for Wimbledon being the first regular colour TV offering and for developing snooker as a TV sport, now you could see the balls in colour.Louis TherouxBroadcaster, writerI’ve watched David Attenborough’s programmes my whole life and what I am inspired by, other than the obvious warmth and intelligence, is the economy of his writing and the music of how he delivers the lines: the pauses, the inflection, how he can imbue even a single word with wit. He never says too much.Benedict MacdonaldWriter, founder of RestoreThe lesson I remember from David is, when creating a sequence, “don’t just show what has happened, but why it is important”. We spent two years setting up shoots in Sumatra for Our Planet, trying to captureorangutans using toolsfor the first time. But it was the emotional resonance of the wider setting that made the story; here they were, showing near-human behaviour, in a habitat being cut down by humans.Dr Mya-Rose CraigAKA Birdgirl,Black2Nature founderAs a child who was aware their love of birds was seen as odd, I lived for each Attenborough documentary that came to our living rooms. His love of birds helped me learn mine wasn’t weird, that it makes sense to be excited by the natural world humans are part of.View image in fullscreenWith Mya-Rose Craig in 2016.Photograph: courtesy of Mya-Rose CraigLizzy CrottyAustralian conservationistWhen I met Sir David, what struck me most was his sense of humour. He reminded me that, while conservation is serious work, we won’t last if we don’t find joy along the way.Charles FosterAuthor of Cry of the WildIt’s not the epic elements of David’s work that stay with me – the high drama of a hunt across the plains, or the ant’s eye view of an aphid – but his childlike wonder at it all. David shows us it’s intellectually respectable to love the non-human world, and if you observe closely, you’ll get very emotional about it.Tim HanniganTravel writerBritain’s rich tradition of nature writing wouldn’t exist without David. His documentaries introduced me to nature as narrative. The shock of the revelation that chimpanzees sometimes hunt other animals – and behave in uncannily familiar ways – still lingers.Chloe DaltonAuthorWatching his presentation ofthe male bowerbird’s efforts to lure a mate, I realised nature contains more wonders than can be observed in a single lifespan, but a lifetime can be spent learning from its secrets.Michael MalayNature writerIn one of her letters, Elizabeth Bishop described the qualities she admired in Charles Darwin: exactness of attention and openness to mystery. Behind the patient collector of “facts and minute details”, she glimpsed a “young man … sliding giddily off into the unknown”. She could have easily been describing David Attenborough. He, too, has helped us see the world with greater respect, care, accuracy and joy.View image in fullscreenWith the Zoo Quest team in 1956, en route to Komodo, island home of the giant lizard.Photograph: © David AttenboroughHuw CordeyWildlife documentary-makerDavid radiates confidence and calmness (although I discovered on a shoot he has a phobia of rats). I was once working with him in Bristol when he got a call to say there’d been a mix-up and he had a speaking engagement in St Paul’s in London that afternoon – he was doing the keynote speech, which he’d done nothing to prepare for. He didn’t seem at all flustered. Next day, I asked how it went. “Oh, fine,” he said. “I waved my arms around a bit and it seemed to work.”Bill BaileyComedian, musician, writerHis elegant, unceasing advocacy for the planet is an example to us all. To paraphrase the Victorian naturalist and explorerAlfred Russel Wallace, he is himself one of the great productions of nature.Dara McAnultyAuthor, conservationistDavid Attenborough’s unwavering voice follows you when you’re out in nature. Recently, on a field trip to Borneo, I was (nastily) bitten by a centipede, thanks to my naive explorer complex (which he also inspired). Of course his voice rang in my ears, his indomitable, and sometimes necessary, admonishing narrative. That’s the power of his presence, his embodiment of the joy and wonder of the natural world.Lorraine KellyTV presenter, authorI was honoured to interview the great man and wanted to sit at his feet and listen to him for hours – he has so much wisdom, compassion and humanity. He saved me when I was editing my book while camping in remote Zimbabwe. The only wifi was at anti-poaching stations and when I showed them a pic of me and him, I was given all the internet access I needed.View image in fullscreenDavid Attenborough’s Madame Tussauds waxwork with Lorraine Kelly in 2023.Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/ShutterstockHelen MacdonaldAuthorLife on Earthwas a foundational experience for me.

And that, ever since, is what I have tried to do.Kate WinsletActorBefore the digital world filled our everyday lives, we lived in a different time. David Attenborough remains, for me, an integral part of how things used to be. Our more plentiful oceans, our verdant, bulging rainforests, full of species that thrived before their natural habitats came under such serious threat. He is someone I would swim through stormy seas to meet. In a declining world when we desperately need compassionate anchors, David is that anchor for so many, showing us depths and beauty that won’t be with us forever, forming a picture for future generations of just how vital it is to stay educated, to stay curious.Hans ZimmerComposerI’ve been a film composer all my life, telling stories with music. I’ve worked oncountless movies– some great, some good and some I’d rather not mention. But I’ve always loved the process, the endless hunt for the right note, which expresses something that can’t be elegantly expressed in images or words alone.And then, one day, Sir David and the BBC Natural History Unit came knocking on my door and seduced me with the truth and beauty of extraordinary pictures, tales of courage and a love of the world we have the honour to share with fascinating and extraordinary creatures. And the power of Sir David’s message, always spoken gently with his extraordinary human spirit and intellect, reaching out to us – profoundly moving and kind, full of hope and love – convincing me that now, I’ve finally found the reason for my work.Sadiq KhanMayor of LondonHe is a guiding light in our efforts to make London a more sustainable city.

A council estate girl from the city, destined for the corporate world. David has the gift of inspiring people from all walks of life to appreciate and respect nature – a real super power and key to a greener future.Tony JuniperChair of Natural EnglandI have never forgotten Sir David telling of the huge significance of the evolution of grasses. They are the basis of food webs that include grazing mammals and predators such as lions, because they grow from the bottom up, not the top, like other plants. When I see a neatly trimmed lawn, this pops into my mind.Bill McKibbenClimate activist, authorHis whole life has been a remarkable journey, but the last couple of decades are a powerful reminder that long experience can produce deep clarity.View image in fullscreenAbseiling down a living wall in 2016.Photograph: Toby Smith/Geoff Robinson PhotographyMelissa HarrisonAuthorThere’s respect and patience in his approach to nature: it’s not all drama and spectacle, but also waiting, at times failing, it’s about smaller, intimate behaviours, and not inserting yourself into what’s unfolding. Just sitting on a riverbank watching fish flick about feels like something David showed me how to do.Fiona MathewsProfessor ofenvironmentalbiologyI first met David with a bat in my hand. We were at an event with throngs of people and he made a beeline for me as soon as he saw the bat. It turns out they are among his favourite animals, demonstrating his true love of the weird, wonderful creatures of the planet.Farhana YaminClimate lawyer, authorI came to the UK from Pakistan in 1973. My dad banned “western” TV but Life on Earth was allowed – Attenborough’s storytelling made everything fascinating, whether it was about exotic creatures such as cheetahs or insects in our gardens. My sense that nature is a source of delight but that we have a responsibility to protect it comes from him.Molly EastonCo-director ofYoungwildersAttenborough taught me nature is something we do together – not just watch “over there”. Visually, this is strongest when he’s interacting with wildlife (my favourite is him observing a bowerbird’s nest). Seeing ourselves as active participants in nature is key.View image in fullscreenWith a pygmy goanna in 1984.Photograph: Fairfax Media Archives/Getty ImagesBono and Ali HewsonMusician and activist/businesswomanIn a world full of noise, you find signal with a whisper.

Happy birthday.David OburaMarine ecologist, coral expertI was brought up on Life on Earth. I received the book as a birthday present before I turned 13, still on my bookshelf now. I pored through each chapter, then waited with bated breath for episodes flown to Kenya on VHS video, screened at sporadic movie nights. I wonder that his words now sound close to a semi-obituary for nature that can yet be beautiful, but must be at a new balance with our overbearing species.Colin ButfieldCo-author with David Attenborough of Ocean: Earth’s Last WildernessI remember, before I met him, watching in The Life of Mammals a blue whale breaking through the water as he perched in a small boat only a metre or so away. It was 2002, so there were no drones or satellite tags to help them locate the whale. Most of us would have said “wow” or waffled a few rehearsed facts. David told a story. I’ve learned many things from working with him but the one that stays with me is the power of turning expert research into a fascinating story.View image in fullscreenFilming A Life on Our Planet with Colin Butfield in 2018.Photograph: Conor McDonnellChris WatsonMusician, sound recordistIn April 2010, I was standing with David at the north pole. The Russian helicopter that had flown us there had just taken to the air to film him standing alone on the ice. I had stayed to keep him company and would duck behind a slab of sea ice when the helicopter returned. As we chatted, we observed that in one direction was the US while to our left was Europe and farther over was Asia. All the time zones on the planet converged at our feet, so what time was it for us?Helen CzerskiPhysicist, oceanographer, presenterThe UK named a research vessel for him and I saw it being built and talked to him about it. His excitement was focused on the science it would enable, and the new ideas, new knowledge and new perspectives on the natural world that would come with it. It was humbling to see such indomitable curiosity, alongside the absolute conviction that nature will always have something fascinating to teach us.Raynor WinnAuthorDavid taught us to look below the surface, observe the detail, then question what we saw. I received the Life on Earth book as a school prize in 1979. Since then, he’s taught us all how to see what’s really happening, not just in nature but in the wider shifting world.Tanya SteeleWWF CEODavid is famous for his words, yet he is a generous listener, whether discussing politics or a new species. I’m inspired by his willingness to be a voice for nature in the corridors of power as well as our living rooms.Louis JadwatClub promoterYou might not think of David Attenborough as having a big impact on clubbing, but in 2018 a student party my friend Will and I threw,celebrating him, went viral. We turned a Leeds venue into a jungle and filled it with cardboard cutouts and masks. Then the DJ cut his narration over tracks. It led to a sort of collective joy, realising he’d taught a generation to find excitement and happiness in the natural world.Mary RobinsonFormer president of Ireland, former UN human rights commissioner andclimate envoyOur family loved watching David Attenborough’s films, enthralled by his wonder and joy. Gradually, watching with grandchildren, I became irritated. Why did he not mention the climate crisis? When he did, with increasing authority, what a difference he made!View image in fullscreenWith Mary Robinson, receiving an honorary degree from Trinity College Dublin in 2008.Photograph: PA Images/AlamyElif ShafakAuthor, activistFor me, David Attenborough is, first and foremost, an exquisite storyteller, making “the invisible” more visible and bringing the “far away” closer to our homes and thus our hearts. In an age in which we need to connect the dots and see how deeply interconnected we all are beyond borders, he is a bridge builder between cultures and continents, humans and nature.Debbie PainConservation biologist, ecotoxicologistIn 2016 David Attenborough wrote a letter on behalf of the World Land Trust, for which I worked, opposing plans to build an environmentally disastrous road bridge across the Kinabatangan River in Borneo. The Guardian publishedextracts of his letterin early 2017, and plans were halted. I’ve learned The Power of One: one man, one letter, one enormous difference.Kabir KaulConservationist, wildlife campaignerSir David’s introduction to nature’s beauty galvanised me to campaign for wildlife in cities.

Katie Holmes is an undertaker! And Kumail Nunjiani is the new Tiger King! The super cool, celebrity-packed show is even wilder than everRebecca NicholsonSat 3 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareThe best thing aboutPoker Faceis that it doesn’t bother trying to shore up what it knows is a flimsy premise. Fans of the first season will recall that Charlie Cale, Natasha Lyonne’s wisecracking 70s detective homage, has an in-built ability to detect a lie as soon as someone tells it. Instead of trying to explain this gift away as the result of a gamma storm or spider bite or covert government experiment, it now accepts that, yeah, she has a “freaky little lie detector trick”, that’s the extent of the idea, got a problem with that? These days, Charlie waves away any queries about it with an “Eh”, a shrug and a cheeky nudge of the baseball cap and aviator shades.After using her talent to work her way through a series of increasingly preposterous case-of-the-week murders last time, then ending up with the mafia putting out a hit on her, Charlie begins the second season (starting 8 May, 9pm, Sky Max) on the lam once more, only now goons with guns keep popping up and shooting at her. For what could have been a high-concept show, Poker Face is surprisingly fuss-free about all of this, and barely lets a violent mob-based subplot get in the way of what Charlie does best. That is, wandering around small-town America, working out who is a killer and how/why they did it, then exposing them for their terrible crimes. She has to dodge bullets on occasion, sure, but she always keeps her eyes on the prize: coughing out the word “bullshit” and cracking the case.Poker Face is created byKnives Outdirector Rian Johnson and, much like that franchise, it has become a place for A-listers to cut loose and be daft. The first episode featuresCynthia Erivo, and to get its money’s worth the show has her playing quintuplets, former child stars contesting the will of their recently deceased evil momager. Later, Katie Holmes pops up as the frustrated wife of a morbid funeral director, played by Breaking Bad’s Giancarlo Esposito, and Kumail Nanjiani goes all-in as an award-winning Florida cop who also happens to be a lot like the Tiger King, Joe Exotic. Best of all, Rhea Perlman returns as mob boss Beatrix Hasp, and she works so well with Lyonne that it’s a shame they couldn’t have done the whole season together.There is a long-standing debate about whether comedy ever gets the praise it deserves. Funny films rarely win Oscars; funny shows regularly get pushed out of best comedy categories by “comedy” series that aren’t actually very funny at all (cough, The Bear). So it is immensely enjoyable to watch something like Poker Face, which is television of serious quality and precision that opts for comedy, wordplay and slapstick over the arid melancholy of serious drama. And while most TV likes to think it’s about the underdog, Poker Face actually walks the walk. Charlie’s life on the run rarely takes her to big cities. She tours towns and rural areas, working her way through the gig economy, getting by as an apple-picker, a car park attendant, even a corpse for hire. The only downside to season two is that it’s gone a bit industry: there are a couple of meta episodes about film sets and TV stars, but even when it goes there, it at least makes the story about the crew and the people doing the gruntwork.Much like the shows it pays tribute to – Columbo and Murder, She Wrote – each episode of Poker Face works as a standalone story, with its own murder to solve, though it does take three episodes to wrap up last season’s cliffhanger and push off in its own direction. When it does, the story gets even sillier. It’s a rare show that makes you scribble down notes such as “meth alligator”, “shrimp-flavoured Vienna sausage” and “explosive vape”. The love of puzzles that fuelled the Knives Out whodunnits appears here, but it inverts the premise. It shows us who did it at the start, so there’s no mystery in that respect. The pleasure is in working backwards, and filling in the Charlie-based gaps, so we can figure out how she figures it out.Lyonne and her swagger make Poker Face cool but, fundamentally, it’s Jonathan Creek with a love of 70s cinema – and I mean that as a compliment. Stylish and nerdy, witty and clever, it is rock-solid, hard-working entertainment.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionThe watcherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Returning to the venue last week for Samuel Beckett’s one-man playKrapp’s Last Tape, the 67-year-old English actor is a world removed from the young upstart onceadvised by Rada to do something elsefor a living.In the intervening four decades Oldman has steadily become one of the greatest actors of his generation, whose versatility and intense performance style have earned him numerous accolades including an Oscar, three Baftas and a Golden Globe.Today, he is one of the highest-grossing actors of all time (more than $11bn worldwide), and beloved by British audiences for his“standout” performanceas Jackson Lamb, the cantankerous manager of a team of defunct spooks in the Apple TV+ spy drama Slow Horses.It’s no surprise that viewers are drawn to Lamb, whose appeal lies in his fallibility: he is rumpled, mildly corrupt and pessimistic, with a propensity to drink and swear. It’s exactly the type of offbeat role Oldman has spent his career perfecting.View image in fullscreen‘An older man in conversation with his younger self’: Oldman in Krapp’s Last Tape.Photograph: Gisele Schmidt“Jackson Lamb’s character arc is all in the backstory. He’s not going to change or develop; we’re looking at a burned-out wreck of a man,” Will Smith, the Emmy-winning creator and showrunner ofSlow Horses, told the Guardian.“Because Gary is such an extraordinary actor, he can convey that vast hinterland with the narrowing of his eyes or a shift in his posture. There’s so much to reveal and explore with Lamb, but Gary is happy to have it simmering in the background and then give us the occasional tantalising glimpse into the darkness of his past. It’s a wonder to behold.”Often hailed as a “working-class hero” in an industry increasingly rife with Etonians and Harrovians, Oldman began his life in New Cross, south-east London, in 1958. His father, Leonard, was a welder and former sailor who left the family home and Gary’s mother, Kathleen, when his son was seven.The teenage Oldman, a diehard Millwall fan, was initially drawn to music but gravitated towards a career in acting after seeing Malcolm McDowell on stage. He began studying with the Young People’s theatre in Greenwich while working odd jobs as a porter and a shoe shop assistant. After failing to get into Rada, Oldman studied acting at the Rose Bruford College in Sidcup, before a run of work with York Theatre Royal, the Royal Court and the Royal Shakespeare Company.On screen, he made his film debut in 1982 in Colin Gregg’s Remembrance, and the following year he landed a starring role as a skinhead in Mike Leigh’s Meantime, before rising to prominence with his portrayal of Sid Vicious in Sid and Nancy (1986).View image in fullscreenGary Oldman alongside Chloe Webb and Kathy Burke in Sid and Nancy.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyPlaying the Sex Pistols’ bassist – a performance described by John Lydon as “bloody good” – showcased Oldman’s devotion to his characters (at one point he was taken to hospital after losing significant weight for the role) and led to other starring turns. He was the playwright Joe Orton in Prick Up Your Ears (1987), a football firm leader in The Firm (1989), and the titular Rosencrantz in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead (1990). He became the unofficial frontman of the “Brit pack”, a fraternity of driven young British performers that included Colin Firth and Daniel Day-Lewis.In 1991 Oldman starred in his first US blockbuster, playing Lee Harvey Oswald in Oliver Stone’s JFK. After that, the actor began to gain a reputation as Hollywood’s “psycho deluxe”: he was the titular Count inFrancis Ford Coppola’s Dracula(1992), the violent pimp Drexl Spivey in the Tony Scott-directed, Quentin Tarantino-written True Romance (1993), a sadistic prison warden in Murder in the First (1995), and a corporate tyrant in The Fifth Element (1997). Perhaps most memorably, he played a corrupt DEA officer in Luc Besson’s Léon: The Professional (1994), widely considered as one of the best villains and most corrupt cops in cinema history.View image in fullscreenOldman as Dracula.Photograph: Columbia/AllstarAfter a fallow period in the early 2000s, Oldman found himself back in the spotlight when he was cast in two major franchises. He was Harry Potter’s godfather, Sirius Black, in the film adaptations of JK Rowling’s books, and the police commissioner Jim Gordon in Christopher Nolan’s Batman trilogy – a performance lauded by critics, who increasingly regarded Oldman as one of the greatest actors never to have been nominated for an Oscar.That Oscar nomination eventually did come, for Oldman’s portrayal of the spy George Smiley in Tomas Alfredson’s 2011 adaptation of John le Carré’s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. But he didn’t win the gong until 2018,for playing Winston Churchillin Joe Wright’s Darkest Hour – a role the actor recently revealed he turned down “half a dozen times” until his wife intervened. “[She] said: ‘Go out there and walk on the wire. It could be great, but even if you fall and it’s no good, you’ve got to stand on the set and say: We shall fight you on the beaches.’ I thought: You’ve got a point there.”Oldman’s transformation into the wartime prime minister required 200 hours in the makeup chair, 14 pounds of silicone rubber, and $20,000 worth of Cuban cigars, which gave him nicotine poisoning. Christopher Eccleston hailed Oldman’s Oscar win as “massive” for people from working-class backgrounds. “Oldman is as fine an actor as Daniel Day-Lewis, but Gary is not double-barrelled,” he said.View image in fullscreenGary Oldman as Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour.Photograph: Jack English/APOldman’s third Oscar nomination was for an eponymous role inMank (2020), David Fincher’s paean to a past era of great American film-making. He has previously expressed how difficult he found it to work without disguise on the film. “I do like to hide, but I’m hiding because it’s all my baggage … so that was my problem,” he said.And there’s been no shortage of personal baggage over the course of the actor’s life. There was his difficult childhood, an experience he mined whenwriting and directing Nil By Mouth (1997), a bristling portrait of an abusive, alcoholic father in south London – which the film critic Nick James described as “the most authentic working-class cockney movie ever”. There was his alcoholism in the 90s, when he was arrested for drunk-driving and checked into rehab (Oldman has been sober for more than 25 years).Then, in 2014, Oldman issued apologies for offending Jewish people after he played down antisemitic slurs by Mel Gibson. He has also had a string of marriages, including to the actors Lesley Manville (the mother of his eldest son Alfie) and Uma Thurman. He has faced down accusations that he was violent to his third wife, Donya Fiorentino (the mother of his younger sons, Gulliver and Charlie), which came out during the promotion of Darkest Hour. He has been married to the writer and art curator Gisele Schmidt since 2017.Slow Horses season four review – Gary Oldman roars like a bear dipped in chip fatRead moreWhile Oldman has been in several recent films, including Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer and Paolo Sorrentino’s Parthenope – released in the UK on Friday – Slow Horses has solidified his status as a national treasure.“Working with Gary was an education and inspiration,” Smith said. “He is a truly transformational actor, a once-in-a-generation talent, an intuitive genius with an incredible work ethic and a disarmingly generous spirit. Every actor that joins the cast is in awe of him, but he makes them feel welcome and puts them at ease.”Much like the character of Krapp, Oldman is reconnecting with his past when he steps on to the stage each night, carrying “the sense of an older man in conversation with his younger self” according tothe Guardian’s review. The actor has spoken of his desire to retire once Slow Horses ends, which would make his return to York all the more serendipitous. Towards the end of the play, Krapp questions whether his “best years are gone”, but it’s clear that Gary Oldman’s star is as bright as it ever was.Explore more on these topicsGary OldmanSlow HorsesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I remember collapsing on to the sofa after work – completely exhausted – and putting it on. My girlfriend was already asleep in the next room. Her drinking had been getting steadily worse that year, but I think we were both in denial about it. Most evenings I’d spend alone, so I’d put a movie on in the background for company.I found it funny at first, watching Bill Murray’s character trapped in a time-loop. But about 20 minutes in, I started feeling this creeping sense of dread. I remember seeing Murray’s white alarm clock going off, waking him up to begin the same day and feeling this horrible spark of recognition. It was like watching my own life play out on the screen in front of me.If anything, Bill Murray’s nightmare onscreen life was better than mine. Murray is a TV presenter, forced to report on the same local festival for ever – whereas I was stuck working four jobs, and could barely afford to pay rent. In the morning I would drive to a factory and put in a six-hour shift, and in the evening I worked as a painter-decorator. I’d teach music on the weekends and play the occasional gig. My girlfriend couldn’t hold down employment, so I was in charge of handling all the bills for both of us, and the responsibility was crushing.I told myself she would stop drinking, and that this was only a phase – but she was getting worse. I had come up with some twisted logic and convinced myself that staying with her was the easy option – whereas in reality, it was so hard. We were constantly arguing.I saw Murray’s alarm clock waking him up to the same day and felt a horrible spark of recognitionA few weeks before I saw Groundhog Day, my girlfriend had made some throwaway comment, saying she could “live in this flat for ever”. I’d had this sinking feeling I couldn’t really put my finger on. I couldn’t imagine anything worse than living in that way with her for ever, but I didn’t have the courage to say that to her – or even really admit it to myself. I’d just pushed the panic aside, gone to sleep and then woken up to begin the vicious cycle again.Within three days of watching Groundhog Day, I’d taken more action than I had in the previous three years. I quit all four of my jobs and broke up with my girlfriend. I used most of my savings to pay back-rent on our flat, then moved into a place on my own.I did almost nothing for about five weeks. I’d spent every day rushing from job to job, attempting to avoid thinking about my life – so I spent a lot of time just staring at the wall, trying to get to grips with what I wanted to do next. At first it was terrifying, just feeling my brain work – and asking myself all the existential questions I’d been repressing. But slowly, I started to feel a tiny bit less afraid. When my money ran out, I took a catering job, but I made an effort to cap my working hours. Cooking is stressful, but it’s also unpredictable, which I like. No day ever pans out in exactly the same way.I’ve never watched Groundhog Day again. I’m in a new relationship and I’m much happier in my work – but sometimes I wonder whether I’m actually avoiding rewatching it because I’m frightened of having a similar realisation about my current life, and I simply don’t have the strength to remake my life all over again, at 48. Maybe seeing Groundhog Day once in a lifetime is enough.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Since being spiked with LSD back in the 1960s, which also influenced his distinct take on left-fieldsoul music, the 82-year-old says he could still feel the impacts of it up until just a few years ago. “I was paranoid of crowds and paranoid of being alone,” he says. “I had high anxiety and could be sitting in a room with you and if I looked at you long enough, you’d start looking like some kind of monster.”For a long period of time it was only through the help and support of his late wife that he was able to hold it together. “I didn’t trust but one person in life, and that was Yvonne,” he says. “I wouldn’t do anything without her. She’s why I’m still alive. Yvonne was my god.” There are similarly touching sentiments expressed about her in the offbeat, funny and strangely poignant newdocumentaryabout the cult artist and his curious world: Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted.‘He lived his whole life in that fire’: the tragic story of ‘lost’ singer Jackson C FrankRead moreSwamp Dogg is a musician like few others. Part golden-voiced crooner, part experimental satirist, part flat-out oddball, he has made music that spans soul, rock, country, disco, R&B and Auto-Tune boogie. Growing up in Virginia, he cut his first record when he was just 12 as Little Jerry Williams. He did A&R and production work for major labels and went on to write songs for Gene Pitney, Doris Duke and Johnny Paycheck. Feeling burned out, unfairly treated and frustrated by the industry, as well as chemically altered from his LSD experiences, he rebranded as Swamp Dogg in 1970. From then on he embarked on a much more singular musical trajectory that fused the madcap peculiarities of Frank Zappa with a deep love of old school soul and country.Since then he has worked withBon Iver, been a manager and mentor to the World Class Wreckin’ Cru, which featured a youngDr Dre, and he’s sold novelty records of dogs singing – well, barking – Beatles songs to pet shops in Spain. His record covers – such as him stuffing himself naked inside a giant hot dog – regularly feature on lists ofworst ever album sleeves. The album cover to 1971’s Rat On!, of him riding a giant white rat, is also painted on the bottom of his swimming pool (hence the name of the film). And there is also a recent cookbook he’s written that he describes as “an idea 50 years in the making”. If You Can Kill It I Can Cook It features soul food recipes such as Baked Beans Bo Diddley.“I guess I do feel like I am eccentric,” he says with a chuckle when asked if he agrees with the description that often follows him around. “Although I pull back on a lot of things that I know are crazier than a motherfucker.”Pulling back is something that doesn’t always come easily to Swamp Dogg. Back in the 1970s he joined Jane Fonda’s anti-VietnamFree the Army tourand he feels it set him back years in the industry. “I’m trying not to be as political,” he says. “I’m still a little political but not as much because it backfired. It got me thrown off of Elektra records and that’s what stopped people from wanting to do live interviews with me on radio and television.” Does he have any regrets about how he approached that? “I would do it the same again but I would do it harder,” he says. “But with more backup this time. Because before it was like I called a meeting and nobody showed up for it.”I’m happy that I’ve stayed true to myself. And I’ve got a lot of faith in what I do and I want to leave a hell of a legacyDespite a turbulent career that, for the most part, has seen him confined to the fringes, he feels like he’s landed in a sweet spot when it comes to carving out a space from autonomy and idiosyncrasy. He remains prolific too, having released three albums in the last five years. “More people seem to know me now than ever before and I still feel like I’m cooking,” he says. “Some concerts I play and I see all these people coming in and [there’s that many] it’s like they must be thinking Snoop Dogg is going to be here. I love the audience so much. I’m so happy to play for them. It makes me want to work like a motherfucker.”So what keeps him so motivated and hard-working at an age when many, after 70 years in the industry, would gladly be thinking about retirement? “Poverty,” he says, bluntly. “I think about poverty and I get dizzy. Laying in bed watching television, and all of a sudden, you realise I ain’t had no money coming in for a couple of months. That drives me. The thought of being poor makes me want to work because being poor will get your ass no matter what age you are. There’s no sympathy for octogenarians.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Photo courtesy of Magnolia PicturesOne of the really moving elements about the documentary is the domestic situation that he has at home. In a neighbourhood in Los Angeles where they joke that all the porn films are shot, he has neighbours such as Johnny Knoxville and Mike Judge who swing by, and he lives with his friends and musical collaborators Guitar Shorty and MoogStar. “Guitar Shorty came here for a couple of months and it turned into 18 years,” he says. Swamp Dogg never charged him a penny in rent. “Because I’ve been there,” he says. “I’ve slept on people’s couches and on their front porch and all that kind of shit. I’ve been all the way down to the bottom. But I would always find a way out because I don’t like not having nice things, even when you can’t afford them.” One such example of this tendency is illustrated in the film when he was at the peak of success and owned nine cars. “I thought the world would become mine,” he reflects of that period.Borrowed Time: Lennon’s Last Decade review – reverential reminiscence takes its timeRead moreYou get a sense that the company and camaraderie of his pals, bandmates and housemates have replaced the deep loss felt over his wife. He concurs with this, before joking: “and they also never looked like monsters to me”. Sadly, Guitar Shorty has since died, along with another friend and collaborator, John Prine, who also appears in the film. “I guess I’m next,” he says. “But I’m trying to walk a straight line and do the things that keep me healthy and my mind, and my whole being, happy. I try to eat right, don’t drink, don’t do drugs …” he stops himself. “Damn, you might say I’m boring as a motherfucker.”In reality, Swamp Dogg is anything but. And you get the sense that he is starting to realise that embracing eccentricity, and making music purely on his own terms, while forging a truly unique career path, has perhaps paid dividends. “I’m happy that I’ve stayed true to myself,” he says. “And I’ve got a lot of faith in what I do and I want to leave a hell of a legacy. That’s why I cut so many albums. I’ll take a shot and hope it works out. It seems to be working.”Swamp Dogg Gets His Pool Painted is out in Los Angeles cinemas on 2 May and in New York City on 9 May with a UK date to be announcedExplore more on these topicsMusicDocumentary filmsSoulMusic documentaryinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In small towns and big cities from Alaska to Florida, red counties and blue (and a handful of European cities), they gathered with homemade signs full of fury and heartbreak and sarcasm. Yet the “Hands Off” protests received minimal media coverage, and the general response was that they didn’t do anything, because they didn’t have immediate and obvious, and most of all quantifiable, consequences. I’ve heard versions of “no one cares”, “no one is doing anything” and “nothing came of it” for all my activist life. These responses are sometimes a sign that the speaker isn’t really looking and sometimes that they don’t recognise impacts that aren’t immediate, direct or obvious. Tracking those indirect and unhurried impacts, trying to offer a more complex map of the world of ideas and politics, has been at the heart of my writing.For more direct impact, at least when it came to the rally I attended in San Francisco, you could have walked six or seven blocks to the Tesla dealership. Weekly protests there since February, like those across the country and beyond, have helped tankthe Tesla brandand Tesla shares. They remind Elon Musk that he’s in retail, where the customer is always right – and right now the customer would like him and his Doge mercenaries to stop dismantling the US government the way a hog dismantles a garden.Tesla aside, activists sometimes really do have tangible results and even immediate ones. The protests around the world and in Seattle, where we blockaded the 1999 World Trade Organization meeting, encouraged the global south nations inside to stand up and refuse a raw deal from the global north and corporations. At that very meeting that very week. It might be the most immediately and obviously effective protest I ever attended, in fortysomething years of attending protests (even if protesting this version of corporate globalisation under the rubric “free trade” is hard to explain during a catastrophic tariff crisis).View image in fullscreenA Donald Trump balloon amid placards at a protest in Los Angeles last month.Photograph: Étienne Laurent/AFP/Getty ImagesBut that was an exception. Mostly protests, campaigns, boycotts and movements do a lot, but do it in less tangible and direct ways than these. They influence public opinion, make exploitation and destruction and their perpetrators more visible, shift what’s considered acceptable and possible, set new norms or delegitimise old ones. Because politics arises from culture, if culture is our values, beliefs, desires, aspirations shaped by stories, images – and yeah, memes – that then turns into politics as choices and actions that shape the world.If you want to measure impact you need more sophisticated tools and longer timeframes than the many versions of “where’s the payoff for this thing we just did”. Take theGreen New Deal, advocated for passionately by the young climate activists in the Sunrise Movement, starting around 2018. The simple story to tell about it is that, as legislation cosponsored by congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and senator Ed Markey, it did not pass. The complex story is that it shifted the frameworks in which we think about climate and economics in consequential ways. In other words, it was very effective, just not directly. It strongly influenced the Biden campaign’s platform in 2020. His administration sought to pass it as Build Back Better and succeeded in doing so with the watered-down but still impactful Inflation Reduction Act, which influenced governments in other countries to amplify their own climate policies. (The Trump administration is dismantling some of it, but some will survive.)Change happens in complex, sometimes unpredictable ways – it often unfolds with slow and indirect consequencesThe Green New Deal as a proposal and campaign moved us beyond the old jobs-versus-the-economy framing that had plagued environmental activists for decades, making it clear that doing what the climate requires is a jobs-creation programme, and you could care about both. I don’t hear the old framework any more, and one of the hardest things to detect in the department of indirect consequences is the thing that doesn’t happen or the frame that no longer circulates. Jobs v environment is one. Another is the many stereotypes-become-slurs that treated female rape survivors as inherently dishonest and unreliable, deployed to protect countless rapists. This blanket discrediting is not part of the culture the way it was before the feminist insurrections that began in 2012-13. Seeing what’s no longer there or what didn’t happen is also an art, whether it’s seeing the persecution that ceased or the forest that wasn’t cut down.One of the aphorisms I have been coming back to for at least half my lifetime is “everything should be as simple as possible, but not simpler”, attributed to Einstein and useful for almost everything. Because we get explanations of how things work – big things such as politics, change, history, human nature – that themselves don’t work when they fail to account for the complexities, ambiguities, uncertainties and indirect and delayed influences and consequences. It’s like hacking off all the limbs of a tree because you’d rather call it a log or because you haven’t quite figured out what leaves and branches do. Or looking at a tree today and saying it isn’t growing, since it hasn’t visibly changed since yesterday. Which, put that way, sounds infinitely ridiculous and yet in speech – which, ideally, reflects thought – people do it all the time.As I write in my forthcoming essay anthology No Straight Road Takes You There:Essaysfor Uneven Terrain, “It’s not that I have anything against the easy, the immediate, the obvious, the straightforward, and the predictable. It’s just that I think much of what we face and endeavour to achieve requires an embrace or at least a recognition of its opposite. So I have chased after the long trajectories of change as both the often forgotten events and ideas leading up to a rupture, a breakthrough, or a revolution, and the often overlooked indirect consequences that come afterward. I’ve celebrated how a movement that may not achieve its official goal may nevertheless generate or inspire those indirect consequences that matter sometimes as much or more than the original goal. I’ve also noticed how often a movement is dismissed as having failed during the slow march to victory, when victory comes. So much activism has, on the sidelines, people telling us we can’t win, who routinely vanish if and when we do.”One of the curiosities of American political life is that Republicans refuse to acknowledge the complexities and interconnections as ideology, but are very good at working with them practically, while the opposite is true of the Democrats. Republicans and the far right famously built power from the ground up, getting their people to run for school board and other low-level positions at the state and local level, working hard on winning state legislatures to passvoter-suppression measuresthat would help Republicans broaden their power even while they narrowed their support. They played the long game, patiently building power, pushing propaganda, recruiting – and of course did so with hugely wealthy foundations and billionaire donors who could afford to underwrite such efforts and provide the stability for such campaigns.View image in fullscreenAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez with climate protesters in 2021.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesIn other respects, Republicans deny that everything or anything is connected to everything else, that actions and policies have consequences, that the shape of a life is not entirely up to that individual but is influenced by economic and social forces, that everything exists in relationship. It’s convenient for rightwing ideology to deny the reality of environmental impacts, be it mining and burning fossil fuel or spreading toxins, because acknowledging the impact of individual and corporate actions would justify the regulations and collective responsibilities that are anathema to their deregulated free-enterprise rugged individual ethos. Likewise, it’s convenient to claim that poverty and inequality are the result of individual failure, that the playing field is level and everyone has equal opportunity, because if you acknowledge that discrimination is real – well, discrimination is itself a system, and they prefer to deny systems exist.Democrats on the other hand have long recognised the existence of systems, including the systems that are the environment and climate, as well as the ugly systems of discrimination that have permeated American life such as racism, misogyny, homophobia and so forth. But they’re remarkably bad at building political frameworks to address this, failing where Republicans succeed when it comes to the long game of building power from the ground up, being on message, having a long-term strategy and sometimes, it seems, any strategy at all.So we live in an environment of conflicting and confusing information, furthered by the way the mainstream media too often see background and context on what just happened as editorialising and bias, so tend to present facts so stripped of context that only those who are good at building context themselves can find meaning in them. Media outlets routinely play down protest and when they cover it often do so dismissively. Media critic and former Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivanwritesof the thin coverage of the Hands Off rallies: “Organizers said that more than 100,000 demonstrators came to the protests in both New York and Washington DC. Crowd estimates are always tricky, but that certainly seems like a big story to me.” She points out that for many months news outlets have commented on how the public resistance to Trump is so much quieter than in 2017. “But when the protests did happen, much of the media reaction was something between a yawn and a shrug. Or, in some outlets, a sneer.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionProtests against Trumpism in 2017, which were probably sneered at and dismissed at the time, are now being used to dismiss 2025 protests. But the most precise calibrators of these protests, Erica Chenoweth and colleagues at the Crowd Counting Consortium,write: “And since Jan. 22, we’ve seen more than twice as many street protests than took place during the same period eight years ago … In February 2025 alone, we have already tallied over 2,085 protests, which included major protests in support of federal workers, LGBTQ rights, immigrant rights, Palestinian self-determination, Ukraine, anddemonstrations against Teslaand Trump’s agenda more generally. This is compared with 937 protests in the United States in February 2017.”The Consortiumcounted686 protests on 21 January, 2017, with total participation above 3 million, making the Women’s March the biggest one-day protest in US history. Meanwhile more than 1,300 US rallies happened on 5 April this year. This is part of why it’s hard to recognise the impact of such events; they’re so often written out of the story of change. Mostly the story of change we get is that great men hand it down to us, and we should admire and be grateful to them and periodically implore them for more crumbs.This is built into how history narrows down the civil rights movement and all the crucial work done by women into a few great men, into how the decades of dedicated work by the abolitionist movement are written out of the version in which Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves out of the blue. It’s built into the superhero movies in which problems are solved by musclebound men deploying violence to definitively defeat evil, when the real superheroes of our time mostly look like scruffy stubborn people who build alliances and networks and movements over years, with an occasional burst of drama in the legislatures, courts and streets (but mostly through stuff that looks like office work, even if it’s administration for liberation). The language of “save the whales/children/country” suggests some kind of finality, and so do the plots of action movies. But evil comes back, so you have to keep defending your reproductive rights, your freedom of speech, your marriage equality, your forests and rivers and climate, even though maintenance is not as exciting as conflict.The phrase “theory of change” has become popular in recent years, as in “what’s your theory of change?” Mine is that categories are leaky and anomalies abound. That change happens in complex, sometimes unpredictable ways, that it often unfolds with slow and indirect consequences, and that what ends up in the centres of power often begins in the margins and shadows. That stories have profound power and changing the story is often the beginning of changing the world.Something the current crisis in the US demonstrates is that power is rarely as simple as it’s supposed to be. We see those who are supposed to be immensely powerful – captains of industry, prestige law firms,Ivy League universities– cringe and cave in fear while ordinary people (including lawyers and professors) stand on principle and judges mete out the law without intimidation. As for the unpredictability, I find hope in the fact that we’re making the future in the present, and while you can’t predict it with the certainty too many self-anointed prophets seem afflicted with, you can learn a lot from the patterns of the past – if you can remember the past and view events on the scale of those patterns that spread across decades and centuries.Places popular with tourists often put out maps that oversimplify the terrain on the assumption that we visitors are too dumb to contend with the real lay of the land, but those maps often mislead, literally, so you wander into a sketchy neighbourhood or a marsh that’s not on the map. What I’ve tried to do as a writer is give people maps adequate to navigate the rocky, uneven territory of our lives and times.No Straight Road Takes You There: Essays for Uneven Terrain by Rebecca Solnit will be published by Granta on 8 May.To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The show, Point Blank, is based on original sketches created by Dylan between 2021 and 2022. They depict people playing instruments, couples, sportspeople – along with rooms and places where Dylan spent time.The drawings were painted over with vivid colours to create “living, breathing entities that have emotional resonance, colours used as weapons and mood setters, a means of storytelling”, Dylan said.“The idea was not only to observe the human condition, but to throw myself into it with great urgency,” he added.The studies include a mirror reflecting a set of lips, a saxophonist and a cowboy with a pistol hanging on his belt in front of a rising sun.Some of the drawings are tangled up as blue, red and neutral monochromatic studies, reminiscent of Pablo Picasso’s early blue period.View image in fullscreenOne of the works from the Point Blank exhibition.Photograph: HalcyonThe Point Blank series began as a book and includes accompanying prose.Kate Brown, the creative director at Halcyon, said: “These works on paper feel like memories, intangible windows into the life and imagination of one of the greatest storytellers who ever lived.“People who attend the exhibition will discover that they provoke stories from our imagination. We consider the circumstances of the protagonists and ponder our movement through the spaces that the artist depicts.”The Halcyon Gallery previously exhibited Dylan’s series Drawn Blank, which featured graphite drawings made when travelling between Europe, Asia and the US from 1989 to 1992 – and later reworked with paint.Dylan describes the process of making his work as a way to “relax and refocus a restless mind” during busy tours.Paul Green, the president and founder of Halcyon, said: “It is nearly 18 years since Halcyon first started working withBob Dylanand it has been an extraordinary experience to watch this cultural icon develop into such a critically revered and important visual artist so closely.“This latest body of paintings feels like a more intimate connection to the artist than in any of his previous work and it is a great privilege to share them with the public for the first time.”The exhibition is free of charge and will open on 9 May.Explore more on these topicsBob DylanArtPaintingnewsShareReuse this content"

But not even Oscar-winning director Thomas Vinterberg can make this climate crisis dystopia the epic it promised to beLucy ManganSat 3 May 2025 16.50 EDTLast modified on Sat 3 May 2025 17.29 EDTShareFamilies Like Ours is a drama – directed and co-written by the Oscar-winning Danish directorThomas Vinterberg– that asks the question: what would you do if your luck ran out? The kind that maybe saw you born with a healthy body, or into a privileged, developed country, or with a skin colour that didn’t invite discrimination among others. Maybe even all of the above. What if life as you knew it – stable, easy, dependable, cushioned – was turned upside down? What then?The seven-part series is set inDenmarkin a near future in which the Dutch economy has recently crashed, flooding the Netherlands’ nearby countries with job-seeking immigrants, eating up capacity and goodwill. Thus there is little of either available when the government announces that the threat posed to low-lying Denmark by global heating and rising sea levels means it must now be evacuated of its six million inhabitants entirely. The country is, in effect, being shut down.So Vinterberg takes what most of us treat as an existential threat, a problem too huge and frightening to think about, and puts it into a more manageable frame. Rendering it smaller and more potent still, we follow a handful of characters through the decisions they are forced to make as the massive displacement begins.Some have advance notice of the government’s announcement and use it – illegally, but who wouldn’t, is the first question we are made to ask ourselves – to liquidise assets before the market crashes and withdraw savings in cash before restrictions are brought in. Among them is Nikolaj (Esben Smed), a government employee, who tells his husband, Henrik, (Magnus Millang), and his sister Amalie (Helene Reingaard Neumann). Henrik’s volatile, homophobic brother Peter (David Dencik) is tipped off too and it is from him that come most of the violent incidents that Vinterberg’s naturalistic approach otherwise eschews. Sometimes, you wonder if it eschews them too much. There are reports of social unrest but there is so little on screen that you do wonder if the drama could not afford to ratchet up the tension a bit more. There is so much talk about the necessary documents to be found, visas to be applied for, permits to be amassed and so many scenes set across desks from cold-hearted bureaucrats that you could get to the end of the first few episodes feeling that you have a better idea of how to organise a nationwide exodus than of how it would really feel to be caught up in one.The other characters we follow include Amalie’s husband, Jacob (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), an architect who manages to use his connections to get his family a coveted pathway to France. But his daughter Laura (Amaryllis August), from his first marriage, is torn between going with him (to take up her place at the Sorbonne or going with her less wealthy and connected mother, Fanny (Paprika Steen), to her state-organised placement in Romania (it is possible Vinterberg has chosen to make some of his soon-to-be-refugees a little too privileged). There is also new boyfriend, Elias (Albert Rudbeck Lindhardt), to throw into the mix and provide a “will first love be torn asunder” subplot that is given too much time for what it adds to the show. More affecting is the decision made by Christel (Asta Kamma August), mother of nine-year-old footballing talent Lucas who has been offered a place by football scouts in England but would have to go without her. As borders close and travel by resettled Danes will become impossible, she would essentially be saying goodbye to him for ever.Families Like Ours has been a hit with viewers and critics since its inaugural showing at the Venice film festival last year. And there is much to admire. It doesn’t preach, it does have the themes work through the characters instead of the other way round (and has a cast stuffed with Danish heavyweights to help it). But it all feels a bit thin, a bit bloodless – like a thought experiment made flesh rather than a compelling, provocative drama. The script is uninspiring and the relentlessness of the bad decisions made by characters, as if to be privileged is not just to be unreflective but actively stupid, too, lends a slight air of flagellation to proceedings. One to admire, perhaps, but not to love – and therefore one whose message can, if you try, be resisted.Families Like Ours aired on BBC Four and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewThomas VinterbergDenmarkreviewsShareReuse this content"

As you delve into the layers of almond sponge, ganache and buttercream that form the opera cake, you may see how it was inspired by the ornate balconies of thePalais Garnieropera house; while the Paris-Brest, a wheel-shaped choux, was first made in 1910 to commemorate the famously brutal cycle race. Seek out a rum baba – a brioche-like treat soaked in rum‑infused syrup – and you might be told the story of how it was created by Nicolas Stohrer, the chef of the exiled Polish king Stanislas. The patisserie that bears his name has been at51 rue Montorgueilsince 1730 and is officially classed as a historic monument.Among the 21st-century stars of the Parisian pastry scene areCyril Lignac, who makes a sublime caramel eclair;Yann Couvreur, who takes thechouquette(similar to a profiterole) to the next level by filling it with vanilla cream; andCedric Grolet, whosetrompe l’oeilpatisseries are as astonishing to the eye as the taste buds – they look just like the fruits and nuts of their flavours.

There is much debate about what it should contain, however; some Niçois will only use tunaoranchovies, not both, and only canned, not fresh; others insist it should contain a certain kind of olive.While the locals battle it out in their kitchens, you can enjoy the welcoming atmosphere in the family-run restaurants of Vieux Nice, where your only dilemma is what to order. Look out for theCuisine Nissardesign (it shows a woman in a straw hat with a basket of vegetables), which denotes that dishes have been made traditionally with good-quality ingredients. AtRestaurant Acchiardo(mains from €17), the family are proud to tell the story of their Italian great-grandmother Madalin, who walked across the Alps in the early 20th century for a job with an aristocratic English family, and later set up the restaurant. Their salade niçoise includes rocket, basil, tomatoes, artichoke, egg, anchovies and tuna, and makes a great starter before their mains, such as beef fillet “Madalin style”, with anchovies, garlic and parsley. Another must-try dish in Nice is the chickpea-flour pancake socca, which you can buy by the slice atChez Theresa(€3) in the Cours Saleya market, or atChez Pipo(€3.80), and nibble it as you wander around the old town and the port.Where to stayHotel Windsorhasdoubles from€90room-only,hotelwindsornice.comOystersin Bassin d’ArcachonView image in fullscreenChez Boulan, a typical cabane à huître on the Bassin d’Arcachon.Photograph: A GariteaiTrue fans of gourmet bivalves will know that their flavour changes depending on where they grow, which means you can have fun visiting different areas of France to savour them, whether that be Cancale in Brittany or the Étang de Thau near Montpellier.

See if you can shimmy through the narrow gap between the building and the column on the corner of rue Mercière at the start of your trip, because there’s no way you’ll fit through it by the end, especially if you indulge in the city’s signature dish,choucroute garnie. This plate of fermented cabbage topped by different cuts of pork and sausage is a staple on the menus of the city’s traditional wine taverns, orwinstubs, with their gingham tablecloths, carved wooden furniture and excellent wine lists, where you can spend a good part of a day enjoying the cosy atmosphere.Among the best isChez Yvonne(mains from €18.50), which dates from 1873 and later became a favourite of former French president Jacques Chirac, who once invited Boris Yeltsin to dine with him there. For his choucroute, chef Serge Cutillo has carefully chosen each cut of meat from top local butchers. If you want to try a non-pork version, book a table at the ancient restaurantMaison Kammerzell(mains from €20.50), which celebrates its 600th anniversary in 2027 and looks like it comes straight out of a Grimm fairytale. Its speciality is a decadent buttery fish choucroute with halibut, salmon and smoked haddock, which makes a pleasant change from the meat feasts elsewhere, though they serve other versions with meats including confit duck leg (see the Dordogne, below).Where to stayOkko Hotelhasdoubles from€76room-only,okkohotels.comConfit decanardin the DordogneView image in fullscreenConfit de canard in the Dordogne.Photograph: Pauline Cutler/AlamyDishes using ducks and geese have been a staple in the south-west of France since the middle ages and it became particularly easy to rear the birds after maize was brought to France from the Americas and grew easily in the warm climate ofthe Dordogne. The best-loved dish isconfit de canard, in which the legs of a duck (or goose,oiein French) are salted and then cooked and preserved in their own fat. Once reheated, the tender meat just falls off the bone. It features on menus in bistros and restaurants in the region’s villages and towns of honey-coloured stone, such as La Roque-Gageac and Tremolat, where you can find a great version atLe Bistrot de la Place(€28 as part of a three-course meal). The best thing about the dish, though, is that it is easy to take home in tins and jars ready to reheat. Look out for it in the excellent markets at Sarlat-la-Canèda (Wednesday and Saturday) and Issigeac (Sunday). You can also visit producers on their farms; atLa Garrigue Hautethey serve dishes featuring their carefully reared ducks and geese from early June to late September (three-course menus from €28).Where to stayHotel EdwardPremierin the charmingvillageofMonpazierhasdoubles from€97room-only,hoteledward1er.comGâteaunantaisin NantesView image in fullscreenGateau nantais is flavoured with sugar, vanilla and rum.Photograph: Hemis/AlamyThe city of Nantes has mastered reinvention, with incredible street art installations andLes Machines de L’Île, a cultural project that includes a 12m-high mechanical elephant and ocean-inspired steampunk carousel.

There is also a moving exhibition at theChâteau des ducs de Bretagne, which shows the brutal conditions on the ships. As the name of the chateau suggests, the city also has a historically Breton identity, so it’s a good place to tuck into buckwheat galettes and crêpes – there are good ones at both outposts ofLe Loup, le Renard et la Galette(mains from €13).

In Castelnaudary, people proudly tell a charming tale about its invention during a siege in the course of the hundred years war, during which all available ingredients were piled into a pot for a sustaining meal and the enemy was held at bay. They celebrate it with gusto at theFête du Cassoulet, five days of concerts, parades and eating as much of the stew as you can in the town’s squares and market halls during August. The tourist office also has information about theRoute du Cassoulet, a 170km loop that allows you to find local restaurants and meet duck producers and the craftspeople who make the essentialcassolepot, from which the stew takes its name. It also includes a stop at fellow cassoulet town Carcassonne.At theToulouse à Tablefestival (May-November), meanwhile, you can join in with an attempt to set a world record of serving 3,031 individual pots of cassoulet to enthusiastic diners atLe Grand Banquetin the Jardin du Grand Rond park on 17 May.

Much loved for its gentle heat, it is dried and ground to flavour dishes and products from charcuterie to chocolate, and is used liberally in a local dish calledaxoa(pronounced ah-cho-ah), a stew of chopped veal, onion and peppers, with a warming smoky-sweet flavour. Try it in the village of Espelette itself, at restaurants likeAintzina, which means “long ago” in Basque, where it’s served with crispy garlic potatoes for extra piquancy (mains from €20).Chefs across France love to sprinklepimentin their dishes, and it’s worth taking a jar home to pep up something as simple as scrambled eggs or guacamole. Shops in the village all sell it in powdered form, as well as in jellies, ketchups and sauces, and it’s worth visiting theAtelier du Pimenton the outskirts to find out more about how it’s grown and dried. If you visit in autumn, you’ll see flame-red peppers growing on the neat rows of vines and drying on racks before they’re ground into powder.Where to stayThe welcomingHotel Arrayain thevillageofSarehasdoubles from£110room-only,en.arraya.comTartiflettein the AlpsView image in fullscreenTartiflette is an alpine classic.Photograph: Margouillatphotos/Getty ImagesWhen you’ve been skiing or hiking in the mountains, there’s no better way to refuel than with a serving oftartiflette. This creamy, oven-baked dish, layered with potato, onion, cheese and bacon, is food for the soul and originates in the Aravis mountains, where it was rather unromantically invented in its modern form in the 1980s to promote its key ingredient, Reblochon cheese (though it is based on an 18th-century dish,péla).The story behind the raw cow’s milk cheese, with its soft texture and nutty flavour, is more intriguing. It was first made in the 13th century because, legend has it, mountain-dwelling farmers had to hand over milk to their landlords, and so would not fully milk their cows. They would then do a duplicitous second milking for themselves, with which they’d make the cheese – in old Frenchreblochermeans to squeeze an udder again. The resort ofLe Grand Bornandis in the heart of the Aravis mountains, and so an ideal place to try it.La Ferme du Pépé(mains from €21.50) is set in a cosy farmhouse that dates from 1800 and is proud of itstartifletteand other Savoyard specialities, including fondue and raclette.Where to stayThe cosyHotel Le Deltahasdoubles from€110room-only,hotel-delta74.comPoulet Gaston GérardinDijonView image in fullscreenPoulet Gaston Gerard is the happy result of a culinary accident.Photograph: Image Professionals GmbH/AlamyBurgundy is where you’ll find deeply comforting dishes such as beef bourguignon andoeufsenmeurettes.There are also recipes made with its superior breed of chicken, thepoulet de Bresse, such as coq au vin. Another chicken dish to try in theregional capital of Dijoncombines it with another local speciality – mustard – and bears the name of a former mayor, Gaston Gérard. In 1930, Gérard invited Curnonsky, the leading food critic of the time, to dinner, only for his wife to knock a pot of mustard into the pan. In a swift move of culinary ingenuity, she rescued the dish with the help of some cream, white wine and Comté cheese. Curnonsky then named it after her husband. Thankfully, some restaurants in Dijon return the honour to her on their menus. As you would expect from such rich ingredients, it’s quite a wintery dish. Try it atL’Epicerie & Ciein Dijon’s lively Place Emile Zola, which serves excellent versions of the Burgundy classic dishes (mains from €15).

Food styling assistant: Laura Lawrence.Meera Sodha recipesSpring food and drinkMeera Sodha’s recipe for asparagus lasagne with pecorinoIn the unlikely event you have some asparagus left over, blitz it into a lovely rubble and layer into this outstanding springtime lasagneMeera SodhaSat 3 May 2025 01.00 EDTShareAsYotam Ottolenghi once said herebefore, a lasagne doesn’t have to contain ragu and bechamel. In the broadest sense, lasagne is just a layered pasta dish using various fillings and sauces and, as such, the world is your lasagne. This particular one came about because I was so extremely excited about British asparagus arriving early this year that I bought far too much of it, so had to come up with a starring role for it at the dinner table. I hithered and thithered about baking the asparagus, in case it lost its freshness, but I needn’t have: it’s still fresh-tasting and, like any good lasagne, comforting to boot.Asparagus lasagne with vegetarian pecorinoYou’ll need a food processor for the asparagus and a roughly 20cm x 30cm baking dish or oven tray. This is best served fresh and warm, but if you don’t get through it all in one go, it’s delicious if reheated in a hot, dry frying pan the next day.Prep20 minCook1 hrServes680g unsalted butter4 tbsp plain flour(40g)1 litre whole milk160g pecorino(make sure it’s a vegetarian one), finely grated2 big pinches coarsely ground black pepperFine sea salt2 bunches asparagus(about 900g), woody ends snapped or cut off and discarded, the rest rinsed5 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced paper-thin2 leeks(350g), greens and whites finely sliced, rinsed and drainedFinely grated zest of 1 lemon25g fresh mint, leaves picked and chopped500g packet dried lasagne sheets(you won’t need them all)First make the pecorino bechamel. Melt half the butter in a saucepan on a medium heat, then add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for one to two minutes, to make a thick paste, or roux. Gradually whisk in the milk, beating regularly to prevent lumps, then, after about eight minutes, when the mixture thickens to a consistency of thick double cream, add half the grated pecorino, a couple of big pinches of black pepper and a half-teaspoon of salt. Mix well and take off the heat.Roughly pulse the asparagus in a food processor until the spears have broken down into coarse, ½cm pieces with a rubble texture. In a wide frying or saute pan on a medium heat, melt the remaining 40g butter, then add the garlic and cook, stirring, for a minute or two, until softened. Stir in the sliced leeks, cook for four minutes, until wilted, then add the asparagus rubble and stir-fry for five to six minutes, until the asparagus has softened but still has some bite. Stir in the lemon zest, mint and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt.Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Sprinkle half the asparagus mix in the base of a 20cm x 30cm oven tray or baking dish. Layer enough lasagne sheets side by side on top to cover, then ladle in half the pecorino bechamel and spread it out evenly. Repeat the layers one more time, then top the final layer of bechamel with the remaining 80ggrated pecorino. Bake for 30 minutes, until golden and bubbling, remove and leave to rest and settle for 15 minutes, then serve.Explore more on these topicsSpring food and drinkMeera Sodha recipesVegetarian food and drinkVegetablesFoodCheesePastaMain courserecipesShareReuse this content"

This Korean staple is traditionally made by salting cabbage to preserve it and add crunch, then fermenting it in a pungent paste often made from glutinous rice porridge,gochugaru(Korean chilli flakes), onion and enough garlic to keep a vampire at bay. Fish sauce is another common addition, as is, sometimes, even raw seafood such as crab or squid, but most kimchi sold in the UK is plant-based, and so appeals to a much wider audience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The magic behind kimchi lies in the lactic acid bacteria naturally present on vegetables. These beneficial microbes are encouraged to thrive during fermentation, creating the complex, tangy flavours and deep umami that make kimchi so distinctive. All kimchi brings bold flavour, but only raw, unpasteurised ones deliver the probiotic benefits that come from live fermentation, so look for the words “raw” and “unpasteurised” on the label. Gochugaru, meanwhile, is what gives kimchi its signature vermilion hue. The brightness of its red-orange colour is a good visual cue as to how much chilli has been used and, as a result, how spicy the kimchi is.The UK has welcomed kimchi with open arms, and its popularity has soared, with many local home-based producers now crafting freshly fermented, small-batch kimchi alongside those from the classic Korean brands. According to the statistics portal Statista, the value of South Korea’s kimchi exports has more than doubled in the past decade, a sure sign of its growing global appeal. For this review, I tasted a mixture of renowned Korean brands and small, UK-based fermenters, rating them primarily on flavour. A great kimchi should be boldly tangy from the lactic acid fermentation, balanced by a subtle natural sweetness from ingredients such as carrot and rice flour. Texture matters, too – I look for a satisfying crunch throughout – as, of course, does funk: kimchi should have a sweet-sour aroma with depth and character, without veering into raw brassica territory.The best kimchiBest all-rounder:Ollie’s kimchiView image in fullscreen£6.50 for 350g at Ollie’s Kimchi£6.50 for 350g at That Fat Cow★★★★★Bold and punchy, with a bright red colour and chunky cut, this is slow-fermented for extra depth and complexity. It’s vegan and boosted with umami from soy sauce and miso, which add balanced sweetness alongside the carrots. Full and well-rounded: tangy, savoury and umami-rich, with a satisfying, medium-hot heat. Even with the longer fermentation, the texture holds up well, offering a decent bite. This is well seasoned, has big flavour and hits that sweet spot between funk and freshness. A big, full-flavoured jar that delivers. I’ve named it the best all-rounder because it’s the cheapest of the well-fermented local varieties.Best splurge:The Cultured Collective classic kimchiView image in fullscreen£5 for 250g at Ocado★★★★★A vivid, glossy kimchi with serious crunch and a bright lactic fizz that makes it one of the most satisfying and flavourful out there. This UK-made non-vegan one includes fish sauce and rice flour, lending it a deeper umami complexity and a gentle sweetness that sets it apart. Well-structured and vibrant, with a satisfying bite throughout, especially in the crunchy cabbage stalks. Delivers on flavour, too: medium-to-hot spice, a bold fermented aroma, punchy garlic notes and a well-seasoned balance of salt and tang. A standout jar that’s alive, expressive and deeply moreish.Best bargain:Jongga Mat kimchiView image in fullscreen£1.09 for 80g at Hmart★★★★☆This classic Korean kimchi brand, founded in 1987, offers a mellow, approachable, gentle heat, soft bite and well-balanced flavour. Brilliant red-orange and glossy, it’s coated in a thick sauce (thanks to thickener E415), with no MSG, high-fructose corn syrup or preservatives (unlike some larger commercial brands). It contains added lactic acid bacteria to support fermentation, and while it’s not the liveliest, it still delivers a pleasant tang, with a clean and savoury flavour, a subtle sweetness and just enough heat to keep things interesting.And the rest …Mr Kimchi traditional kimchiView image in fullscreen£12.90 for 2 x 330g jars at Mr Kimchi£23.80 for 3 x 330g jars at Amazon★★★★★This is delivered fresh, allowing you to ferment it in your own kitchen – a brilliant way to explore the simplicity and rewards of fermentation. I tried the traditional Korean recipe made with fish sauce and glutinous rice flour, though Mr Kimchi also hasa vegan version. It delivers an authentic Korean experience, freshly made in the UK, allowing for a proper ferment that deepens flavour. Satisfyingly crunchy, with a vivid, red colour, and the generous amount of gochugaru brings a lively medium heat. Vibrant, garlicky and with a well-balanced, tangy acidity. Rice flour adds a mild natural sweetness that rounds things off beautifully.Jamie Ferments kimchiView image in fullscreen£8.50 for 450g at Jamie Ferments★★★★★Bursting with life, quite literally. When I opened the jar, it fizzed and popped with activity, a sign of a raw, unpasteurised ferment at its peak. I tasted the vegan and traditional versions and found them equally delicious. The vegan version swaps fish sauce for a mix of soy sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds, which brings a lovely, nutty depth. It has a vivid red hue, is glossy, crunchy and well-structured, with a bright, expressive flavour: clean lactic acidity, mellow umami, a medium heat and a gentle natural sweetness from the rice flour. A joyful, fizzy ferment with loads of character – one of the best on the shelf.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

While flavour comes first, minimal processing is important, too, because it helps to preserve the beneficial bacteria cultivated through fermentation. Raw and alive, it delivers a gentle fizz, mellow aftertaste and gentle heat. The orange liquor is light, but has good coverage. This kimchi is well-structured, chunky and has a satisfying crunch. It has a mild to medium spice level, soft tang and a hint of natural sweetness from the fermenting veg. Fresh, young – perhaps the result of a short ferment – and a little shy of funk for lovers of bold kimchi, but a great place to start for the uninitiated.Bibigo sliced kimchiView image in fullscreen£1.75 for 150g at Sainsbury’s£2 for 150g at Ocado★★★☆☆Bold, glossy and with great flavour and a satisfying crunch that holds up despite its long shelf life. Made by South Korean brand Bibigo, it’s less lively than some, but still has a slight fizz of fermentation. The thick, orange paste coats the well-structured slices evenly, giving them a polished appearance. The flavour is balanced and punchy – medium-spiced, with a noticeable tang, mellow umami, and just the right level of saltiness to enhance rather than overwhelm. Its more complex ingredients list includes calcium lactate and xanthan gum, which may rule it out for wholefood lovers, but it delivers on taste and texture.Biona organic kimchiView image in fullscreen£5.20 for 350g at Ocado£5.20 for 350g at Tesco★★★☆☆A solid, minimally processed, long-life vegan kimchi made using organic ingredients and without preservatives. Mild yet satisfying, with a yellow-orange hue, medium to mild spice and a very subtle lactic fizz (though I assume it’s pasteurised). For a long-life product, it retains some crunch and a pleasant texture. The mild, tangy sourness and balanced acidity add depth, while the less traditional addition of tomato brings umami and a slight Campbell’s soup aroma.Vadasz raw kimchiView image in fullscreen£3.50 for 400g at Ocado£4.50 for 400g at Tesco★★★☆☆A bright orange-red, raw vegan kimchi with a fine cut and glossy coating that makes it ideal as a topping – think burger, sandwich or toastie. Has a rounded, mellow umami, a gentle fizz and balanced tang. Mild to medium spice levels and, while it’s on the saltier side, the seasoning enhances rather than overwhelms. It has a medium bite that’s not super-crunchy but is still satisfying, with a subtle sweetness and tomato-like aroma that give it a softer, more accessible character. A solid fridge staple with versatility.Yutaka Korean kimchiView image in fullscreen£2.45 for 200g at Morrisons£3.50 for 200g at Sainsbury’s★★☆☆☆A minimally processed, long-life product that’s perfect for adding a gentle kick to midweek meals. This vegan kimchi has just a whisper of fermentation fizz and a fleeting tang. The flavour is mellow – mildly sour and sweet, low in umami, with understated heat and salt. Its soft orange hue and thin sauce reflect a light touch on the chilli, while its small to medium chopped pieces hold a satisfying bite, though they fall short of a full crunch. Subtle in aroma and softly spoken in character, this is a calm condiment rather than a fiery ferment.Explore more on these topicsKorean food and drinkThe food filterFoodPickling, fermenting and preservingVegetablesfeaturesShareReuse this content"
