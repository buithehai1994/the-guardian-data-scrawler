However,Tony Harrison’s collected plays run to six volumes, comprising 19 full-length dramas. Many of them are translations from Greek (The Oresteia, from 1981, is the most actable version of the trilogy by Aeschylus) or French (he did an astonishing rhyming version of Molière’s The Misanthrope in 1973). But, as Harrison’s theatre career developed, he also wrote original plays, of which The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus (1990) and Square Rounds (1992) stand as the best new verse dramas written in English since Eliot’sMurder in the Cathedralin 1935.The English versions of foreign dramas were a dividend from the extraordinary education in classics and languages available to a working-class child atLeedsGrammar School in the 1950s, before he extended his knowledge of Latin and Greek at Leeds University.View image in fullscreenTony Harrison in Canada for a production of his version of The Misanthrope in 1973.Photograph: Bob Olsen/Toronto Star/Getty ImagesThe poet-critic Sean O’Brien has observed that Harrison’s printed verse “insists that it is speech rather than page-bound silence”, and this vivid verbal quality led logically to writing words for performance by others.It was while teaching at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria from 1962-66 that Harrison wrote his first play, collaborating with a colleague on Akin Mata (1964), a vernacular version of Lysistrata, Aristophanes’ comedy about a pacifist sex-ban by Greek women. Harrison suppressed this text, although some have argued that the strongly visual and ritualistic nature of African theatre influenced his later stage work.Back in England in the early 70s, Harrison was picked by the director John Dexter to solve the problem of why French classic dramas rarely succeeded in English. The technical difficulty was the favoured Parisian style of alexandrine rhyming couplets, which frequently rely on soft and half-rhymes that are more elusive in English, encouraging translators towards blank verse or prose. Dexter set Harrison to translate Molière’s Le Misanthrope and Racine’s Phèdre while fully respecting their rhymes and 12-syllable rhythm.After much experimentation, delivering his drafts aloud while walking northern moors, Harrison perfected a compression technique, through lines such as “The loved one’s figure’s like Venus De Milo’s”, which had a speedy, speakable beat. By relocating the Racine to the period of English rule in India, Harrison also ingeniously widened the rhyme store: “Raj”/“sabotage”, “degrees”/“rupees”. Both starring Diana Rigg, Harrison’s The Misanthrope and Phaedra Britannica, staged by theNational Theatreat the Old Vic in London from 1973-75, were hits that still make pleasurable reading.View image in fullscreenFruitful experimentation ... Diana Rigg and Gillian Barge in Tony Harrison’s version of The Misanthrope at the Old Vic, London in 1973.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyOne of Harrison’s signature stories about the English class system was of going to the gents on one of his first nights and returning to find his father beside the auditorium door, looking in bewilderment at his hand, filled like a tout’s outside a sports stadium. “People keep giving me their tickets,” said his dad, whose Sunday best had convinced the smart-casual middle classes he must be an usher.When the National moved to the South Bank in the mid 70s, artistic director Peter Hall set Harrison another frequently-failed theatrical test – rendering Greek drama into lines suited to be said rather than read. His solution in The Oresteia involved, as with the French texts, compacted content, this time through frequent hyphenated neologisms such as “grudge-dogs” and “blood-ooze.” Insistent on the actors keeping the exact syllabic beat, Harrison described his role in the rehearsal room, with characteristic wit, as “the man who came to read the metre”.Ever since being ticked off at school for his translations being too “demotic” (as described in his poemClassics Society), Harrison hankered after a literary rhetoric reflecting Yorkshire speech. He achieved this brilliantly in The Mysteries, first performed at the National Theatre in 1977. Harrison reshaped themedieval religious playsperformed by workers’ guilds in Wakefield, York and elsewhere into three plays – The Nativity, The Passion and Doomsday – that take a whole day to perform in full. Apart from Yorkshire vocabulary and vowels, the linguistic signature in The Mysteries was aggressive alliteration. Creating the world, God fills the sea with “fish to flit with fin / Some with scale and some with shell”.View image in fullscreenLost Sophoclean satyrs ... Harrison’s first original drama The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus revived at the Finborough theatre, London, in 2017.One reason that Harrison gravitated towards writing plays from scratch was frustration that even the most acclaimed translations are rarely revived, theatres tending to commission new versions. The dramatic move had also been influenced by immersion in television. In 1984, he had writtenThe Big Hfor BBC Two with composer Dominic Muldowney, a music-drama for children based on the Herod story. He also worked with BBC producer Peter Symes on a series of film-poems with verse commentaries, including The Blasphemer’s Banquet (1989), aboutthe death threatimposed on the writer Salman Rushdie.Harrison’s first theatre original,The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, ingeniously entwined expanded fragments of a lost satyr play by Sophocles with the story of the archaeologists who found them. Its successor,Square Rounds, examined the morality of scientists through the stories of the inventors of the machine gun and chemical weapons. The inventive staging incorporated live magic tricks, but audiences stayed away, and the then NT artistic director, Richard Eyre, recorded it in his published diaries as “a kind of noble disaster” that he should have done more to improve.The Guardian view on Tony Harrison: a people’s poet | EditorialRead moreEyre himself staged The Prince’s Play (1996), a version of Victor Hugo’s Le Roi S’Amuse, which channelled the anti-monarchist views that would lead Harrison to exclude himself, in the poemLaureate’s Block, from consideration for the role of poet laureate.Fram(2008), about Arctic exploration, felt unready for the stage, and was his last collaboration with the National, although The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus and Square Rounds both looked impressive on revival at London’s Finborough theatre in 2017-18.Despite lacking a thirst to sip the Queen’s sherry as national bard,Tony Harrisonbecame, across four decades, the National Theatre poet.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTony HarrisonPoetryNational TheatreYorkshireLeedsClassicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Some conservatives are questioning his razor sharp U-turnEd PilkingtonSat 27 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 07.08 EDTShareIt has taken barely two weeks forDonald Trumpto turn the horrific killing of Charlie Kirk to his political advantage, unleashing an unprecedented peacetime assault on free speech and a free press on the back of the assassination.Since Kirk’s death, the president and his top team have:forceda private media company to suspend late-night TV star Jimmy Kimmel for inaccurate comments he made about Kirk’s suspected shooter;threatenedother TV networks with losing their licences should they say things Trump doesn’t like;vowedto prosecute “hate speech” that is fully protected under the first amendment;declaredantifa a terrorist organisation in an indiscriminate attack on political ideology;and toldjournalists covering the Pentagon that they will have their access revoked unless they agree to restrictions on their reporting.That’s a far cry from the promise Trump made on the first day of his new presidency.On 20 January, hours after he had been sworn in as 47th president, Trump sat at his desk in the Oval Office and applied his distinctive signature to executive order 14149 – Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship.Theorderpronounced that government censorship of speech was “intolerable in a free society”. It promised that under Trump’s watch, no federal official would engage in any conduct that would “unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen”.View image in fullscreenCharlie Kirk at a ceremony where Donald Trump signed an executive order aiming to ‘protect free speech’ on college campuses in the East Room of the White House on 21 March 2019.Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty ImagesIt was a bold pledge to return America to the values of free speech and expression enshrined in the first amendment of the US constitution. But for some observers following events that day, the executive order was to be taken with a large pinch of salt.“I knew at the moment that the ink was not even dry, that executive order 14149 was a load of BS,” said Matt Welch, editor-at-large of the libertarian magazine Reason. “I knew it would not last.”Despite the administration’s rush to censorship as a result of Kirk’s killing, Trump has so far enjoyed almost complete support from the Republican party and his wider “Make America great again” (Maga) movement. Relatively few voices from the right of American politics have cried foul.But those voices are pointed, and in the longer term potentially critically important. Many of them subscribe to libertarianism, with its emphasis on individual rights, civil liberties and limited government. Or asReasonputs it, devotion to “free minds and free markets”.Other free speech critics have raised their voices from the wider conservative movement, while a few brave souls have even spoken out against Trump from within the Republican party. Collectively, they articulate a conservative and libertarian critique of Trump’s second presidency that, given that it comes nominally from his own side, may carry some weight with the president as he proceeds to pulverise constitutional norms.Their presence – lonely though at times it may seem – underlines that Trump and his Maga army have not yet secured an absolute monopoly of thought on the right. As guardians of free speech trying to hold back an increasingly authoritarian tide, they can also offer tentative clues as to how American conservatism might one day claw its way back from Maga’s iron grip.But for now they remain engaged in a long, uphill battle. “We are locked in a type of memetic combat,” Welch said. “We’re standing on the sidelines trying to get their attention, telling them that each new development is making it worse, and they are not listening at all.”Rightwing thinktanks have been central to Trump’s second presidency. TheHeritage Foundationpresented him with the blueprint for his incendiary return to office: the 920-page Project 2025.America First Legal, founded by the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, has providedlegal ballastfor many of Trump’s key ambitions. They include tearing down diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and initiating mass deportations.But as Trump has begun aggrandising his own power and wielding it against his opponents, a separate heavyweight thinktank, the libertarian Cato Institute, has emerged as a thorn in the president’s side.When government officials use the power of the state to suppress speech ... it places a core restriction on individual libertyThomas BerryInitially, Cato’s belief in small government and deregulation led it to show enthusiastic support for the Maga agenda.Within 48 hours of Trump’s second inauguration,the thinktankhad flagged up 22 of his predecessor Joe Biden’s executive orders including several countering the climate crisis and enhancing healthcare, all of which Trump dutifully revoked. It also offered itsown blueprint, in this case a manual for Elon Musk and his demolition crew, the “department of government efficiency”, that was so well received thatRolling Stonedubbed Cato “Doge’s unofficial think tank”.More recently, however, Trump’s egregiously unconstitutional assault on the first amendment has goaded Cato into speaking out as a rare but influential adversary on the right. Thomas Berry, Cato’s director of constitutional studies, told the Guardian that several of Trump’s recent actions had offended one of the institute’s most fundamental values.“When government officials use the power of the state either to suppress speech or tilt the free marketplace of ideas, that’s incredibly dangerous in the long term. It places a core restriction on individual liberty – the right to say what you want and say what you believe,” he said.Cato began objecting to Trump’s authoritarian tendencies well before Kirk’s death. In June the thinktank joined a coalition of groups in filing anamicus briefsupporting Harvard in its lawsuit against the Trump administration after billions of federal dollars were withheld from the university ostensibly as punishment for its failure to combat antisemitism.Cato also expressed concern aboutMahmoud Khaliland Rümeysa Öztürk, students from Columbia and Tufts universities respectively, whom the administration tried to deport after their public criticism of Israel’s war in Gaza. Berry called the administration’s yanking of Harvard funding and the student immigration actions “core infringements on academic freedom and speech”.He also denounced Trump’sexecutive orderlast month vowing to prosecute anyone burning the American flag. As he pointed out, “there is ironclad legal precedent that flag burning is protected speech.”View image in fullscreenJimmy Kimmel tapes an episode of his late-night show, which was temporarily suspended by ABC after the network was pressured by the Trump administration to crack down on critics of Charlie Kirk.Photograph: Randy Holmes/ABC/AFP/Getty ImagesSince Kirk’s killing, Berry has watched the unfolding of Trump’s “free speech for me, but not for thee” response with mounting alarm. Disney’s temporary cancellation of Kimmel’s late-night show for misrepresenting the Kirk suspect as a Maga supporter after threats of government penalties from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), was in Berry’s estimation a clear example of “government power being used to suppress speech that the administration doesn’t like”.Then there was the intervention of Pam Bondi, the US attorney general, who days after Kirk’s death vowed to prosecute hate speech. Like flag burning, hate speech is fully protected under the first amendment, as the country’s top law enforcement official ideally should have known.Ironically, Kirk himself was clear on this point,saying last year: “Hate speech does not exist legally in America. There’s ugly speech. There’s gross speech. There’s evil speech. And ALL of it is protected by the first amendment.”Berry also regards as a free speech violation Trump’s threats to go against leftwing groups he dislikes. On Mondaythe president designatedantifa a “domestic terrorist organization”, a move that potentially breaches the first amendment by criminalising political ideology.All of these quick-fire steps after Kirk’s assassination towards controlling public discourse leaves Berry profoundly apprehensive. “I’m very worried about what the executive branch is trying to do,” he said.In particular, the Cato director is concerned about what he calls the “capitulation factor”. He fears that private companies such as Disney, ABC’s owner that suspended Kimmel for six days before the comic wasallowed back on airon Tuesday, will settle with Trump rather than stand up for constitutional rights.“Long term, we’ll get through this,” Berry said. “But in the short term a lot of speech is going to be chilled without ever getting into court, and that’s very, very bad.”View image in fullscreenA man holds a sign in the shape of Mickey Mouse’s face on Monday during a protest outside the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, California, across the street from where Jimmy Kimmel Live! is recorded.Photograph: David Swanson/ReutersOpposition to the assault on free speech goes beyond the libertarian right. Other prominent public figures from conservative and libertarian circles have spoken out, indicating fissures that, should they grow, could challenge Trump’s Maga hegemony.Bari Weiss, a rising star on the anti-woke right who is being reportedly groomed for atop job at CBS, has castigated the president in her online outlet, the Free Press. Inan editorial, the site decried Trump’s many threats against media organisations as a “case where the medicine is worse than the disease”.In Congress, senator Ted Cruz, normally a reliable Trump acolyte,warned the presidentto avoid habitually bullying media companies. If he did, it would “end up bad for conservatives”.Thomas Massie, a Republican congressman from Kentucky who has led the charge to have theEpstein filesreleased, compared Bondi’s threat to prosecute hate speech to George Orwell’s dystopian “thought crimes”.Even the Maga cheerleader Tucker Carlson clearedan episodeof his online show to rail against the risk of hate speech laws being introduced in America. Were that to happen, Carlson said, then civil disobedience would be called for.“Because if they can tell you what to say, they’re telling you what to think, there is nothing they can’t do to you because they don’t consider you human.”People are motivated by censorship envy – the idea that the other side got to suppress speech they dislikedEugene VolokhSo how did it come to this? How did Trump go from executive order 14149 tothreatening an ABC reporterto his face last week that he might face prosecution “because you treat me so unfairly”?How did JD Vance move frompledging in Februarythat under Trump’s leadership “we may disagree with your views but we will fight to defend your right to offer it in the public square”, to calling for amass doxingof anyone who had celebrated Kirk’s murder?How did the FCC chair Brendan Carr veer fromhaving denouncedin 2023 government censorship as the “authoritarian’s dream”, to using his federal power to force Kimmel’s suspension with the mob-like menace: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way?”Eugene Volokh, a libertarian conservative who is a senior fellow at Stanford’s Hoover Institution, has a word for the Trump team’s razor sharp U-turn on free speech. He calls it “censorship envy”.“It’s human nature to want to restrict speech that you disapprove of, to retaliate,” he said. “People are motivated by censorship envy – the idea that the other side got to suppress speech they disliked, so I should jump on the bandwagon and get some of that action too.”Volokh added that in his opinion Trump’s get-you-back censorship was a mistake. “It’s bad for the country. It’s bad for the conservative movement.”View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to reporters before departing the White House on Friday.Photograph: Julia Demaree Nikhinson/APThat admonition was echoed by Sabrina Schaeffer, a member of the executive team of the R Street Institute, which preaches classical liberalism, individual liberty and free markets. She said that she has been scratching her head over the past few days as so many Republicans applauded the clampdown on free speech.“I know they’re tired of ‘woke’ politics. But this should be a cautionary tale, because one day Democrats will hold the levers of power again and then they will be even more empowered to shut down dissenting views.”Welch, who regards his strain of libertarianism as neither of the right nor left, sees the current moment against the long arch of history. Under Ronald Reagan, the Republican party was a broad church that combined conservatism with libertarian activism, with free speech as one of its central tenets.What Trump has unleashed, by contrast, “is going against Reagan and 40 years of American politics. People are so addicted to power right now that they are throwing principles out the window.”Rightwing podcasters run rampant with Charlie Kirk conspiracies: ‘It’s craven opportunism’Read moreIt was Republicans, Welch pointed out, that in the 1970s and 80s led the charge on free speech grounds against the FCC’s so-called fairness doctrine that required TV networks to carry opposing viewpoints on controversial public issues. That is a world away from the Republican chair of the FCC threatening a broadcast company over one comment from a comedian.“I care about the federal government telling a private broadcaster how they are supposed to conduct their business,” Welch said. “That’s crazy.”Cato’s Berry is clearly disturbed by the turn of events, but he has not despaired. For him, the way out of this quagmire lies with the American judiciary and the first amendment itself, which he regards as the strongest safeguard of free speech in the world.“I remain confident that the courts will uphold the principles that the government cannot be biased, that it cannot chill speech through selective enforcement, that there is no law against hate speech.”As for Welch, he draws comfort in the storm from a more amorphous source. He looks to the American spirit, and a characteristic within it that he believes has been integral since even before the country’s founding.That is, the ability of Americans to trash each other.“We criticise, always have done,” he said. “We have just always been kind of assholes, cheeky.”Welch sees the portrayal of Trump in the latest season of the animated sitcomSouth Parkas a seamless continuation of this trait. The president is depicted as a censorship-addicted dictator sleeping with the devil.That gives Welch hope.“I feel like the South Park in all of us will eventually win,” he said. “It’s the natural place for us to be, and by the time Trump finally goes, he’ll find himself on the losing end.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We eke out the last dregs of summer until one day we realise that we are still carrying sunglasses around, when what the weather actually calls for is a scarf. At which point, it is time to focus on what will be the most important piece in all of our wardrobes for the next six months – the coat.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.A good coat is much more than an extra layer. It is the piece that sets the tone for your whole outfit. It is the hardest-working player in your wardrobe, the one that you turn to day in and day out, the piece that has to coordinate with everything else you wear, the garment that needs to be tough enough to cope with being pulled on and off multiple times a day.The right one will make it easier to get through winter with a smile on your face. Picture a cold, rainy Tuesday morning commute. Now imagine yourself striding along in a fluffy leopard-print jacket, or a glossy emerald puffer, or a debonair maxi coat in cherry-coloured wool. Exactly.Let’s say you have decided that last year’s coat just doesn’t cut it and are in the market for a new one. The best strategy is to tick off the practical requirements first, then go with what makes your heart sing. A coat is a major investment, so do not settle for one that does not both keep you warm and make you happy.Start with the basics. Do you mostly walk, cycle or travel by car? Do you carry an umbrella, or do you need a hood? If you wear smart dresses to work, then a long coat will protect them while you are outside; if you are mostly in jeans, a warm jacket works.With those guardrails in place, find a coat that elevates your look. For half of the year, the coat you wear becomes, if not your whole personality, then at least your first impression. So when you pick one, you make a statement about yourself to the world.A bright coat can be a smart choice, because it adds impact to simple outfits. When you try one on, tune in to how it makes you feel about yourself when you look in the mirror. If you feel emboldened, go for it. But if you feel awkward or embarrassed, pass and move on to something navy or camel or grey. This coat should make you feel brave and happy and competent and warm – and warm inside. Autumn is sneaking up on us as we speak.

A mass of ferns, vines and thistles encroaches on the path, and the guides hack through brambles with machetes. Above, the forest whistles in the wind, glowing in the morning light.“The higher you go, the more the mountain pushes back,” Ssebide says, pausing for breath.View image in fullscreenUganda wildlife authority rangers tracking and monitoring gorillas in the Virunga mountains along the Rwanda-Uganda borderAfter nearly 45 minutes, a ranger spots patches of flattened grass and large piles of fresh, dark green dung. We are close.Then the forest suddenly opens up to nine mountain gorillas – the Nyakagezi family – having their breakfast in a clearing. The enormous silverback munches his way through a thistle, throwing his visitors an indifferent glance.Nearby, a three-year-old juvenile swings on a vine watched by its mother. An adolescent male tugs at a wild blackberry, carefully picking off leaves to eat and grunting with satisfaction.View image in fullscreenTrackers hack through the foliage in search of mountain gorillasThe Virunga mountains, which range over the border region of Rwanda, Uganda and theDemocratic Republic of the Congo(DRC), is one of two remaining homes for this endangered gorilla subspecies, identifiable by their thick fur and stocky frames that help them withstand the harsh conditions.Location map of Virunga national park and mount MuhaburaView image in fullscreenA young gorilla plays in the early morning on mount MuhaburaIn the 1970s and 80s, barely 250 mountain gorillas were left and naturalists feared extinction was close, as expanding agricultural frontiers and logging devoured their habitat.But decades of intense conservation efforts – through war and the 1994 Rwandan genocide – have worked. Population numbers reached more than 1,000 in 2018 and mountain gorillas were downgraded from critically endangered to endangered by conservation authorities. Next year, an updated count is expected to show another increase. But it has come at an enormous cost in moneyand human life, and nobody who works with the animals is certain of their future.In the past two decades, more than 220 rangers have been killed in the DRC side of Virunga national park whereM23 and other militias and bandits operate with impunity. Thousands of people have been displaced and killed. Even in the safe regions of the apes’ range, the threat from human diseases is growing.As gorilla numbers continue to increase in their last remaining islands of habitat, there is a new concern: what happens if they run out of room?Human contactIn the dense jungle of Muhabura,Ssebide, from the conservation organisation Gorilla Doctors, and his colleagues Dr Nelson and Dr Fred get to work. From a distance, they check the health of each animal, paying close attention to any signs of sickness or injury.“They are all feeding well,” he whispers.View image in fullscreenSsebide, centre, with Dr Nelson and Dr Fred in the Gorilla Doctors vets teamGorilla Doctor vets, who work across all three countries, are key to the turnaround in mountain gorilla numbers, one of the greatest conservation success stories of the past century.One studyattributes half of the increase to the vets and their preventions of dozens of deaths, enabling the population to slowly grow.“We have relationships with so many gorillas. Mark [this family’s dominant male] is just one. There are others. There is another born at Christmas in 2000; I saw him as a baby – now he is a silverback leading his own group,” Ssebide says.When the Gorilla Doctors first started, much of their time was dedicated to dealing with injuries from the primates becoming caught in or lacerated by traps meant for buffalo and antelope in the forest.Now respiratory diseases passed from humans have become a bigger problem. Anyone observing the animals now must wear a mask, disinfect their hands and keep their distance.View image in fullscreenHuman contact is the biggest threat to the gorillasThe threat from human colds and flu reflects one of the contradictions at the heart of conservation: humans remain the biggest ongoing threat to gorillas while also being the source of their salvation.‘Life here has improved’In his immaculate khakis, Chemonges Amusa is not a man to be messed with. Stretching his arms around his fellow rangers outside their headquarters, he laughs: “I am the silverback here. These are my blackbacks. Any challenge, big problem.”View image in fullscreenChemonges Amusa, warden of Bwindi Impenetrable national park, with his team of rangersAmusa is the senior warden in charge of the southern section of Bwindi Impenetrable national park in Uganda, the other stronghold of mountain gorillas, and oversees a lucrative chunk of the gorilla business for the UgandaWildlifeAuthority.Earlier that morning, two groups of foreign tourists – each paying $800 (£585) for one hour with the gorillas – had received their safety briefing.They will see “habituated” mountain gorillas: primate families adapted to being around humans. They are not tame, but have undergone a multi-year process to allow tourist groups to stand metres away as they feed and socialise. Without training, the gorillas would flee from, or attack, people who get too near to them.More than half of the family groups inBwindi, home to about 460 mountain gorillas, are habituated and regularly visited. Local communities receive a 20% share of the revenue from tourism, and want more gorilla families to undergo the process.View image in fullscreenA Chinese tourist enjoys a welcome performance for visitors at Bwindi Impenetrable national park before embarking on a gorilla tracking tourAs the visitors arrive just after sunrise, 30 women sing and dance to welcome them. A dozen porters wait nearby, hoping to carry bags. Those who struggle with the hike can pay local people $300 to carry them up and down steep hills.Habituation – and the economy that has sprung up around it – has been another pillar of conservation success. The money from the more than 40,000 tourists who visited Bwindi in 2024 raised enough to fund the entirety of Uganda’s national park system for a year, says Amusa.We are very proud of our work. I am happy to see them alive and increasing in numbersAmusa ChemongesJust as in Virunga, the Bwindi gorillas are hemmed in by subsistence agriculture, a dividing line between apes and humans. But the money from ecotourism has helped to fund buffer zones, made by planting tea – which gorillas will not eat – around the forest, discouraging them from feeding on crops.“We have to habituate for two reasons. One is for tourists, who cannot visit the gorillas if they are very wild – it would be dangerous. The other is so we can monitor them,” says Amusa. “We are very proud of our work. I am happy to see them alive and increasing in numbers,” he says.View image in fullscreenBuhutu Steven, a tea estate manager who helps deter poaching and keeps gorillas away from settlementsThere is enthusiasm for the gorilla conservation among the villagers, even though it has been a fraught process. In 1991, hundreds of people were moved from their homes when national park boundaries were formalised and the land protected. In some forest areas,Indigenous Batwa hunter-gatherers (formerly known as Pygmies) were forced out. But there have been major efforts to find a balance and funnel benefits back to communities.Buhutu Steven, a 44-year-old tea farmer, tends to acres of plants. His land borders a Batwa forest reserve.“I feel I contribute to the gorillas’ protection. When I got engaged in planting the tea, it was one way of looking after them. Before, the gorillas were at risk,” he says. “When they habituated gorillas, life here improved. Guests come and they leave something behind.”More roomThe gorillas have become a booming industry across the border in Rwanda, too. Were it not for an enormous bamboo stage constructed in the shape of two gorillas, you could be forgiven for confusingKwita Izina– Rwanda’s annual naming ceremony for baby gorillas – with a music festival.From early in the morning, a DJ blasts music in the shadow of the Volcanoes national park’s mountains, on the Rwandan side of the Virunga massif. Celebrities, conservationists, artists and businesspeople gather alongside park rangers and guides, with high-profile guests invited to name a baby. This year is a bumper ceremony: 40 babies need a name.View image in fullscreenMichael Bay, the US film director, speaks at the naming ceremony“This puts theSuper Bowl half-time showto shame,” says the film director Michael Bay before introducing his baby gorilla,Umurage, which means “heritage”, to the crowd. He promises to make the “good-looking” infant a movie star.The ceremony, marking its 20th anniversary, is a stark contrast to how things used to be. Near here, theprimatologist Dian Fossey was murderedin 1985 during her campaign against poachers. Today, the Rwandan government isincreasing the park size by nearly a quarterto provide the gorillas with more habitat. The country has also embraced a high-end ecotourism model. Each visitor pays $1,500 to visit the animals, and some hotels charge more than $20,000 a night.As gorilla numbers creep up, the success of the model is obliging conservationists to consider what may happen if more mountain gorilla habitat is needed in their last two remaining strongholds.View image in fullscreenPeople attend the 20th anniversary of Rwanda’s annual naming ceremony for baby gorillas, which helps support conservation efforts“Right now, the park is still big enough for the gorillas. We need to work out the carrying capacity. But in the future, if the numbers overwhelm us, the government will ask the community to create more land for them, both for their habitat and the buffer zone,” says Amusa in Uganda.Researchers will watch for signs of fighting between gorilla families, an indicator that numbers are putting strain on the available habitat. But for now, most are satisfied that predictions of mountain gorillas’ annihilation have been proved so wrong.“The records indicate there were many more gorillas here before. I think these areas could take three times as many,” says Ssebide. “But ultimately, you will never know what will happen as the population grows.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsUgandaThe age of extinctionDemocratic Republic of the CongoWildlifeNational parksConservationAfricaEndangered speciesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

That means it’s also going to bea record-breaking year for cider.According to the National Association of Cider Makers, the warm summer has also delivered apples“full of rich flavours and natural sweetness, perfect for cider making”. In orchards across the UK, boughs are breaking under the weight of the ripening fruit. Thatchers Cider has begun its earliest apple harvest in the company’s 121-year history. At Sandford Orchards near Exeter, they’re installing extra tanks to keep up with production.How will we cope with all the extra cider coming our way?

As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall puts it, “using cider in cooking is a bit like using fruit and wine and perhaps a little vinegar and a pinch of sugar, all at the same time”. Hislamb stew with ciderdeploys it where another recipe might call for stock. It serves a similar purpose inchicken Normandy, and inSlater’s chicken thighs with mushrooms and cider.View image in fullscreenStock alternative … Nigel Slater’s chicken thighs with mushrooms and cider.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverCider has a place in cooking seafood, too, most famously with mussels, where it’s used as a steaming liquid; a serviceable – and maybe, at this time of year, preferable – substitute for white wine.Angela Hartnett’s mussels with cider and pancettais an object lesson in keeping things simple.Cider and salt-grilled salmon, a winning Guardian reader’s recipe from 2015, uses cider as a marinade for the fish.View image in fullscreenKeeping it simple … Angela Hartnett’s mussels with cider and pancetta.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianAn onion soup made with cider instead of wine gives that French classic a distinctly British twist.Tom Kerridge’s versionis topped with cheese-and-apple toasts made with cheddar and a ripe granny smith cut into matchsticks.Dan Lepard’s rye loafrelies on a yeast, flour and cider mixture left to develop in the fridge overnight.While it’s less common to turn to cider as an ingredient in cakes and desserts, it’s not unheard of.Nigella Lawson’s cider and five-spice bundt cakeis one example, combining ginger, black treacle, cinnamon, Chinese five-spice and cider, baked in a fluted, doughnut-shaped bundt tin. Thiscider and pumpkin cakeuses two bundt cakes joined base-to-base, to recreate the shape of a pumpkin. The recipe tells you to bake the two cakes one after the other, presumably on the supposition that nobody has two bundt tins.Cider sorbet with cheddar and mintmay sound like a slightly challenging collection of flavours, but the cheddar here is a stick of cheese deployed as a garnish – the same way you would a flake in a 99 – and is therefore wholly optional.View image in fullscreenMull it over … cider gets hot and spicy.Photograph: Ray Kachatorian/Getty ImagesFinally, a classicmulled cider from Jamie Oliver.

Streeting was reading on his phone that Donald Trump had justwarned womennot to take Tylenol – known outside the US as paracetamol – during pregnancy.The US president had alleged without evidence that the common painkiller caused autism in children. “Don’t take Tylenol,” Trump said about a drug also known as acetaminophen.The British government has been criticised for tiptoeing around Trump on all manner of issues. But not, it seems, on this. Streeting decided to devise a plan to limit the fallout in the UK and reassure mothers-to-be that taking paracetamol was safe. He decided to rebut – publicly and vigorously – what Trump had said.Already booked to appear on a breakfast show the next morning, Streeting knew he would be asked about Trump. “He knew he had to be unequivocal,” the aide said. “That whatever diplomatic issues we face, first and foremost our responsibility is people’s health.”‘Listen to doctors, scientists’When the question came, Streeting was brutal. “I trust doctors over President Trump, frankly, on this,” he said. “I’ve just got to be really clear about this: there is no evidence to link the use of paracetamol by pregnant women to autism in their children. None.“So I would just say to people watching: don’t pay any attention whatsoever to what Donald Trump says about medicine. In fact, don’t even take my word for it, as a politician – listen to British doctors, British scientists, the NHS.”View image in fullscreenWes Streeting.Photograph: Jordan Pettitt/PAHis headline-making response to Trump’s baseless claim was complemented by a “flood the airwaves” strategy that he and his Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) had begun putting in place the day before.Senior figures from bodies such as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which regulates medicines, NHS England, the Royal College of GPs, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the UK Health Security Agency conveyed similar messages to Streeting’s in media interviews throughout Tuesday.The National Autistic Society criticised “the incessant misinformation about autism from President Trump and [the US health secretary] Robert F Kennedy Jr”, which it said would undermine decades of research and leave autistic people “dismayed and frightened”.Their responses aligned withthose issuedby the World Health Organization (WHO) andleading medical bodiesin the US.In addition, DHSC officials gave doctors and influencers with large followings on social media factsheets and briefings on paracetamol and pregnancy to help ensure they got accurate, well-evidenced information out on platforms such as X, TikTok and Instagram.Recent months have brought severalhigh-profile examplesof untruths about medicine and such misinformation is causing growing alarm in the global health community.In June, cancer doctors revealed their horror that some patients were shunning established treatments for the disease and instead opting for untested quack regimes such as coffee enemas and raw juice diets.3:32The truth behind Trump's claims about autism and paracetamol, or Tylenol – videoDays later, theBBC disclosedhow Paloma Shemirani, the daughter of a nurse turned anti-vaxxer, Kate Shemirani, had died after rejecting chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The 23-year-old had chosen to use Gerson therapy, an unproven treatment for cancer, instead.And this month in an appearance on the main stage at Reform UK’s conference, the cardiologistclaimedthat King Charles and the Princess of Wales’s cancer diagnoses were linked to them having had the Covid vaccine.But experts who study health misinformation see Trump’s remarks as a worrying new low.Helen Bedford, a professor of child health at University College London (UCL), said: “I was horrified, because it’s not evidence-based and he is the most powerful man in the world. It was shocking because you know the impact it’s going to have, not just on pregnant women but also because it implies that autism is something to be avoided. It was a horrifying announcement, damaging and dangerous.”Is Tylenol the same as paracetamol, and should you take it in pregnancy? Here’s why experts say Trump should be ignoredRead moreDr Susanna Kola-Palmer, a psychologist at the University of Huddersfield, said: “People are prone to authority bias, trusting and believing what someone in authority says just because they are an authority figure, not necessarily because they are right. Donald Trump, as the US president, is a powerful public figure and therefore lots of people will accept what he says without questioning it.“When health misinformation is being peddled so publicly by such a powerful person, it is both deeply troubling and dangerous, as it risks eroding public trust in science and compromising public health.”Health experts fear Trump linking acetaminophen to autism could dissuade pregnant women – who already have few medicines available if they fall sick – from using it and in turn lead to illnesses such as pain or a fever going untreated and harming them or their unborn child.Pharmacists in the UK report that Trump’s remarks may already be influencing some people’s decisions about their health. In a survey of 500 pharmacies, 24% said they had encountered patients this week who were questioning paracetamol’s safety.“These are alarming findings which show that comments made in the US are having a direct impact on patients in the UK and potentially deterring some from taking what are proven and safe medical treatments,” said Olivier Picard, the chair of the National Pharmacy Association.‘Fringe narratives’Writing in theLancetmedical journal in July, Heidi Larson, a professor of anthropology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, identified the US as the origin of so much of the “pandemic of misinformation” and “fringe narratives” that caused controversy during the Covid pandemic and appear to have gained even more traction since.For example, from 2019to 2021 the US acted as “a major exporter of Covid-19 vaccine misinformation, with American accounts disproportionately represented as central hubs in global misinformation networks”, she said. That influenced behaviour in countries as far away as Nigeria, Ghana and Bulgaria, contributing to reduced uptake of Covid and childhood vaccines.As a result, organisations such as the WHO and Gavi, the vaccines alliance, in their day-to-day work promoting vaccines “are increasingly confronted by vaccine hesitancy grounded in exported disinformation, much of it directly traceable to American political discourse and media,” Larson said.Concerted efforts to undermine vaccines are rising despite the WHO’sestimatethat vaccines have saved 154 million lives since 1974 – 101 million of them children – and in an era of rapid progress in medical science when new vaccines appear to offer promise on diseases for which until recently they were not used.So how can the growing threat misinformation poses to health worldwide be tackled?View image in fullscreenA vaccination station in Kampala, Uganda. The WHO estimates vaccines have saved 154 million lives since 1974.Photograph: Hajarah Nalwadda/Getty ImagesThere is no obvious way to stop the authoritarian Trump and Kennedy promoting wild theories about health despite a lack of evidence. But experts say new approaches in response are needed, especially with big tech firms whose social media platforms spread so much of the scaremongering. There is a consensus that simply relying on conveying accurate information via leaflets and websites is not enough.“While messages fromWes Streetingand professional organisations are very helpful, evidence shows that what matters to the public is the individual conversations they have with health professionals,” Bedford said, citing the many questions a parent may have before their child starts their schedule of vaccinations. “Most people trust health professionals and want to talk to them when they have concerns and questions. That can be very powerful and very influential.”But she noted that the UK has a shortage of many types of health professionals – health visitor numbers have fallen sharply since 2015 – so how such informative and potentially reassuring conversations would happen was not obvious. A different mindset among clinicians and a bigger health workforce were needed to enable such a shift to pro-active, pre-treatment appointments, she said.View image in fullscreenParacetamol on sale in the UK. Pharmacists report that Trump’s remarks may already be influencing some people in the UK’s decisions about their health.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAChris van Tulleken, an NHS infectious diseases doctor and global health expert at UCL, cautioned that clinicians having such conversations should not automatically disregard the views of patients who may have suspicious, even conspiratorial views about big pharma, given some of its products have caused major harm.“We have to meet people where they are. If you just tweet with the hashtag ‘vaccines work’, which some people do, the difficulty is that there are some vaccines with serious side-effects. I run a clinic where we’re cautious about certain vaccines,” he said.Last year the WHO agreed a partnership with TikTok involving factchecking and the social media company doing more to remove content that could endanger health.The WHO’sFides networkbrings together more than 1,000 health professionals who are active on social media “to amplify trustworthy content and push back against harmful misinformation”, said Dr Alex Ruani, one of those involved. “It’s essentially a ‘trusted voices’ network.” For instance, Dr Mikhail “Mike” Varshavski, one of those voices, has more than 29 million followers on social media.Ruani said social media platforms needed to do much more. “Big tech already know how to downrank, demote, deamplify or quarantine content. These processes can and should be applied to high-risk content [about health],” she said.“We need better risk flags and warnings at the point of exposure, a bit like how you get pop-ups for cookies or how spam filters work in email. These friction nudges can be built into browsers or apps to give people a heads-up about dodgy content before they consume or share it.”Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, said at the UNhis country “must finish the job”.However, the seniorLabourpolitician declined to conclude that Israel was committing genocide in the territory, despite pressure to do so from inside her party, repeating the government’s position that was down to a legal process.She admitted that “words seem hollow” in response to the catastrophic situation on the ground and said the priority must be trying to use new momentum behind a peace deal to end the “screams and pain” of Palestinian children.Cooper, believed to be one of the cabinet ministers who privately pushed Keir Starmer torecognise the Palestinian state, said that while she understood the horror many felt about the humanitarian situation it was her job to focus on ending the war.The White House is understood to be backinga plan that would have Tony Blairhead a temporary technocratic administration of Gaza.

I think we’ve reached a moment where the world wants to end this war,” Cooper said.The “beginning of the process” was a ceasefire, the restoration of humanitarian aid and the release of all the hostages, she added. However, she acknowledged the process was fragile and there were many obstacles ahead.View image in fullscreenIsraeli forces strike Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“We can’t pretend this isn’t incredibly hard, and how long the crisis has been going on makes it challenging. But there was no doubt that there is a real sense of determination and energy behind trying to get an end to the war and to try and get not just an immediate ceasefire, but a proper plan for the future.”Just days before hosting Netanyahu in Washington, Trump told reporters on Friday that it was “looking like we have a deal on Gaza”. Cooper acknowledged the US president would play an instrumental role in bringingIsraelon board.The 21-point White House plan for peace is, diplomats say,compatible with the plan for Palestineendorsed by the UN last week, with agreement on no mass displacement from Gaza, no role for Hamas and no West Bank annexation.But Foreign Office insiders are understood to be uneasy about aspects of the Trump plan, including what role Blair might play.“Tony Blair has been one of the people adding proposals to this process, and that’s been really important, but there have been lots of other processes as well,” Cooper said. “There’s still a huge amount of work to do. At this stage, there’s a sense of consensus building but we’ve got to keep that on track.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war has to be brought to an end,” Cooper said.“I think the reason that there is just such a sense of distress is because everybody can see the horror of what has happened and the fact that it feels like nothing’s being done. It feels like nothing is changing. It feels like everything is just getting worse …“The challenge for us now is that there is a moment, and we have to make sure that that moment, through international action, is turned into a peace process.”Turning to Russia, and the drones and jets being flown over Poland and Scandinavian countries, Cooper accused Vladimir Putin of “deliberate provocation” and attempts to destabilise Europe.The foreign secretary urged the US to “go much further” on sanctions on Russian oil and gas, after Trump said a week ago he was ready to do so, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions. “There has to be a much more concerted effort,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warYvette CooperLabour conferenceForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

We thank everyone connected with JLR for their continued support and patience.”Commenting on the loan, the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, said: “Jaguar Land Rover is an iconic British company which employs tens of thousands of people – a jewel in the crown of our economy.“Today we are protecting thousands of those jobs with up to £1.5bn in additional private finance, helping them support their supply chain and protect a vital part of the British car industry.”Following the cyber-attack, the company wasforced to shut downmost of the systems it uses to track parts, vehicles and tooling in its factories, as well as everything to do with selling its luxury Range Rover, Discovery and Defender SUVs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Labour must also pick up our suggestion of a cyber reinsurance scheme to protect British businesses from state-backed actors in an increasingly dangerous world.”Sarah Olney, the Liberal Democrat business spokesperson, said: “The government and JLR must urgently clarify whether this emergency loan is going to be enough to properly protect tens of thousands of jobs and companies in the supply chain.“This move is of course welcome – and hopefully not too late – but the government has been too slow to act.“The government must be prepared to provide further support, including a furlough scheme for affected workers, if needed. We must also see a plan for ensuring cybersecurity standards are improved so that situations like this aren’t repeated.”With plants in Solihull and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands in addition to Halewood in Merseyside, JLR is one of the UK’s largest exporters and employs 34,000 people in its UK operations.It also operates the largest supply chain in the UK automotive sector, much of it made up of SMEs, and employs about 120,000 people.Explore more on these topicsJaguar Land RoverAutomotive industryCybercrimenewsShareReuse this content"

He will open up some other direction. Nobody knows where. He wants that,” he said.Safety fears as external power to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant still out after three daysRead moreUkraine’s president said the Kremlin was deliberately checking Europe’s capacity to protect its skies, afterdrone sightings in Denmark, Poland and Romaniaand the violation of Estonian airspace by Russian fighter jets. More drones werespotted on Friday night above a Danish military base, and over a Norwegian base on Saturday.Zelenskyy suggested EU governments were struggling to deal with this new and dangerous threat. Earlier this month,Ukrainespotted 92 drones flying towards Poland in a “choreographed” way. It intercepted most of them. Nineteen crossed into Polish territory, where the Poles shot four down.“I am not comparing our forces. We are at war and they [Poland] are not,” he said. Zelenskyy said representatives from several unnamed countries would travel to Ukraine to receive “practical training” in how to repel Russian aerial attacks. “We are ready to share our experience,” he added.Zelenskyy’s remarks follow what he said were “very nice” talks with Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.

Asked to explain this apparent warmer tone towards Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he had briefed Trump about the realities on the battlefield. He told him Russia’s advances were often fleeting: “It’s not success. It’s temporary presence.”The US president now had greater “faith” in Ukraine and has discovered that Russia treated him and everyone else with “disrespect”, Zelenskyy said. He declined tocomment on reportsthat he had asked the White House for US Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking Moscow, saying: “It’s a sensitive issue.”In recent months Kyiv has carried out a series of successful strikes against Russian oil refineries using domestically produced long-range drones. Zelenskyy said that if the Kremlin tried to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure again this winter its own capital will experience retaliatory blackouts.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

The prime minister, Keir Starmer, described the proposals as “national renewal in action”.It comes as the new towns taskforce, established in September last year, publishes a report with a raft of recommendations for fresh developments across the country.Labouris keen to present the proposals as a rejection of what it sees as the “quick fix” politics of Reform.Reed will tell delegates that the project is modelled on the “housing boom” overseen by Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, which built more than one million homes between 1945 and 1951. Reed’s project will rely on public and private funding but the total anticipated cost is unclear. The taskforce is expected to say that, collectively, the new towns could deliver “up to 300,000” homes over the “coming decades”.Reed, who became housing secretary just three weeks ago following the resignation of Angela Rayner, will say he will do whatever it takes to get Britain building to “restore the dream of home ownership” to thousands of families across the country.He will say on Sunday: “We will fight for hard-working people, locked out of a secure home for too long by the Conservative government of blockers. This Labour government won’t sit back and let this happen. I will do whatever it takes to get Britain building. We’ve got to ‘build, baby, build’.“That’s the way we put the key to a decent home in the pocket of everyone who needs a secure and affordable home. And not just homes, but communities, and not just communities but entire towns.“This party built new towns after the war to meet our promise of homes fit for heroes. Now, with the worst economic inheritance since that war, we will once again build cutting-edge communities to provide homes fit for families of all shapes and sizes.“I am launching the next generation of new towns taking the lessons from the postwar Labour government housing boom, mobilising the full power of the state to build a new generation of new towns.”Locations under consideration include Tempsford, Bedfordshire, Crews Hill, north London and Leeds South Bank, though final decisions are yet to be made.Each new town is expected to have at least 10,000 properties as well as GP surgeries, schools, green spaces and transport links. The taskforce will suggest that about 40% of the dwellings should be affordable homes, with 20% earmarked for social housing, it is understood.Academics say Britain faces a shortage of about 4.3m homes, and there are record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation. Labour has pledged to build 1.5m new properties before the next general election, although analysts have cast doubt on whether this target is achievable.Explore more on these topicsLabourHousingCommunitiesSteve ReednewsShareReuse this content"

Germany’s interior minister has said he wants to authorise its military to shoot down drones, while EU leaders are due to meet in Copenhagen next week and are expected to discuss how to improve Europe’s defences and support Ukraine.On Friday, defence ministers from 10 EU countriesagreed to strengthen eastern defenceswith a so-called “drone wall” to deter Russia.On Saturday, Russia’s foreign ministry said the measures would lead to “an increase in military and political tensions on our continent”, according to state news agency RIA Novosti.The ministry added that the plans amounted to “personal ambitions and political games of the EU’s ruling elites”.The Danish public broadcaster DR reported that there were drones in the air inside and outside the fence of the Karup airbase about 8pm on Friday, according to Simon Skelkjær, spokesperson for the Central and West Jutland police.Skelkjær said he could not comment on where the drones came from, adding: “We didn’t take them down.”Karup airbase houses all the Danish armed forces’ helicopters, airspace surveillance and parts of the Danish defence command.In Norway, Brynjar Stordal, a spokesperson for the country’s joint headquarters, told AFP they were investigating the sightings but “handling it as a drone sighting”.EU to move forward with plans for drone wall amid Russian incursionsRead moreAt least two drones flew “for around an hour” in a restricted area close to Orland, the main base for Norway’s F-35 fighter jets and a key Nato base. “They were not engaged by us,” he said.There was also a drone spotted late on Friday over Germany’s northern Schleswig-Holstein state, which borders Denmark, state interior minister Sabine Sütterlin-Waack told local broadcaster NDR.Germany’s interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said on Saturday that the threat from drones was “high” and the government was considering allowing the armed forces to shoot down drones under certain conditions. Police have the main responsibility for defending against drones.Dobrindt told journalists in Berlin he wanted to revise air safety laws to allow the “shooting down of drones” by the armed forces, among other measures.“It’s about being prepared so that critical infrastructure or large gatherings of people, for example, can be protected,” he said.“What we are witnessing is an arms race – an arms race between drone threats and drone defence. We must prepare ourselves for this,” he added.Copenhagen has also said it plans to acquire new enhanced capabilities to detect and neutralise drones.Russia is the prime suspect behind the recent drone incursions. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, on Thursday said: “There is one main country that poses a threat to Europe’s security, and it is Russia.”Although no definitive proof has been provided to back this up, Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Thursday that the flights appeared to be “the work of a professional actor”.The drone flights began just days after Denmark said last Wednesday it would acquire “long-range precision weapons” for the first time to counter the threat from Russia.Denmark’s justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said the aim of the attacks was “to spread fear, create division and frighten us”.This follows similar drone activity over Romania and Poland in the last few weeks, as well as Russian fighter jets violating Estonian airspace, which has raised concerns over the security of northern Europe and its vulnerability to air attacks from Russia.Moscow has denied breaching Nato’s airspace, calling the EU’s reaction a “hysteria” on Wednesday.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDenmarkDrones (non-military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

He is campaigning ahead of state elections that are to be held in early 2026.The 51-year-old said on X that his “heart is shattered” at the tragedy, adding: “I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of my dear brothers and sisters who lost their lives in Karur.”Videos from local media show thousands of people surrounding a large campaign vehicle on top of which Vijay is seen standing and speaking.During the rally, visuals showed Vijay throwing water bottles from the top of the vehicle to fainting supporters and calling for police help when the crowd became uncontrollable.Modi said the incident was “deeply saddening”.“My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time,” he said in a statement on social media.Crushes are relatively common in India when large crowds gather. In January, at least 30 people were killed as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river during the Maha Kumbh Mela festival, the world’s largest religious gathering.In July last year, 121 people were killed in the northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.And 11 fans were crushed to death this June in Bengaluru during celebrations for the local team’s first Indian Premier League title.It is also not the first time Vijay’s rallies have been the subject of safety concerns. At least six deaths were reported by media following the first meeting of his political party when it was launched in October last year.Despite police-imposed restrictions, including limits on convoy size and venue changes, the sheer scale of public turnout has repeatedly overwhelmed local infrastructure.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

But no more. They are world champions for a third time and this one may taste all the sweeter for being played out in front of a world-record crowd of 81,885. The result will have apermanent effect on the sport in England.‘Kildunne and Dusted’: Red Roses dialled up to 11 for emotional World Cup victory | Robert KitsonRead moreIt was just a few years ago when the Red Roses would run out to a few thousand fans who had stayed behind after the men had played. Now, they are turning a profit for the Rugby Football Union and securing silverware in the process. The celebrations do not stop at Twickenham, with an event at Battersea power station on Sunday.Ellie Kildunne’s brilliant individual attacking sizzle will rightfully be in the spotlight once again with her efforts making the difference at times, but Alex Matthews and Sadia Kabeya must share some of the acclaim. The No 8 is ever-consistent in an England shirt and showed up on the biggest stage with two tries, while Kabeya, the player of the match, fronted up in defence.View image in fullscreenThere is no stopping Ellie Kildunne as the England back sprints to the line with an immediate response to Canada’s early try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCanada were expected to start fast and it looked like it until they knocked on to set up the first scrum. Both finalists boast an impressive set-piece, but England ate them up in the first instance. Back and forth went possession, but a lost lineout allowed Canada to pounce and the first blood went the way of Asia Hogan-Rochester.England responded well and after winning penalty advantage, Kildunne danced and twisted to the line in another phenomenal solo effort. For the next period it was all about the hosts, though they fumbled two attacks as the showpiece continued to be closely fought. However, just as the catch and drive undid them in the 2022 final, it was responsible for their next try through Amy Cokayne.View image in fullscreenAlex Matthews crashes over for England’s third try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianTatyana Heard intercepted when Canada looked to be creating a promising attack and while Canada’s defensive set rendered plenty of penalties, they did prevent England from scoring. That was until Matthews, who won the World Cup in 2014, sniped when England went through phases after another impressive scrum.Canada were in desperate need of points, but despite continually knocking on the door, England’s defence was impressive, particularly through their captain, Zoe Aldcroft. Canada won a penalty with Sophie de Goede adding three points. At half-time the score stood at 21-8 after England had a try ruled out because of obstruction in the lineout.Livin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi was the soundtrack and “we’re halfway there” never felt more suitable for England’s supporters. Whoever scored first in the second 40 would land a psychological blow and the victor of that particular element were England through Abbie Ward.Quick GuideNew Zealand see off France to claim third in playoffShowThe New Zealand wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee ran in two tries as the Black Ferns finished third at the World Cup with a 42-26 victory over France in the playoff for bronze.The 18-year-old star Sorensen-McGee, the tournament's leading try scorer, produced her 10th and 11th  tries of this World Cup in a comfortable win at Twickenham for the deposed champions.New Zealand were taken apart 34-19 by Canada in the semi-finals and France faced the backlash, althoughLes Bleueshad their moments, especially in the second half.The Black Ferns had built a 26-7 lead by the interval with Ruahei Demant, Sylvia Brunt, Renee Holmes and Laura Bayfield crossing, rewarding their ambition in attack.France staged a fightback with Léa Champon, Gaby Vernier and Emilie Boulard going over, but Sorensen-McGee's finishing instincts ensured there was no danger of an upset.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With England’s prop Hannah Botterman receiving a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, Canada took advantage with Hogan-Rochester going in again.

It was 1990 and Michaels was working as a professional dancer. A colleague in Brooklyn needed a roommate and Michaels took her up on the offer, moving toNew YorkCity.Michaels’ career swiftly took off; she even landed an 18-month contract in Japan. “I worked with MC Hammer,” Michaels said, recalling that she also worked as a backup dancer in an Aretha Franklin video. “I was thriving.”But Michaels’ rapid ascent came to a halt after she metJeffrey Epstein.When Michaels returned from Tokyo, she learned her roommate had secured what seemed to be a plum gig. “She shared with me that she was working for this wealthy Wall Street guy that was training her in how to be a masseuse.”A few months later, Michaels’ roommate seemed willing to share in her good fortune. “She said she got a dance contract, and he needed a backup person, and was I interested?” said Michaels, who was 22. “I said yes.”The well-heeled client turned out to beEpstein, a convicted sex offender who in 2019 died in jail while awaiting trial for child sex-trafficking. Michaels went to his Madison Avenue office one day to meet him; one week later, she went to a “penthouse-looking place” for a trial massage.“That is when he raped me.”“I was confident, I was happy. I was successful in my career,” Michaels said of her life before Epstein. “It destroyed my career, destroyed relationships.”Michaels, who said she is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, also said that the attack “ripped off a scab, and just deteriorated my sense of self, my sense of self trust”.Michaels is now among the dozens of Epstein survivors who are advocating for the release of investigative files. WhileDonald Trumpinsisted on the campaign trail that he would release the files, his Department of Justice backtracked on disclosing these documents.In July, the department insisted that there was no Epstein client list and that they would not release any more documents. Trump has since been saddled withheadlineafterheadlineabout his relationship with Epstein.The department’s handling of these files drew renewed scrutiny recently duringKash Patel’s testimony before Congress. The FBI director claimed that the FBI was “releasing as much as legally allowed”.Patel also said there was no credible information that Epstein trafficked his victims to other men, but Thomas Massie referred to FBI reports that suggested otherwise. The Republican representative noted that victims of Epstein and accompliceGhislaine Maxwellidentified at least 20 other men to whom they were allegedly trafficked.Patel said that his statement about credibility wasn’t his claim, but the finding of three different US attorneys,per ABC News. “If there were, I’d bring the case yesterday that he trafficked to other individuals,” Patelsaid.Michaels was vexed by the seemingly contradictory positions – Patel invoked other administrations’ claims that broader trafficking allegations weren’t credible, but he has alsocondemnedpast administrations’ handling of Epstein.“I just thought: I’m so glad the American people are seeing why we are so frustrated,” Michaels said. “It was just plain as day that this is someone that is either completely inept at his job or covering up, and both of those things are problematic.”Michaels noted that Maria Farmer, who issuing the federal governmentover authorities’ handling of her claims against Epstein three decades ago, reported him to the FBI and police.“She was ignored,” Michaels said. “Systemically, throughout the last three decades, the very same thing has happened.”“Sitting and listening to Kash Patel, I mean the frustration that I heard from other survivors, from people on my social media, from other people that heard that, they’re like, ‘oh my goodness, this makes sense of why everyone is frustrated,’” she said. “The volume of negligence, the systemic failures are evident.”Michaels’ frustration over the files’ non-release has been coupled with validation, however. The American public, “on all sides” of the political spectrum, has seen first-hand what survivors have grappled with in calling for transparency, Michaels said.“I have family members, and I have friends, that are conservatives, and they equally believe this needs to just happen,” Michaels said. “The files need to be released to get to any clarity.”Michaels also alluded to claims that releasing the files could harminnocent menwhose names might just happen to appear in these documents.“If there is no credible evidence of trafficking, then why do you worry that there are men in these files that could be harmed?”“If that’s true, then there are no men that will be harmed by releasing the files,” she said. “There are no other people that will be harmed if [Epstein] just trafficked women to himself, as is the claim.”She noted that Virginia Giuffre, an Epstein victim who killed herself several months ago, was “very clear in that she had been trafficked to other men”. Michaels said that authorities are “completely ignoring” victim statements about Epstein’s trafficking.“I don’t think you can say there’s no credible evidence, while also saying we have to protect the men that are in the files. Because I don’t think you can put those two things into the same sentence,” she said.The Department of Justice did not reply to a request for comment. The FBI said it “does not have a comment”.Asked for comment, Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said: “Democrats and the media knew about Epstein and his victims for years and did nothing to help them while President Trump was calling for transparency, and is now delivering on it with thousands of pages of documents as part of the ongoing Oversight investigation.”Michaels has maintained some optimism that the truth will come out because the prevalence of sexual trauma crosses party lines. More than half of women, and nearly one third of men, have endured “sexual violence involving physical contact during their lifetimes”,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Do you know what I have faith in? It’s what I know about trauma and sexual assault as now an advocate,” she said. “There are Republican constituents and Republican representatives that have experienced sexual harm, and what I’m hoping, in my heart of hearts, is that they will see themselves in our story.”Michaels also hopes “that they will see themselves in the blatant coercion and manipulation of an evil man likeJeffrey Epsteinand an evil woman like Ghislaine Maxwell, and they will find it in their heart to, at the very least, seek the truth”.Explore more on these topicsJeffrey EpsteinNew YorkLaw (US)interviewsShareReuse this content"

He was found dead in his cell at Wakefield prison on Tuesday, 12 years after being jailed. The circumstances of his death have not yet been publicly confirmed.The Ukrainian national was 37. He was convicted at the Old Bailey in October 2013 of murdering Muslim man Mohammed Saleem, 82, in April of that year.Saleem was a pillar of the local community who was on his way home from evening prayers at the mosque when Lapshyn stabbed him three times in the back and stamped on his head.Keir Starmer to launch progressive fightback against ‘decline and division’ fuelled by far rightRead moreLapshyn later planted three bombs outside mosques in Walsall, Wolverhampton and Tipton. Along with Saleem’s murder, he was convicted of causing an explosion with intent to endanger life and of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts. He is not known to have expressed any remorse.A picture found on his computer by police had words and images relating to the murder, with a smiley face and the slogan “WHITE POWER”.Saleem’s daughter, Maz Saleem, the youngest of seven children, has said she forgives Lapshyn for taking her father’s life in such a brutal and horrific way. At a time where hatred and division are increasing hers is a rare voice calling for calm and healing.“In the early days after his murder, I wanted revenge,” she says. “I wanted the pain I felt to be felt by the man who killed him. Over time I realised that living in anger would consume me and give the far right even more power over my life.“I’ve recently come to a place of forgiveness as carrying hate in my heart doesn’t help. I’m a very empathetic person and I’m actually feeling for his parents at this time. Parents are parents, aren’t they, and his are very elderly.”She has spent years campaigning against racism andIslamophobiaand does not want the murder of her father to continue the cycle of hatred between people from different backgrounds.View image in fullscreenPavlo Lapshyn.Photograph: West Midlands Police/PA“I miss my father every day. Pavlo Lapshyn butchered him outside our house, where we used to walk five times a day, every day.“When I heard that he had died in prison, my first reaction was not joy but reflection. I have lived with the consequences of his actions for more than a decade. I have known anger so deep it kept me awake at night. But I have also spent these years deciding not to let hatred dictate my future.“For me, it’s time to forgive, because we need a world of unity. I wish him to rest in peace, and I am keeping his parents in my thoughts.”She was notified of Lapshyn’s death in a brief letter from the Ministry of Justice, stating: “I am writing to inform you that PL has died in custody. As a consequence the involvement of the victim liaison officer in this case has come to an end and our contact with you will cease.”The Prison Service said: “This was an abhorrent crime and our thoughts remain with Mr Saleem’s friends and family.”Maz emphasises that forgiving Lapshyn does not mean she condones what he did.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But I believe holding on to hatred serves no one. What Pavlo Lapshyn stood for – hatred, extremism and racism – is the opposite of everything our community believes in, and we must continue to stand for forgiveness, justice and peace. I refuse to allow hatred to poison my heart.”She is alarmed by the rise of anti-migrant and far-right campaigners: “The fact that we have 150,000 people marching on our streets holding these views is disturbing, very disturbing,” she says.“We are living in dangerous times. The murder of my father was not an isolated incident. Muslim women have been attacked on our streets, a Sikh woman was allegedly raped, a Bangladeshi boy was assaulted. The far right are emboldened.“Britain must take far-right violence as seriously as any other form of terrorism. That means protecting places of worship, resourcing counter-extremism programmes, educating young people, holding those who spread hate to account, and supporting victims’ families beyond the first weeks of tragedy.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Saleem. ‘More than 6,000 people came to his funeral because he had spent his life serving others.’Photograph: PAShe says her much-loved father, who came to the UK in 1957, settled in theWest Midlands, working first at a steelworks and then in a bakery, always told her that “education is key, knowledge is power”, and encouraged her to stand up for what is right.“More than 6,000 people came to his funeral because he had spent his life serving others – guiding young people away from crime, encouraging girls to pursue education, and bringing neighbours together.”She says her decision to forgive Lapshyn has been greeted largely positively.“I have received overwhelming support and solidarity. Women have reached out to thank me, saying this is the lesson racists need to hear. To those who celebrate anyone’s death, I say: I understand the pain and anger, but we must not become what we despise.“My father’s story is not just a chapter in the history of far-right terror – it is a warning. His legacy must be more than grief. It must be a call to confront hate, build solidarity, and create a future where no one is targeted for how they look, how they worship, or where they come from.

But now, my motto is: ‘My alone feels so good, I’ll only have you if your presence is sweeter than my solitude.’”Many of the responses were surprisingly similar. The most frequently listed qualities women said they were looking for in a partner were kindness and emotional intelligence, mental and physical health, shared values, ambition and being “hardworking”, financial stability, masculinity and maturity, and a willingness to commit to an equal, monogamous relationship as well as, in many cases, having a family.‘People say I come across as incredibly boring!’ How to find love on the dating apps – whatever the obstaclesRead moreOne of the phrases respondents used the most was that they were looking for a partner capable of “adding to” or “enhancing” their life – as in, someone who was entirely self-sufficient and capable of adding romance, children or a unique intellectual connection to their lives. A large number of women complained about past suitors who had been “lacking effort” or “unable to keep up”.A lot of men seem to actively make life for women worse instead of betterBabet, 32,a beautician from New York City, echoed hundreds of other respondents across ages and socioeconomic backgrounds.“I would love to have a partner, but it seems like the men are super low effort,” she said. “Not responding ondatingapps, not effectively communicating, not wanting to plan dates. A lot of men seem toactively make life for women worseinstead of better … No matter what women say they look for in a relationship, it is completely ignored by men.”Kellie, 43, from Georgia, joined the substantial number of respondents who felt that social media narratives had made dating toxic and pitted men against women.“I wish I could have met my person before the stupid gender wars, social media andred pill rhetoricthat has ruined people’s view of dating and marriage,” she said.Scores of women said that nobody available they had encountered met what they considered “basic requirements”.“I’m looking for a man who …has goals and ambition, is intelligent, trustworthy, a provider, supportive, considerate, kind, assertive, masculine, honest, faithful, intentional, has a healthy self-esteem and a sense of humour, loves to go out, and likes fitness. These basic qualities are hard to find these days,” she said.Although many women said theyfound being single “lonely”, they also typically said that they would not consider anyone who did not tick these or similar boxes.View image in fullscreenKatie, 37, is choosing to not date for the time being despite wanting a partner.Katie, 37, a biotechnology product manager from Wisconsin, said she had felt unable to look for a new partner since herlast breakup in 2021.A partner should ideally have “a robust social life, a focus on holistic health, compassionate and forthright communication skills, and functional independence”, she said.“I’m happy to compromise on things. The bar is extremely low, and yet it’s rarely cleared.”Hundreds reported struggling to find a partner with shared values, political views and interests, and a similar education level, with many pointing to a deepening mismatch between men and women in these areas.Danielle, 29,a public relations professional from Tennessee, said her future partner would need to be “kind, thoughtful, emotionally available, considerate, reliable, and responsible”, but also “college educated”.“I’m very disheartened by the shortage of quality men,” she added. “Men my age are less educated, their social skills are abysmal, and now they’re running into the arms of Trump and ‘incel’ forums.”Many men don’t want to date someone who’s more educated or makes more money than themLaura, in her 40s, from San Francisco, said she had beensingle for the better part of a decade since her divorce despite having used many dating apps and having attended been dozens of single events.“There’s an imbalance between education levels now in the US. Many men don’t want to date someone who’s more educatedor makes more money than them. There’s also the Peter Pan syndrome: a lot of men here don’t seem to want to grow up and take on the responsibilities of adulthood or a committed partnership,” she said.Although almost all women who were looking for a partner did not cite standout levels of professional or financial success as a priority, financial self-sufficiency was crucial for many. Various women stressed that they were searching for a socioeconomic equal.View image in fullscreenKelly Wallace, from Portland, would only consider a partner on her income level and with a similar lifestyle.Kelly Wallace, 48, a consultant from Portland, said: “I’m a self-employed high earner. I’m working on a memoir, own rental property and have struggled with finding someone who is like me: creative and high earning. I don’t drink or smoke and I don’t want a partner who does either.”While most women elaborated on their experience of being single in a social sense, some explained why they were legally single despite wanting to be married to their current partner.Susan, 40, a social worker from Ohio, said that her long-term boyfriend’s economic situation had become a permanent obstacle for marriage.It feels like taking on a partner would be like taking on another job“He wants to be working full-time with a decent wage before getting married and having a family. He hasn’t [managed that], so we haven’t moved to the next step. I’m still hoping marriage will happen, but have mostly given up on anything changing.“The idea of breaking up and trying to find someone else seems pretty hopeless at this age, so I’ve basically resigned myself to never having kids.”Some respondents reported feeling so disheartened by the world of dating that they had given up actively looking for a partner despite still wanting one, among them Raina, a 41-year-old doctor from Washington state.View image in fullscreenRaina, a doctor, is “devastated” about being single but has stopped actively looking for a partner.“My experience on dating apps over the last few years has been dismal,” she said.Like many others, Raina cited men who had not actively “worked” on their mental health as a main hurdle in her search for a partner.“I find most men my age have a lot of baggage and they’re not actively working to process their traumas,” she said. “It feels like taking on a partner would be like taking on another job – someone to care for physically and emotionally – when men can’t seem to offer the same to me in return.”She felt “devastated” about being single “most of the time”, she added, and felt, like dozens of other women, that she was being punished for her professional and emotional progress.The ‘biological clock’ thing weighs heavily on my mind“I feel like my career and ambition have diminished my dating pool,” she said.Kristina, 32, a mental health therapist from Chicago,said she had withdrawn from active dating after she had been dumped by someone who did not want to commit.Although Kristina reported feeling overall very happy being single, she did have concerns about her ability to have children.“Women are freer than ever to make their own lives outside of the confines of romantic relationships, but the ‘biological clock’ thing weighs heavily on my mind.”View image in fullscreenChristal Sharp, 39, says she finds it ‘peaceful’ to focus on herself, her career and her children instead of on a new partner.Christal Sharp, 39, a self-employed art teacher and wedding photographer from Oregon, was among many women who said drinking, drug use and other addictions among men, especially to porn, were a major factor in why they could not find a worthy partner.“I tried internet dating after my divorce and … I only met men who were emotionally immature, wanted [someone] to take care of them or had major addictions to drugs, alcohol, gambling, video gaming and porn. Most guys were just looking for a woman to sleep with, not grow with.”I let go of the notion that a long-term relationship is an accomplishment I must fulfil to be successfulWhile many respondents said they would like to have a partner, others prioritised their careers, families and personal interests. In many such cases, the financial independence these women enjoyed appeared to substantially contribute to this mindset.“I am 35, a homeowner, have a decent income and one older child,” said Lauryn, from Connecticut.Although she would love to meet “someone hardworking, honest and loyal”, she was “very comfortable being alone”, she said.View image in fullscreenRandi, from Chicago, would rather approach motherhood solo than waste time on the dating scene.Randi, 33, a government policy analyst from Chicago, said she had stopped dating entirely.“I’m not looking for a partner because … it’s not that important to me,” she said. “I let go of the notion that a long-term relationship is an accomplishment I must fulfil to be successful.“I can afford my living expenses while saving for retirement. I have considered becoming a single mother via fostering or adoption. I’d rather commit to raising a child alone than go through the efforts of dating and finding a suitable partner.”My time is my own, my money is my own, my home is my own – I feel free and contentWhile some women reported feeling happy that they could afford being single thanks to their decent incomes, others said that the financial cost of being single was the main drawback of not settling down with a partner.Take good pictures and embrace the apps: how to start datingRead more“I find dating to be more trouble than it’s worth. The one thing is that being single is very expensive,” said Nicole, 42,a high school teacher from Portland, Oregon. “The US seems designed for couples and families. Rent keeps going up, other costs are as well. It would just be nice to share the burdens with another person.”Various respondents made clear that they had no intentions to couple up.“I’m single by choice because dating nowadays is a waste of time,” said Valerie Gregorio, a 27-year-old from Maryland.“I’m not looking for anyone, I value my freedom and independence too much. I still live with my family because everything is too expensive and I want to save as much money as possible, especially since I’m not making six figures currently.“I’m ready to accept being single for the rest of my life.”Explore more on these topicsDatingWomenfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For many, the morning-after ritual still involves a steaming bowl ofhaejangguk, or “hangover soup”.Often made with napa cabbage, dried pollack or even congealed oxblood, it’s a comfort food as much as a cure, with specialist restaurants opening early for bleary-eyed regulars.More recently, though, the cure has gone commercial. Walk into any convenience store and you’ll find entire sections dedicated to hangover remedies, from traditional drinks to trendy jelly sticks and tablets designed to ward off the suffering.View image in fullscreenHaejangguk – or Hangover soup - eaten as a hangover cure in Korean cuisine.Photograph: Woohyeok Choi/AlamyMost contain extracts of hovenia dulcis, though some use other ingredients said to help, including red ginseng, milk thistle or even seaweed.The country’s hangover cure market reached approximately 350bn won (£190m) in 2024, according to NielsenIQ Korea, up 10% from the year before.Despite the market’s growth, South Koreans areactually drinking less, with per-capita alcohol consumption falling steadily since 2015 and post-pandemic shipments of beer and spirits still below 2019 levels.Analysts link the shift to a combination of factors, from companies cutting back on mandatory after-work boozy sessions to a health-conscious younger generation favouring moderation over binge drinking.Prof Joo Young-ha, a cultural anthropologist at the Academy of Korean Studies who specialises in food culture, says the appeal of hangover products for younger drinkers is as much social as practical.“They often buy multiple products in advance to share as gifts during drinking sessions, turning hangover prevention into part of the evening’s etiquette,” he says.Taeyoung Hwang, an analyst at market research firm Mintel, says that while hangover recovery products remain niche markets globally, South Korea and Japan represent exceptions.“They have mature and widely adopted hangover recovery product industries deeply tied to their respective drinking cultures,” Hwang says.According to Mintel’s analysis, South Korea has launched the most hangover products globally in the past five years. Many have become “indispensable daily consumer goods”, with the so-calledKorean Waveenabling international expansion.“The global popularity of Korean culture, including K-pop and K-food, is fuelling interest and driving demand for Korean hangover recovery drinks in markets like south-east Asia and beyond,” Hwang says.Hovenia dulcis is often promoted as an age-old Korean remedy. Many articles claim that it features prominently in traditional medicine, but experts say this is often overstated.View image in fullscreenAbove: Gil Sa-hyeon outside his traditional medicine shop, Joseon Yakcho, in Seoul’s Yangnyeongsi Market.Right: Gil Sa-hyeon holds hovenia dulcis, known as oriental raisin, a key ingredient in hangover remedies.Photograph: Raphael RashidView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Raphael RashidWhile hovenia dulcis appears in classical Chinese medical texts – which historically influenced Korean medical scholarship – it was incorporated into Korean medical literature in later centuries and only recently became a commercial phenomenon, part of a broader movement to retroactively attribute traditional health benefits to modern products.“Interest in hovenia dulcis for hangover relief only began in the early 1990s, starting with Japanese patents, then Korean scientific research followed,” says Dr Choi Goya from the Korea Institute of Oriental MedicineTesting the claimsStudies in South Korea have examined various parts of hovenia dulcis for potential detoxifying effects, though evidence remains largely limited to animal research.In laboratory settings, researchers found fruit extracts of hovenia dulcis reduced blood alcohol concentration in rats, and fermented fruit vinegar reduced levels of both alcohol and acetaldehyde – the toxic compound produced when the body breaks down alcohol.Scientific literature has also found that the plant increased activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, an enzyme that breaks down alcohol, and may protect the liver from alcohol-related damage.However, the body of research has major limitations, including studies of different plant parts, a lack of high-quality human clinical trials, and inconsistent quality standards.Medical researchers remain broadly sceptical about hangover remedies, though a King’s College Londonsystematic reviewfoundhovenia dulcis fruit extract among several substances showing statistically significant results in human trials, albeit with very low-quality evidence.View image in fullscreenBags of dried herbs and botanicals outside Joseon Yakcho, a traditional medicine shop in Seoul’s Yangnyeongsi Market.Photograph: Raphael RashidUntil recently, Korean companies could make hangover cure claims without needing proof, which prompted local regulators to crack down on the industry.In January 2025,new rulesrequired companies toconduct human trialsshowing measurable improvements in things like hangover symptoms and blood alcohol clearance.Companies that failed to do so have until October to provide new evidence or face a ban on hangover-related marketing claims entirely.For many, though, hangover remedies are perhaps less about scientific certainty and more about comfort, routine, and the shared culture of drinking.Lee So-young, a 26-year-old office worker, has been buying hangover products since university.“I don’t know if they really work,” she says. “But they’re cheap, and sometimes I do actually feel better. That’s good enough for me.”Explore more on these topicsSouth KoreaHangover curesAlcoholfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But 251 years, eight unbroken generations and many Johanns, Johanneses, Carls and Karls later, the company that emerged from that first family business has become one of the most rampagingly successful footwear brands on the planet.Birkenstock now sells tens of millions of pairs of shoes every year (they won’t say how many), giving the company a valuation of $7.5bn (£5.6bn) when itfloatedon the New York Stock Exchange in 2023. It has been a fashion and high street success storyfor decades, yet still seems to boast gravity-defying growthyearafteryear; this weekit announcedprojected growth of 17.5% on last year.View image in fullscreenBirkenstock is a ‘purpose brand that’s rooted in orthopaedics’.Photograph: BirkenstockSteve Jobswore them in the 1970s, as did Kate Moss in her breakthrough 1990shoot for the Face. They rose in the boho chic years,soaredduring Covid and were even givenan extra bounceby theBarbie movie. The current big seller, theBoston clog, was hailed byBritish Voguein April as the “shoe that has the fashion crowd in a chokehold” – yet in 2026 the Boston will mark 50 years, entirely unchanged, since it was first introduced.How did a brand described even by some of its fans as the world’s ugliest shoe become one of the world’s most popular? Not by leaning into trends. “Fashion has never been our thing – neither then nor now,” the company’s CEO, Oliver Reichert, said recently, a bold choice of words from a man leading a global style brand. Instead, in perhaps the least sexy phrase ever uttered in fashion marketing, he said Birkenstock was a “purpose brand that’s rooted in orthopaedics”, which since its foundation had had an “unquenchable interest in foot health”.View image in fullscreenEsther Addley with rolled leather at the Birkenstock factory in Bernstadt, Germany.Photograph: Daniel WoellerThis anti-fashion approach has long been part of the company’s shtick. It was Konrad Birkenstock, great-grandson of Johann Adam, who first introduced an orthopaedic shoe last in 1897, making waves by his bold suggestion that right and left feet should be shaped differently.Carl, his son, insisted that shoe retailers complete a training course before they were even allowed to stock the product; when Carl’s son Karl (told you …) launched the Original Birkenstock Footbed Sandal at Düsseldorf shoe fair in 1963, he got a wave of ridicule and not a single order. RenamedMadrid, that same single strap model remains one of the company’s core products.“We always start from the consumer and the benefit our products bring to their lives,” Nico Bouyakhf, the company’s president and managing director forEurope, the Middle East and Asia, said. “Our goal is to deliver the best possible experience with our unique footbed, rather than chasing short-term trends.”View image in fullscreenModels in Hamburg wear the Arizona, right, and the Boston clog, a current bestseller.Photograph: Jeremy Moeller/GettyUltimately, says J’Nae Phillips, a trend forecaster and creator of theFashion Tingznewsletter, it was precisely this fixation on function that has made Birkenstock a “kind of fashion paradox: a shoe so unconcerned with style that it has become a style statement. Their ‘anti-fashion’ aesthetic taps into a deeper cultural moment where authenticity and utility are often prized over overt trendiness. In a world that cycles rapidly through fast fashion, Birkenstocks offer a stable, grounded alternative.”Dr Anastasia Kārkliņa Gabriel, a cultural critic and author of Cultural Intelligence for Marketers, points to the brand’s popularity in the 1970s US counterculture as a turning point. “Birkenstock was a rebellion against mainstream American footwear. Once it was adopted by the hippies, it took on a new layer of meanings associated with spiritual freedom and a more conscious way of living.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Workers scan sheets of coloured leather by eye before carefully placing cutters where the hide has no defects. Even the glue that will fix the leather pieces to the sole is wiped on by hand using a tool that looks a bit like a shaving brush.View image in fullscreenThe shoes are trimmed, stamped, shaped, buckled and boxed by humans (Birkenstock boasts that 50 hands make each pair).Photograph: Daniel WoellerThe shoes are trimmed, stamped, shaped, buckled and boxed by humans (the company boasts that50 hands make each pair), which makes for shoes that are pleasingly artisanal – and expensive. Having set the model for the lazy summer sandal, the brand is dogged by fake and copycat products, andfailed earlier this yearin a legal attempt to copyright its products as works of art.Don’t bet on that German court case holding Birkenstock back. The company now has aluxury line, called 1774, and aprofessional lineaimed at workers, and continues withhigh-enddesignercollaborationsand non-sandal launches, such as this month’sUtti Laceshoe.

There wasn’t a big circus or acrobatics community where I grew up, so it felt exciting to be surrounded by 23 other teenagers who shared the same passion.I was 17, the youngest of our year, and my allocated buddy was Cal. He was a year older, full of energy and had a way of making everyone laugh. We clicked instantly, and we took the rules of being a buddy very seriously – including giving each other a muffin if one of us was injured. We both ate a lot of muffins that year.The moment I knew: he took me to the crematorium to ‘meet his mum’. It was so personal and lovingRead moreWe also balanced each other out. He specialised in teeterboard and balance ladder, and I perform with hula hoops. Cal has a larger-than-life personality, while I am quieter. His brain always seemed to have a million tabs open, whereas mine works quite differently.Circus school was very social. On weekends the whole group went to movies or parties, but slowly and subtly Cal and I drifted into spending more time together. We became flirty friends. Even though there was tension between us, we didn’t rush into anything because we knew we’d be working side by side for years and we didn’t want to complicate things.View image in fullscreenChelsea and Cal in Paris in October 2013In our second year, our flirty friendship turned into something more. During a study tour in Paris, Cal told me he loved me. It wasn’t under the Eiffel Tower like he’d planned, but it was still very special. After that, we became girlfriend and boyfriend, but it wasn’t long before our schedules were going to change and time together wasn’t guaranteed.In 2015, Cal’s company took him to the UK for a few months. I had my first contract in Germany, and when doing long distance wasn’t sustainable, we decided to end things. It was hard, but it felt like the right choice at the time.The following year, I was given a break from touring and I booked a trip to London to see some Australian friends living there. I knew Cal would be there too, and when we saw each other again, it was like no time had passed at all. He asked if I wanted to give things another go, and I didn’t hesitate.That summer, his company was performing in the circus and theatre section at Glastonbury. I put my hand up to volunteer with the team so I could be there too.View image in fullscreenChelsea and Cal at Glastonbury in June 2016Adele was the headliner, and I was a fan. But I wasn’t familiar with Make You Feel My Love. When she started singing that song, I started crying. It felt as though the lyrics – “I’ve known it from the moment that we met. No doubt in my mind where you belong” – were speaking directly to us. There was no doubt in my mind that we should be together. After the show, I told Cal how I felt, and we agreed to make it work, no matter the challenges.For the next few years we toured almost constantly, often in different countries, but we made the effort to see each other whenever possible. In 2017 we created a cabaret show so we could finally tour together.When Covid halted touring, we lived at Cal’s sister’s place in the Blue Mountains, helping with her kids while she worked. It was the first time in years we weren’t travelling, and it gave us a chance to enjoy everyday life together. It was nice to set up a space that was our own, and not live out of a suitcase for a while. When restrictions were lifted, we eventually settled down in Queensland.View image in fullscreenCal and Chelsea back in Paris again, this time in May 2022We’ve since built a shipping container home on my parents’ property, with a sauna, ice bath and Jacuzzi. It feels like a little place we can retreat to between tours. These days, we spend most of the year together.On stage, Cal is always my biggest supporter – I can hear his laugh across the room. When he hears my music cue, he cheers and calls out “that’s my girlfriend”.Sometimes he’ll surprise me with a muffin, just like when we first met. It reminds me how far we’ve come, and how much we still lift each other up.Chelsea is performing inLash Outat the Sydney fringe festival from 23 September to 12 October.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Most supermarket coffee disappoints: often stale and over-roasted, and with unpleasant notes of rubber and burnt ash. That said, as someone who prefers a lighter roast coffee (that is, bright, fruity and acidic), I was pleasantly surprised by some of the brands I found among all the dark-roasted offerings that dominate our supermarket shelves.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I focused on fresh coffee that’s sold ready-ground for general use in cafetières, filters ormoka pots(depending on the grind size, some leaned better towards one method than another, which I’ve noted where necessary). Ideally, however, coffee should be freshly ground for purpose, with a fine, sandy grind for moka pots, and a coarse, gritty one for filters and cafetières. I judged each coffee on flavour, provenance, sustainability and value, while bearing in mind that its quality depends on every stage of the production process, from growing and selection to fermentation, drying, roasting and storage. Coffee also carries a huge social and environmental weight, which makes certifications such as Fairtrade and organic, as well as independent social and ecological initiatives, so important.The best coffee machines for your home: your morning brew made easy, according to our expertRead moreThe results were mixed. Some coffees were predictably dreadful, but others were surprisingly good value. One key finding stood out, however: the most expensive supermarket products rarely justify their price.Coffee is something of an art, so I brought in a professional to help guide my tasting. Will Whiting, founder ofCalm Coffee Roasteryin Peckham, south London, welcomed me to his space where two tables were carefully laid out for a cupping session (cupping is the global standard for assessing coffee quality). We measured 12g of each sample into individual bowls, noted the dry aromas, then filled the bowls to the brim with hot water. After four minutes, we broke the crust of grounds with spoons, and inhaled the aroma as the gases released. We then skimmed off any remaining grounds and let the brews rest and sit for 10 minutes before tasting from spoons, which spread the coffee instantly across the tongue, revealing its flavour in a burst. We then took notes on the acidity, body and nuanced flavour.What did we discover? The bottom-shelf coffees are as bad as we’d expected: harsh, bitter and good for nothing more than a morning caffeine kick. But there were surprises, too. Perhaps the biggest lesson was that the most expensive supermarket coffees – often priced on a par with coffee from top micro-roasteries – just don’t deliver. If you want truly exceptional coffee, skip the supermarket’s so-called premium bags and order online from independent roasters who provide small-batch beans of good provenance, named varietals traceable to individual farms and, crucially, clear roasting dates, which helps ensure a coffee’s freshness.The best supermarket coffeeBest all-rounder:Blue Turaco ground coffee 100% specialty Ugandan robustaView image in fullscreen£6.25 for 227g at Waitrose (£2.75/100g)£8.99 for 227g at Amazon (£3.96/100g)★★★★☆This farmer-owned lighter roast surprises the palate with malty, caramel notes, smooth body and a bright hazelnut finish.

Donald Trump signalled his support for shooting down Russian jets.The febrile geopolitical climate was then made even more tense after a spate of unmanned aerial vehicle forays over Danish airports that forced the country’s largest, in Copenhagen, to close. It followed recent Russian drone incursions into Poland and Romania. “We are at the beginning of a hybrid war againstEurope,” said Mette Frederiksen, Denmark’s prime minister, in an address to the nation.It might be thought, then, that there would be loud acclaim for a military presence in Narva, separated from Russia by a 101-metre-wide river, traversed by a “Bridge of Friendship” on which the Estonians have built a line of 3ft concrete dragons’ teeth and are constructing a heavy security gate.But Narva, closer to St Petersburg than the Estonian capital, Tallinn, is complex: 98% of its population is primarily Russian speaking and, while not a homogenous group, international news can be perceived quite differently here, as it is in other such communities in Latvia and Lithuania.View image in fullscreenThe view from Narva looking across to Russia.Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The GuardianFor some it is consumed through the prism of Russian TV, banned in Estonia but easily accessible at this proximity to the country. The Kremlin has denied the breach of Estonian airspace ever happened – the “Nazis” in Tallinn, 210km west of Narva, were doing what the “global war party” does.Others in Narva see such claims on Russia’s TV stations as fake news but worry about poking the Russian bear. Estonian troops are welcome perhaps, they say, but not foreign Nato soldiers.The candidates in the TV debate generally accepted that the military base was a done deal but criticised the communication of it, saying it had sparked concerns within the city of 53,000 people rather than a sense of assurance.The Russian incursion into Estonian airspace and its suspected involvement in the drone attacks has certainly been a test of Nato – but it is something more.The reactions of the Baltic states and their allies to provocations are proving a test in themselves to the resilience and the unity of countries that remain home to large Russian-speaking communities.Local elections are coming up in Estonia in October and it is shot through with risk, said Katri Raik, a former national interior minister, who is the mayor of Narva and in the race for a fourth term.Nato intercepts Russian fighter jets on ‘reckless’ violation of Estonian airspaceRead moreA socially and economically disadvantaged city where the phasing out of the oil shale mines has hit hard, Narva was largely ignored for decades by Tallinn and that was fine by the residents, who thought of it as something of an island, she suggested. But in recent years, the state has become “really close”, said Raik.Following Russia’s invasion ofUkraine, the Estonian government ordered the removal of up to 400 Soviet monuments that they argued commemorated not the liberation of the country but its occupation from 1945.View image in fullscreenKatri Raik: ‘We might be surprised that we are even alive as a city, for our mental health.’Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The GuardianThe most controversial was a Soviet-era tank from its pedestal on the outskirts of Narva. It caused an uproar. Raik, who is among the 2% of the population who speak Estonian as a first language, received death threats when she sought to be a mediator between the government and local people.Then, at a time when the cost of heating has tripled in two years, the closing of the Bridge of Friendship to vehicles and freight, leaving only pedestrian access to the Russian border town of Ivangorod, has been an economic blow. It was the Russians who closed it first but the extra checks enforced by the Estonians on those going by foot is being blamed for the long queues.More recently, there have been claims that Tallinn is repressing religious freedom through its attempt to split the Russian Orthodox church in Estonia from the Moscow patriarchate, which manages it and is seen as being in cahoots with the Kremlin.There was also the passing of a law that phases out the existence of Russian-speaking schools by 2030, causing people to complain that their children were being educated in a language they did not use at home.“And the cherry on top,” said Raik, has been the ban on non-EU citizens, including Russians and Belarusians living in Estonia, from voting in local elections.Russia’s high-risk game in Nato skies – podcastRead more“A third of people [in Narva] will not be able to go to vote,” she said. All of this has been magnified and twisted by Russian propaganda. “When it is all together then we might be surprised that we are even alive as a city, for our mental health,” said Raik. “It is really a little bit too much altogether … It’s a big chance for the populists.” The people deprived of voting rights, they have sisters, they have husbands, who can vote, she said.Maria Smorževskihh-Smirnova, the director of Estonia’s Narva museum, was caught up in such a cycle of action, reaction and counteraction. This week she was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in a Russian general-regime penal colony.Her crime was putting up a large poster on the outer wall of her museum – a castle on the river by the Friendship bridge – that accused Vladimir Putin of being a war criminal and making comparisons between him and Adolf Hitler.The target of her message was those who gathered at the Russian side on 9 May to celebrate Victory Day and the end of the second world war on a newly built square, just below the ramparts of their own castle across the river.There the Russians put up large screens facing in the direction of Narva showing images of Putin or war movies. “It’s about brutal Russian power,” said Smorževskihh-Smirnova. “It’s about the cult of death, about the cult of war, and about the glorification of [the] Ukrainian invasion.”For her “very small” protest, she was subject to a torrid barrage of hate on social media. Messages included “I will kill you, I know where you walk, I know where you live”, she said. “But we will be just silent or just ignored? No.”It is the sort of emotional response that Egert Belitsev, the director general of the Estonian border force, does not countenance. The Russian provocations are endless in Narva, he said.Surveillance blimps appear in the sky, asylum seekers surreptitiously followed by Russian border guards with video cameras have been steered over the bridge (and then pushed back by the Estonian guards), GPS signals have been jammed, crippling search and rescue operations, and buoys in the river demarcating the border have been removed.“It’s something in order to cause some mess, to see how we react,” he said. “How far are we willing to go? What are we able to do?”View image in fullscreenEgert Belitsev, the director general of the Estonian border force.Photograph: Hendrik Osula/The GuardianEach reaction by the Estonian authorities is portrayed by Kremlin propagandists as militaristic, belligerent and an attack on the rights of the Russian-speaking people in Narva. This despite Putin suggesting in 2022 that it would be justifiable to “take back and secure” Narva for Russia.Talk of the appearance among the brutalist Soviet-style blocks in Narva of “little green men”, the colloquial term for unmarked Russian soldiers, are roundly said to be far-fetched but it does not need to go that far to be damaging.Igor Taro, Estonia’s interior minister, a former journalist, is in charge of carefully calibrating government policy. He makes regular visits to the city a priority; indeed the country’s prime minister, Kristen Michal, was in Narva opening Europe’s largest rare-earth magnet factory when he received news of the Russian jets’ breach of the airspace.Each of the government’s contentious policies, Taro insisted, had an explanation. The Russian-language schools were driving segregation. The symbols of occupation needed to be removed. The opportunity of citizens of an aggressor state to vote in Estonian elections was no longer appropriate or safe. But he is not blind to the dangers.“We were in a kind of situation where it was hard not to react, to do these decisions,” he said.The Estonian security services keep a watchful eye on Narva, he said. On Thursday, a Narva citizen was convicted of spying for the FSB, the Russian security service, since 2017, and seeking to sow discord.“He was just a regular working guy, but very social, communicating with lots of different people, and could gather quite different information,” said Taro.The Estonian government learned from the experience in Ukraine, he said, where political activists emerged in Donetsk and Luhansk in the east, and ultimately spearheaded break-away republics.“That’s what we are trying to avoid here,” he said. “They are trying to do it. They’re trying to prepare the soil, in information warfare and in all the kinds of domains, but we have the measures to cut them off.”He added: “We have been training for all other possibilities with this bridge”.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

And finally, for England’s women, it is now. The last time the Red Roses lifted the World Cup was 11 years ago and defeat on home turf in front of a world-record 81,885 crowd would have been beyond devastating. Hence the tears of relief and shared collective joy at the final whistle as they finally brought the big one home.Among other things this trophy has brought them the validation they dearly wanted and, in truth, needed. Since the introduction of full-time professional contracts in 2019, the Red Roses have won 74 of the 76 matches they have contested. The number of registered female participants in Canadian rugby would barely fill half of England’s towering citadel.England outclass Canada to capture glorious Women’s Rugby World Cup triumphRead moreThis was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the hosts simply could not afford to squander and their pack, in particular, enthusiasticallygrabbed it with both hands.So roll on the celebration after-party at Battersea power station on Sunday afternoon, the latest air-punching moment in this special summer of women’s sport. When it mattered England delivered by some distance their most convincing 80-minute performance and all the angst of past failures melted away. English rugby has spent years hailing the boys of 2003 and they now have some fresher-faced, modern-day competition.And what a memorable day it was all round. Inclusive, happy audiences, a feelgood vibe ... this tournament genuinely does seem to have captured the public imagination. Out on the concourses there were significantly more young children and teenage girls than normal. And, perhaps most noticeably of all, an awful lot more hair than Twickenham crowds usually possess. Gone were the waxed jackets and bald heads of middle England, replaced by cowgirl hats and ponytails. Goodbye, Barbour; hello, Barbie.View image in fullscreenEngland’s Ellie Kildunne in full flow for her try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianYou could tell it was a full-fat Twickenham occasion hours earlier because the matchday traffic was suitably appalling. But the novelty value more than made up for such minor inconveniences. Sophie Lloyd and her electric guitar ripped it up before kick-off, the now-familiar strains of Livin’ on a Prayer were dialled up to 11 and the pre-game noise levels were up there with anything this venue has recently known.Even the celebs wanted a piece of it all. Justin “Red” Rose sent a message from the Ryder Cup, the Lioness Lucy Bronze was in the crowd and royal best wishes arrived from the palace. Shania Twain, sadly, had a prior engagement and couldn’t make it but, most important of all, Canada turned up big-time out on the field. When they scored the afternoon’s first try through Asia Hogan-Rochester, the same thought flashed through the mind of every English fan. They couldn’t, could they?Hats, high fives and mauls: Women’s Rugby World Cup 2025 – a picture essayRead moreIt was just as well that England had their shaggy-haired secret weapon lying in wait. If any further proof were required, after her brace of semi-final tries, Ellie Kildunne has rocket boosters in her specially designed white boots and four or five would-be tacklers were left in her wake as she swerved and surged away to register a quite brilliant individual score. “Kildunne and dusted” read a handwritten sign in the crowd but it was still way too early to relax.View image in fullscreenMany England fans had banners inside Twickenham, a refreshing change from the men’s Barbour brigade.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianUnfortunately for Canada, it was also only half the story. While individual brilliance catches the eye, collective power is even harder to counter. England’s secondary shove in the scrums gave their opponents due warning from the outset and when they did make it into the Canada 22 their maul was its usual formidable weapon. The hungry caterpillar rarely lets England down and made the difference again here.Canada could have enlisted every strapping lumberjack in British Columbia and still wouldn’t have stopped the inevitable rumbles that laid the platform for England’s second and third tries and, later on, the two crucial second-half scrum penalties that snuffed out Canada’s comeback. Every time the physical effort took a little bit more out of the legs of Canada’s forwards and made it that little bit harder for them to gallop freely elsewhere.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When England start tiring they have the luxury of bringing on their own Bomb Squad equivalent who could just as easily start. What they occasionally lack in subtlety they more than atone for in terms of close-quarter effectiveness. John Mitchell, the head coach, and his forwards lieutenant, Louis Deacon, have not spent the last three years idly making daisy-chains.The Red Roses’ ability to slow down Canada’s ruck ball was another crucial element. The ruck speed thatblew New Zealand awayin the semi-final was still there in patches but, at other times, there would be Hannah Botterman or Zoe Aldcroft to swoop and kill Canadian momentum at crucial moments. The player of the match, Sadia Kabeya, and Alex Matthews put their bodies on the line constantly and, defensively, it was telling when Canada, at 21-5 down, opted to kick a penalty rather than hurl themselves once more at the white barricade in front of them.View image in fullscreenRosie Galligan of England claims the lineout in the last play of the match, which was played in front of a world record attendance of 81,885.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianBack on at half-time, predictably, came Bon Jovi’s tantalising message – “We’re half-way the-re!” – but surely it would now take Shania, Justin Bieber, Michael Bublé and Rush in their collective heydays to change the contest’s prevailing tune? Particularly when Abbie Ward drive ferociously low and hard for her side’s fourth, reinforcing her reputation as the toughest mother in the land.Canada’s gallant mini-fightback, in the circumstances, was even more praiseworthy. For this World Cup they have had to launch a million-dollar crowd-funding drive, supported by among others the Canadian band the Tragically Hip. By the time the next tournament comes around in Australia in 2029, you can only hope that more women’s teams are better funded and more sides are in a position to challenge England’s supreme queens.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Rugby World Cup 2025England women's rugby union teamCanada women's rugby union teamRugby unionWomen's rugby unionanalysisShareReuse this content"

Never in his wildest of dreams couldLuke Donaldhave imagined this scenario for his imperious European team. They will head into the final day of the Ryder Cup leading 11½–4½ and requiring a mere two and a half more points from 12 singles contests for retention. The fat lady is gargling.There will be analysis – and plenty of it – about American capitulation under the erratic leadership of Keegan Bradley but the scale of what they have run into must also be recognised. Tommy Fleetwood has won within half a point of the US tally on his own. Perhaps Bradley should deploy pairs of golfers again for day three. The Europeans have already made history, courtesy of their largest ever pre-singles lead.PGA silent after Ryder Cup MC leads foul-mouthed chants abusing Rory McIlroyRead moreEurope have therefore enjoyed the last laugh over American galleries who have let themselves and this sport down.Thuggish, moronic and personal insultstowards Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry especially dominated Saturday at Bethpage Black. Yet as Europe led their hosts the merriest of dances, thousands of punters streamed towards the exit gates. Resale prices for Sunday tickets, which were $750 (£560) to begin with, have crashed online.“The job is never done till it’s done,” said a typically pragmatic Donald. “So I’m not going to sit here and be complacent. I know how strong the US are. They will have plenty of fight in them, they had plenty of fight today. Our guys had a lot, too, though.”An example of how one-sided thisRyder Cuphas become can be taken from the clock. When JJ Spaun and Xander Schauffele defeated Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka at 6.20pm, it was the first US point on the board since 10.38am. In between times, McIlroy had backed off a birdie attempt on the 6th green with the utterance: “I am not going to putt until they shut up.”View image in fullscreenShane Lowry reacts to the crowd as Rory McIlroy looks to putt on the 6th.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesSecurity, lots of it, followed McIlroy and Lowry over the back nine of a successful fourball clash with Justin Thomas and Cameron Young. While Thomas did his best to quieten hecklers at times, he also whipped up the audience. Lowry was held back by his caddie at one stage, with scores of offensive punters removed from the crowd. Whether reflective of a wider society or simply a New York Ryder Cup, this was a dismal scene.McIlroy turned into politician mode when asked to assess what he was subjected to. “When you play an away Ryder Cup, it’s really, really challenging,” said the Masters champion. “It’s not for me to say.

Justin Rose not unreasonably feltBryson DeChambeauand his caddie were fiddling about on his line as he waited to putt on the 15th. The Englishman’s request for the American duo to move brought a furious reaction. The matter rumbled on to the walk to the 16th tee, where DeChambeau had a pop at Fleetwood. The intervention of Fleetwood’s caddie Ian Finnis – all 6ft 7in of him – prompted DeChambeau to beat a hasty retreat. “I was waiting to putt, the boys were obviously working on their read,” Rose explained. “Obviously they going through a lot of calculations and bits and pieces.“I waited a few seconds and then I felt like they came up again. I questioned whether … I was like: ‘It’s my putt, right?’ Or however I said it.

This has been an utterly miserable Ryder Cup for Scheffler. On Saturday morning, the world No 1 played with Russell Henley, losing by a hole to Robert MacIntyre and Viktor Hovland. Rahm had combined with Tyrrell Hatton again for foursomes success over Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay. McIlroy and Fleetwood eased to a win against Harris English and Collin Morikawa in the same section.The final match of the day was in the balance playing the final hole. Sam Burns and Cantlay held out hope of at least half a point from Hatton and Fitzpatrick. Europe had other ideas, both golfers hitting approaches to tap-in range. Fitzpatrick’s effort from a fairway bunker was special and a fitting denouement for those in maroon shirts. Europe took both sessions 3-1.View image in fullscreenThe Bethpage Black scoreboard spells out the scale of Europe’s lead.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAHovland was due to partner Fitzpatrick in the afternoon before a late switch. The Norwegian has been troubled recently by a neck injury, which flared up during his foursomes match. Should Hovland be unable to play in the singles, the US would also remove a player, with both sides taking half a point. This would clearly edge Europe even closer to victory. Neither Donald nor Hovland will want such a situation to play out. Nonetheless, given the lack of sportsmanship afforded to them from the galleries here, the Europeans do not owe this event anything.

Now the only unbeaten side left in the Premier League having stretched their run to club record 18 matches thanks to this dramatic late victory over champions Liverpool, Palace are about to embark on their first European tour when they face Dinamo Kyiv in the Conference League on Thursday and have a manager that is proving to be a bit of a genius.Arne Slot’s expensively assembled side thought they had kept up their run of rescuing late points when Federico Chiesa equalised Ismaïla Sarr’s opener. But the winning goal came from another substitute as Eddie Nketiah’s volley in the seventh minute of stoppage time recorded their first victory against Liverpool here since November 2014 and sent the home supporters wild. While Marc Guéhi put in another faultless performance against the club thatcame so close to signinghim earlier the month and even provided the assist for Nketiah’s clincher, above all this was a triumph for the system that has been implemented by Oliver Glasner since he arrived in south London 18 months ago. On this form, Palace are a match for anyone.Crystal Palace merited last-gasp win over Liverpool, admits Arne SlotRead moreContinuity has been one of the keys to their recent success and the return of Sarr – who scored in a third successive game against Liverpool – from injury meant Glasner was able to name the same team that started the FA Cup finaland Community Shield, apart from new signing Yeremy Pino replacing the departed Eberechi Eze.Liverpool still haven’t settled on their first choice XI after a busy summer of recruitment. Having spent almost a combined £250m on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, Slot probably felt compelled to start them both – especially afterHugo Ekitiké’s unhelpful red cardin midweek ruled him out of contention. But Liverpool looked a far cry from the team that started this season with five straight wins as Palace seized the initiative in the first half.As well as possessing a rock solid defence, Glasner’s side have also become lethal from set-pieces under the Austrian – asLiverpoolfound to their cost in the ninth minute. Virgil van Dijk’s loose pass was intercepted by Tyrick Mitchell and after breaking upfield, Palace won a corner that was contested by Slot and his backroom team. But the impressive Daichi Kamada’s inswinger was headed by Ryan Gravenberch under pressure from Guéhi and it fell perfectly for Sarr to sweep home. It should have been 2-0 in the next attack when Kamada pinched the ball off Gravenberch but Pino could not convert Sarr’s cutback.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr fires Crystal Palace into an early lead.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PALiverpool looked stunned and they had to wait almost five minutes to take a free-kick after a medical emergency in the crowd that required the intervention of medics. All was well in the end before Mohamed Salah hit the wall and a brilliant save from Dean Henderson somehow diverted Gravenberch’s piledriver on to the post. The direction of traffic was largely one way, however, and only two stunning saves from Alisson kept Liverpool in touch. First the Brazilian did well to scoop Daniel Muñoz’s effort off the line before he stood tall against Jean-Philippe Mateta in a one-on-one.Ibrahima Konaté had endured a particularly testing afternoon having earlier been booked for hauling down Mateta but the France defender was inches away from equalising when he headed Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner wide. Palace’s dominance was underlined by the fact that Isak recorded only his sixth touch of the first half during 10 minutes of stoppage time that were added on. Another flowing move started by Maxence Lacroix’s stunning pass ended with Mateta striking the post with a curling effort before he blasted just over on the volley. Half-time couldn’t come soon enough for Liverpool, while Palace left the field to a deserved standing ovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Conor Bradley was replaced by Cody Gakpo as Szoboszlai reverted to right-back and the German moved into midfield. He seemed much more at home there than stuck out on the left flank, with Wirtz setting up Gakpo for a shot that wasn’t far away from Henderson’s post before forcing the Palace goalkeeper into a point-blank save from Szoboszlai’s cross that he really should have scored from.Isak was the next to spurn a big chance after wriggling his way into the penalty area before firing wide. “What a waste of money,” sang the Palace supporters. Liverpool camped out in their half as they pushed for a way back into the game. But it needed a mistake from Chris Richards when he failed to clear Gravenberch’s cross to allow Chiesa to slam home the equaliser and keep up their record of having scored in their last 39 league games. But Nketiah made sure this was another afternoon to savour for Palace when he chested down Guéhi’s flick-on and provided the killer blow after the visitors failed to clear a long throw from Muñoz deep into stoppage time.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Though it probably should have been three points rather than one. A point edged Tottenham into the surprise party Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Bournemouth are enjoying in the top five as João Palhinha’s strike in the depths of stoppage time denied Wolves. Showing a fight and determination hitherto lacking from their season, the visitors had seemed destined for victory via Santiago Bueno’s scrappy opener.So close to a tactical triumph for Vítor Pereira, who signed a new, three-year contract last week, despite his team being on nilPremier Leaguepoints. “The spirit was there, everything was there but the last minute, it’s football,” said the Wolves manager.Tottenham 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreHis team will require so much more than a single point, considering other expected relegation candidates’ promising starts. He had taken drastic action. From a home defeat by Leeds last week that heightened the growing disquiet at Molineux, Wolves’ starting team selection featured nine changes, the same formula successful against Everton in the Carabao Cup.A near repeat of the form that relieved Gary O’Neil of his duties almost a year ago had suggested the continued danger of asset-stripping a squad. At Tottenham, a number of Wolves’ summer buys who mystified fans showed they had something to offer, only for concentration to lapse at the last as Pape Sarr laid up Palhinha for a raking drive.As the final whistle sounded, Pereira threw his notes in rage at the turf: “Some players came at the end of the market and then went away with their national teams,” he said. “Now we are building the spirit and putting them on the tactical page. We came here to win this game.”Sam Johnstone could only watch Palhinha’s strike fly by, after an excellent performance. In replacing José Sá he repeated a fine performance against Newcastle a fortnight previously. Like many others, Sá’s performances have fallen below standard. “They understand the decisions,” Pereira said of the omissions. “The first half we had some problems but the second half my team were the best team on the pitch.”Johnstone said: “We have to be proud of today. That is our baseline performance now.”View image in fullscreenSantiago Bueno bundles home to give Wolves the lead.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesIn the midst of a heavy schedule, a trip to the arctic circle set for Tuesday in the Champions League, Spurs rushed to get their Saturday night assignment completed, missing a number of first-half chances. They were eventually relieved to collect a point they would have struggled to collect under their previous management.“We were clearly on top and in control,” said Thomas Frank of the first 45 minutes. Matt Doherty, the right-back, unprotected by Jhon Arias ahead of him, was booked when his hefty challenge stopped one of Destiny Udogie’s trademark overlaps. In the final action before the break Doherty hit the bar from a corner Spurs struggled with. It served as an unheeded warning.Pereira’s half-time changes reverted his defence to the usual back three/five from the previous four. The speed of Jackson Tchatchoua, the summer arrival, a half-time replacement, was deployed to stop Mohammed Kudus’s runs. Successfully, too; Udogie’s influence also faded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jørgen Strand Larsen, who held the ball up expertly until being replaced late on, had been given a first bite of the cherry as Spurs again failed to clear their lines.Wolves did not completely sit on their lead, Hugo Bueno forcing a save from Gugliemo Vicario. Arias, a star of the summer’s Club World Cup with Fluminense, showed off serious chops with neat touches buying breathing space. His fellow South American, André, another former “Flu” player, impressed in midfield.Frank’s late changes included the withdrawal of the disappointing Xavi Simons. Like many of his colleagues, little had come off for the Dutchman. When all seemed to be coming up Pereira, he was denied by Palihinha, who offered post-match commiserations to his compatriot. “We needed something special and we got that,” said Frank, not a little relieved.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTottenham HotspurWolverhampton Wanderersmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Even at the end of a performance that was, if nothing else, a perfect example of empty and bloodless systems football, 90 minutes that felt like watching a robot with a cold go for a walk, this thing can still offer you stories, mini-arcs, narrative Easter eggs.The only shame is we will have to wait another six months, April at Stamford Bridge, to see if Bruno Fernandes can complete the perfect hat-trick of weirdly missed west London penalties.At Fulham a month ago Fernandes became very angry after a minor collision with the referee, then whumped the ball into the crowd. Four miles west of Craven Cottage, with Manchester United 2-1 down to an energeticBrentford, there was a more nuanced take on the delayed Bruno west London spot-kick fluff plot device.This time he was subjected to an interlude of mental disintegration by the video assistant referee, who took three minutes to decide Nathan Collins had not, repeat not, impeded a goalscoring opportunity by pulling back Bryan Mbeumo eight yards from goal with the ball heading his way. Enough for an obvious penalty. Not enough to qualify as a goalscoring opportunity. Maybe Mbeumo should sue for defamation.Probably there was some really good logic behind this, shorthand for four hyped-up guys babbling jargon at each other in a sweaty room. It was process. It was an application of the guidelines. It was also just nonsense.View image in fullscreenCaoimhín Kelleher dives to save Bruno Fernandes, watched by Igor Thiago.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersIn the middle of this Bruno was also nudged a little by Keith Andrews, who made a double substitution that stretched out the wait. A mid-penalty substitution. Ever seen it before? All this time Bruno held the ball, tried to look centred, calm, earthed, while invisible non-football happened. The kick was weak, but also well saved.And for United the game never came back from there, the only real tension the amazing lengthsRuben Amorimwas willing to go to in order to preserve intact his laughably totalitarian “system”, like a juggler whirling around a bowling ball, a sword and a piece of sponge cake. Behold my miraculously ineffective 3-4-2-1, now available with six midfielders, a pigeon, a sandwich and Jim Leighton at wingback.Quick GuideShould Nathan Collins have been sent off?ShowNathan Collins was behind Bryan Mbeumo and pulled him back. Craig Pawson awarded a penalty but Collins was only booked. The challenge was looked at by the video assistant referee but he did not recommend a review.Law 12 says:Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g.holding, pulling, pushing,no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.It continues:The following must be considered:distance between the offence and the goalgeneral direction of the playlikelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ballThe Premier League match centre said on social media that Mbeumo was deemed not to be in control of the ball.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.After the game Amorim blamed his team’s wretched performance on the players. Also on the referee. Also on Brentford for playing an aggressive game, dammit. The reality is this: at any normal club unscarred by other recent sackings, Amorim would now lose his job.The prize at the Gtech was the hilariously abject prospect of back-to-back league wins for the first time under a manager who has been there for almost a year. In that time Amorim has achieved only one thing. A team that seemed previously to be bad for diffuse macro reasons of culture and ghosts in the walls are now bad in a highly specific Amorim-shaped way.He has at the very least built a team in his own image. And yes, that image is reliably flawed, a pencil sketch from a textbook placed over ragged, complex human life by a manager who advertises to his opponent exactly what he’s going to do and then seems shocked each week to find himself getting mugged.But there was at least a first here. This might sound harsh. But even the missed penalty is arguably Amorim’s fault. At the very least the manager deserved a miss-assist. What position is Fernandes playing in these days? Deep pivot, arguably, sentenced to that role as he’s the only person at the club still in favour with the boss who can play on the half turn.View image in fullscreenBruno Fernandes hides his head in his hands after his penalty was saved.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesIn the process new patterns are being run. The assists and goals from open play have dried up. Here he is in a tight game stepping up to take a vital penalty, fried and rejigged, un-Brunoed, and looking for the first time anything other than totally relaxed. What do we we expect in this scenario? Business as usual?Another slow start also seemed to baffle Amorim, to the extent he again blamed Brentford for this afterwards. It is obvious watching this team why they start badly. The players begin each game looking like they’re in a state of buffering, regurgitating information, remembering patterns and shapes, unable to engage emotionally with the game or with what their opponents are doing.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Don’t worry about the utterly bloodless performance. We still have an obscure but well-worked set piece restart for you.And as ever it’s the system, stupid. It’s the stupid system. Let us take these oddly sourced parts, a fish finger, four walnuts, Casemiro, and bake them into a workable meal, but only, and I will not compromise on this, if I can do it in the shape of a bicycle. That is my one, unshakable principle. And here every player in the team underperformed or looked confused.Ruben Amorim rues Manchester United’s lack of character after latest defeatRead moreA long pass was all it took to create the first Brentford goal. Igor Thiago’s finish was astonishing, perhaps for him too. But what kind of manager asks Harry Maguire to play a high line, to defend large spaces, and is then surprised when this doesn’t work? Hey, what’s a guy got to do to get a payoff around here?The wingbacks were dreadful. Patrick Dorgu is good at running, but it’s more like he’s doing a cross-country quite near some other people playing football. Benjamin Sesko scored an opportunist goal. The penalty miss came and went. And Brentford were always, always winning this game.The one certainty at the end ofan abject 3-1 defeatis that nothing will shift here.

They could have taken the £125m, bought players at their leisure, and the sense going into the season would probably have been one of quiet satisfaction at a decent summer.Premier League wants minimum six-point penalty for serious breach of planned spending rulesRead moreThere has, at least, been an attempt to address some obvious issues in the squad. Callum Wilson was getting old;Yoane Wissa is not only an upgradebut his pace and capacity to pull wide make him a more natural fit for the dynamic counterattacking approach Eddie Howe favours.Anthony Elangabrings pace and directness on the right and is probably a step up from Jacob Murphy. Jacob Ramsey adds to their creative options. There may be a sense that Malick Thiaw has not quite kicked on as many hoped he would when he first emerged at Schalke but, at 24, he’s a good young defender who adds depth and may yet develop.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak’s goal at Wembley helped Newcastle to Carabao Cup glory – but that triumph has a slight taint now.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe shadow of Isak, though, and more specifically the acrimonious nature of his departure, hangs over everything. IsNick Woltemadebetter than Isak? Obviously not. But is Woltemade plus Wissa potentially better in a year or two than Isak plus Wilson? Possibly.In terms of transfer value, the two pairs roughly cancel (while opening up significant PSR headroom given the nature of amortisation). But because so much emotional energy was invested in keeping Isak, Newcastle’s season has begun in a funk: not great, not terrible, but dominated by three0-0 drawsthat have highlighted the absence of a high-class centre-forward.Eventhe Carabao Cup triumphhas a slight taint now. How can fans settle down to watch a rerun knowing the clinching goal was scored by somebody many would be dismissing as a rat just a few months later?It is both the blessing and the curse of the big one-club, post-industrial cities of the north that the identification of club and city is so strong. That’s why that victory at Wembley in March stimulated such a feeling of civic pride, but also why Isak provoked such strong reactions: in rejectingNewcastle United, he was also rejecting the city and its people.What Newcastle are going through now is the equivalent of a painful break-up, reminders of lost love materialising at every turn. That feeling is likely to be particularly acute on Sunday as they face Arsenal, against whom Isak excelled last season. Hescored the winner in the league at St James’ Park– a glorious header from Anthony Gordon’s outswinging cross – and then in both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also beat Arsenal 1-0 at home the previous season, a series of games that has seemingly contributed to Mikel Arteta’s adoption of an increasingly physical and cautious approach.Woltemade did score the winner against Wolves and has produced enough nice touches while sporting distinctive facial hair to raise the possibility he could become a cult figure, but – assuming he starts – facing Gabriel Maghalães and William Saliba or Cristhian Mosquera is a whole new level of challenge.Why, then, given the near-inevitability of Isak’s departure and the futility of keeping a player against his will, and the fact his sale could have been made into a positive, creating PSR headroom for significant spending, did Newcastle wait until the last minute to take the money?On one level it was simply a failure of leadership. With the sporting director, Paul Mitchell, having left in June, there was a vacuum, nobody to make the decision or to present the board’s position to the public. But perhaps it stung particularly because deep in the folk consciousness of the club is a memory of the 1980s, when Newcastle were forced to sell Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne, contributing to the sense of the club as a diminished entity. Isak was not, as those three were, local – but he had been taken to local hearts and become an emblem of a possible future competing with the very best.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scores against Wolves – but the prospect of facing Arsenal’s defenders is a far bigger challenge for Newcastle’s new signing.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockThere is an echo of the sale of Andy Cole to Manchester United in 1995, the same bewilderment at letting a prolific forward join a Premier League rival, but at least then Kevin Keegan appeared on the steps to explain the decision and there followed a few months later the world-record signing of Alan Shearer. Sir John Hall’s largesse in funding transfers had not stopped. Whether the Saudis remain so committed is less clear.Ambitioustalk of a move to a new stadiumin Leazes Park in March seemed a reaffirmation of their commitment, but little has happened since, beyond a petition being raised to save the park. Perhaps there will be progress now David Hopkinson is installed as chief executive, but no decisions are expected until next year at the earliest, in line with the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s (PIF) generalpolicy of retrenchment.The “strategic realignment” is particularly directed at investments outside Saudi Arabia and, while it may be true that PIF has become frustrated by PSR as a check on the pace of growth, the regulations also serve as useful cover for investors scaling back. As theSwiss Ramblefootball finance Substack pointed out, a £73m loss from 2021-22 falls out of PSR consideration this year, meaning Newcastle can make a loss of about £80m this financial year and still be compliant.And that’s the other – ultimately more unsettling – element of the Isak debacle. It’s not just that he will be missed; it’s what he represents. He was the symbol of Newcastle’s imagined future as an elite club with world-class players, a bellwether of the success the Saudi money could bring. Now Isak has gone, and so too has much of optimism about the transformational impact PIF’s investment could have.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedInside footballSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

It was so dramatic, and so barely believable from a sporting perspective, that it felt like a moment that could surely never come close to being repeated.Leigh overcome Wakefield in playoff to set up semi-final rematch with WiganRead moreUntil now, that is. Almost exactly 25 years to the day, the same team – who history has shown can never be written off, even when all seems against them – produced another moment from the sporting gods to keep their season alive in a fashion that even just a few seconds earlier would not have seemed remotely possible.Make no mistake, in almost every single moment prior to Shane Wright scoring one of the greatest and most dramatic tries Super League has ever seen to secure victory for St Helens at the expense ofLeeds Rhinos, Paul Wellens’ side were labouring and, quite frankly, limping towards a miserable exit from the playoffs.They trailed for most of the evening and the knives were being proverbially sharpened when, with less than 10 minutes remaining, they were behind by eight points. The Saints, who have struggled in attack all year, suddenly needed two tries to keep their season alive. At that point, it seemed inevitable that it would be Leeds progressing to face Hull KR next week in the semi-finals.But what they did next beggars belief. Jon Bennison’s try and subsequent conversion brought the gap down to two before they were awarded a penalty as the full-time hooter sounded. They kicked deep, and produced a move in which the ball passed through almost every pair of hands, shifting left to right and then right to left, with Wright the lucky man to touch down.The Leeds players slumped to the turf, their season suddenly over. The Headingley crowd was stunned into silence. And the Saints’ squad and travelling support were sent into delirium. “Someone reminded me this week that the ‘Wide to West’ try was 25 years ago on Monday … it’s almost like it was written in the stars,” Wellens said.“To our credit tonight, we weren’t perfect but we stuck to the task and played to the end. That shows you the rewards you can get. But when the dust settles, we’ve only got into the next round and we’ve another big game next week.” That game comes against the all-conquering Super League leaders, where they will undoubtedly have to go up several levels.Because this playoff tie was fairly low on quality before that stunning finale. Leeds led 12-6 at the break thanks to tries from Chris Hankinson and James McDonnell, with Jonny Lomax briefly levelling the scores for the Saints. When Jake Connor added a penalty to make it 14-6 going into the final quarter, the destiny of the tie only seemed to be going one way.It was perhaps no surprise that what transpired in the final few moments left the Rhinos’ head coach almost lost for words. “It’s a tough game, isn’t it,” Brad Arthur said. “Sport can be unfair sometimes but we’ve had enough chances to win that game in the second half so we just have to go away and learn from it.”Arthur is right. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have put this game to bed. But that won’t be remembered now. What will be remembered for ever more is how the Saints, against all the odds, somehow plucked a victory from nowhere thanks to Wright’s miraculous late try. It will forever stand the test of time, and who knows where it could lead to next.Because the funny thing about that iconic West try a quarter of a century ago? It proved to be the catalyst for the Saints to go all the way to Old Trafford and win the Grand Final. The prospect of history repeating itself seemed impossible even after the full-time hooter had sounded on Saturday evening but now, no outcome can be ruled out.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSt HelensLeeds RhinosRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

James Fuller stood rooted to the spot in disappointment after his attempted force off the back foot produced a thin edge that was duly snaffled by Ben Foakes behind the stumps.Fuller’s was the final wicket Surrey needed to bowl out Hampshire for 160 and notch the win to secure their finish as Division One runners up toNottinghamshire.Chahar’s fizzing haul of 8-51 were the best innings figures for Surrey in a First-Class match since Kemar Roach’s blistering 8-40 againstHampshireat the Oval in 2021, and, more impressively, the best by a spinner for Surrey since Pat Pocock’s 9-57 v Glamorgan at Cardiff in 1979.Hampshire’s loss meant that allDurhamhad to do was bat out the day in Leeds to ensure their own survival, their fate firmly in their own batting gloves. They felt the pressure keenly, collapsing under it like a batch of Braeburn’s on a late September Apple pressing.

He notched his first Group One winner in mid-August on the Godolphin-owned Rebel’s Romance. It is his day-to-day form from the start of July, though, that suggests a first serious tilt at the jockeys’ title is a distinct possibility next year.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Sunday tipsShowEpsom1.45 Galileo Island 2.20 Alfaraz 2.55 Gamrai 3.30 Naasma 4.05 Fantasy Believer 4.40 Falmouth Lad 5.15 Musical AngelFfos Las1.55 Zambezi Magic 2.30 Astrazar 3.05 Proof 3.40 Change of Fortune 4.15 Guiteau 4.50 Capone 5.25 King Of The Dance (nb)Newcastle2.13 Enpassant 2.45 Lir Speciale 3.20 Toronto Raptor 3.55 Crack Shot 4.30 Sportingsilvermine 5.05 Leading Dancer 5.40 Major Neigh Sayer 6.15 Zryan 6.45 Superposition (nap)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.At least 20 winners per month is title form – Oisin Murphy, the champion-elect, has notched at least 22 in every month of the race, which started in early May – and Loughnane has hit the same level over the past three months. Murphy is gone beyond recall this year, with 128 wins before Saturday, but Loughnane, in second with 93, is guaranteed to finish as runner-up.View image in fullscreenWilliam Buick acknowledges the crowd after winning the Middle Park Stakes on Wise Approach.Photograph: Ian Headington/racingfotos.com/ShutterstockNext year’s title race kicks off on Guineas weekend when all being well, Bow Echo will put his unbeaten record on the line in the colts’ Classic. “He showed a nice turn of foot and handled the track great,” Loughnane said. It [the 2,000 Guineas] looks the right spot for him. I liked the way he came down the Dip [inside the final quarter-mile]. I was still going well and it’s exciting for next year.”The Middle Park Stakes winner would often be viewed as a Guineas candidate, but Wise Approach, who overcome a near-disastrous stumble in the early strides to win the Group One contest by three-quarters of a length, is seen as more of a sprinter at three by his trainer, Charlie Appleby.Despite almost parting company in the opening strides, this was an impressive performance by Wise Approach, who found a burst of speed to get back into contention two furlongs out and then quickened again to hold off the late challenge of Brussels. “I said to William [Buick] to put him there on the line,” Appleby said, “and he did that, but it wasn’t an easy watch. Full credit to William and the horse.“He’s a half-brother to a good sprinter [the 2021 Middle Park winner, Perfect Power], and I’d say that will be it for the year, but we’ll see what the team want to do.

There are two means by which they are achieved. The first is the mass killing and expulsion of the Palestinians. The second is rendering the land uninhabitable. Alongside the crime of genocide, another great horror unfolds: ecocide.While the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in Gaza is visible in every video we see, less visible is the parallel destruction of ecosystems and means of subsistence. Before the 7 October atrocity that triggered the current assault on Gaza, about40% of its landwas farmed. Despite its extreme population density, Gaza wasmostly self-sufficientin vegetables and poultry, and met much of the population’s demand for olives, fruit and milk. But last month the UN reported that just 1.5% of its agricultural land now remains bothaccessible and undamaged. That’s roughly 200 hectares – the only remaining area directly available to feed more than 2 million people.Part of the reason is thesystematic destructionof farmland by the Israeli military. Ground troops have demolished greenhouses; bulldozers have toppled orchards, ploughed out crops and crushed the soil; and planes havesprayed herbicidesover the fields.What is ecocide and could it become a crime under international law?Read moreThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) justify these attacks by claiming that“Hamas oftenoperates from within orchards, fields, and agricultural land.” And apparently from hospitals, schools, universities, industrial estates and any other resources on which the Palestinians depend. All the IDF needs to do in order to rationalise destruction is to suggest that Hamas has operated or might operate from the thing it wants to destroy. And if there’s no evidence – sorry, too late.The IDF is steadily expanding the “buffer zone” along Gaza’s eastern border, which happens to contain much of the Strip’s agricultural land. As the human rights specialist Hamza Hamouchenepoints out, rather than “making the desert bloom” – a mainstay of Israeli state propaganda – it is turning fertile and productive land into desert.The Israeli government has beenfelling Palestinians’ ancient olive treesfor decades to deprive them of subsistence, demoralise them and break their connection with the land. Olives are both materially crucial, accounting for14% of the Palestinian economy, and symbolically powerful: if there are no olive trees, there can be no olive branch. Israel’s scorched-earth policy, in conjunction with itsblockade of food supplies, guaranteesfamine.The IDF’s assault on Gaza has caused a collapse inwastewater treatment. Raw sewage floods the land, seeps into aquifers and poisons coastal waters. The same thing has happened to solid waste disposal: mountains of rubbish now rot and smoulder among the ruins or are pushed into informal waste dumps, leaching contaminants. Before the current assault, people in Gaza had access toabout 85 litresof water per person per day, which, while sparse, meets therecommended minimum level. As of February this year, the average hadfallen to 5.7 litres. Gaza’s crucial coastal aquifer is further threatened by the IDF’s flooding of Hamas tunnels with seawater: salt intrusion, beyond a certain point, will render the aquifer unusable.The UN Environment Programme estimated last year that on each square metre of Gaza there was an average of107kg of debrisfrom bombing and destruction. Much of this rubble is mixed with asbestos, unexploded ordnance, human remains and the toxins released by weaponry. Munitions contain metals such as lead, copper, manganese, alumnium compounds, mercury and depleted uranium. There are credible reports of the IDFillegally using white phosphorus: a hideous chemical and incendiary weapon that also causes widespread contamination of soil and water. Toxic dust and smoke inhalation have major impacts on people’s health.On top of the devastating immediate impacts on the lives of the Gazan people, the carbon emissions of Israel’s assault are astronomical: a combination of vastdirect emissionscaused by the war and the staggering climate cost of rebuilding Gaza (if that is ever allowed to happen) – reconstruction alone would produce greenhouse gases equivalent to the annualemissions of a medium-sized country.When you consider the ecocide alongside the genocide, you begin to grasp the totality of the Israeli state’s attempt to eliminate both the Palestinians and their homeland. As the Palestinian ecologist Mazin Qumsiyeh argues: “Environmental degradation is not incidental– it is intentional, protracted, and aimed at breaking the eco-sumud (ecological steadfastness) of the Palestinian people.”I’ve written very little over the years about the environmental impacts of armed forces, as I feel that if you cannot persuade decision-makers that killing people is wrong, you will never persuade them that killing other life forms is also wrong. I think many others have felt the same way, which is one reason why the military tends to be excused the environmental scrutiny that other sectors have felt. But its footprint, even in peacetime, is enormous. The Conflict and Environment Observatory estimates that the world’s armed forces produce roughly5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet partly as a result of lobbying by the US government, they areexempted from mandatory reportingunder the Paris climate agreement. Nor are they properly held to account for their vast range of other environmental harms, from deforestation to pollution, soil destruction to unregulated dumping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For many years, green campaigners have pointed out that peace and environmental protection must go together. War is as devastating to ecosystems as it is to people, and environmental breakdown is a major cause of war.For the Israeli government, the erasure of ecosystems and people’s means of survival seems to be a key strategic aim. It appears to be seeking whatsome have called “holocide”: the complete destruction of every aspect of life in Gaza. Even without a specific law of ecocide, whichmany of us seek, the destruction of Palestinian ecosystems is in clear contravention of article 8 of theRome Statuteand should be considered alongside its great crime of genocide.But if the eventual plan is to create a “Gaza Riviera” or a similar scheme to build an eerie elite technopolis stripped of place and history, of thekind that Donald Trumpand somesenior Israeli politiciansfavour – well, who needs trees or soil or crops for that? There is no cost to the perpetrators. Or not, at least, until they are brought to justice.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I was willing to die on this hill, arguing that they distracted from the purity of the audiovisual experience: the cinematographer’s attention to detail, the glimpse of a tear in an actor’s eye, the punchline of an expertly timed joke, and so on.But I have been forced to recognise just how alone I am on this hill: in 2021, a surveyfound that80% of 18-25-year-olds used subtitles all or some of the time, while a new survey run by streaming service U found that 87% of young Britons are using subtitles more than they used to. There is no longer a debate about subtitles: among my peers, “two types” of people have given way to “mostly one type”. (Meanwhile, the 2021 surveyfound thatless than a quarter of boomers used subtitles, despite the latter generation experiencingmore hearing difficultiesoverall.)Why is this practice so common among people my age? If you aren’t hearing-impaired and are fluent in the language of the dialogue, what is it about subtitles that makes them more appealing?An easy assumption is that this is the result of a short attention span, passivity and a lazy nature, a failure of generation Zombie. But having experienced watching TV with and without subtitles, I’d say the former doesn’t beget lazy viewing so much as a quicker information download. The new status quo of “subtitles on” among the young reflects both a values shift and cultural conditioning as a result of big tech’s ever-encroaching impact on our entertainment experience.For example, the small screen in our living room has to share the limelight with the micro screen in our lap. The U survey revealed that 80% of gen Z and millennials “double-screen” when they watch. With subtitles on, I find myself being able to quickly gather what one character has said, look down at my phone, react to a message, then look up before that character has even finished their line. The viewing experience thus becomes multifaceted and efficient. The subtitles allow us to go on our phone but still absorb the content and gist of the TV show. Of course, that means they also function as mini-spoilers: when watching a comedy sketch recently, I found myself half-heartedly chuckling at a joke before it had left David Mitchell’s mouth – because I had already read it on the screen.I don’t need to use my little grey cells when watching most TV shows, but there are few, like Succession, where double-screening is a sad exercise. Even if I manage to successfully absorb each line in the script through reading, I’d be neglecting the exceptional acting. The same thing cannot be said for Love Island (although arguably the acting is of a high standard there, too).And social media itself has encouraged the use of subtitles across the board. It is now a given that most creators add text captions to their videos – without the option to turn them off. This cultural shift may explain the generational gap between boomers and younger viewers, the latter only appeased by rapid-fire content and videos with faster cuts, absorbing lightweight content at a higher speed, which text captions allow us to do.This isn’t simply a trend but a feature anchored in the algorithm itself. Text captions, rather than dialogue, encourage the video to crop up in the TikTok search engine, increasingreach and visibilityas well as viewer retention and viewing time. It began as an accessibility improvement, but the rapidity with which it has caught on suggests it’s business-oriented and crucial to getting that sweet algorithm boost. The fact that 85% of social media visual content is nowwatched on mute(while commuting, cooking, on the treadmill at the gym or in houseshares), coupled with the ease with which AI can generate subtitles without the need for human transcription, means we’re living in a subtitled world – one that is often poorly translated,low-qualityand error-ridden.Mumbling actors, bad speakers or lazy listeners? Why everyone is watching TV with subtitles onRead moreSeen this way, subtitles have been normalised as a result of our technology-infused lifestyle, rather than being something we have actively sought out or freely adopted. My flatmate, a keen TikToker, said she used to find subtitles distracting and annoying, then gradually started using them while watching TV. “I’ve felt very passive in it,” she said. “I don’t think I look at them most of the time.” Then why do you have the subtitles on, I asked. “I don’t know,” she said with a shrug.Amazingly, subtitles havenot been linkedto improvements in young people learning to read, although other studies have shown that they canimprove comprehensionof what happened in a given programme. Subtitles arguably keep us following more effectively than non-subtitles. Our TV habits are now influenced by a need for efficiency ported over from our social-media habits, which mean we can quickly glean the necessary content and then move on. In a 2023 survey,40% of Americanscited “enhanced comprehension” as the main reason they use subtitles.I have to ask: are people now watching shows just to find out what happens, and to prove they’ve seen it? Since when did we finish work, sit down on the sofa, cuddle up and think “thank god, I can’t wait for a bit of comprehension tonight”? TV is supposed to be fun. Shouldn’t we be focused on enjoying it?Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionDeafness and hearing losscommentShareReuse this content"

It was clear that the elected leader of the nation that has done much to shape the world for 80 years was in full bully mode. And so he rambled on for 57 minutes, 42 minutes more than he was allocated, telling the leaders that their countries were going to hell, that the climate crisis was a “con job” and that the UN was “funding an assault on western countries and their borders”.Still, they managed to applaud him for 20 seconds at the end and smiled into the camera for selfies with the man who made clear his contempt forscience,civilised values and human flourishing.The normal rules of diplomacy, grounded in politesse, quiet persuasion and trust, are proving to be woefully inadequate, just as the normal rules of international relations were found woefully inadequate more than 80 years ago.Trump delivered an embarassing performance at the UN general assembly | Mohamad BazziRead moreFifty-one nations signed up to create a new world order from the ashes of the second world war, aiming, as Hammarskjöld – the influential second secretary general – liked to say and UN officials now quote as a mantra: not “to take mankind to heaven but to save humanity from hell”.Smaller countries were keen to join and Australia’s HV “Doc” Evatt, the third president of the general assembly, played a major role in making this possible. He also signalled Australia’s entrance on the world stage as an influential independent nation alongside Jessie Street, one of only eight women at the first assembly in 1945. She insisted that the UN charter recognise the damage of sex discrimination. This was a legacy the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, noted, despite his diffidence about history,in his speechto a much less crowded room the following day.Now with 193 member states and a world transformed by independence, development, education, opportunities for women and massive reductions in poverty and starvation, the “scourge of war” has not been eliminated. Armed conflicts are raging around the world. Battles are killing hundreds of people every day, many invisible in the west, but several are broadcast live and in horrifying detail.Pope Francis’s observationin 2014 that we are in “a third war, one fought piecemeal” feels still apt and fosters feelings of helplessness.This made the US president’s belligerence feel particularly off-key. It is tempting to think that this is just the rant of a narcissistic leader who no one has the courage to correct, but that is a misreading of the forces at play.Over the decades, as the UN has evolved to better serve a vastly different world than the one that emerged in the 1940s, its activities and mission have changed. Development became a major priority at the UN as it helped nations to grow, helped lift millions out of poverty, de-risked international investment in poor nations and educated women and children, asSusan Brown, the former Australian journalist who is now the assistant administrator and director at the UN Development Programme, has noted.This was crystallised in 2015 with the enthusiastic adoption of the eightmillennium development goals(MDGs) – a 15-year road map to a sustainable future, eradicate extreme poverty, ensure universal education, environmental sustainability and gender equality. These goals provided a 21st-century framework that reinterpreted the ambitions of the global organisation. When combined with the Paris climate agreement later that year, they were, as the economic historianAdam Toozehas put it, “the high point of reformist ‘global governance’”.Australia must stand firm in its support for a rules-based order and reject any US requests for military aid | Donald RothwellRead moreEarlier this year, about the same time as it decimated USAID, the US retreated from its earlier support for the MDGs. Its new policy “rejects and denounces the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development … Although framed in neutral language, Agenda 2030 the SDGs advance a program of soft global governance that is inconsistent with US sovereignty and adverse to the rights and interests of Americans”.Millions will suffer and die and not achieve their individual and collective potential as a result, but there will be some winners.For years, Quinn Slobodian has been studying the minutiae of the formation of neoliberalism and its role in shaping the Maga agenda. In his new book, Hayek’s Bastards, he traces the connecting tissue that helped elect the current US president. The collapse of the cold war signalled a new political battlefront for the most fervent believers in the primacy of the market, he argues. For them, “the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s had injected the poison of civil rights, feminism, affirmative action, and ecological consciousness into the veins of the body politic”. He says neoliberals tried to “erect a bulwark against the encroaching demands of progressives and hopefully roll back social changes to return to a hierarchy of gender, race, and cultural difference they imagined to be rooted in genetics as well as tradition”.It appears this was the mentality Trump was channelling from his bully pulpit in New York. A world order shaped not by aspiration and inclusion but by fear, winners and losers, racialism and crude exclusionary nationalism.Although to do so would have risked further revenge by a humiliated man, it’s a shame more of the world’s leaders did not turn their backs or walk out during the US president’s address.Julianne Schultz is the author of The Idea of AustraliaExplore more on these topicsUnited NationsOpinionDonald TrumpAnthony AlbanesecommentShareReuse this content"

Incels masquerading as philosophers and 14-year-olds who have just discovered Nietzsche.The world’s most famous antinatalist academic, David Benatar, has a book called The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys.I remember rolling my eyes back into my skull, thinking:here we go.Why did I start down this red pill rabbit hole?America’s premier pronatalists on having ‘tons of kids’ to save the world: ‘There are going to be countries of old people starving to death’Read moreWell, I was about to turn 30, and I’m someone who tries to do the right thing. I wanted to know if having a kid, on this burning planet, was the right thing. In 2021 Ipsos released theirPerils of Perception: Climate Changepaper in which they declared that the single most effective things a person from a rich country (like mine) could do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions was: have one less child.It is fair to criticise the very idea of an individual carbon footprint. After all, it was a genius piece of PR propaganda created by BP to shift focus away from the100 companies who emit 71% of climate-damaging carbon dioxide emissions worldwide. But in Australia, Scott Morrison won the 2019 election after he’d brought a lump of coal into parliament in 2017. I couldn’t see much cause for optimism about systemic change.I started looking for a new way to ask that foundational, Socratic question: what is a good life? How can I lead it? And should I try to create it? Is it even possible to?What I didn’t expect to find in antinatalism was a complex and rich web of ideas, some contradictory and some complementary, but all based on compassion. Most antinatalists I’ve spoken to and whose work I’ve read share the underlying desire to reduce suffering. To minimise harm and hurt. All human life involves suffering, and all humans cause suffering. You may believe that suffering is outweighed by the joys and experiences of life. You may believe that humans are entitled to kill animals to eat or burn the Earth for profit. Those are normal beliefs. But they aren’t universal. There are as many ways to be an antinatalist as there are to be, say, a Christian or a Buddhist or a romantic or a Stoic. But the core belief they share is that for those of us who can choose, the better choice is tonotcreate another human being.I was so compelled by these ideas I decided to make the protagonist in my new book,Seed, an antinatalist. What I quickly started learning, when discussing the book and the ideas with people as it developed, was that antinatalism is seriously taboo.It goes against almost every religion to question whether the creation of a new human life is a morally righteous act. It goes against modern economic policy to suggest we should consider anything other than eternal growth of populations and the goods and services they require. It goes against the very real and valid instincts many people have to want, or to have wanted, to have a baby.Our society has come a long way in making space for things such as maternal ambivalence and the childfree movement, but those are still frameworks that ask whether or not wewantto have children, not whether or not weshould.I chose to be childfree. I didn’t think I was choosing isolation, tooRead moreI’ve learned that, for many people, these ideas are inherently offensive. It’s one of the reasons I was cautious to make sure the protagonist in my book was a man. Ie:not me.Like all taboo topics, the fast track to shutting down a conversation you don’t want to have is to shame the speaker.What’s so strange about antinatalism being taboo is that pronatalism is skyrocketing in mainstream prevalence. And whereas antinatalists seek only to convince, pronatalists seek to legislate. People like Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and JD Vance want to “make America procreate again”. In late January, aDepartment of Transportation memodirected the agencyto prioritise projects that “give preference to communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average”. In April the USAID program cut off their supply of contraceptives to 50 million women, and in July a story came out that they’d ordereda $9.7m supply of birth control to be incinerated.Fortunately Australians rejected Trumpian rhetoric at the last election. But that doesn’t change the fact I see more compassion from antinatalists than pronatalists right now.View image in fullscreenIn Australia, young peoplesuch as Anjali Sharmaare having to sue their leaders and elders to try to get the government to acknowledge they have a duty of care not to exacerbate the climate emergency. The government fought the young people and the government won.Since May 2022, the federal environment minister has approved 11 new coalmines or expansions with 1,677m tonnes of lifetime emissions. That doesn’t sound like a nation that values new and future lives. Sometimes it feels as though the wrong things are taboo.Bri Lee is the author ofSeed(AU$34.99, Simon & Schuster)Explore more on these topicsLife and styleChildrenParents and parentingWomenPopulationClimate crisiscommentShareReuse this content"

However, that’s never stopped the very stable genius from inflicting his unhinged health views on the rest of us, has it? Back in 2020, for example, Trump memorably mused thatinjecting disinfectantcould help fight the coronavirus – which forced the maker of Dettol and Lysol to put out an urgent statement explaining that this was a very bad idea.Now the president, who once vowed to be aprotector of women“whether they like it or not”, has turned his attention to prenatal care. “Taking Tylenol is, uhhhh, not good,” Trump said on Monday, with his trademark eloquence. He was flanked by health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr, the guy who told Congressthis yearthat “people shouldn’t take medical advice from me”.Trump went on to link autism to prenatal exposure to acetaminophen, which is the active ingredient in Tylenol. If you’re feeling poorly while pregnant you should “fight like hell” not to take Tylenol to relieve your pain, the president instructed. Which basically means suffering instead: ibuprofen, for instance, is generally not recommended afterweek 20 of pregnancy.“If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that’s what you’d have to do,” Trumpcontinued. “You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words, a fever that’s very, very dangerous, and ideally, a doctor’s decision, because I think you shouldn’t take it and you shouldn’t take it during the entire pregnancy.”Like everything Trump says, this incoherent quote makes zero sense. But the bottom line here is that the Trump administration is advancing wildly irresponsible guidance. There isno evidencefor a causative link between acetaminophen and autism and many experts were aghast at Trump’s statements. Indeed, even the moral vacuum that isJD Vancebalked at repeating Trump’s advice, instead urging women to lean on their doctors. And while Trump claimed that there is “no downside” in avoiding Tylenol, an untreated feverduring pregnancycould cause problems for the baby.Trump’s demand that pregnant women “tough it out” is also deeply misogynistic and a reminder of how women’s pain is often misunderstood or ignored.Numerous studiesshow that the medical establishment takes men’s pain more seriously. A 2022 study from theJournal of the American Heart Association, for example, found that women who visited emergency departments with chest pain waited 29% longer than men to be evaluated.This sudden Tylenol scare is also yet another example of mom-shaming. “ We really have a long history of blaming mothers in this country, and we’re seeing that reinforced through the narratives around autism’s causes right now,” Martine Lappé, a sociology professor,told NPR.Women are shamed for not getting pregnant or waiting “too long” to get pregnant. They’re shamed (and, increasingly,criminalized) for losing a pregnancy. They’re shamed for everything from the size of theirbaby bumpto what they eat whilethey’re pregnant. They’re called out forexercisingwhile expecting – or not exercising enough. And if they give birth to a baby that isn’t able-bodied or neurotypical, women are often told it’s probably because of something they did. It’s their fault.While pregnant women are often treated like public property, expectant fathers are not treated with the same scrutiny. About 15% of couples in the US have trouble conceiving, and, by one count, over 50% of the time amale infertilityissue contributes. Yet women are traditionally blamed. Indeed back in the1940s researcherseven posited that women’s unconscious hatred of their husbands was what stopped them from conceiving. We’ve moved on from that a bit, but infertility is still widely thought of as a woman’sproblem.Studies have alsofound a linkbetween advanced paternal age and autism. But does society constantly shame men for having kids later in life? Of course not. When a 59-year-old Trump fathered Barron, he crowed to the press about his virility. “I continue to stay young, right? I produce children, I stay young,” said Trumpat the time.No doubt there are numerous things motivating this suddenTrump administrationobsession with Tylenol, including a need to distract people from those pesky Epstein files. However, a concern for women’s health is absolutely not at the heart of it. Rather, this is yet another way to control women; another way to reduce us to walking wombs rather than multidimensional human beings. This war on Tylenol is also very much a war on women. Now, if only there was a pill we could take to help deal with this Maga-induced malaise. As it is, we are all just going to have to tough it out.Elon Musk’s father accused of sexually abusing his children and stepchildrenConsidering it is common knowledge that Errol Musk fathered at least one child with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years oldwhen he married her mother, these new accusations, reported by theNew York Times, are not a huge surprise. Errol, meanwhile, has dismissed the allegations as “nonsense” and “rubbish.”75-year-old weightlifter heading to world championshipsKate Evert got into weightlifting when she was 69 after her kids nagged her to go to the gym.

It is also,says the newly mintedhousing, communities and local government secretary, Steve Reed, “putting working families in control of their lives and their neighbourhood”. This follows the English Devolution and Community Empowerment bill, which ploughs a similar furrow,legislating for, among other things, communities’ right to buy and ensuring sports venues are automatically listed as assets of community value.The strategy is being broadly understood as Labour’s answer to Boris Johnson’s much-touted “levelling up”. The investment, Keir Starmerhas said, will “get rid of the boarded-up shops, shuttered youth clubs and crumbling parks that have become symbols of a system that stopped listening”. Neighbourhoods and high streets are the place where the “change” promised by Labour’s winning manifesto must first manifest. It’s not all about the fastest-growing GDP in the G7: the strategy starts by asserting that the government’s “measures of success cannot just be shifts in national statistics but must include change that people see and feel in their local community”.Labour MPs are praising the direct investment the fund will bring to their communities. The funding allocations have been decided by, among other things, the index of multiple deprivation and the lesser-known community needs index, which measures quality of available services. When communicating the policy to their constituents and local media, they are generally leading with the cash amount being funnelled into their areas, as well they should. Money is what makes things real: policies about duties and responsibilities that cost nothing are cheap in all senses of the word.People working in what might be understood as the “progressive communitarian” space (including organisations such as Power to Change, the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods, Locality and the Co-operative party) want to critique that narrative, however. They argue that Labour’s plans are different from the levelling-up funds because of the structures by which the money will be spent. It provides money and power.“Nothing destroys political trust like money that comes and goes,” says Caitlin Prowle, head of politics at the Co-operative party, drawing a direct contrast with Johnson’s plan: “This isn’t just about investment in communities, it’s about a genuine shift in power and ownership. This money comes with new powers to shape and own community assets, so that even when funding fades, the community owns those places and can determine their future.”As with the provisions of the English Devolution and Community Empowerment bill (but more so), it is being framed by Labour as a response to decreasing trust in politics – and, of course, toReform UK. Farage’s party placed second to Labour in a great many of the areas that will now receive funding. “This is our alternative to the forces trying to pull us apart,” says Reed in his introduction to the strategy. There are no prizes for guessing who he means.The theory of change here is based on ideas about political trust, understanding Reform as a manifestation of anti-politics. First, it argues that people want to see real delivery in their local areas – and that at this level it is possible to give it and make people believe politics is responsive to their lives. Second, it seeks to build up trust and positive feeling, from where it isstrong at a local level, so that its benefits might apply to national politics.Steve Reed is a Labour and Co-operative MP, and before entering parliament was leader of Lambeth council, in which time he set up the Co-operative Councils Innovation Network. In 2011, in his contribution to the Purple Book (an attempt at intellectually revitalising the Labour right after the 2010 defeat, featuring contributions from no fewer than five current cabinet ministers), he wrote about “handing more power to communities and the people who use public services”, something which requires turning the “traditional model upside down”.Reed is a long-term believer in the politics he is now attempting to put into practice; this background probably goes some of the way to explaining why this programme is the most fleshed-out iteration of Labour’s localism-against-Reform playbook thus far. Whether it is successful, however, depends on how well Labour can communicate the agenda and authentically own the changes that will be brought about by this shift of money and power. Reform is,many people acknowledge, significantly ahead of Labour when it comes to community organising (something no doubt due in part to the difficult legacy of the Corbyn-era Labour community organising unit, shuttered early in the Starmer years, which became for many on the then ascendent right of the party a byword for a kind of lefty excess that was both out of touch and insufficiently electorally minded). But the potential rewards are huge: a rebuke to the argument that politicians are removed from people’s real lives, and an injection of cash and autonomy to places that sorely need both.Morgan Jones is the co-editor of Renewal: A Journal of Social DemocracyExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionPovertySteve ReedLabour conferenceKeir StarmerCommunitiesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

Then his smart glasses failed on stageMatthew CantorThe Meta CEO fumbled a demo of his AI Ray-Bans, giving us hope that the robots might be too dumb to take overSat 27 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 14.46 EDTShareAs humanity inches closer to anAIapocalypse, a sliver of hope remains: the robots might not work.Such was the case last week, asMark Zuckerbergattempted to demonstrate his company’s new AI-enabled smart glasses. “I don’t know what to tell you guys,” Zuckerberg told a crowd ofMetaenthusiasts as he tried, and failed, for roughly the fourth time to hold a video call with his colleague via the glasses.It was a limp follow-up to an ambitious opening to the event at Meta Connect 2025, a developers conference in Menlo Park,California, where the company is headquartered. The keynote was to feature the Ray-Ban Meta Display, the latest version of what is essentially a face-mounted iPhone – ideal for the consumer who lacks the energy to pull a device from their pocket and idolizes both Buddy Holly and the Terminator. Despite that undeniable appeal, the show was a technical mess – perhaps the perfect homage to the latest pointless iteration of digital hardware.The show had a promising start. Viewers witnessed Zuck making his way to the stage to thumping music, performing an alarming number of fist bumps en route. The moment was presented onscreen through the camera on his glasses, so that the audience could see “Mark’s POV”. All the while, he was receiving a flurry of text messages expressing enthusiasm that was no doubt genuine: “Let’s gooo” followed by a rocketship emoji, “audience is getting hyped” with a picture of two guys looking content at best, a gif saying “It’s time.”Finally, Zuck reached the stage, in his now signature big T-shirt and curls. He explained the company’s commitment to attractive eyewear, to the supremely ironic notion that “the technology needs to get out of the way” of human interaction, and to “taking superintelligence seriously”. Superintelligence is going to be “the most important technology of our lifetimes. AI should serve people, not just be something that sits in a data center automating large parts of society,” he said, sweetly assuming that society will exist beyond the next decade.If it was all an exercise in humanizing Zuckerberg, it worked: it was easy to pity the boy wonder, 41Things rolled along smoothly enough until it came time to actually use an AI feature. Zuck held a video call with chef Jack Mancuso, suggesting he make “maybe like a steak sauce, maybe Korean-inspired type thing”, which Mancuso admitted he had never made before, so he “could definitely use the help” of AI.“What do I do first?” he asked the oracle.“You’ve already combined the base ingredients,” the AI informed him wrongly, “so now grate a pear to add to the sauce.” Long silence.“What do I do first?” Mancuso asked again.“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce,” the AI patiently reminded him.“I think the wifi might be messed up. Sorry. Back to you, Mark.” (Certainly it was the wifi and not the AI itself.)To his credit, Zuckerberg remained poised. “It’s all good. You know what? It’s all good,” he said. “The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the wifi on the day kind of catches you.”AI demo failures are nothing new. They are something of atraditionat Google, where last yeara presenter used its Gemini toolto scan a Sabrina Carpenter concert poster listing her tour dates. “I’ll just open Gemini, take a photo, and ask: ‘Check my calendar and see if I’m free when she’s coming to San Francisco this year.’” The bot’s response was dead silence. (It finally worked on the third try, on a different device.)This year, when Google showed off a translation feature on its own smart glasses, it failed after about15 seconds. To be fair, just because there’s an error in a high-stakes tech presentation doesn’t mean a product won’t work, as anyone who watched a certain Tesla Cybertruck presentation will recall. When a designer threw a metal ball at the truck’s “armor glass” windows, it smashed them. That truck went on to a glorious future, earning the coveted title of “deadlier than a Ford Pinto”.At this point in his presentation, you might assume Zuckerberg would leave nothing to chance. But when it came time to demonstrate the Ray-BanMetaDisplay’s unique new wristband, he opted against using slides and decided to try it live.The wristband is what he called a “neural interface” – in a genuinely remarkable feat of technology, itallows you to type through minimal hand gestures, picking up on the electrical signals going through your muscles. “Sometimes you’re around other people and it’s, um, good to be able to type without anyone seeing,” Zuckerberg told the crowd. The pairing of glasses and wristband is, in short, a stalker’s dream.At least when it works. Zuckerberg attempted to call his colleague Andrew Bosworth over and over again, the audience sitting in silence as the incoming-call music played. But the CEO was unable to pick up. “That’s too bad. I don’t know what happened,” he said after the first failed attempt. Then came another – “I’m just gonna pick that up with my neural band,” he said with a straight face – but again, he couldn’t do it, as the “missed video call” alerts stacked up on the onstage display, still showing “Mark’s POV”.“I don’t know what to tell you guys, alright, but we’re gonna have Boz come out here and we’re just gonna go to the next thing that I wanted to show and hope that will work.” A sign at the back of the room, visible onscreen, read: “Live demo – good luck”.If it was all an exercise in humanizing Zuckerberg, it worked: it was easy to pity the boy wonder, 41, as he fidgeted with the controls and did his best to smile through it all.Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg to solve your loneliness with an ‘AI friend’? No, me neither | Emma BrockesRead moreBut the event as a whole felt like an out-of-touch millennial nightmare, a surreal relic of early 2000s optimism that only a cloistered Silicon Valley billionaire could embrace. The fanfare was reminiscent of Steve Jobs’ unveiling of the iPhone in 2007, with two big differences: back then, the US wasn’t collapsing offstage – at least not so obviously – and meanwhile, it was abundantly clear why a person might actually desire the device being announced. It was the internet! In your pocket! When could we get our hands on this marvel of human ingenuity?This event – and much of the AI push, as generative tools are crowbarred into hardware and software that appeared to work fine without it – wants to harness the same energy without a remotely comparable product.To a layperson, at least, it seems that consumer technology has long since entered an era of solutions in search of problems – particularly troubling at a time when the world is facing so many genuinely intractable crises. As entertaining as it is to watch our tech overlords flounder on stage, it raises bigger questions, such as: who exactly asked for this, beyond the billionaires cashing in?

But in his determination to hound George Soros, Donald Trump wants prosecutors to become agents of his personal vendetta, facts be damned. That is the conclusion to be drawn from the instructionsissuedby one of Trump’s senior justice department officials to a group of US attorney’s offices across the country, telling them to investigate Soros’s foundation.This is the latest step in Trump’s implementation of the autocrat’s handbook, with the aim of chipping away at the checks and balances on presidential authority. Having already attackedjudges,lawyers,media companiesanduniversities, Trump now sets his sights on civil society. Soros, a longtime and extraordinarily generous funder of progressive causes around the world including in the United States, is Target Number 1. Trump shares this fixation with the likes of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Europe’s most prominent autocrat, who for years has used Soros as ascapegoatfor widespread and growing dislike of his corrupt, self-serving rule.As the name of Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) suggests, he promotes the free and public exchange of ideas. Soros made his billions by recognizing that markets arefallible. He gave awaybillionsbased on the insight that human governance is imperfect, too, and that the best way to compensate is with independent voices engaged in free debate. Having survived as a Jewish boy in Hungary under Nazi rule, Soros understands that we are safer when people can contest government dogma.Soros has funded not only human rights activists who defend open societies but also intellectuals and journalists who have pushed the limits of public debate, as well as organizations devoted to redressing a range of injustices. My former organization, Human Rights Watch, was and remains a major beneficiary.Despite his brilliance, Soros is too modest to believe he has the ultimate answers to society’s most vexing problems. He is always self-critical, deeply aware of his inability to see the full truth, skeptical of any moment’s conventional wisdom.At age95, he has stepped back from an active role in his foundation, which is now chaired by his sonAlex. But his vision still guides the foundation and is antithetical to Trump’s delusional belief that he alone is the guardian of all wisdom while critics are to be demonized and persecuted. Soros has the self-confidence to eschew the kinds of sycophantic lackeys whom Trump prefers.The debate that Soros has long promoted is peaceful. That is the essence of the open society that he champions. OSF recentlyreiteratedthat they “unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law.”But that has not stopped Trump from insinuating without evidence that Soros and OSF are somehow supporters of people who engage in political violence. I have known Soros for more than three decades and have never seen a hint of that. It is the opposite of who he is. But stubborn reality has never impeded Trump and his acolytes in their universe of “alternative facts”.Straining to justify the vendetta, Trump’s justice department points to areportissued by a group that calls itself the Capital Research Center. It is filled with tendentious, McCarthyite allusions about OSF grantees having alleged sympathy for Hamas or tolerance of “direct action”, a supposed reference to violence.One of the prominent examples it cites is OSF’s funding of the highly respected Palestinian human rights groupAl-Haq, one of six Palestinian organizations that the Israeli government in 2021designatedas supposed terrorists. But the Israeli government bandies about accusations of terrorism the same way it tries to silence critics with false allegations ofantisemitism. I have worked with Al-Haq throughout my career and have always known it to be a fact-based, principled, and peaceful organization that fairly and objectively investigates and reports on Israeli abuses in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.Another OSF grantee targeted is the human rights groupDawn, which was founded byJamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered by the Saudi government. One of its stated offenses is that while it condemned Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, it focused on the civilian, not the military, victims.That such “evidence” mighttemptTrump to order criminal charges against Soros under his newlyannouncedeffort to counter “domestic terrorism and organized political violence” means that almost anyone could be targeted.In persecuting Soros, Trump has taken on a tough target. Like Harvard, which successfullysuedrather than capitulate, Soros has the means to fight back. Moreover, unlike some law firms that cutdealswith Trump to escape his wrath, 100 progressive foundations haveannouncedthat they will mount a common defense if any of them faces Trump’s vengeance. That mutual support is the right response to Trump’s divide-and-conquer strategy.I would expect that the courts will promptly dismiss any action that Trump takes against Soros. Despite Trump’s efforts to bully them, federal judges have maintained their independence, and manycontinueto apply the law rather than Trump’s dictates. A fact-free prosecution of a well-known critic is a recipe for judicial rejection.But that doesn’t relieve Soros and his foundation from the burden of defending themselves from fabricated charges, which can be substantial. Trump’s abuse of his power to persecute an independent voice – his posturing to his base in utter contempt of the first amendment – should be widely and firmly denounced. Unless the pushback is intense enough, Soros may be Trump’s first civil society target but not the last.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs.

The Resolution Foundation thinktank estimates that removing the cap couldlift 470,000 children out of poverty.The National Governance Association, the National Association of Head Teachers, the Association of School and College Leaders, the National Education Union, NASUWT and Unison warned in the letter of the “critical need” to scrap the policy.The letter read: “As school leaders, headteachers, governors, teachers and support staff working in schools and academies across England, we are writing to you about the forthcoming government child poverty strategy and the critical need for it to fully scrap the two-child limit policy.“This poverty producing policy is harming the lives of hundreds of thousands of children and young people in our classrooms, and we are calling on government to put an end to this this autumn.“No child deserves to live in poverty, full stop. But the educational impact of the poverty that continues to rip through our communities and schools cannot be overstated.“Poverty is having an adverse impact on children’s ability to learn, with children living in low-income households doing worse on average than their peers at every milestone, and it is making it increasingly hard for educators to carry out their core roles, with 79% of school staff in all roles reporting this.“The government cannot claim an ambitious child poverty strategy while any part of this policy remains in place.“We work tirelessly every day to protect children from the harms of poverty, but we come together on behalf of the teachers, school leaders, governors and support staff we represent to ask government to meet us in the middle. We need bold action that addresses poverty at home, to ensure all children can thrive at school.”Speculation is growing that the cap could be removed. Last week, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson,said that scrapping the policy was “on the table”. Phillipson, seen as Downing Street’s favoured candidate for Labour’s deputy leadership, described the cap as “spiteful” and said it had “punished and pushed children into hardship”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t need to tell [that] to Qantas. It is my choice,” she said.Mobility aid or personal electronic device?Before Darongkamas and her partner left for their trip, Qantas’s dangerous goods team told them her scooter was classed as a “personal electronic device” according to International AirTransportAssociation (Iata) regulations.Iata does not name specific manufacturers in its guidance document for battery-powered mobility aids. It says any lithium batteries must have a UN 38.3 certification, which the Topmate ES33 does. On its website, Topmate says the ES33 battery can be taken on a plane.A Topmate spokesperson told Guardian Australia the ES33 “is indeed designed and intended for use as a mobility aid” and that the battery was “certified and safe for air travel when handled in accordance with relevant regulations”.An Iata spokesperson said airlines have to “consider and balance the needs of the passenger traveling with the mobility aid and the safety of the aircraft and its passengers when deciding whether or not it can accept a mobility aid for transport.”The manual Darongkamas provided Qantas as part of her complaint after the incident, seen by the Guardian, describes the ES33 as a “disability scooter”.Qantas appeared to have cited a different user manual, available online, when it doubled downand told Darongkamas her scooter was “a bike, electric bike, tricycle or electric tricycle” and she couldn’t fly with it.However, two days later, Qantas’s customer specific needs team emailed asking for the dimensions of “Jurai’s mobility aid” and confirmed the “mobility aid details” had been added to their booking.Thinking everything was sorted, Darongkamas and her partner left on 31 December. At Sydney airport on 2 January, they were told “at the last minute” they couldn’t get on their flight to New Zealand.New NSW laws to regulate e-bike batteries after hundreds of fires and multiple deathsRead moreAfter a night in the airport hotel, Qantas put them on an Air New Zealand flight to Wellington, which Darongkamas says accepted the scooter and battery.Disability advocates say they are working with the Australian federal government to implement clear accessibility standards after last year’s release of theaviation whitepaper, which sets out a plan for the sector until 2050.The acting chief executive of People With Disabilities Australia, Megan Spindler-Smith, said inconsistency between different airlines’ rules is a “massive problem”.‘A disappointing experience’In February, Qantas told Darongkamas “we sincerely apologise for any lack of clarity” and offered a refund of $616 in February for the two business class seats they had booked on the flight to Wellington. She refused the refund, aiming instead to achieve an outcome that ensured her “horrible experience” would not “happen to future travellers”.In April, Darongkamas escalated her complaint to the industry-funded Airline Customer Advocate (ACA), with no success.The Albanese government has promised to replace the ACA with an independent aviation ombudsman from next year.In July, before it closed Darongkamas’s case, Qantas apologised for giving her conflicting advice but said the information available still did not satisfy that the ES33 had been “manufactured as a mobility aid” to the required safety standards.Qantas said even though it “repeatedly liaised” with Topmate in China the manufacturer was unable to supply the required information about the battery’s test standards. Guardian Australia put this claim to Topmate, but the company did not directly respond to the question.“We understand this would have been a disappointing experience for Ms Darongkamas and acknowledge that our communication with her during the process may have been confusing,” a Qantas spokesperson said.Qantas said it has improved the communication between its dangerous goods and specific needs team.Speaking generally, Erin Turner Manners, a senior solicitor at the Justice and Equity Centre, said airlines have obligations under discrimination and consumer law but this hasn’t prevented discrimination and poor customer experiences.She said airlines should be investing in making their services accessible and that people with disability shouldn’t have to “take on big corporations like airlines and airports” to get a fair outcome.Explore more on these topicsDisabilityTransportQantasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for the prince went further, describing the quotes attributed to Harry as “pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son”.The spokesperson did not specify who the information might have come from.The Sun said Harry had confirmed parts of its report, telling the Guardian he “was given full right of reply yesterday in advance of publication and opted not to give a response to the Sun’s carefully sourced account of the meeting”.Harry’s spokesperson also corrected part of the Sun’s report about gifts that had been exchanged between the king and him.The Sun had initially said a framed photograph of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s family was exchanged.But Harry’s spokesperson denied the claim, saying: “While we would have preferred such details to remain private, for the sake of clarity we can confirm that a framed photograph was handed over, however the image did not contain the duke and duchess.”The duke carried out several charity events in Nottingham and London during his recent four-day visit to the UK this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The offences you are held on remand for are linked to Palestine Action and impact roles that are considered appropriate for you. The library orderly role is not considered appropriate.”Hoxha, who recently went on hunger strike for four weeks, said she had a striped green, white, red and black scarf she made in knitting class taken away because it was the colours of the Palestinian flag.View image in fullscreenTeuta Hoxha was removed from her library job at HMP Peterborough last year.Photograph: No credit requiredHoxha said her sister was removed from her prisoner call list because of her sister’s political views, said to align with those of Palestine Action, after she and two other inmates held in relation to Filton were told they had been categorised as terrorists by the joint extremism unit.Palestine Action, which predominantly targeted the UK sites of the Israeli arms manufacturer Elbit Systems and companies that do business with it, was proscribed on the basis of intelligence assessments, one of which said it was “mainly due to its use or threat of action involving serious damage to property”.Audrey Corno, 23, who is on bail awaiting two trials for alleged Palestine Action protests pre-proscription, said: “She [Hoxha] was arrested in November 2024, way before proscription so it’s completely banal for them to apply this retrospectively, and it’s completely punitive the way that they’re using this.”Zoe Rogers, 21, who is awaiting trial on the same Filton-related alleged offences as Hoxha, complained after she did not receive a keffiyeh, which had been sent to her at HMP Bronzefield.The response said the headscarf, commonly worn to express Palestinian identity or solidarity, had been withheld “because it features branding associated with the Palestine Action Group (PAG)”.View image in fullscreenClare Hinchcliffe, the mother of Zoe Rogers, who has been on remand in prison for a year over Palestine Action.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianIt continued that Rogers, who has been in jail since August last year, was awaiting trial for offences connected with PAG, which “has been formally recognised and is now treated under the Terrorism Act 2000 … In light of this, I considered the decision to withhold the item to be reasonable and proportionate under given circumstances.”Other prisoners at HMP Bronzefield subsequently had their keffiyehs taken away. Corno said the headscarf “pre-dates Palestinian Action by centuries”.A spokesperson for Sodexo, which runs HMPs Bronzefield and Peterborough, said, they did not comment on individual cases but that they managed prisoners in line with policies governing the entire prison estate, including “specialist multi-agency processes to assess individual terrorist risk and security status”.They said: “The removal of Palestinian keffiyehs has been carried out in accordance with the prisoner property framework, which sets standards on acceptable items of clothing and headwear across the estate.”A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said all prisoners were subject to the same rules, adding: “Flags, symbols and other items that might threaten safety, order or security can be confiscated.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city.”“The number of necessary troops is zero,” Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, said. “I’ve been so deeply disappointed to see the footage from a half decade ago recycled,” he added, referring to a recent Fox News reported cited by Trump that misled viewers by wrongly presenting video from a 2020 protest in Portland as new.A visit by the Guardian to downtown Portland on Saturday morning confirmed that the city is placid, the farmers’ market was packed and the protest against immigration enforcement in an outlying residential neighborhood remained small. There were just four protesters on the sidewalk near the Ice field office Trump claimed was “under siege”. One, wearing a chicken costume and draped in an American flag, held up a sign that read: “Portland Will Outlive Him.” Passing motorists honked in appreciation.The White House did not provide details in connection with Trump’s announcement, including a timeline for the deployment or what troops would be involved.Portland residents scoff at Trump threat to send military: ‘This is not a war zone’Read moreAta hastily assembled news conferenceon Friday night, Wilson said that the city had become aware of “a sudden influx of federal agents in our city. We did not ask for them to come. They are here without clear precedent or purpose.”“The President has sent agents here to create chaos and riots in Portland, to induce a reaction, to induce protests, to induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look like what he’s been describing it as,” Oregon’s junior senator, Jeff Merkley said. “He wants to induce a violent exchange. Let us not grant him that wish. Let us be the force of orderly, peaceful protest.”The senator also drew attention tovideo evidencefrom the local newspaper, the Oregonian, which showed federal agents using force against a small number of protesters outside the Ice facility, who remained peaceful.Although a spokesperson for the Oregon national guardtold the Oregonianthat no official request for troops had been made yet, convoys of dozens of federal agents, in marked and unmarked SUVs, wereseen on Friday enteringa federal building downtown and an Ice field office in a residential neighborhood that has been the scene of regular protests by dozens of protesters.“The President of the United States is directing his self-proclaimed ‘Secretary of War’ to unleash militarized federal forces in an American city he disagrees with,” Representative Maxine Dexter wrote ina social media statementon Saturday, referring in part to the Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth. “This is an egregious abuse of power and a betrayal of our most basic American values. Authoritarians rely on fear to divide us. Portland will not give them that.”Both of Oregon’s US senators and three of its House representatives had in recent days strongly rejected Trump’s claims about mass anarchy in the city as a fiction intended to justify the unnecessary deployment of federal troops as part of an “authoritarian” crackdown.Ron Wyden, the state’s senior Democratic senator, told reporters on Friday: “It’s important to recognize that the president’s argument is a fable – it does not resemble the truth.”“If he watches a TV show in the morning and he see Portland mentioned, he says it’s a terrible place,” Wyden added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But life has long since returned to normal, and barriers around the federal courthouse and police headquarters downtown have been removed.The president, however, apparently deceived by video of a handful of protesters gathered outside the Ice facility in a south-west Portland neighborhood broadcast by conservative outlets, insisted that the city has been in non-stop “anarchy” since 2020 and is barely livable.“Portland is, I don’t know how anybody lives there, it’s amazing. But it’s anarchy out there,” Trump said. The president then claimed, falsely, that most of the city’s retail stores had closed, due to arson attacks, and “the few shops that are open” were covered in plywood.Describing the small number of protesters who have gathered outside an Ice facility that has been illegally used for detentions in a residential neighborhood, Trump claimed, without evidence: “These are professional agitators, these are bad people and they’re paid a lot of money by rich people.“But we’re going to get out there and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that.”Representative Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat, said on Friday: “This proclaimed ‘war on Antifa’ is completely a fallacy. Antifa is an ideology, it is not a group, and so we’re extremely concerned with what he’s going to try to do with that pronouncement.”“Donald Trump does not care about safety. If he cared about safety he would not have released 1,600 convicted insurrectionists into the streets. He cares about control and authoritarianism,” she added, referring to Trump’s clemency for those who carried out the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. “Portland does not need the military. We do not want them, we do not need them, we do not welcome them to come here under his orders.”Trump, a Republican, has sent military troops to the Democratic-controlled cities of Los Angeles and Washington DC so far in his second presidency. He has discussed doing the same in Memphis and New Orleans, which are also Democratic strongholds.Explore more on these topicsPortlandUS militaryDonald TrumpTrump administrationOregonUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

But it also produces some of the most expensive electricity in the country.The power plant, owned by a subsidiary of the commodities trading giant Vitol, raised eyebrows in recent years by calling for record high payments to generate power when electricity was in short supply.Ed Miliband looking into more North Sea drilling despite Labour pledgeRead moreIn the winter of 2022, months after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine triggered record high gas market prices, Rye Houseset its own recordsby charging £6,000 for every megawatt-hour it generated. UK electricity market prices are typically between £60 and £100 per megawatt-hour.In January, Rye House was one of two power plants that were eachpaid more than £6m to run their gas turbines for a few hoursduring a spell of freezing weather.The payments provoked outrage from climate campaigners and consumer groups who have called on the government to hasten Britain’s plan to reduce its reliance on gas power to just 5% of the electricity system by 2030.Under the system to balance Britain’s grid when electricity supply is short, the National Energy System Operator (Neso) encourages energy companies to bid prices at which they would be prepared to power up their plants.But like it or not, these gas plants are here to stay for the foreseeable future. They will still be required to help keep the lights on by the end of the decade, according to official forecasts – and the one-off payments needed to make these plants economic over the course of a financial year are likely to rise.A price worth paying?VPI, which owns Rye House, believes the plant’s high costs are a price worth paying. The company justifies the staggering payments it receives on a per megawatt-hour basis by pointing to the costs of maintaining the plant for much of the year when it is not needed. The power plant is held in preservation mode over the summer, a period in which the plant still incurs some costs but makes no money.The rapid decarbonisation of Britain’s electricity generation, whereby the last coal power station inRatcliffe-on-Soar in Nottinghamshireclosed a year ago, has made the grid more unstable. Gas plants and their big, spinning turbines are needed to provide theinertia that wind and solar cannot, helping keep the grid’s frequency stable.Senior industry executives have warned that if companies like VPI were unable to cover their costs, and make a justifiable profit, it could spell the closure of Britain’s older gas power plants, which would ultimately lead to higher costs for consumers if new gas plants needed to be built to replace them.View image in fullscreenRatcliffe-on-Soar power station, the final coal powered plant in the country, closed last year.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianTo guard against this, the government’s capacity market mechanism was devised in 2012 to secure the future of Britain’s gas plants even as the country shifts away from fossil fuels. Energy companies must vie for contracts that cover the cost of keeping the power plants on standby for when they are needed. Separate auctions offer contracts to gas plants one year in advance or four years in advance.The competition between generators to clinch a contract keeps the auction costs as low as possible, since the lowest bids are the ones that win. So to earn a profit, gas generators still need to top up these earnings by selling electricity into the market.Rye House runs only 5-10% of the time, meaning its opportunity to turn a profit is limited. In the future, as the UK moves towards a low carbon energy system, many more gas generators will find themselves in the same position.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

RWE is the UK’s biggest gas generator, and also one of the country’s biggest renewable energy investors. Its plants run more often, meaning they do not typically call for “scarcity prices” on a par with those earned by Rye House.“These things have been debated for years,” Glover said. ‘Twenty-five years ago everyone thought relying solely on scarcity pricing was the right economic signal to send. As the years go by, we’re starting to realise that no one wants to accept a price of £1,000/MWh as fair.The race to find a way to recycle old turbine blades from windfarmsRead more“We’re becoming the fire brigade of the energy system,” he added. “You have to pay for the fire brigade to be around all the time. Hopefully you don’t call on them very often but when you do, they best be there and they best be reliable. Today our gas plants still make up a quarter of the UK’s electricity but this is going to evolve over the next five to 10 years. Eventually we will effectively be paid to be there, rather than getting paid for running.”Despite the arguable success of Britain’s capacity market, concerns over whether gas generators are making fair profits have prompted fresh proposals to reform the system. Earlier this month, research by a former government energy mandarin found that the governmentcould save energy users £5bn a yearby overhauling the electricity market by removing gas plants from it.Adam Bell, the government’s former head of strategy at the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, argues that the UK’s gas plants should be held in strategic reserve, available to be fired up when needed without distorting the overall cost of electricity in the wholesale market.The report, which was commissioned by Greenpeace, proposed that gas plants should no longer be able to sell power on the open market, and instead provide a strategic reserve of electricity, at an agreed price, whenever they are required to fire up.View image in fullscreenConnah’s Quay, a gas-fired power station in Flint, Wales.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAA senior industry source said that although gas generators are eager to tackle Britain’s energy affordability crisis, the proposals were unlikely to win over private companies. A second source described the proposals as “economically illiterate”.Critics of the plan believe that dampening volatility in the electricity market would undermine the incentive needed to spur batteries to release electricity, or for energy users to pause their demand, when supplies are short.But there may still be room for further debate on reforming the market, according to Glover. “We want lower consumer prices, we want lower gas power generation, we want more renewables. We’d like to work with them to achieve the objective we’re all trying to get to, but maybe with a greater understanding of the market,” he said. “There are different ways to get there.”Explore more on these topicsEnergy industryGasCommoditiesHousehold billsGreenhouse gas emissionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And yet the vast majority of media coverage of theclimate crisisoverlooks this critical sector, according to a new dataanalysisfrom Sentient Media.The findings suggest that only about a quarter of climate articles in 11 major US outlets, including the Guardian, mention food and agriculture as a cause. And of the 940 articles analyzed, only 36 – or 3.8% – mentioned animal agriculture or meat production, by far the largest source of food-related emissions.The data reveals a media environment that obscures a key driver of the climate crisis. Meat production alone is responsible fornearly 60%of the food sector’s climate emissions and yet its impact is sorely underestimated: a 2023 Washington Post/University of Maryland poll found74%of US respondents believe eating less meat has little to no effect on the climate crisis.Sentient Media analyzed the most recent online articles about climate change from 11 major U.S. outlets – the Guardian, Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune, CNN, Los Angeles Times, New York Post, New York Times, Reuters, Star Tribune, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. Opinion pieces, syndicated stories, and articles that mention climate change only in passing were excluded.How to reduce your food footprint: if it’s better for you, it’s better for the planetRead moreThe final group of 940 stories was collected using artificial intelligence and then reviewed individually for accuracy. Of all the causes surveyed in the report, including mining, manufacturing, and energy production (55.9%); fossil fuels (47.9%); and transportation (34%), livestock and meat consumption were by far discussed the least.Sentient Media’s editor-in-chief, Jenny Splitter, who helped oversee the report, said she had long noticed the omission as a reporter covering the intersection of climate and food. “We thought one way to start the conversation with other journalists and newsrooms was to put some numbers to the question,” she said.Mark Hertsgaard, the executive director and co-founder of Covering Climate Now, a non-profit that helps newsrooms strengthen their climate reporting, said daily news outlets struggle to emphasize the deeper root causes of climate change – often focusing on incremental updates over the larger why.“It’s not necessarily nefarious,” he said. “But as the climate crisis has accelerated, it is increasingly indefensible for news coverage of climate change not to make it clear that this crisis is driven by very specific human activities – primarily burning fossil fuels. And in second place is food, agriculture, forestry.”Hertsgaard, who has reported on the climate crisis since 1990, said food and agriculture had long been a “gross oversight” in climate circles. The United Nations climate change summithad no dedicated agriculture focusuntil 2015, reflecting its neglected status in the world of policymakers, thinktanks, and NGOs – which contributed into the media’s illiteracy on the topic, Hertsgaard said.Dhanush Dinesh, the founder of the food-systems focused thinktank Clim-Eat, said climate organizations sometimes shy away from the topic due to food’s fraught cultural status, which may have helped to keep it from the media spotlight.When you eat a burger, you’re not just eating a cow ... You’re eating the Amazon. You’re eating the earth.Michael Grunwald, journalist“Nobody wants to put themselves out there and tell people what to eat – it’s just too sensitive,” he said. “Even within the [climate advocacy] space, we see it’s quite polarizing.”That tension isn’t always so organic. When a 2019 report published by the Lancet showed how reduced-meat diets could feed the world without causing environmental breakdown, an industry-backed coalitionhelped to fundsome of thebacklash against it. Beef industry groups take an active approach to messaging, including staffing a24/7 “command center”in Denver that scans social media for negative stories and deploys counter-messaging.Journalist Michael Grunwald said that the food conversation today is lagging about twenty years behind the energy and fossil fuels conversation. He spent years covering climate issues for outlets including Time, Politico and the Washington Post before he started to see the links between the food on our plates and changes in the atmosphere.“I didn’t know squat,” he said. “Here’s this important part of the climate equation that I was spectacularly ignorant about. And I realized others probably were, too.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

I shopped at Dollar Store for a week to find outRead moreGrunwald’s new book,We Are Eating the Earth, unpacks how dietary choices shape the planet’s surface, playing a massive role in its ultimate fate. That is in part because ruminant livestock – particularly cattle – are a major source of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, that warms the planet 80 times faster than carbon dioxide.But feeding billions of farm animals also takes up a lot of space.Half of the earth’s habitable landis already devoted to agriculture, and most of that – about 80% – is grazing pasture and cropland for animal feed, making meat consumption a major driver of deforestation globally. Today, we clear a soccer field’s worth of tropical forest every six seconds, a loss dramatically worsened by humanity’s growing hunger for meat.“When you eat a burger, you’re not just eating a cow,” Grunwald said. “You’re eating macaws and jaguars and the rest of the cast ofRio. You’re eating the Amazon. You’re eating the earth.”And yet this toll tends to be broadly misunderstood, when it is not ignored altogether. Only about 15% of stories analyzed Sentient Media mention land-use changes in connection with the climate crisis.Princeton senior researcher Timothy Searchinger has spent decades making the case that we cannot solve the climate issue without rethinking how we use land.“Every tree, after you take out the water, is about 50% carbon. So forests store vast quantities of carbon,” he said. “If we continue to clear forests, we have the capability to dramatically increase climate change.”That conversion of forest into agricultural land takes an unthinkable toll, responsible globally foras much carbon emissionseach year as the entire United States. Meanwhile, the global population is expected to grow from 8 billion to 10 billion by 2050. So fixing the climate crisis will mean growing more food with fewer emissions on the same amount of land – or, ideally, even less land.“There’s kind of no way to solve the land use problems in the world unless there is moderation of diets – meat consumption, particularly beef – in the developed world,” Searchinger said.If ruminant meat consumption in wealthy countries such as the US declined to about 1.5 burgers per person per week – about half what it is now, still well over the national average for most countries – that alone would nearly eliminate the need for additional deforestation due to agricultural expansion, even in a world with 10 billion people, according to ananalysisby the World Resources Institute.Why our broken food system remains a climate disaster: ‘broiling the planet to stuff our faces’Read moreThough she acknowledges the 3.8% figure is low, Jessica Fanzo, a professor of climate at Columbia University, said she didn’t blame media as much as the challenge of translating scientific consensus into real action – a structural gridlock that’s made progress, and therefore storytelling, more difficult.“Governments are reluctant to push hard on dietary change, livestock emissions, or fertilizer dependence because they trigger cultural sensitivities and risk political backlash,” she said, by email. She also said it is difficult to take action on the vast, decentralized agricultural sector. Climate advocate and author Bill McKibben agreed, pointing out in emailed comments that 20 fossil fuel companiesare responsiblefor much of the world’s emissions, whereas food comes down to the actions of millions of farmers.Meanwhile, US agriculture policy is mostly geared toward ramping up commodity grain and animal-feed production through subsidies – an approach thatprioritizes cheap caloriesover reducing carbon emissions. And available demand-side solutions, such as meat taxes or meatless Mondays at public schools, risk touching acultural third rail.But in this divided environment, media can play a crucial role, said David McBey, a University of Aberdeen behavioral scientist focused on diet-climate links.“Information campaigns don’t change behavior,” he said. “But they do lay an important bedrock. If you want behavior to change, it’s important that people knowwhyit should change.”Explore more on these topicsGreenhouse gas emissionsOur unequal earthClimate crisisFoodAgriculturenewsShareReuse this content"

More than 6 million people signed one calling for Brexit to be reversed.Digital ID cards presented “an enormous opportunity” for the UK,Starmer said on Friday, as the government grappled with a civil liberties row over the proposals.‘A hacker’s dream’: Britons on Keir Starmer’s plan for digital ID cardsRead more“I know working people are worried about the level of illegal migration into this country,” the prime minister said. “A secure border and controlled migration are reasonable demands, and this government is listening and delivering.“Digital ID is an enormous opportunity for the UK. It will make it tougher to work illegally in this country, making our borders more secure.”He argued that the “Brit card” would offer ordinary citizens “countless benefits, like being able to prove your identity to access key services swiftly – rather than hunting around for an old utility bill”.Civil liberties groups have raised concerns over the proposals, with Silkie Carlo, the director of Big Brother Watch, warning the system would “make Britain less free” and create “a domestic mass surveillance infrastructure that will likely sprawl from citizenship to benefits, tax, health, possibly even internet data and more”.She added: “Incredibly sensitive information about each and every one of us would be hoarded by the state and vulnerable to cyber-attacks.”Addressing concerns over the government’s use of digital IDs, the culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, said ministers had “no intention of pursuing a dystopian mess”.The Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said her party would oppose any push by the government “to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens”.The Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, also criticised the scheme, which he described as “an anti-British card”.Writing inthe Daily Express, he said: “The Labour government’s plan to impose digital ID cards on all adults will do nothing to combat illegal immigration.

Written after football hooligans desecrated his parents’ gravestones, the expletive-laden work was described as a “torrent of filth” by the Daily Mail when it was broadcast on Channel 4, prompting an early-day motion in the Commons. It is now studied in schools.‘The man who came to read the metre’: Yorkshire poet Tony Harrison was the National Theatre bardRead moreHarrison grew up in a working-class family inLeeds, winning a scholarship to Leeds grammar school and studying classics at the University of Leeds. His poetry explored the tension between his working-class background and the arts, from the teacher who mocks him in Them & [uz] – “You’re one of those / Shakespeare gives the comic bits to: prose!’” – to the resulting separation he felt from his parents due to his education. In the poem Book Ends, he wrote of how he felt unable to talk to his father on the night of his mother’s death: “Back in our silences and sullen looks, / for all the Scotch we drink, what’s still between’s / not the thirty or so years, but books, books, books.”In 1962, his friendship with Nobel laureate and fellow Leeds graduateWole Soyinkacontributed to his moving to Nigeria, where he wrote the play Akin Mata, a version of Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata with African music and dance, and published his first poetry pamphlet, Earthworks, in 1964. Returning to Britain in 1967, his first collection The Loiners won him the Geoffrey Faber memorial prize in 1970.His 1973 adaptation of Molière’s The Misanthrope was his big break at the National Theatre. Adaptations of The Oresteia and The Mysteries would follow, as did original productions Phaedra Britannica, Bow Down andThe Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, which was based on fragments of a Sophocles play. But though his career would span theatre, opera, film, television and print, Harrison preferred to be regarded as a poet. “I hate being called poet/dramatist/translator/director. Poet covers it all for me,”he told the Guardian in 2015, after winning the David Cohen prize. “I want to do justice to my inwardness, my tenderness, my political rage.”In 1987, whenRichard Eyre’s film of Vwas broadcast, Harrison became renowned as a public poet, and a fearlessly political one, making headlines again two years later for his film-poem The Blasphemers’ Banquet, which was prompted by the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie and led to the Archbishop of Canterbury asking the BBC to withdraw it. In his 1999 film-poem Prometheus, the story of the titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humans, Harrison reframed this act as an example of class warfare, with Yorkshire miners facing up to Zeus and Hermes, who are agents of capitalism.In 1995, the Guardian sent him to Bosnia to cover the war. A poem written while travelling in an armoured vehicle outside Sarajevo made the paper’s front page. “Why shouldn’t poetry address what happened yesterday, and be published in the newspaper?” he told the Guardian 20 years later ina 2007 interview. “Yes, I’ve got inwardness and tenderness, but I also get angry and vituperative, and you have to honour that as well.” His 2003 poemIraquatrains, published a month before the “dodgy dossier” scandal became public, urged readers to: “Go round to Downing St, get Tony Blair’s hard disc.”Harrison rejected establishment attempts to bestow accolades on him, calling honours “the nature of British life. It’s horrible.” When named as a possible contender for the poet laureateship in 1999,he made his feelings clear in a poem in the Guardian, titled Laureate’s Block. Harrison wanted, he wrote, to remain “free to write what I think should be written / free to scatter scorn in Number 10 / free to blast and bollock Blairite Britain”. He also took a swipe at the monarchy: “There should be no successor to Ted Hughes... / Nor should Prince Charles succeed our present queen / And spare us some toady’s ode on coronation.”The current laureate,Simon Armitage, however, has spoken of how Harrison blazed a trail. “He has allowed my generation to do our own thing without having to worry too much about where we come from and what accents we’ve got,”said Armitage in 2000. “Trying to write in a way that’s representative of our voices was a pitched battle for him.”Speaking in 2000, Harrison said that he hoped “the people who knew me will talk about me over a bottle of wine after I’ve gone”. “But what I’m proud of is that I can read poems about my parents in Leeds or Bradford, and men especially are suddenly sobbing in the audience. That a short poem has touched them that deeply and brings that kind of response is better than a rave review,” he said, going on to ruminate on his own inspiration.“I always feel, especially in my fallow periods, that I don’t recognise this monster who finishes my work with such intensity. It’s like Rumpelstiltskin coming in and turning all the straw into gold and then going away again. I’ve done poems for the page, the stage, the opera house, television, film and newspapers. It’s all one work. You know, maybe the life is really about dodging about to achieve moments where the work can happen. And often you fuck up your life in order to get that moment. But that’s the way it can be when the muses have your telephone number.”Explore more on these topicsTony HarrisonPoetryTheatreOperaTelevisionLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

The week after Smyth’s suspension was announced, he was also charged over allegations a secret camera was placed in toilets inside the Scottish parliament – which he denies.The two MSPs’ suspensions are not believed to be linked. The Guardian has contacted Choudhury for a comment.After Choudhury’s suspension, the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman called on the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, to “urgently come clean on the reasons why yet another Labour party MSP has been suspended”.“The public deserve full transparency,” she said. “Whatever the explanation, with yet another scandal on the eve of their party conference, there’s no doubt the Labour party is in crisis.”The Scottish Conservative deputy leader, Rachael Hamilton, said Choudhury’s suspension showed “Labour are in complete chaos on the eve of their conference”.The Tory MSP said: “Confidence in Sir Keir Starmer is gone after a year of broken promises and U-turns, thedigital ID schemehas faced instant backlash, Anas Sarwar is engaging in bizarre attacks on independent experts, and now Scottish Labour have had to suspend another MSP.”Hamilton added that Labour should be “as transparent as possible about what has happened”.Choudhury is chair of the Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council. He was also one of the founding directors of the annual multicultural festival Edinburgh Mela, where he serves as vice-chair.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsLabourScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

The local council said it had not received any planning application.Reform UK politicians, including George Finch, the teenage leader of Warwickshire county council, have criticised the use of HMOs to house asylum seekers.Protests led by the far right over the summer have been blamed in part oninaccurate and inflammatory claimsfrom politicians including Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform, and Robert Jenrick, the shadow justice secretary.The Home Office haspromised to close dozens of asylum hotelsin the new year with ministers due to unveil plans to move asylum seekers into military barracks instead.3:40The truth behind Britain’s 'immigration problem' – video explainerBut there has been growing speculation about whether they could, or should, resort to a greater use of HMOs which – separately from the asylum debate – have been blamed for tensions in some communities.Louise Calvey of Asylum Matters, which campaigns for better asylum conditions in the UK, said the charity had received reports of an increase in hate crimes near HMOs as well as rumours circulating in communities that HMOs were housing migrants, even if they were not.“This anger around HMOs, this fearmongering around HMOs, risks hate crime against all racialised people,” she said. “There’s huge risk. At least if people are in hotels, there’s security there and there’s usually some form of support. In HMOs, it’s much more likely that people are going to be attacked walking around the street and it’s much more likely that those attacks will go unreported.”However, she stressed that the use of HMOs to house asylum seekers was not new and was unlikely to substantially increase.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There just isn’t access to that housing stock out there.”Calvey urged the government to tackle the asylum claims backlog and allow asylum seekers to work, rent rooms or live with family. “The solution is to get people out of both hotels and HMOs where they’re at risk of violence,” she said.The Office for National Statistics estimates there were 182,554 HMOs in England and Wales in April, although some councils believe this figure may be too low.Local authorities have taken steps to try to clamp down on the rise of HMOs in their areas, with councillors in Warrington and Bolton voting to scrap exemptions that meant homes could be converted into small HMOs (with six tenants or fewer) without planning permission.Last week, Phil Brickell, the Labour MP for Bolton West, urged the government to allow a debate on why companies such as Serco, which leases hundreds of HMOs across the country, do not tell local communities when and where they are placing asylum seekers.He said the lack of transparency meant proposals for HMOs ended up on social media and surrounded by misinformation.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHousingCheshireNorth of EnglandCommunitiesRacenewsShareReuse this content"

The prize was given for a short story praised by judges for its “powerful language, distinctive tone of voice, and bold, compelling storytelling”.Hitting Budapest, whichwonthe 2011 Caine prize, follows a group of six children who sneak from their shantytown, Paradise, into an affluent neighbourhood, Budapest, to steal guavas. First published in the Boston Review, it examines poverty, social and economic inequalities, and the dreams of children.“Budapest is like a different country. A country where people who are not like us live,” says the narrator, a nine-year-old girl called Darling. “Budapest is big, big houses with the graveled yards and tall fences and durawalls and flowers and green trees, heavy with fruit that’s waiting for us since nobody around here seems to know what fruit is for. It’s the fruit that gives us courage, otherwise we wouldn’t dare be here.”Speaking after receiving the award at the inaugural Words Across Waters: Afro Lit Fest at the British Library in London today, Bulawayo said winning the Best of Caine award 14 years after herCaine prizesuccess “feels like a moment to reflect on the journey”.“Winning the Caine prize as an unpublished writer back in 2011 was truly the kind of defining highlight to jumpstart a career,” she said. “It brought my work to a global audience, affirmed my literary path, and strengthened my confidence and commitment to writing, so that finishing a first novel worthy of the recognition bestowed on me by Africa’s most prestigious literary award – my first ever recognition – was non-negotiable.”Bulawayo was announced as the winner by Ellah Wakatama, the chair of the Caine prize.The judging panel for the Best of Caine award was headed by author and Nobel laureateAbdulrazak Gurnah, and featured novelist and short story writerJennifer Nansubuga Makumbiand film producerTony Tagoe.Bulawayowas born and raised in Zimbabwe and moved to the US when she was 18.Hitting Budapest came about as she was working on a book, and it served as the first chapter of her critically acclaimed debut novel,We Need New Names, which was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2013 – a first for a Black African woman – and theGuardian First Book award.Her second novel,Glory, a satire about the fall of an oppressive regime inspired by the coup against Robert Mugabe, wasshortlisted for the 2022 Booker prize.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

I’d never spent so much time at such an altitude in my life, so that was a challenge in itself,” Bargiel said. “Skiing down Everest without oxygen was a dream that had been growing inside me for years.”More than 6,000 people have climbed the mountain, according to the Himalayan database, but only about 200 have done it without additional bottled oxygen. A few people have skied back down, but never a continuous downhill without supplementary oxygen.It took nearly 16 hours on Monday for Bargiel to climb through the “death zone”, which is above 8,000m where oxygen levels are dangerously low.At the top of the mountain the air is so thin that climbers only get about a third of the oxygen available at sea level. This can cause brain damage, fluid in the lungs, and even death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not for Poles! Andrzej Bargiel has just skied down Mount Everest.”In 2018, Bargiel became the first person to ski down Pakistan’s K2, the second highest mountain in the world.In an interview with the Guardian in 2020 he said: “No one thought it could be done; even my own brother had doubts.

But a senior Trump administration official told theNew York Timeson Friday that Hegseth intends to deliver a “rally the troops” message – and that one of the primary goals of the gathering is to “get our fighters excited” about the new posture of what was recently rebranded the Department of War.A White House officialtold CNNthat the event is intended as a “show of force of what the new military now looks like” during Donald Trump’s second presidency.“It’s about getting the horses into the stable and whipping them into shape,” the military official familiar with the planning told CNN. “And the guys with the stars on their shoulders make for a better audience from an optics standpoint. This is a showcase for Hegseth to tell them: get on board, or potentially have your career shortened.”Hegseth’s team reportedly plans to record and publicly release the address later, according to CNN, which cited three of its sources.A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed the upcoming gathering to the Guardian, saying that Hegseth “will meet with his senior military leaders”, but did not provide any further details.According to theTimes,the Pentagon informed congressional committees overseeing the military on Friday that Hegseth intends to use the gathering to share with “most senior service members his intent for the department”, including new guidance on “military fitness standards and several other areas of interest”.Sources cited by the Post say that Tuesday’s address will be the first of three short lectures by Hegseth. The second, the Post reported, will reportedly focus on the defense industrial base, and the third on deterrence.The meeting has reportedly stirred unease and anxiety among some military officers, especially given Hegseth’s efforts to reshape the Pentagon and his recent firings of several senior officers.In May, heordered a 20% reductionin the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military and a 10% cut in the number of flag and general officers.

It could be a preparation for a potential budget stalemate next week, or it could be concerns over information leaks.”“Secretary Hegseth has fired 12 senior ranking general officers, so he could be firing more,” Hertling added. “Or is it performative theatre?”In a post on social media on Friday, Lt Gen Ben Hodges of the armycomparedTuesday’s gathering to a 1935 “surprise assembly in Berlin” where German generals were “required to swear a personal oath to the Führer”, Adolf Hitler, in the lead-up to the Holocaust and the second world war.Hegseth, a former army national guard officer and ex-Fox News host,respondedto Hodges by writing: “Cool story, General.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

New study challenges claims progressive films flop at the box officeFilm data analyst Stephen Follows finds no evidence that ‘woke-adjacent’ cinema is doomed commercially – and claims some genres may benefit from diverse castingAndrew PulverSat 27 Sep 2025 09.05 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 09.07 EDTShare“Go woke, go broke” is a movie catchphrase du jour, loved by rightwing culture warriors, who take aim at mainstream films judged to have adopted progressive values, and therefore are worthy of boycott and complaints. Films as varied as The Marvels, Charlie’s Angels, Ghostbusters (the 2016 reboot) and Pixar’s Elio have been attacked for their perceived commitment to inclusiveness and diversity, and in some cases their box office revenue appears to have been affected as a result.But is it actually the case? Film data analyst Stephen Follows, an adviser to Guinness World Records and author of The Horror Movie Report,has published researchon how audiences actually respond to “woke-adjacent” content in current cinema. First presented at the Zurich film festival on Saturday, Follows’ research suggests that there is no blanket rule for the success or otherwise of progressive-themed mainstream cinema, and adds that for some genres – horror, sports and music films in particular – diverse casting and identity-driven stories can have a substantially positive effect on commercial success.Conversely, however, Follows concludes that big-budget blockbusters face considerable risks if they indulge in “heavy-handed politics”, incurring a backlash if “audiences feel political messaging overrides story or character”. Moreover, weakening well-established characters or narratives – in films such as theJames Bondseries – carries what Follows describes as a “massive financial risk”. He claims: “Rewriting legacy canon or characters is one of the strongest negative signals for commercial performance.”Follows’ main tool for identifying audience reaction to themes and content – applied to around 4m publicly available comments – is textembedding, a machine-learning process that converts text into numerical values, which makes specific terms easier to identify. Follows then compared the strength of comments around individual ideas to profitability estimates to assess commercial impact.After analysing responses to more than 10,000 films, Follows concluded there was no consistent pattern to whether a film’s progressive themes harmed its box office. “Problems … are linked to execution,” he said. “Heavy-handed political messaging, clumsy canon changes, or anachronistic dialogue reduce audience satisfaction and profitability.”View image in fullscreen‘Identity narrative’ … Taron Egerton as Elton John and Richard Madden as John Reid in Rocketman.Photograph: Gavin Bond/Paramount/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockFollows added that “horror audiences, who are younger on average, are more open to reinvention and less resistant to changes”. Citing relatively recent films such as Candyman, the 2018 reboot of Halloween and Evil Dead Rise, he said: “Identity-driven perspectives, diverse casting, and reimagined canon often boost appeal by adding novelty and raising stakes.”In sports and music categories, Follows suggests that a number of films, including Creed III, Rocketman and A Star Is Born, had their commercial performance strengthened by “identity narratives” and “inclusive themes”.The biggest risks, however, are faced by long-running big-budget franchises such as James Bond, which is now being overhauled after beingbought by Amazon MGM, with a new director and screenwriter (Denis Villeneuve and Steven Knight respectively). A search is also under way for a new lead actor after Daniel Craig’s retirement from the role.According to Follows, departing from “core canon” can carry serious financial consequences. “Audiences react poorly when identity-driven changes are seen as imposed rather than motivated by character or story. The risks multiply when several shifts occur at once. A change to Bond’s race, gender, or nationality on its own would already be financially risky, but stacking multiple changes compounds the danger.”He adds: “[It] represents a high-stakes gamble with billions in potential revenue.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRaceLGBTQ+ rightsMarketing & PRFilm industryJames BondnewsShareReuse this content"

Treasure it!Lucy ManganSat 27 Sep 2025 17.10 EDTShareWe open, bright red Pulp Fiction-y letters tell us, on “Day Nine”. Not “Day One”! Intrigued? You betcha! We are in Los Tríos, Mexico – watching a woman watch the Mexican military police await delivery of nine bodies, to store in an isolated facility’s morgue. Which is fortuitous, because this is the beginning of a new thriller by Anthony Horowitz, called Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue (the title fits brilliantly). The series was originally developed for the short-form platform Quibi; but I thank whoever realised that this perfect piece of trash deserved a larger canvas and broader distribution, and gave it 45 minutes per episode (and, ultimately, to the BBC).I don’t know that anything has given me greater or purer joy this year. Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue is unabashed nonsense, without a trace of cynicism or guile in a world stuffed to bursting with both. I offer my undying allegiance to its Agatha Christie-meets-Lost shenanigans.To wit: eight days earlier (Day One), pilot Octavio Fuentes is flying Flight CBZ517 over the Mexican jungle, when he loses all comms with the ground. Now, he is flying Flight CBZ517 by dead reckoning – and the episode is called Dead Reckoning! But both “dead” and “reckoning” can have two meanings, so move a little closer to the edge of your seats and let your hopes rise. Octavio just has time to call someone with a semi-cryptic message about people not letting them live, before the plane crash-lands in the jungle, which is still in Mexico.Siobhán McSweeney: ‘Which living person do I despise? So. Many’Read moreFortunately, all the main characters survive. They have only their carry-on luggage and two traits apiece to help them survive until, they assume, rescue comes. There is spoilt rich girl, Amy (Jan Le), and her devoted new husband, blue collar Dan (Adam Long); brittle British woman, Sonja (Lydia Wilson); a fantastically miscast Siobhán McSweeney as Lisa, a southern Maga belle married to heart-medicine-dependent Travis (Ólafur Darri Ólafsson); the immensely cool and practical – even suspiciously so – purported claims adjustor, Zack (David Ajala). How many’s that? Six down, three to go.There’s Carlos (Peter Gadiot), who is a luchador; a Mexican wrestling star who holds the camp spellbound with his speeches about how much he loves wrestling, what it means to be a luchador and the mystical significance of bouncing around a ring in a silver mask in pursuit of glory. There’s Will & Grace’s Eric McCormack as a cowardly former doctor, Kevin; and there is Octavio himself (Christian Contreras), who has somehow survived a tree crash-landing through his chest, Kevin and Zack yanking the treeoutof his chest, being pulled to safety and then undergoing an unanaesthetised operation in the evening to relieve a tension pneumothorax. Kevin doesn’t want to do it (“If I try, I’ll kill him!”) – but in the end Kevin must (“He’ll die if you don’t!”). They boil and use 90% of their drinking water to prep, despite an earlier mention of tanks full of slightly lesser quality stuff stored in the plane that would have been perfect for the job. It is this kind of inattention to detail that I am so hugely here for.A further example – the fact that no one stays with Octavio overnight. They just leave him, probably dying, while they kip elsewhere. Of course, this means that he can be killed by a shadowy figure emerging from the woods (no spoilers, but he is billed as The Figure in the cast list and played by Bradley J Ibrahim). The rest of the gang put it down to post-operative shock and remain unaware of the threat. Terrifically, whenever someone dies a row of yellow stick figures pops up in the corner of the screen; whereat, one turns red and is struck through with a cross. This is a top gimmick and I commend whoever’s brainchild it was.Naturally, as time passes, tensions beyond the merely pulmonary arise as people try to hide rations, secrets and the fingers they’ve chopped off corpses to try to unlock their phones. The Figure merely adds to the growing uncertainty. “This is like some terrible nightmare!” says someone. I forget who. Just about anyone could be saying any of the lines. This is the genius of it. Meanwhile, the Guardia Nacional has retrieved 10 passports from the plane. Wait, what? But there are only nine bodies! Yes, and all unrecognisable due to the depredations wreaked by jungle temperatures and predators.Who’s missing? Who dies next? Who’s the woman watching the police? Why can I not stop watching? Is it one-star fare or five? Or both? How can something so bad be so good? How can something so good be so bad? Tune in and do – or don’t – find out!Nine Bodies in a Mexican Morgue aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

In several telling encounters, however, things went quickly south after it became clear many of those fans didn’t have the slightest idea who he was. “What makes you think I’m not in the band?” he would ask them, with increasing frustration. “If you’re in the Cars, then why aren’t you in the videos?” they’d say.‘This country’s gonna fall on its face. There’s nobody coming to save us’: Boston punks Dropkick Murphys take on MagaRead moreEven ardent followers of the Cars could be forgiven for not noticing that he actually was. In the clip for their 1984 smash single Magic, for instance, Robinson, as well as most of the other band members, appear for just 30 seconds, squeezed into a small corner of the screen. In the video for the Cars’ biggest hit, the worldwide smash Drive, Robinson and most of the others, only appear towards the end – as lifeless mannequins. Meanwhile, in the Magic clip the camera dotes on leader Ric Ocasek obsessively, while in Drive, Ocasek gets a whole backstory despite the fact that bassist/vocalist Ben Orr is the guy who actually sings the song.“With the Cars, Ric always had to be the one out front, calling the shots,” said Bill Janovitz, who has written the first authoritative book on the band, aptly titled Let the Stories Be Told. “One reason I wrote the book was so people could understand everything the other guys did to make the Cars the great band that it was.”In the process, Janovitz not only revealed the imbalanced dynamics that mar many major bands, but also the troubling mix of fear and insecurity that defined Ocasek’s darker side. Janovitz did so with the full cooperation of the surviving three members, including guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and Robinson who, besides playing drums, also designed much of the band’s visual presentation. Janovitz never had the chance to speak to the two members who have died, one under tragic circumstances, the other under a cloud of bitterness. Orr, the group’s sex symbol and most flexible singer, died of pancreatic cancer at 53 in 2000. Ocasek, who wrote and sang the vast majority of the band’s songs, died in 2019 at 75 from heart-related issues. The latter’s death made tabloid headlines when it came to light that he had cut out of his will some of his children as well as his famous wife, the model Paulina Porizkova. Though the division of funds in Ocasek’s will was actually a bit more nuanced than that, the last-minute changes he made to his estate had a vindictive edge that left a rancid taste in the mouths of some key survivors.In his book, Janovitz worked hard to balance the brilliance of the band’s music with the issues that sparked rancor in their ranks. Easton and Robinson think he achieved that. “There are some rough parts to it,” Easton admitted, “but I think he told a true story.”View image in fullscreenThe Cars at the US festival in 1982.Photograph: Photo by Elaine Hawkes, courtesy of Greg Hawkes“Let’s just say that nobody is painted any worse they actually were,” Robinson said with a laugh.The most positive legacy of the band is the music itself. During their imperial years, between 1978 and 84, the Cars sold nearly 25m albums in the US alone, driven by eight top 20 hits, including top five smashes like Shake It Up and Drive. Their debut single, My Best Friend’s Girl, broke the British top five with a fresh and clever style that presaged what would become a signature electro-pop sound of the 80s. To Janovitz, “it was a sound that seemed both old and new at the same time.”Key parts of the older aspects came from Easton’s guitar. “I added a lot of the rock’n’roll elements,” Easton said. “Every song had a hook, a little solo break and an interesting intro and outro.”At the same time, the Cars’ records drew on the arty drones of the Velvet Underground and the sinister sputter of the art-synth band Suicide. Other parts of the Cars’ music had an incredibly specific influence – namely, the mid-section breakdown in Roxy Music’s debut single from 1971, Virginia Plain. Even so, they updated it with their own quirky hooks and the unique sheen of Roy Thomas Baker’s production. “Roy didn’t mess with the music or add parts to the songs,” Easton said. “He was more into the sonics, which made us sound great in the studio and gave us that massive background vocal sound.”Janovitz provides forensic detail on the construction of those songs, but he’s just as thorough in covering the personal demons the members faced, especially their controlling, self-involved and secretive leader. Many of Ocasek’s issues can be traced to his troubled childhood in Cleveland. His mother was an alcoholic, and his father would beat him. A gawky kid, he was also taunted and often excluded by his peers. “Ric himself often said in interviews that he needed to be in such control because he was bullied not only by his parents but by other kids,” Janovitz said. “In every band he was in, you see him taking control as opposed to letting things happen with the other members.”“A large component of Ric’s personality was insecurity,” Easton said. “It was like he believed someone was trying to take something from him.”Ocasek also had a troubled romantic relationship early on, having married when he was 18 to a high-school girlfriend mainly because she had gotten pregnant. They had two children before Ocasek abandoned them to pursue a career in music. An expert compartmentalizer, Ocasek told few people about his first wife and kids. Even the other band members didn’t know until years later. “Ric would dole out information on a need-to-know basis,” Janovitz said.His ambition to ditch domestic life for stardom ramped up after he met Orr, whose smoldering good looks and sweet voice offered a useful contrast to Ocasek’s awkward appearance and rangier singing. “He knew they could form a great partnership, balancing the dark and the light, the edgy and the smooth,” Janovitz said.In the early 70s, the two moved their nascent band to Boston, drawn by both its large student population and the fact that its music venues had the distinction of encouraging original material from new acts. They formed the Cars in 1976 with members who each had a healthy amount of prior experience in bands as well as distinct musical tastes. “Unlike a lot of bands who met in high school as friends and who all had the same record collection, we were five very different people,” said Easton. “I think that’s a big part of what made the Cars unique.”Not only did they have a notable disparity in their tastes but also in their ages; Ocasek was nine years older than Easton, something the band leader worked hard to hide from the press – for good reason. When the Cars’ debut album came out in 1978, Ocasek was already 34, putting him in the age range of 1960s rockers such as Mick Jagger who were, by then, considered the old guard. That could be a major problem for a group being marketed as part of a new wave. By that point, Ocasek had also begun losing his hair and wore a wig, something he barely mentioned to anyone. To Janovitz, that was part of a cycle of denial. “The lying begets the insecurity, which begets more lies,” he said.View image in fullscreenRic Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes, Benjamin Orr and David Robinson.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsRegardless, the Cars broke big almost immediately, selling over 6m copies of their self-titled debut while earning the title of best new artist in a Rolling Stone readers’ poll over emerging stars as vaunted as Elvis Costello and the Clash. Unfortunately, their success only seemed to fuel Ocasek’s need to claim all the credit. He was abetted by Elliot Roberts, the band’s powerful manager, who treated most of the other members as expendable. “Elliot separated Ric from us,” Robinson said. “If there was important information to be shared, he would only tell Ric.”Roberts’ choice to focus solely on Ocasek enabled the band leader to try to replace Robinson at one point, a move staved off only after the drummer made a pleading case for himself. Over time, Ocasek became just as disillusioned with Easton, whose playing he considered too rooted in the past. His critiques could prove wounding. “It was kind of a ‘hot and cold’ thing,” Easton said. “I thought we were really tight, then something would happen, and he would shine me on.”Roberts put no muscle behind any of the other members’ solo projects, and, in some cases, prevented them from taking outside session projects that would have boosted their personal profile. The result limited their income, as did Ocasek’s reluctance to tour as the years went on, something only he could fully afford to do since he had nearly all the publishing credits and, so, the big royalty checks. The fact Ocasek rarely shared any portion of the credits with the other members frustrated some of them. Though he did write the core of most every song, “the demos he brought to us were extremely skeletal,” Easton said. “What the band brought to them – the different motifs and grooves and hooks – was the meat that hung on those bones.”“Ric brought us a ‘Ric song’,” Robinson said. “But we made it a ‘Cars song’.”Though Ocasek felt closest to Orr, the member he knew the longest, eventually he became jealous of his sex appeal and began to put him down and severely limit his input in the recordings. That exacerbated Orr’s growing alcoholism, which progressed to such an alarming degree that at one point he allegedly threatened to kill himself and his then girlfriend, saying, “This ship’s going down, and I’m taking you with me,” according to Janovitz’s reporting.View image in fullscreenElliot Easton and Ben Orr performing in 1985.Photograph: Ebet RobertsOver time, Ocasek’s personal life became problematic as well. He dumped his second wife, with whom he had two children, nearly as abruptly as he had his first spouse and their kids. He did so to be with Porizkova, who was less than half his age: she was then 19 to his 40. At the time, one of his kids was older than she was. As obsessed as he initially was with her beauty, he grew tired of her, leading to sexual affairs. Porizkova told Janovitz that Ocasek withdrew from her sexually years before his death, but he still wanted her to remain devoted. She remained so, nursing him when he became sick in his later years. Regardless, he accused her of abandoning him – his greatest fear.Even so, Porizkova was surprised when Ocasek left the grand majority of his estate to his two youngest sons, minus 20% for the middle two kids. Not a cent was given to his first two. An earlier version of the will had given all the kids equal amounts, with plenty left over for Porizkova. Though she did inherit the Gramercy Park townhouse they shared, which later sold for $9m, Ocasek’s catalogue was the real prize. After his death, it sold for $45m.Despite the more troubling issues the band faced, Easton said he’s anything but bitter, stressing, too, that he retains great love and respect for their leader. For that reason, he hopes the more difficult parts of the Cars’ story won’t taint their legacy. Certainly it didn’t dampen Janovitz’s respect for them. Still, the author admits that, for all his exhaustive reporting of the Cars’ story, Ocasek remained elusive to him. “I’m sure I didn’t get the whole of him,” Janovitz said. “Ric always wanted to be an enigma. In the end, that’s just what he was.”Let the Stories by Told is out on 30 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s a total delightHannah J DaviesSat 27 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareGlen Powellis Hollywood’s man of the moment, a Tom Cruise-in-waiting megastar who only has to breathe near a movie set to guarantee that a project will be a huge hit (see:Twisters,Hit Manand – of course – the extremely Cruise-yTop Gun: Maverick). It may come as a surprise, then, that his latest gig isn’t a blockbuster movie where he gets to share his surfeit of charisma with the world, but a small-screen comedy in which he spends most of the time smothered in latex and sporting a wig that will – for British viewers – almost certainly call to mind Corrie’s Gail Platt.The role in question is the titular character in Chad Powers (Disney+, from Tuesday 30 September), a Forrest Gump-ish southern college American footballer who is both unfailingly good-natured and deeply socially awkward (he’s described by one character as “a sweet, possibly inbred folk hero”). If this sounds like it could be in bad taste, fear not, for Chad Powers is, in fact, the alter ego of disgraced sportsman Russ Holliday, the sort of toxic chump who brags about wearing a blood diamond earring and proudly drives a Tesla Cybertruck. After fumbling a major championship – an “outrageous, improbable, inexplicable, painful loss” according to the commentary that replays numerous times throughout the series – Russ is persona non grata, less popular with the public than Bin Laden, we’re told. Disguised as Chad, there’s a way back, and the possibility of resuscitating his sporting career. Just so long as he keeps his face away from all and any forms of water!The character was the brainchild of ex-footballer and broadcaster Eli Manning, who disguised himself with some frankly terrifying prosthetics for a section on his ESPN series Eli’s Places back in 2022. But if making an entire series based on a TV prank sounds absolutely absurd, it truly works. Powell and co-creator Michael Waldron (Rick and Morty, Loki) have made a show that’s as farcical as it is warm-hearted, with a story as much about sports as it is friendship and navigating the travails of life. In Russ’s case, that means making an unlikely alliance with the South Georgia University Catfish mascot, Whiskers, who – under his big sea creature costume – is actually Danny (Frankie A Rodriguez), a theatre kid with some much-needed makeup skills. Danny’s also unafraid to tell it like it is – not least when Chad is considering plastic surgery in Brazil (“I think you’re having a psychotic break,” he deadpans).Rounding out the starting lineup areSteve Zahnas perma-frazzled Catfish (see what they did there) coach Jake Hudson, with Perry Mattfeld as his daughter and colleague, Ricky, who is desperately trying to fight off nepo baby accusations to forge her own career. Because of the sort of show this is, they get a lot of silly things to do: I have no idea how the actors kept a straight face during a scene where Chad refuses to shower, feigning a medical condition, and Coach Hudson senior has to tell him to “Tape up your peehole!”. But because it’s also a heartfelt show, they get a lot of really touching scenes, too, which – shock horror – feel far less cloying and Hallmark-esque than you might expect. Zahn is particularly plausible as a man trying to save his marriage, while also truly believing that he has “one of the hardest jobs known to man”.This, I think, is Chad Powers’ secret weapon: it really does have a lot of heart, even when it’s totally and utterly ridiculous, which it very frequently is. In a scene where it looks as though a dog has mistaken Chad for a rubber chew toy, I find myself both in fits of laughter and desperately hoping that this isn’t how his true identity will be revealed. Similarly, where else would running out of face glue be both a hilarious plot point and a potentially dramatic twist?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He recalls their intense bond, their last trip to Ireland and her memories of being romanced by Richard BurtonAndrew O'HaganSat 27 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTShareIfirst met Edna O’Brien on a mild spring evening in 2009. There had been a party to celebrate the 70th birthday of Seamus Heaney and I was running late, so I put up my hand for a taxi and a rumbling black cab drew to a halt. The door swung open and Edna stepped on to the pavement like Ophelia out of the weedy brook. She was a vision in black velvet and volumised hair. She paid at the window, clearly irked after some altercation with the driver, and when she turned she immediately took my hand and offered a Joycean, or possibly a Glaswegian, effusion.“I fucking hate the English. Do you?”“Not unceasingly,” I said, smiling.“You’re that Scottish boy,” she said.“And you’rethat country girl.”I made a move towards the cab. “How about I invite you to dinner on Tuesday?” I said to Edna.“Where?” she said.“The Wolseley?”“Perfect. Ask for the corner table. Lucian Freud’s table. If he’s not there, they always give it to me.”And so began a friendship founded on laughter. On the appointed Tuesday, Edna arrived wearing even more of her weed-like garments than before, and as we sat down (at the famous painter’s table) she asked for Sancerre. We were immediately into it: childhood, love, Ireland and Scotland, publishing, Harold Pinter. The waiter, who I think was Portuguese, kept being waved away by Edna when he tried to take our order, but eventually I held him by the sleeve and forced her to choose something. “We’ll have the small potato.”“Sorry, madam?”“The small potato. You have them. Delicious.”The man was totally baffled. “What about steak tartare?” I suggested. “A soufflé, maybe?”For 15 years, we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone“There was a terrible famine,” she said to the waiter. “In Ireland, Scotland. It’s all the same. And these small potatoes make all the difference.”After some negotiation, a purvey was agreed. I’m sure it involved herrings and small toasts and red meat and the small potato. By the time it was finished, Edna and I were fast friends and professional soulmates. She wanted to change publishers. She wanted to change agents. She wanted me to read something. She wanted more wine. But the stories flowed from her with the kind of talent you can’t fake. Edna was a pathbreaker, a brave artist, a brilliant diviner of human nature and folly, and from that night on, for the next 15 years, we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone.There was comedy at all times. Edna was anxious to a degree that could sometimes scupper any possibility of success. She often said that friendship was a benison, but just as often she feared – with some well-wisher, some visitor – that it might be a curse, and it made me laugh to see how intolerant she could be. She had what you might call the underdog’s sense of being done over, and had cause to think that way as her struggle had always been real.Her sense of outrage was a kind of energy. At the Duchess theatre, we once attended a production of Endgame, Samuel Beckett’s morbidly funny little masterpiece, and she made us climb 90 steps to look in on the actors. One of them, Mark Rylance, was perfectly nice though in a bit of a hurry, and the other immediately buttonholed Edna and suggested she write to Michael Billington, the Guardian theatre critic, to complain about his review of the play. “As if I don’t have enough to worry about,” Edna said as we thudded back down the stairs. “And not as much as athimbleof wine either!” Day in and day out for years, Edna would come on the phone speaking of “my present harassed condition”. She seemed to enjoy the fact of two writers bobbing separately and together towards their goals, but her instinct for friendship showed her when to go deeper. “We have to draw blood,” she would say, her face a mask of worry, as we sat down in her kitchen, belowJane Bown’s famous photographof Beckett. “He would get lonely sometimes and call me late at night,” she said of him. “Oh, Andrew. Beware of the man who calls you late at night, that’s all I can say.”“She’s a great part of the world, isn’t she?” Philip Roth said. The occasion was the off-Broadway opening of a play Edna had written, Haunted. She and Roth had been friends since the 1960s and she swore by his standards, by his industry, if not always by his editorial suggestions, over which she once threatened to excommunicate him. But that night their friendship was in full flower and he appeared at the theatre, proud, as he said, to know this tenacious Irishwoman with the bold prose style. She liked to say, of some of these older friends, that the friendship had survived many tests, but I was never sure if the testing had come from them or from her. (From them, she implied.) She was never reticent about sex or the part it had sometimes played in complicating a friendship. (There had been a fling with Roth but it had faded very quickly.) She liked men, but what she liked most in men who were also writers was their dedication to the task. She liked conversation with other writers, she wanted clues, and most of all she wanted an accompanying spirit to help as she moved things along.View image in fullscreenFast friends … Edna O’Brien and Andrew O’Hagan.Photograph: Bill HeaneyLate in her life, we went together for a week’s tour in the County Clare of her childhood. More than once on that drive, she grew fearful, I think, that the present-day was pulling away from her, and pulling apart her mastery of her own biography. At our hotel in Limerick, Edna told me she used to come here and look over all the churches and steeples, full of dread for her boys and her hopeless marriage. Some writers were rude to her back then. “Elizabeth Bowen,” she said, “was so condescending. She looked at me and said, with a stutter: ‘You are quite mad. Quite mad.’ She was right.”We’d arranged a visit to her childhood home, Drewsborough House. It was changed utterly, as Edna said, and I could see she was taking the house’s flexibility as an affront. “I couldn’t write about it now,” she said. “I could be drawn back into it, but I’ve done it.”We got back in the car and drove to the lough. “There’s going to be rain soon, I’ll tell you that now,” Edna said. Looking out at the fields, she played with phrases, just working with the sound of them, “the milk of the cow”, “the feel of the rain”, before rendering them into Irish. After a stop-off, she had “a little complain”, as she said, about some of the local men, their insistence and their clarion call of “listen now to me”. She felt there was some perpetual disquiet about her. She felt certain people had never forgiven her for her writing, which caused some of them to object to her plan of being buried on Holy Island (Inis Cealtra). We were headed there to look across from the bank of the Shannon at her final resting place.“Why do you want to be there?“ I asked.“Oh, because it’s beautiful. It’s isolated. And it’s full of birds. And trees all around it that are not cut down, and it’s wild. It has an old monastery covered in white lichen. And there are very few people buried there, so, if the dead commune, I won’t have much to worry about. I feel I could be buried in Tuamgraney where my mother is, but I want this house of splendid isolation.”We passed near the Bow River.“I used to love this little bit of road,” she said, “where the trees met.” I was driving but she put her hand over my hand. “I’m glad we came together. I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way and that’s the truth.”After a few moments, we dipped down a bank to the Shannon and we could see Holy Island through the slanting rain. “Oh, Andrew,” she said. “That is a very, very final thing. I have said I’m not afraid of it but I’m beginning to alter the script.”“What frightens you?”“The unknown. The nothing maybe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’d better organise my demise in a sensible manner.” Looking over the sound to Inis Cealtra, it was hard to think about her demise. I saw images in my head from that decade and a half we had been friends. All the suppers, all the appearances together on stage, all the travels. But here we were, looking through the wild squall towards something on the other side of words, and she was ready for it. “I cherish our friendship and thank God for it,” she said. I took a photograph of her at the water’s edge. And at that point she turned and pushed her headscarf aside. “Shall I do a Virginia Woolf?” she said.View image in fullscreenEdna O’Brien on her trip to Ireland with O’Hagan, with her last resting place in the background.Photograph: Andrew O’HaganEdna slowly declined over the next few years but something burned in her – a kind of determination, I suppose. One May evening in 2023, she asked me to come over and bring a few things from Melrose & Mortgage, as we jokingly called it, an extortionate delicatessen in Primrose Hill. “Oh, Andrew, what’s going to happen?” she said. “I’m dying.”I suggested we open a bottle of Laurent-Perrier, which somebody said was Oscar Wilde’s favourite champagne. That made her smile. On the table there was a copy of her novel The Country Girls. She opened the book and read a sentence or two, beginning to weep as she did so. “There are some things in this world you cannot ask,” she read. “Oh,Agnus Dei. There are some things in this world you cannot.”“Give me your hand,” I said.She cheered up then. We spoke about a new play at the National Theatre. “I knew Richard Burton very well,” she said. “He courted me. He used to come to my house at midnight with roses. I always used to say the same thing: ‘Where did you get a shop open at this time?’ He sat and talked with me. I never went to bed with him. I was attracted to him and I liked his personality when he wasn’t too drunk – too drunk, he was a gangster. He loved a story of mine, The Love Object, and he used to read it aloud to Elizabeth when they were having sex. He told me that. I said I’d rather not know, if you don’t mind.”She spoke about Burton’s old habit of shouting verse into the trees in Wales. She said that the trees we’d seen at Drewsborough House had actually spoken back to her in childhood. I was intrigued and I don’t find such things alarming. “My mind isn’t gone,” she said. “My mind is the same as it was when I was a young girl. I’m crying. I’m sad. But I was sad then.” We burst out laughing.I told her I was directing a play about Truman Capote , alone in a room at the Plaza hotel. “I met him, by the way,” she said. “Truman. He was so drunk. There was a dead, Black poet called Edna and he thought I was her. I was standing in full flesh beside him at a party of Senator Javits’ s in New York.”We then turned to a question she’d raised several times about me writing about her once she was gone. “You have a free hand,” she said. “You could talk about things nobody else could. People have a very mistaken version of me. I’m like a child, a very gifted child … intelligent, but with unmitigated foolishness. I overspent. I have put it in my books and I don’t talk phoney talk like Blanche DuBois, but if they opened my brain and picked out the alphabet of my life – very painful – always been worried, managing, managing, nightmare father, nightmare upbringing, nightmare mother, nightmare husband, getting custody of children … dirt and ugliness you could not muster.”I poured her another glass. Ten years previously, Edna had asked me to record some of her final wishes on to tape. “Make sure it isn’t taken over by neanderthals,” she said. Her voice is strong on the recording, making jokes, making judgments, reaching out to posterity. Later that week, with the question of her afterlife still very much on her mind, she sent me a letter in the post, which I put into a file containing all her letters to me, but this one I never opened. I suppose I couldn’t face the end of our friendship: I believed it would be the final word from her, though of course the letter was not the last one, and it wasn’t the last recording either. But the letter sat unopened in the file.She levelled a powerful look at me and took a sip, saying: I think we can finally say that the great enemy is proseccoClose to her death, she moved into a flat in Belgravia, and I went to see her for the last time with the usual cargo of champagne. She wasn’t really drinking by then, and she lay on the bed, beautiful as ever. “Let’s have a glass,” she said. I opened it and we toasted each other. She levelled a powerful look at me and took a sip. “I think we can finally say, Andrew, that the great enemy is prosecco.”We reminisced about that trip to Ireland. She recalled her time at the water’s edge across from Holy Island, in the midst of all that rain. But it was to Drewsborough House that her mind turned during that last visit. “You would not think there are so many words for ‘hope’,” she said. “I wish I could do more, but I won’t.”I read to her from Keats, her favourite.“O for a beaker full ofthe warm South.”Edna O’Brien: her fearlessness paved the way for today’s female Irish writersRead moreEdna was 93. She spoke of the old house and the trees surrounding it, giving her the setting for The Country Girls, published more than 60 years ago, eight years before I was born. She drifted back to her childhood and told me how she had loved the natural world. She expected to be back in that garden in the next life.The sun was beating down the day we brought her remains over the Shannon to Inis Cealtra, which felt all in all like theLake Isle of Innisfree, that magical world conjured by another of her favourites, WB Yeats. There was a man who understood the ascending power of friendship. “Thank you,” was all I could say to Edna as I dropped two shovels of earth into her grave and turned away. “Think where man’s glory most begins and ends,”wrote the manhimself, “And say my glory was I had such friends.”“The real secret is loving,” Edna had said that last afternoon in Belgravia. “So I would love to meet Chekhov on a train.”“Do you think you will meet people?”“He will be in a higher place. But I hope he won’t be near Putin. Oh God, Andrew, the world has gone mad, do you know that?”After writing the last sentence, I walked through to my filing cabinet and brought out the unopened letter Edna had sent me 10 years ago. I fancied it still smelled a little of the tuberose that swirled about her papers. I took a wooden letter opener that I once believed had belonged to the family of Robert Louis Stevenson. Stamped along the side, it says: “1850. To my Sweetheart.” Edna’s letter was pristine. Neatly folded. Carefully dated, it is written in her characteristic hand, full of her usual curlicues and anxieties, pleading for acts of friendship that I hope will never end.This is an extract from On Friendship by Andrew O’Hagan, published by Faber on 9 October.

My mum and I had recently moved out of a one-bedroom council flat into a Victorian terrace house in London; my half-sister had just been born, and I was training myself to call my stepdad “Dad”.My life felt as if it had been torn in half, right down the middle – like the photograph of their parents that Hallie and Annie piece together in the film. The 11-year-old identical twins (both played by Lindsay Lohan) reunite at summer camp after being separated at birth, and switch places in their plan to reunite their family.My own biological dad had left for good on my second birthday, moving back to Hungary.I had pored over photographs in the years since: black-and-white wedding photos where he looked adoringly at my mum, glossy ones of him throwing me in the air. I fantasised about what it would be like to be reunited with this mythical man whom my childish imagination had turned into someone great.Over the years, I received strange gifts from him on birthdays and long, self-pitying letters. When I got Facebook at 15, these messages flooded my inbox. He uploaded a grainy photo of a dilapidated church with the caption “The conception place of @Olivia.” That was how I found out that I was conceived in a church in Transylvania. Scrolling through Facebook, I also learned he had four other children with three different women.Despite these warning signs, every time I watched The Parent Trap, I became more determined to reconnect with the part of my identity I lost when he left. Until one day, having just turned 17, I boarded an easyJet flight alone to Budapest.I don’t know what I’d been expecting, but it was probably something similar to the airport reunion in the film, where the dad picks Annie up and spins her around. Although that would have looked a bit ridiculous, considering I was nearly an adult and the grey-haired man in a straw hat at the arrivals gate had his two-year-old son strapped to his back.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Our first interaction felt like an uncomfortable performance, and that’s how it continued. On the drive from the airport, we passed a prison where I was told my great-grandfather had been an inmate for malpractice as a gynaecologist, and over the next four days, my father made excuses to go out without me and seemed to enjoy shocking me.After days of him avoiding me, we set out to visit his mother, whom I hadn’t seen since I was two months old. Although we didn’t have a shared language, this was at least something of the emotional reunion I had hoped for, her tears communicating what her Hungarian words could not.At the end of the trip, I was anxious to get back to my family: my two sisters who were technically half, but felt full; my stepdad, a father in every way that mattered; and my mum, my only constant. How right they all seemed now.I have seen my biological father a handful of times since. He has told me he regrets how he behaved on that first visit. But his guilt does little to make up for the disappointment I felt at the time, when I realised this stranger wasn’t the person I had built him up to be. There had been no feeling of coming home, of finding my missing piece. Instead, I discovered something else: that I didn’t need to be reunited with a parent to become whole, because I already had been all along.Did a cultural moment prompt you to make a major life change?

Tell us about your nail regime.I started doing my nails about 25 years ago. Once I started touring so much, I couldn’t go back into a salon so I do it myself. It is a fast-drying gel. I’m usually really, really on to doing them because they’re so important – I can’t play guitar in my style without them.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

The first time it happened, I had to have a prosthetic nail for a while – I was touring so hard that my fake nail was lifting up the nail bed. It didn’t hurt because it happened so slowly, but I was taping it down. My prosthetic nail was a finger pick flipped around and attached with electrical tape on to the tip of my finger. I had to do that for a couple months. But for the most part, my nails are really healthy. I can’t believe I’m talking nail hygiene.[laughs]I’m quite techie on it.What’s the best piece of advice you have ever received?“You are your word in action.” That’s something I’ve learned by doing lots of men’s work – they are gatherings where men try to sort their shit out, [instead of] outsourcing that work. There was a lot of talk about how talking means nothing without being congruent. When you do what you say, and you say what you do – that’s an extremely important attribute to have as a human.There’s a great project called the ManKind Project that is all about the reclamation of the male archetype out of the patriarchy. We are lovers and warriors, but we’re also nurturers and carers. And the toxicness that we see around the world is because of the patriarchy. I think a lot of people think “down with the patriarchy” means “down with guys”. But this system we have doesn’t really favour a man who is ultra-sensitive. We’re beaten into a certain shape, and that shape can make us toxic in the world. We’re meant to be partners and companions and fathers and lovers – not just workers and soldiers and CEOs.Do you ever miss your hair?It’s right here! Do you mean my dreadlocks? No, not at all! I had dreadlocks for like 13 years. Do anything for 13 years, you’ve usually had enough of it.Your performances of your instrumental song Ocean have been viewed millions of times online. Every single version is a bit different – how has it evolved over the years?It is like a really personal workout regime – sometimes I’ll run for 10 minutes and then do 50 push-ups, and sometimes I run for 20 minutes and only do five push-ups. Ocean is kind of the same. How it sounds depends on how I feel. If something sounds really cool, I might do it twice. There’s room for good improvisation or a happy accident – a lot of us musicians live for happy accidents. I add to it every time I play it – and so the song goes anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes.If I don’t play that song in every set, the spell doesn’t happen with the audience. It’s a strange thing – I can be doing it alright and then I’ll play Ocean, and then the whole crowd is like, “Oh,that’swhat this is!”What’s been your most memorable interaction witha fan?I’ve had a lot of good ones! But this 11-year-old kid in Paris wrote me these lovely handwritten letters and asked to meet. He had learned Ocean probably better than anybody I have seen – and I’ve meta lotof people who’ve learned Ocean for their music exams, which has been so cool. But he played it perfectly. I was like, “Bro, what is going on with you?” He could do all the little idiosyncratic things that I did. He’s such a sweetheart – I’ve seen him since, he is an adult now. Sometimes he helps my crew at gigs because he wants to be a sound engineer. His name is Julian.What book, album or film do you always return to, and why?There is a book called Over the Range by Ion Idriess – it’s an account of a journalist who goes out on a patrol throughout northern Kimberley to investigate some murders. It’s a snapshot of 1920s-1930s northern Australia, it is like a whole other world.And I always seem to go back to the Christopher Nolan Batmans. I’m not into the Marvel shit at all, but Christopher Nolan’s Batman is so well done. I really just love his aesthetic. Christian Bale is a great actor. So is Heath Ledger. That is my guilty indulgence. Part of me goes, “John, you’ve watched this so many times. Learn a language!” Nah, I want to watch Batman Begins.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Unpaid work is always weird. Emptying my compostable toilet when I lived in Mullumbimby, that was a nice, dirty, skanky job. And I once shaved a man’s back at a Super Bowl party in California. My older brother’s friend was like, “Hey before we go out, can you shave my back?” Like, I guess? I don’t even know you!As for paid jobs, I did a lot of fruit picking after high school. I also did stained glass when I moved to California for a year after high school, for $5 an hour. Two hundred bucks for 40 hours a week. Yeah baby! That’s wild.Do you have a nemesis?Oh me. I’m my greatest enemy. I don’t hate myself – I just find that the person I say the worst things about happens to be me. Which is kind of sad.What is the weirdest thing you’ve done for love?I’ve done so many crazy things for love, and all worth it. But I’ll change the sheet on my wife’s bed. I don’t give a fuck about it but she loves it. My love language is words of affirmation, but hers is acts of service. Some people see love when someone says, “Oh, I thought of you today”, or “I knew that you had a meeting tomorrow, so I printed out everything you needed”, or “I’ve made you a cup of coffee and the kitchen’s clean because I know you can think better when it is clean”. My wife’s love language is that. So I’ll often change the sheets before she gets back from tour. She loves it, and I just find it strange. It is so funny how people receive love in different ways.What is the most chaotic thing that’s ever happened to you on stage?There was a fan in Antwerp who was bothering me all night. He was really drunk and being loud and intense right in front of me. I came up to the quietest song in the set, and he was singing along like we were soccer lads at a Manchester football club. For the whole song he was literally on my shit. I’m just surviving this guy and people in the audience were like, what’s happening? So the song ends on three beats – boom, boom, boom – and on the last boom I literally grabbed his face. My hand wrapped around his face like some alien and I led him off stage by his face. He was so shocked!John Butler is touring Australia 30 September to 5 October, then the UK and Europe for the rest of the year;see here for dates.

I found that the most healing,” she says. Since then, cats have kept coming to visit her garden. Not her cats – it is hard for her to have pets, what with all the touring – but neighbourhood cats, treating the place as if they live there. “I’m not saying anything, but more and more started coming, and foxes,” she says. She sees patterns and prescience in many things, now. “I don’t know. Or maybe I just noticed them more, because that’s what I needed to be around.”In August 2023, Welch had a miscarriage. Days later, she learned that the pregnancy had been ectopic, meaning that the fertilised egg had implanted in a fallopian tube, rather than the uterus. The fallopian tube then ruptured, causing massive internal bleeding. “The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death,” she says. “And I felt like I had stepped through this door, and it was just full of women, screaming.”View image in fullscreenDress: Rockstar Boudoir. Belt: Rebecca sweeting. Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownWe are in her summer house, at the end of her lush garden in south London, still blooming, late in the season, in tasteful shades of pastels and white. She sits on the sofa, wearing a long, pale-green gown, wrapped in a shawl. She shifts and reclines, stands up and sits back down. The door is open. The air is brisk. There is a pile of blankets in the corner, she says, in case I get cold. We talk for almost two hours about what happened to her, and how the catastrophe of it all became her extraordinary, excoriating new album, Everybody Scream. The record is as strange, uncompromising and brutal as she has ever been. It will be released on Halloween, and no wonder. It is full of witchcraft and fury.Welch has long been such a fixture of the British music scene that it can be easy to understate how massive she is. When the first Florence + the Machine album, Lungs, came out, she was 22. (We are meeting on the day after her 39th birthday.) She had No 1 singles and albums at home, and she conquered the US, topping the Billboard charts with her third record. When Foo Fighters had to pull out of Glastonbury in 2015,she was bumped up the bill to headliner, a feat so rare for a British woman that, since the turn of the century, only Adele, Dua Lipaand Florence have managed it. Her performance that night made it clear that she was already a headline act.View image in fullscreenFlorence + the Machine headlining Glastonbury 2015.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesIn 2022, she released a single called King. It was a conversation with herself about whether to have children, or to continue life as a performer. Could the two coexist? It contains the line “I never knew my killer would be coming from within”, and it was the opening track on her fifth album, Dance Fever, which was also partly inspired by a 16th-century phenomenon in whichwomen danced themselves to death. She thought, then, that she had made her horror record. “I really did,” she says, and sighs. “With that naivety … ”At the end of the summer of 2023, Welch cancelled a handful of festival shows, posting a note to Instagram explaining that she’d had to have emergency surgery, that it had saved her life, but that she didn’t feel strong enough to go into the reasons for it, yet. “Suffice to say I wish the songs were less accurate in their predictions,” she wrote, at the time.“Having that line in King was a strange thing,” she says, today, her lip beginning to tremble. “Because I had an ectopic pregnancy, on stage.” She talks through what happened, slowly and steadily. Two years ago, she and her boyfriend – a British guitarist in an indie band, whom she prefers not to name, as she is protective of his privacy, but who she has been with, on and off, since 2011 – decided that they would try to have a baby. “It was my first experience of even trying to get pregnant, and I thought, there’s no way, because I’m ancient,” she laughs. She was about to turn 37. She got pregnant the first time they tried. “It was a big shock. But it felt magical, as well. I felt I had followed a bodily instinct, in that animal sense, and it had happened.”With physical stuff, I have otherworldly strength. Emotionally, I’m an absolute nightmareThe miscarriage occurred early in the pregnancy, so early that they hadn’t yet told anyone about it. “I think, because it was my first time being pregnant, and it was my first miscarriage, I was like, OK, I’ve heard this is part of it. I spoke to my doctor, and they are not generally dangerous. Devastating, but not dangerous,” she says. She was due to headline a festival in Cornwall a week later, and made the decision to continue with the performance. “Emotionally, I was sad and scared, but I think, also, I was coping.” This sense of pushing through is not unfamiliar to her. A few years ago, she broke her foot on stage, bled everywhere, and still finished the gig before seeking help. (She notes, wryly, that the performance got a 4/5 review.) “With physical stuff, I have a strange, otherworldly strength,” she says. “Emotionally, I’m an absolute nightmare. Literally, will crumble,” she laughs. “But broken bone? Fine. Internal bleeding? Let’s go.”Ectopic pregnancies, like the one she didn’t yet know she’d had, are not common; according to the NHS, around 1 in 90 pregnancies can be ectopic. If there are complications they can be dangerous. On the day of the show, she was feeling unwell, looked pale, had started to bleed heavily, and was in a considerable amount of pain. Her doctor told her that, although ectopics were rare, she should get checked, just in case, so she made a plan to go for a scan as soon as she was back at home in London. She put on her white lace dress and got ready to perform. “Women! It’s funny. I took some ibuprofen and stepped out on stage.”There was a storm, and a gale, and there was mud everywhere. “I was in the elements, in the wind and rain, and I just felt something working through me.” The pain disappeared straight away. “And I felt this thing take over, the thing that’s always there, the safe space of performance.” The stage has always been where she feels at her most calm, a place where her chattering brain is finally quiet. “My sister says it might be because everyone’s looking at me. Like, ‘Your most peaceful place is where you’re the fucking centre of attention?’” She laughs. “It’s good, having little sisters.”It was, she says, an amazing show. On the tour bus back to London, the pain returned, but she woke up the next morning at home and felt fine. Still, she knew she had to get checked over. Before the hospital appointment, she went for a walk and got a coffee. She was so sure that it would be OK that her boyfriend didn’t go with her. “Do you know the fucked-up thing?” she says. “I didn’t want to go for the scan.

Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownIt’s funny that she is so anxious, such a hypochondriac, in everyday life, she says. “Because when something bad really is happening to me, I’m like … ” She gets up off the sofa and marches around the room, breezily, as if she doesn’t have a care in the world. “I think I’m going to be fine!”During the scan, the doctor paused. “And I started to panic.” Her fallopian tube had ruptured. “I had a Coke can’s worth of blood in my abdomen,” she says. Her boyfriend came immediately. She was told she would need emergency surgery within the hour; in the end, the surgeons couldn’t save the fallopian tube, and it had to be removed. “I tried to run away,” she says, and begins to cry. But, again, this turns into laughter: she had her legs up in stirrups. “I couldn’t go anywhere!” She lies back, puts her legs into the air, and mimes trying to run away. “Then I was so embarrassed that I was causing a fuss.”That urge to flee sounds primal, I say. “It was animal instinct. Like, run. But there was an [ultrasound wand] inside me and a woman I’d never met before, and I was like, gotta go!” She laughs, and exhales, a long, slow breath out. She had been due to fly to another festival. “If I’d got on that plane, I’d have come off on a stretcher. Or worse.” When she got home from the hospital, she remembers that she howled. “I think the sound that came out of me was like a wounded animal or something,” she says, choking up. “And then, that was that.” She clears her throat. “Ten days later, I was back on stage.”As a child growing up in south London, Welch was anxious and introverted. She found school exhausting, and didn’t want to go. She used her imagination to soothe herself, finding solace in books and fantasy. “I was very interested in the Bible and Greek myths andGoosebumps, anything that could take me out of reality.”Even the Florence + the Machine origin story was an exercise in imagination, at first. In the mid-00s, many of her friends were in bands, and she would go to indie nights in London, claiming to have a band, too. Drunk in the toilets of a nightclub, she belted out Etta James’s Something’s Got a Hold on Me, for the woman who would go on to become her manager. She got booked for her first gig the next week.View image in fullscreenFlorence Welch at the Devonshire Arms in north London, 2005.Photograph: Gregory NolanRecently, Welch’s mother, Evelyn, a professor of renaissance studies and vice-chancellor of Bristol University, dropped round a box full of press clippings from the early days to her daughter. “She collected them all from 2009 to 2010, and then she just stopped,” she laughs. She thinks her mother assumed that she would be in the spotlight for a couple of years, and it would end, and she would move on. Opening the box was a strange experience. “I looked like I was being eaten.” When she first rocketed into the spotlight, people were not sure if she was indie or pop. “So I’d have an indie face, but I’d be in high heels and a minidress, with crazy red hair.”Commercially, Florence + the Machine was a huge success from the beginning, but Welch was pulled into that British cycle of being “lauded and then brought down a peg or two”, as she puts it, particularly in the music press. This was the era of male indie stars in ripped jeans and dirty T-shirts, making as little effort as possible in the pursuit of “authenticity”. “When I was becoming Florence + the Machine, there was a sense that if you are flamboyant, it’s contrivance. Actually expressing your imagination upon yourself and upon your body was inauthentic and attention-seeking, or annoying.” That early backlash was tough. “It made me shrink myself. I was still big on stage and big in my art, but offstage, I made myself smaller.”On stage, it was always a different story. Last year, she appeared alongside Taylor Swift, twice, as one of the special guests on the blockbuster Eras tour, performing Florida!!!, a song they had written together for Swift’s album The Tortured Poets Department. (In true Welch style, her part was inspired by a short story about a woman riding out a storm in a bathtub, haunted by her dead loved ones, holding a chicken and a bottle of red wine.) How do you get involved in something like that, I ask? “We’ve known each other for a while,” she says. “So she just texted.”I am grounded. Or as grounded as a famous person can beView image in fullscreenRobe: Rockstar Boudoir. Slip: Turner Vintage. Corset: Rebecca Sweeting. Boots: Gianvito Rossi.Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownWalking out on to the stage to join Swift was something special. She jumps up off the sofa. “It was amazing,” she says, arms outstretched. “I will say that, yes, I’m someone who wants to hide from the vague humiliations of fame. But I did step out on that stadium stage with her and I was like, this is pretty fucking cool.” She decided that she was going to up her game, stop daydreaming, work harder. “After this, I’m gonna have to make some changes,” she laughs.In fact, mainstream pop had long ago caught up with Welch. Extravagant self-presentation is much more accepted now, if not the norm. She mentions Ethel Cain and Chappell Roan, both of whom have built careers around a persona. “They are allowed to keep their personal boundaries and create this incredible world and character. It’s amazing. But when I was coming up, if you created a world and a character, it was, like, ‘so contrived’. Now, there’s this celebration of people creating imaginative worlds.”View image in fullscreenOn Taylor Swift’s Eras tour last year.Photograph: TAS2024/Getty ImagesShe has a theory. “People really need worlds to disappear into,” she says. Fandoms are communities, and community is being eroded by phones. “So all these communities build up around artists, and I think people really, really crave it at the moment.” Welch says that Instagram is not good for her personality. She finds it too addictive. So she doesn’t post herself, and tries not to keep the app on her phone.Even so, she has a healthy knowledge of what her algorithm tries to feed her. “Like, why have I been looking at … raccoons and bardcore?” What, I ask, is bardcore? “It’s … the medieval Gregorian chant algorithm,” she laughs. She is nothing if not self-aware. She recalls seeing a meme that summed her up. “It said, Florence’s songs are either like, ‘and the mountains came down from the wind’ or ‘this guy hasn’t texted me back and I’m drunk’.” What does it feel like to be memed? She smiles. “When they get it right, they get it right. I can’t deny that that’s what it is.”Welch wishes she could do small talk, but she always gets it wrong. “It kills me. I just go in with something huge, it’s terrible.” Someone will stop her in the street and ask her how she is. “Well, I had to have my fallopian tube taken out the other day … ” she jokes. But she is more dry and funny with it than you might expect. “I am grounded,” she insists, then pauses, aware that her assistant has just placed lunch on the table in front of us. “Or as grounded as a famous person can be.” She looks down at her feet and hoots. “I’ve really got my velvet loafers planted firmly on the ground.”Everybody Scream is the antithesis of small talk. On it, Welch is grappling with a lot. There’s her new song One of the Greats, which she calls her “lunatic, enormous, poem-rant-joke thing”, and offers seething indictment of sexist double standards. In the video, she sits in the back of a limo, at night, in sunglasses and a suit, a rock star waving a cigar (she doesn’t smoke; it’s a liquorice stick). “It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,” she sings.That’s a cheeky line, I say. “Yeah,” she laughs. “It’s all quite tongue-in-cheek.” That one is about effort, and how much is required of women, as opposed to men. “You [male performers] get to be up there and be hot in a T-shirt, and everyone’s like, it’s amazing!” With women, it’s different. “Your body is the show, the clothes are the show.” Many of her male peers have three children and continue to tour, “because they have a partner with the kids at home. What I’m sacrificing to keep going is more apparent, and bigger, as you get older.” It is understandable that this is at the front of her mind, though once again the song was prescient: she wrote it before the pregnancy. “I will get those things, hopefully. I will get to have a family, but I haven’t had both. Or so far I haven’t, and then when I tried, I was sort of violently rebuffed,” she sighs.I don’t want to assume that it’s all autobiography, I say, but … how much of the lyrics are true? What happens, she says, is that she turns the real into the unreal, in order to cope with it. “I’ve shared parts of my life with [fans] that I haven’t been able to say to my closest friends,” she admits. “Addiction, and eating disorders, and whatever the fuck this one’s about.” After the trauma of the ectopic pregnancy and the emergency surgery, she thought that she wanted to put it all away. “But working again helped me. It was like little lanterns in a fog. I could just pick my way through. And I was so angry! There was a fury at how unsupported I felt by my industry, how clear it was, that it wasn’t built for me.”There’s a feeling of dying a little bit, every time I make a record. And, this time, I nearly diedView image in fullscreenCoat and dress: Florence’s own. Boots: Gianvito Rossi. Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting, This Story Jewellery and Florence’s ownIn trying to understand what happened to her, she began to explore the history of witchcraft. In the folk horror-ish video for the album’s first single, also called Everybody Scream, she commands a group of women who possess everyone they meet. On another song, Sympathy Magic, she explores going to a wise woman for a spell, in the same way that one might have gone to a priest for a prayer.She is aware of how all this sounds. “Modern medicine absolutely saved my life,” she says, “but you can’t go anywhere about birth without finding witchcraft and magic and medicine. Some of the first people tried as witches were midwives.” She saw a healer, whom she refers to lightly as “the womb witch”, a woman who helped Welch with her hormones and her natural cycles, who guided her through rituals of grief.For the album, she did her research and holed up in theWarburg Institute, a library in London that specialises in medieval and renaissance studies. Her reference points zigzag from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Rosemary’s Baby, to medieval mystics such as Julian of Norwich andMargery Kempe.Did she feel changed by her brush with death, by the possibility of having not gone for the scan? We talk about one of the myths of experiencing something traumatic – that you are no longer supposed to sweat the small stuff, that you are supposed to move forward with a compulsion to seize the day. “It hasn’t happened,” she says. “I feel slightly more obsessive and fragile and wounded than I did before. But it has given me a sense of toughness in my work.”On another new song, called Music By Men, Welch makes a plea: “Let me put out a record and not have it ruin my life.” In the past, she and her boyfriend always seemed to break up when she released an album, she explains. “I felt like I couldn’t have both. Or something would happen that would blow up my personal life. So there was a sadness of why did that happen to me? Why do I have this record, if I didn’t get to have a kid?”After an ectopic pregnancy, there is a greater risk of it happening again. IVF might be the safer option, but right now they are waiting and seeing. “Once the record is out, you get this burst of energy that compels you to make something, and either that is a record or maybe this time, it’ll be something else.” In times of stress, Welch goes back to Buffy. She is rewatching it right now. “Seasons six and seven are incredible television,” she says. “I will do my Ted Talk on it.”She often finds the business of being Florence + the Machine exhausting. “There’s a feeling of dying a little bit, every time I make a record,” she says. “And, this time, I nearly died.” With every album, she says, she is trying to get it right. “Did I get it perfect? Is it good enough? Will I be satisfied? Will you be satisfied?” She is still afraid that she won’t be taken seriously, a hangover, perhaps, from those early days in the spotlight. Now that Everybody Scream is about to be released, she is wondering if she will finally be happy. She is still not sure. “It’s the Martha Graham quote,” she says, meaning the late US dancer and choreographer. “It’s the ‘divine dissatisfaction’ that keeps you going.”Everybody Scream by Florence + the Machine is out on 31 October on Polydor RecordsExplore more on these topicsFlorence + the MachineMiscarriagePregnancyHealth & wellbeingWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

But they are like old friends, familiar and comforting, and, as such, I’ve been wanting to make a plausible vegan- (and tofu-) based one for some time. A little joyful nugget that could be taken in any direction, from Swedishköttbullarto Vietnamesebun cha. And here it is: I’ve flavoured the balls with a vegeatariansambal oelek, a zingy chilli sauce and one of my favourite ingredients, and drenched them in a lemongrass coconut curry sauce to put some heat in your belly and a snap in your step.Tofu meatballs in lemongrass curryYou’ll need a food processor and a blender.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4450g firm tofu, drained100g dried breadcrumbs6 tbsp sambal oelek– I like Lucullus½ tsp ground white pepper8 lemongrass stalks(160g), trimmed and roughly chopped (80g net)8 large garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped4cm x 4cm piece fresh ginger8 makrut lime leaves, deveined and roughly chopped6 tbsp rapeseed oil400ml tin coconut milk30g coriander, leaves pickedSteamed jasmine rice, to servePut the tofu, breadcrumbs, two tablespoons of sambal oelek and the white pepper in a food processor and blitz to a malleable dough. Transfer the dough to a clean work surface, divide it into four even pieces, then divide each piece in five and roll into small balls weighing about 30g each.

Fry the tofu balls for 10 minutes, turning frequently, until golden all over, then tip back on to the plate.Heat the last two tablespoons of oil in the same pan and, when hot, gently fry the paste for three to five minutes, until it smells fragrant. Slowly stir in the coconut milk bit by bit, then bring to a gentle simmer.

But even £200 cuts the risk of falling behind on billsRupert JonesSat 27 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTShareHaving £2,000 in savings means you are 60% less likely to fall behind on household bills and have a much lower risk of problem debt than someone with little or no money put aside.That is the headline finding from an academic study that has found that when it comes to the protective power of savings, “£2,000 is a turning point”.However, if that feels unattainable, the good news is that even small sums make a difference: savings as little as £200 can help reduce the risk of falling into financial difficulties, researchers from the University of Bristol’s personal finance research centre found.We all know how important it is to save, and putting some numbers out there may help give people a target to aim for.The research was commissioned by the Building Societies Association to markUK Savings Week. This runs until Sunday and is about encouraging people “to build better savings habits, whatever their starting point”.Here are some of the more painless ways to start or build up a savings pot.Get your money working harderThere are thought to be hundreds of billions of pounds sitting in current accounts earning little or no interest. You need enough money in your bank account to cover bills and outgoings, but if there is any left over, move it into a savings account, where it can earn interest.To keep the money from building up again, you could set up a monthly standing order to pay into a savings account just after you have been paid. Or, at the end of each month, sweep what is left in your current account into your savings.View image in fullscreenHave you got money in a current account that could be earning interest in a savings account?Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PASaving little and oftenYou can squirrel away money almost without thinking about it by using a “roundup” tool or app.Lots of banks and financial companies, from high street names such as NatWest and Lloyds to newer kids on the block such as Starling and Chase, let you round up any spending, usually to the nearest £1, and put the difference into a savings pot. So if you spend £3.60, you will be debited £4, of which 40p will go into your savings account. Some such as NatWest will let you multiply your roundups and send maybe two or five times as much spare change to your savings account.The app-based Monzo’s paid-for accounts offer access to its “1p Saving Challenge”, where it will move 1p from your personal account to your challenge pot on day one, 2p on day two, 3p on day three and so on. If you keep at it for 365 days, you will have amassed £667.95, and you will earn interest (currently 3.5%) along the way.Getting into the habitRegular savings accounts offer some of the best interest rates. With these, you typically put aside some money each month for a limited period of time.In many cases you do not even have to pay money in every month, but they arguably work best when you do. If you were to put £50 every month into an account paying 6% interest, it would take you three years and one month to pass the £2,000 mark, assuming the interest is calculated daily and remains the same. However, the headline rate on many accounts only run for one year, so you will need to start another one when the first ends.There are a number of regular savings accounts that do not require an existing relationshipOften, you have to have a current account with the bank offering the product. This is the case at Nationwide, where the Flex Regular Saver pays 6.5% interest.There are a number of regular savings accounts that do not require an existing relationship.Yorkshire building society recently launched the 50 Pound Regular Saver account paying 6%, which is open to all UK residents aged 16-plus and lets you deposit up to £50 a month over a 12-month period.If you put in the maximum, when the year is up, you would have £619.50, including interest.This account is available to open in branches, agencies and online (the online version is called the 50 Pound Regular eSaver).Stash a little, (maybe) win bigThe chance of winning a prize can add some spice to saving. NS&I premium bonds are the best-known option. When you buy these you are entered into a monthly prize draw where you can win between £25 and £1m tax free. The minimum you can pay in is £25.View image in fullscreenYou could strike lucky with premium bonds but there is no guarantee.Photograph: True Images/AlamyThe big downside is that they do not pay any interest and so are more vulnerable to inflation than other savings. The prize fund rate – the proportion of the total amount invested paid out to winners – is currently 3.6%. While you could strike it lucky, there is no guarantee you will win anything at all.Coventry building society has just launched Sunny Day Saver (2), an easy access account paying 4.3% interest and offering 11 monthly prize draws (the first is on 17 October). It can be opened with as little as £1 and there is no requirement to save every month, but for each month that at least £10 is paid in, savers will qualify for a prize draw to win one of 10 prizes of up to £500. Those who save every month for 11 months will qualify for an additional draw next summer that has a top prize of £5,000.Meanwhile, the savings and investment app Chip offers the PrizeSavingsAccount where, instead of interest, you get the chance to win cash prizes every month. Currently the monthly prize pot is £75,000, including a grand prize of £10,000. Every £10 you save is one entry into the monthly draw, although you need an average minimum balance of £100 to be entered.Benefit from Help to SaveThere is a government-backed savings account calledHelp to Savethat lets people on a low income get a bonus of 50p for every £1 they save over four years.You can save between £1 and £50 each month (you don’t have to pay in every month), and you get bonuses at the end of the second and fourth years. These are based on how much you have saved.The most you can pay in is £2,400 over four years (48 x £50), and the most you can earn from your savings in four years is £1,200 in bonus money.This account is for working people receiving universal credit.View image in fullscreenYou do not pay tax on interest earned in a cash Isa.Photograph: Chris Batson/AlamyUse Isas for tax-free growthThe government sets a maximum amount that you can save in an individual savings account (Isa) or Isas each tax year – currently it is £20,000. The cash Isa is one of the main types, and you do not pay tax on interest on money in one. You can get a cash Isa from banks, building societies and other companies.Check out thelifetime Isa, which helps people save towards their first home or for their retirement. Its big selling point is the free cash you get from the government: up to £32,000 in theory. You must be 18 or over and under 40 to open a lifetime Isa. You can pay in up to £4,000 each year until you are 50, and the government will add a 25% bonus to your savings, up to a maximum of £1,000 a year.Check for forgotten savingsThere may already be some savings cash out there with your name on it.A number of online tracing services exist to help reunite people with lost and forgotten accounts.A free service calledMy Lost Accountbrings together the tracing schemes of the banking body UK Finance, the Building Societies Association and NS&I (National Savings and Investments) into a single website, so you only need to fill in one application form.Meanwhile, if you think you have some premium bonds but you are not totally sure, NS&Ihas its own tracing serviceyou can use.Explore more on these topicsSavingsHousehold billsConsumer affairsCurrent accountsSavings ratesFamily financesBanks and building societiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wouldn’t it be nice not to have to think about potential traffic snarl-ups en route or missing connections? Just jump on a direct train and arrive fresh.That’s what these brilliantly accessible boltholes in the UK deliver – they’re all within easy reach of a train station and with everything you might need for a stress-free break on the doorstep.A wild swimming cabinin EssexFfion Francis and Ollie Speck quit their jobs in London to renovate a 15th-century former hunting lodge near the village of Thorpe-Le-Soken in north-east Essex. Alongside bringing the house back to life, the couple have built two cabins. The latest addition,The Lakeside Lodge, sits on the edge of a natural swimming pond surrounded by reeds and trees. From London, it’s a direct train (under 90 minutes) from Liverpool Street or Stratford, then a 20-minute walk down a quiet country lane.The aim is to rest and reset, and there’s a host of pros to help: yoga and breathwork teachers, sound healing, reiki and reflexology (from £55). Simpler still is a cold plunge in the pond, followed by a session in the sauna pod, or a warm soak in the hut’s outdoor cast-iron bath. An English breakfast hamper with bacon and sausages from the local butcher and eggs from their rescue hens can be dropped off (£25 for two), and on chilly evenings snuggle down in bed to watch classic films on the projector.Sleeps 2 (and a dog for an extra £20) from £210 a night,coolstays.comAn arty seaside hideoutin CornwallView image in fullscreenMousehole is three miles south of Penzance, near the tip of Cornwall.Photograph: Simon Maycock/AlamyWith sweeping views out to St Michael’s Mount, it’s hard to believe that the (now) beautifully decorated, glass-frontedLittle Pembrokewas once a rundown garage. The cabin’s mezzanine bedroom is the spot to hole up and take in the seascape these days – there’s even an easel and art supplies, should inspiration strike (the big house, Pembroke Lodge, was home in the 1800s to Walter Langley, pioneer of the Newlyn art school).Alighting in Penzance from theNight Riviera Sleeperfrom London to a morning blast of sea air is the loveliest way to arrive, even better followed by a dip in theJubilee Pool(seasonal opening, check website), but the station is also served by direct trains from Cardiff, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds and even Edinburgh. It’s a 10-minute taxi to Little Pembroke, or there’s a bus that stops just down the road.The cabin is tucked peacefully between Newlyn and Mousehole, and there’s gallery hopping and coastal walks to be had. Pick up a Beryl (the Cornish equivalent of a Lime bike) around Newlyn or Penzance to whizz off further afield. A welcome hamper includes Trink milk, local butter, sourdough bread (breakfast sorted) and it’s only a short stroll to Sunday lunch by the fire at historic maritime pubThe Tolcarne Inn, orMackerel Skyfor lemon sole katsu and crab nachos.Sleeps 2 (plus a baby and/or dog) from £230a night,littlepembroke.comSand and castles in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenThe seaside village of Alnmouth, Northumberland.Photograph: by Marc Guitard/Getty ImagesAnyone who has travelled on the East Coast Main Line will have glimpsed Northumberland’s spectacular coastline when the train curves towards the North Sea, giving those on the east side of the carriages a front-row seat. But rather than speeding on through, hop off at the village of Alnmouth (3½ to four hours from London, one from Edinburgh, two from Leeds) with its pastel houses and seabirds wading in the Aln estuary.Overlooking the golf course to the sandy beach, two-bedroomMarine House Cottageis only a five-minute taxi from the station (or a mile’s walk; swing by Scott’s deli for supplies). Outside there’s a raised terrace that looks out to sea, while the window seat in the main bedroom is the spot for wave-watching and book-reading.Bikes (standard or e-bikes) can be delivered to the house, and from there the traffic-freeAln Valley cyclewayruns over to Alnwick (kids will love the Harry Potter-inspired broomstick training sessions at the castle) or pedal south to Warkworth Castle on theCoast and Castlesroute.

Borrow some boots from the welly wall for autumn rambles through nearby woodlands, along the Kennet and Avon Canal or nearby vineyard Winding Wood.

Inside, the mezzanine bed has a duvet made from plastic bottles, and the sleek, all-Scottish design includes Amy Britton tweeds, SkyeSkyns sheepskins and organic Siabann body products.The biologist-run estate has a 10-year plan to protect and enhance biodiversity, which visitors can learn about on a history and wildlife tour (£40pp). There’s oodles to do: cycling on gravel tracks, outdoor yoga sessions (from £65pp), walks through neighbouring Devilla Forest (look out for red squirrels) or through birch trees to a picnic set up in the woods (from £65 for two). After a day’s exploring, nearby Polly’s Pantry delivers hampers, or chef Douglas MacNair can pre-prepare a feast of local produce to cook over the bothy’s firepit (£75 for two).Mertrick sleeps 2 from £145 a night,kiphideaways.comNew budget hotel in the LakeDistrictView image in fullscreenA room at The Penn in WindermereCompared with most rural regions, the Lake District is brilliantly accessible by public transport. Oxenholme, on the West Coast Main Line, is less than three hours from London, under two from Glasgow and just over an hour from Manchester, with plentiful local rail and bus routes from there. It’s 20 minutes by train from Oxenholme to Windermere, and just a two-minute walk toThe Penn, a new room-only (no reception, no restaurant) hotel concept in a 19th-century stone house in the heart of the town.Check-in by keypad keeps prices down; the smallest doubles are snug, but roomier ones with rolltop baths are only around £30 a night more. From cosy crashpads to a suite with an extra bed for a child, each is done out in earthy colours with jazzily tiled bathrooms. There’s a Nespresso machine, kettle and mini-Smeg fridge filled with soft drinks in bedrooms, but it’s only an amble toHomeground CafeorToastfor breakfast, followed by the lake shore for a swim, or up Orrest Head (Wainwright’s first Lakeland hike).

The oldest one and the middle one are sitting at the table in front of their laptops, surrounded by dirty mugs and plates.“Another working from home day, I see,” my wife says.“Yes,” says the middle one.“How was it?” says the oldest one.“The weather was appalling,” my wife says. “Your father hasn’t spoken since the dog ran off at a farm shop we stopped at on the way back.”Everyone turns to look at me. I say: nothing.We’ve stopped at the same farm shop before, because it’s convenient and has a dog run – a big fenced off field with a gate just beyond the car park. But on busy days the top part of the field becomes an overflow car park, and the gate remains open. Today was a busy day.My wife went off to the farm shop while I took the dog to the field, on a lead, with a ball. It was clear from the moment we left the car the dog would have preferred to go with my wife.“That’s life,” I said as we tramped across the wet grass. “We don’t always get to do what we want.”By the time we reached the far end of the field the dog was fixated on the ball in my hand.“Sit,” I said. The dog sat.“So,” I said, “I’m going to unclip the lead now, and then I will throw the ball.”The dog looked at the ball in my hand, then at me, and then at the ball.The dog watched the ball go, and then turned and ran in the opposite direction, across the field and the car park, in the direction of the farm shopI unclipped the lead, and held up the ball. The dog stood to attention, staring at the ball. I threw the ball downhill, toward a corner fence post. The dog watched it go, and then turned and ran in the opposite direction, across the field, through the gate and across the car park, in the direction of the farm shop.By the time I got to the shop entrance, I was out of breath.“Black dog?” said a man standing there.“Yeah,” I said, panting.“That way,” he said, pointing to the farm shop.Inside the shop another customer took one look at me and immediately pointed down an aisle. At the end of that aisle someone else pointed me up another. In this manner I was directed out the back door, across a paved dining area and eventually round to the front door again. On my second trip through the shop I spotted my wife standing in a queue.“The dog’s gone,” I said.“Gone where?” she said.“Dunno. I thought I was quite close to catching up at one point, but now the trail has …”“There,” my wife said, pointing out the window, where a man was standing by a picnic table holding the dog by the collar. I walked back out through the sliding doors.“She’s very sweet,” the man said to me, causing me to roll my eyes and snort at the very moment I should have said thank you.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

On his command the dog spins clockwise, sits, lies down, rolls over.“This is actually an application,” my wife says, reading.“Do I have to go to dog school?” I say. “I don’t want to go to dog school.” It’s the first thing I’ve said in three hours, and no one pays me any attention.My wife picks up a pen and starts filling in the first page of the application.“Jumping up at people,” she says. “Tick.”The middle one turns his back to the dog, and the dog steps between his legs, sits and looks up at him, awaiting the next command.“Pulls when walked on a lead, tick,” my wife says. “Runs away and will not return when called.”“Tick,” I say.“Christ, I hope we get in,” my wife says. I turn to the dog.“I don’t see you making it to the interview stage,” I say.“You’ll have to be home schooled!” says the middle one. He slaps his chest, and the dog jumps up at him.“Don’t teach her that,” I say.“She won’t like school,” my wife says, “but she’s got to learn.”The dog and the middle one begin to dance.Explore more on these topicsFamilyThe Tim Dowling columnPetsDogsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Is it changing what the US thinks of scandal?President has shouted from rooftops what his predecessors would have tried to cover up for fear of ending their careersDavid Smithin WashingtonSat 27 Sep 2025 14.33 EDTFirst published on Sat 27 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareAs theWatergate scandalunfolded, new editions of the Washington Post newspaper were rushed over to the White House at night so Richard Nixon, the president, could brace for each devastating revelation.Half a century later,Donald Trumpdoes not seem to fear explosive front page headlines or shocking disclosures of malfeasance. Usually because he has written them himself.The US president’s determination to break from his predecessors includes a willingness to shout from the rooftops of misconduct past presidents would have strained every sinew to conceal.And the consequence, observers say, is that Trump’s brazen approach earns him perverse credit for authenticity and takes the sting out of scandals that used to be career-ending when uncovered by muckraking journalists.‘Dangerous abuse of power’: lawmakers sound alarm over Comey indictmentRead more“This is a dangerous notion that, just because a president chooses to be corrupt in public openly, it’s OK,” saidLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. “People say, well, if it were really corrupt, it would be hidden. It’s a false assumption, but many people have it. It’s a new theory of scandal.”Trump delivered one of his most blatant examples last weekend. In a social media post addressed directly to Pam Bondi, the attorney general,the president fumedover the lack of legal action against James Comey, the former FBI director, Adam Schiff, the California senator, and Letitia James, the New York attorney general.“We can’t delay any longer, it’s killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW,” he wrote, before deleting the message and posting another supportive of Bondi.It was a glaringly obvious effort to order the justice department to take action against his political opponents. On Thursday the agency followed through by charging Comey with false statements and obstruction over congressional testimony about the investigation into contacts between Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia.Democrats described it as “a disgraceful attack on the rule of law”, the latest in a series of moves that have threatened the justice department’s traditional independence. But Republicans, who five decades ago forced Nixon to resign over theWatergateburglary and ensuing cover-up, were mostly silent. There was no hint of impeaching Trump over what many saw as an impeachable offence.Richard Painter, a former chief White House ethics lawyer, said: “It’s what prosecutors do in dictatorships. They want to run up this Comey thing that has no merit to it. That’s what they do in Russia. You piss off Putin and end up in some gulag somewhere. That’s not, I thought, how we want to run our country.”It’s what prosecutors do in dictatorships. They want to run up this Comey thing that has no merit to it. That’s what they do in Russia.Richard PainterIf Trump’s shamelessness is one superpower, his ability to flood the zone is another. He has spent the past decade proving the thesis that while one crisis can topple a politician, a hundred crises are subject to the law of diminishing returns. “It’s Watergate, Every Day,”read a headlineon the Bulwark website this week.In a 2005 conversationcaptured on an Access Hollywood tapereleased in 2016, he described his approach to women: “I just start kissing them ... And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything ... Grab ‘em by the pussy.”He has urged foreign governments to investigate political opponents. During a 2016 campaign rally, Trump said, “Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” referring to rival Hillary Clinton’s deleted emails. In 2019 hepublicly called on Chinato target Joe Biden, saying: “China should start an investigation into the Bidens.”In a 2017 NBC News interview, Trump openly stated that he fired Comey because of “this Russia thing”, referring to an investigation into Russian election interference. This admission was cited in special counsel Robert Mueller’s report as potential evidence of obstruction of justice, yet Trump framed it as a decisive action rather than wrongdoing.Trump expressed no contrition over the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021 but rather persisted with his false claim of a stolen election, hailed the rioters as patriots andissued a blanket pardonof them on his first day back in office.In May this year, the president said he will accept a$400m luxury plane from Qatarand use it as Air Force One, defending the arrangement as a “gesture of good faith” despite concerns that it could violate the US constitution’s emoluments clause. The Trump Organization, run by the president’s two oldest sons, struck a series of lucrative deals in the Middle East.It becomes background noise ... What’s Trump done today? Then you shrug your shoulders and have your third cup of coffeeLarry SabatoThe breaches have come so thick and fast that they have become unremarkable to a numbed, desensitised audience. Sabato commented: “It becomes background noise. If there’s bad news about a particular person or category of public policy then it’s less significant because you expect it. What’s Trump done today? Then you shrug your shoulders and have your third cup of coffee.”Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, agrees that “Trump being Trump” no longer has shock value, especially since he previewed many of his actions during the election campaign. “It’s normalised versus when someone acts completely out of character: ‘Whoa, where did that come from? I never would have expected that person to act this way.’”The lightning-paced news cycle makes it easy for Trump to move on from the scandal du jour, Bardella adds. “Watergate was so powerful,[Monica] Lewinskywas so powerful because it was a singular focus for an extended period of time. Now we consider a long news cycle something that lasts actually an entire week, whereas before a week was a blip on the radar.”Even so, Trump has faced a barrage of lawsuits, ethical complaints and demands for investigations. But Republicans control both chambers of Congress and have shown little appetite for imposing accountability. He has spent a decade purging critics from the party and reshaping it in his own image.Wendy Schiller,a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “The institutional structures that should be countervailing, that should be pushing up against this and saying: ‘Oh, this is terrible, he’s breaking the law’, are completely absent. They’ve been co-opted or taken over by the Republican party or the conservative supreme court.“There isn’t a counter voice to say to the American people this is not acceptable behaviour. I don’t think Trump gets credit for flooding the zone or that his strategy is particularly remarkable. It’s that he has neutered the Congress and bought off the supreme court. There isn’t anybody, literally, who can stop him.”View image in fullscreenPam Bondi, the attorney general.Photograph: Alex Brandon/APTrump’s boasting about conduct that others would hide also strikes a particular chord with his Make America great again (Maga) support base. In an October 2016 presidential debate, when Hillary Clinton accused him of avoiding taxes for years, Trump responded defiantly: “That makes me smart.”In a subsequent episode of Saturday Night Live, the comedian Dave Chappelle argued that such moments humanised Trump: his blunt admission of gaming a rigged system made him relatable, not elitist.Chappelle said: “The reason he’s loved is because people in Ohio have never seen somebody like him. He’s what I call an honest liar.”Years later, that still holds with the Maga faithful.John Zogby, an author and pollster, observed: “For voters who want to rage against the machine, instead of being elected president and head of the machine, he’s the guy who feels he’s been put in place to both enforce and live the rage against the machine.“The very fact that he breaks all the rules so brazenly – takes foreign trips and makes personal business deals – adds to the appeal. He’s the baddest cowboy in town. He does and says what a lot of people wish that they could do and say and he gets away with it. With Donald Trump, the one piece of authenticity is he is exactly what he says he is.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpUS politicsWatergatefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Autumn is on its way which means his small home is less stifling. He enjoys his work. His four children are well; so too is his wife, an English teacher. As for Israel’s growing international isolation, he is unbothered.“We are a peace-loving country, but we have to defend ourselves,” he says of Israel’s offensive in Gaza which has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians and devastated swaths of the territory. “Is Israel isolated? I don’t know. Life goes on. It is OK. Life is good,” says Abutbul.Netanyahu vows to ‘finish job’ in Gaza during UN speech as delegates walk outRead moreSderot, scruffy, poor and rightwing, is not a city given to worrying about the bitter condemnation of Israel overseas.“If they lived here, they would have a different view. Every day we worry about rockets or a raid,” says Eli Lior, who works in a service station. David, 24, a recent immigrant from Russia, says international criticism was a constant in Israel’s history and so “like water off a duck’s back”.On Friday,Benjamin Netanyahumade an angry and defiant speech at the UN in New York, calling the recognition of a Palestinian state earlier this week by the UK, France, Canada, Portugal and Australia “sheer madness” and a reward for terrorism.He was addressing a hall that was largely empty, after dozens of delegates walked out, but Israeli commentators said that the speech was aimed at the only two audiences that matter to Netanyahu: his political base in Israel and the US president, Donald Trump.For many Israelis, Netanyahu’s warning earlier this month that Israelis had “no choice” but toget used to growing isolation “at least for the coming years”, merely confirmed what they already suspected.1:13Israeli loudspeakers broadcast Netanyahu’s speech to UN into Gaza – videoA poll last month founda majorityfear they cannot now to travel abroad due to security threats and mounting global criticism of their country. Last week their government warned violence against Israelis abroad could be prompted by the anniversary of the 2023 attack into Israel by Hamas in which 1,200 died, mostly civilians, including 53 in Sderot.Then there are international calls for sports and cultural boycotting of Israel. Concerts in Europe involving Israeli musicians have been cancelled, more than 400 artists have joined a campaign to pull their music from streaming platforms in Israel, andIsrael is now facingpotential suspensionfrom next year’s Eurovision song contest, to be held in Vienna.The EU, Israel’sbiggest trading partner, is considering sanctions, while Israeli participation in the bloc’s Horizon research and innovation programme has already declined steeply, as Europeans have avoided joint projects with Israeli institutions.Shira Efron, senior fellow at the Rand corporation, says: “We have seen in the past year the erosion of Israel’s legitimacy globally but without formal sanctions, a kind of quiet embargo ... Something such as Eurovision might seem trivial but it isn’t for Israelis.”However, it is very unclear whether such measures will influence the current government in Israel – the most right-wing in its history – or sway many Jewish Israelis. Many analysts believe Netanyahu and his allies could instead be reinforced.Gideon Rahat, a professor of political science at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, says: “There are many people in Israel who are worried about international isolation, but most are not Netanyahu supporters and especially not his base.”Elections in Israel must be held before November 2026, with some pointing to the coming spring as most likely. Netanyahu’s current coalition and longstanding electoral base encompasses the mainstream but increasinglyrightwing and populist Likud party, which he leads, religious parties representing Israel’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, and groups from the hardline nationalist religious Zionist movement, which has surged in recent years.“For the ultra-orthodox, the outside world starts at the border of their communities, and the nationalist religious Zionists don’t care … and there are the others who will support Netanyahu whatever … Together, that makes up 30 to 40% [of the electorate],” says Rahat.Many Jewish Israelis attribute deteriorating ties with Europe to historic antisemitism, while Netanyahu, who is facing war-crimes charges at the international criminal court, has blamed European Muslim communities and claimed the country has been targeted by clandestine social media campaigns steered by “anti-Israel actors”.Efron says isolation often affects mostly those who already disapprove of government policies, such as academics or businesspeople.“In the short term, it consolidates the base … and there is no political cost to Israeli politicians taking on Macron or Starmer or European politicians,” she says.Thousands of international actors, directors and other film industry professionalshave pledged not to work with Israeli film institutionsthey say are “implicated in genocide … against the Palestinian people”, though others have signedan open letterarguing that much of the Israeli film and TV industry are “often the loudest critics of government policy”.“It is something that has existed for two years but with the sanctions rolling in, we will be seeing a lot more of it,” says Addam Yekutieli, a 39-year-old artist in Tel Aviv, whose own work has opposed the Israeli offensive in Gaza and the almost 50-year military occupation of the West Bank.“Because my views are quite well known, I feel that I’ve somewhat been spared the backlash. But I think it triggers defence mechanisms here for many people, more than getting them to ask difficult questions … There is an expectation that all this, this war, this genocide, will end and things will go back to normal,” Yekutieli says.Polls underline Israel’s deep division. One last week showed that 59% of Israelis were concerned by Israel being barred from cultural and sporting events, but withmuch higher levels among opposition voters. About half believed Israel should stop the fighting in Gaza and prioritise the release of hostages.Some Israeli and Palestinian analysts point to the historical example of the apartheid regime in South Africa, which collapsed after being hit by a wave of international sanctions, despite US support.The parallel is a controversial one, because Israel is frequently accused by human rights organisation and others of implementing an apartheid system with its treatment of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and, by some, within Israel itself.Itamar Eichner, a well-known commentator,argued last weekthat the white South African leaders’ decision to dismantle the apartheid regime in the early 1990s was not the result of international pressure but of a recognition that “real and lasting solutions” were needed.“Israel now faces a similar crossroads,” Eichner wrote in one of Israel’s largest newspapers, Yedioth Ahronoth.Sanctions comparable to those placed on South Africa are still far off however, and despite its pariah status, South Africa’s apartheid regime survived for decades. The relative resilience ofthe Israeli economy,boosted by huge government spending of borrowed money, has surprised observers.Yossi Mekelberg, of London’s Chatham House thinktank, says: “Yes, Israelis are psychologically still on 7 October [2023] and in trauma, Palestinians are in the terrible catastrophe that they are facing. But Israelis also need to understand the tide has changed.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahufeaturesShareReuse this content"

Caputo is the most well-known of Bari’s so-called pasta grannies, a small group of women who from the doorsteps of their homes along Via dell’Arco Basso, a cobbled alleyway in the heart of the city’s old town, make and sell all day, every day.The historic street’s irresistible blend of the grannies, homemade pasta and fresh laundry billowing from balconies has been a major pull for tourists, catapulting the area – once a no-go zone because muggings were rife – to worldwide fame and bringing prosperity to the women and city.View image in fullscreenTourists in Arco Basso alley in the historic centre of Bari. The irresistible blend of the grannies, homemade pasta and fresh laundry billowing from balconies has been a big pullBut with the meteoric success have come pitfalls. The neighbourhood was rocked in August when plainclothes police officers showed up and confiscated stacks of orecchiette and pasta-making equipment amid allegations that some of the women were sourcing commercially produced pasta and passing it off as their own. Some were also accused of flouting food safety standards and fiscal rules.Three of the women were fined €5,000 (nearly £4,400) for fraudulent commercial activities. Infuriated by the raids, the grannies downed tools and barricaded entrances to the street in a show of resistance.The raid was part of an investigation launched by Bari prosecutors last year and still ongoing to establish whether there is any truth to accusations revolving around factory-made orecchiette.Doubts over the pasta’s authenticity have lingered for years but became more prominent as a result of Bari’s post-pandemicboom in tourism, especially from cruise ships docking in the city’s port.Local journalists probed while some tourists, suspecting they were being ripped off, shared videos on social media. Some of the women are alleged to have bought packets of industrial orecchiette and emptied the contents into clear plastic bags before selling them as their own.Authorities said the most conspicuous evidence was piles of cardboard boxes for factory-made pasta found dumped in wheelie bins on the outskirts of the old town.View image in fullscreen‘Look at them all gawping and taking photos as if I’m a relic in a museum,’ one of the pasta makers said. ‘It never used to be this way’Caputo, who offers orecchiette masterclasses and travels the world to promote the pasta’s tradition, counts the British chef Jamie Oliver among her celebrity friends and says she will always cherish her encounter with the late Pope Francis, to whom she gave a packet of her produce. Photos taken with various visiting politicians, including a former prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, adorn her walls.She was not among the women fined but said she felt “terrified” by the police blitz, as if the women had been hoarding “guns or drugs” instead of innocently making pasta.The pasta grannies came together in a show of solidarity after the raids but otherwise rivalries rumble beneath the surface. Most are tight-lipped about the investigation but one pasta maker freely admitted to cutting corners and selling the industrial stuff. “Yes, I was fined,” she said, declining to reveal her name. “But what else was I supposed to do? Demand was such that I couldn’t keep up.”View image in fullscreenThe pasta grannies came together in a show of solidarity after the raids but rivalries rumble beneath the surfaceShe said it was impossible for the women to cater to all the tourists. “Look at them all gawping and taking photos as if I’m a relic in a museum.

Our position is one of respect for the rules.

Gaetano Campolo, the chief executive of Home Restaurant Hotel, which connects food enthusiasts with home chefs and hosts, made the legal complaint that triggered the investigation and is determined that prosecutors see it through. He criticised Bari council for trying to make a tourist attraction out of something he claimed had “no legal basis”.“It’s a dangerous operation that betrays honest, law-abiding citizens,” he alleged.But Caputo, who is preparing to travel to Singapore to promote orecchiette, brushed the investigation off. “I feel beleaguered by all of this,” she said, “but I will not stop doing this work.”Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Trenches cut through neighbourhoods. Civilians move block by block in search of safety, while self-defence groups fight alongside entrenched garrisons.Over these months, El Fasher has become Sudan’s war in miniature, a microcosm where the old tactics of siege and starvation collide with new arsenals, with drones and recently introduced weapons turning the city into a testing ground for modern warfare.El Fasher shows Sudan’s war in its starkest form: a laboratory, and a purgatory.Q&AWhat is happening in Sudan?ShowFighting broke outin Khartoum, Sudan’s capital, on 15 April 2023 as an escalating power struggle between the two main factions of the military regime finally turned deadly.On one side are the Sudanese armed forces, who remain broadly loyal to Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, the country’s de facto ruler. Against him are the paramilitaries of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a collection of militias who follow the former warlordGen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti.The RSF was initially founded by the former dictatorial ruler Omar al-Bashir as an Arab counterinsurgency militia called theJanjaweed, which quickly became synonymous with widespread atrocities. In 2013, Bashir transformed the group into the RSF, deploying them to crush a fresh rebellion in South Darfur.The conflict has plunged Sudan into“one of the worst humanitarian nightmares in recent history”, according to UN officials. It has created theworld’s worst displacement crisis, scattering more than 10 million people internally and 4 million who have fled into neighbouring countries, putting mounting pressure on Chad and South Sudan.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Since early October 2024, as thefighting shifted and the RSF advanced into the city, civilians have dug trenches in the neighbourhoods to where they were forced to move. Trenches cut through streets, beside houses and around the gathering sites where families now shelter.Shoulder-deep, these trenches flood after rains, becoming what is now the city’s architecture of survival.Since the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) retook Khartoum in April 2025, the RSF has intensified its shelling of El Fasher. “From three or four in the morning, often until late,” one resident says. “We know the schedule now. Each dawn we prepare for it.” Families descend into dark pre-dawn trenches as routine, sometimes sleeping there until the bombardment begins again. Mobile, long-range shelling has become the RSF’s hallmark, more intense every month.The deadliest moments often come in the short sprint between homes and trenches. Ibrahim recalls how two neighbours were killed when they paused to greet each other on their way to their shelters – mere hollows in the ground. Amal describes dragging her grandfather’s body after he was struck by artillery. Pinned down, she sheltered beside his corpse for hours until the shelling eased long enough to leave and bury him.View image in fullscreenIn Daraja Oula neighbourhood, families take cover in a hand-dug trench, with up to 10 people sheltering at a time.Photograph: Marwan MohamedMohamed speaks of a young man who lay wounded in a flooded trench for two weeks, his leg rotting, before he eventually died.Numerous accounts echo these scenes: frantic descents, long hours underground, tentative returns above; predictably scheduled terror. “The fear never changes,” says Hela, a young woman who fled the city. “If you step outside, something will happen to you.”Sometimes, she says, “when I walked between intervals of shelling and saw someone in the street, I wanted to say: ‘I’m glad we made it, let’s walk together.’”Since last October, drones have brought a new fear. People say they now patrol the skies over El Fasher – erratic and unpredictable – marking one of the first uses of drone warfare inDarfur. For those on the ground, every hum carries the same dread: surveillance or a kamikaze strike.For 17 months, El Fasher has been strangled by the oldest tactics of war: attrition and starvation. As the RSF tightened its grip, it built earthworks to the north, east and south, fortifications that also serve as choke points, blocking nearly every road in and out. The city has been cut off. Only one route remains for civilians to leave, leading west to Tawila, about 60km away.El Fasher distils Sudan’s war: old tactics of hunger and blockade colliding with drones and advanced arsenalsThose who make the journey face checkpoints, ambushes and the risk of disappearing. For men and boys of fighting age, escape is nearly impossible. They either stay and fight, or risk extortion or death on the road. The trek to Tawila – two days on foot or a day by donkey – passes through a series of RSF and allied checkpoints, each demanding payment. “A donkey cart out of El Fasher costs more than a new car, now,” says Leila, who recently escaped the city.An elderly man reached Tawila’s buffer zone after walking from El Fasher, arriving there in the first week of September.More than 400,000 newly displacedhad crammed into the area before him. A volunteer recalls seeing him: “He asked for water, drank, and then collapsed and died in front of us.”If leaving is impossible, life inside is unbearable. After 500 days of siege, the markets are gutted and the city is on the brink of famine. What little food remains is beyond the reach of most. Two kilos of millet sell for $100 (£74), a kilo of sugar or flour for $80, while the average monthly salary, when salaries were still paid, was $70.An estimated260,000 civilians remain in El Fasher, most relying on four communal kitchens run by volunteers and sustained through community networks. Under fire, with water restricted and supplies scarce, they offer only one meal a day. Like the rest of El Fasher, the kitchens have also been shelled, killing volunteers. The only alternative is the city’s last market, in the Naivasha area, now reduced to a handful of stalls where prices are extortionate.View image in fullscreenPeople carry the body of a shelling victim to one of only three cemeteries still accessible, where daily funerals mark the mounting toll.Photograph: Marwan Mohamed“I get by on one meal if I can,” says Omar. “But during shelling or street fighting, we’re trapped.” Hani, who once worked with smugglers, says the city long relied on them to bring food in, but most are gone. “A few still try at night, but most don’t make it back. It’s suicide now, a deadly gamble.”For many families, the only food available is peanut-shell residue normally used to feed livestock. Civilians with shrapnel wounds are carried into an improvised treatment centre, referred to as the bloc, where volunteers do what they can with little more than salt and torn pieces of cloth.‘They slaughtered us like animals’: the inside story of how one of the biggest atrocities of the Sudan war unfolded in ZamzamRead moreNo formal aid has reached El Fasher since the siege began. At Al Saudi, the city’s last semi-functioning hospital, volunteers are often reduced to crude triage, deciding “who will live and who will be left to die”, says Amira, a volunteer. Because of its proximity to the frontline, the hospital has stopped admitting the wounded. SAF soldiers and allied Darfuri fighters are generally treated in separate facilities, one of which was struck and put out of service in the past two weeks.In what is left of their city, most people are confined to the north-west corner. They are crammed into three neighbourhoods and part of an IDP camp, co-located with SAF and SAF-aligned Darfuri groups’ positions. By night, the area falls into darkness and silence. Even solar lamps are kept off for fear of drones. “You can’t even light a cigarette,” says Abdallah, a resident.Alongside SAF soldiers and their Darfuri allies, self-defence groups have multiplied, and armed men fill the streets, as militarisation pervades every part of life. The unspoken reality is that every able man and boy is seen as a potential fighter. And while the blurring of the line between civilian and combatant is not unique to El Fasher, nowhere is it likely to be felt so starkly.El Fasher’s battle has transformed from rudimentary urban combat into sophisticated warfare with weapons Darfur has never known. The siege is no longer just military; it has become political, even existential.The siege endures largely because of external support. Public and private accounts point to UAE military supplies andlogistical supportthat have carried the RSF beyond its capacity. Yet El Fasher is Sudan’s toughest front and, paradoxically, one of the last places where resolution still feels possible.Sarra Majdoub is an independent researcher and former UN Security Council expert on Sudan.Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentOpinionConflict and armsDarfurSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricaHungeranalysisShareReuse this content"

Obey the order of humanity!” Petro said.Colombian media reported Petro was already en route to Bogota from New York on Friday night.Petro was in New York for the UN general assembly, where he rebuked theTrump administrationfiercely and called for a criminal inquiry into recent US strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean in his Tuesday address.Colombia’s Petro urges ‘criminal trial’ against Trump for Venezuelan strikesRead morePetro said unarmed “poor young people”died in the strikes– more than a dozen in total – but Washington contends the actions are part of a US anti-drug operation off the coast of Venezuela, whose president Washington accuses of running a cartel.Trump has dispatched eight warships and a submarine to the southern Caribbean, and the biggest US deployment in years has raised fears inVenezuelaof an invasion.Petro, whose country is the world’s biggest cocaine producer, has said he suspects some of those killed in the US boat strikes were Colombian.Last week, the Trump administration decertified Colombia as an ally in the fight against drugs, but stopped short of economic sanctions.The countries are historical allies but ties have soured under Petro, Colombia’s first-ever leftist leader.Its interior minister, Armando Benedetti, wrote on X on Friday night that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visa should have been revoked rather than Petro’s.“But since the empire protects him, it’s taking it out on the only president who was capable enough to tell him the truth to his face.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpColombiaVenezuelaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

He will face court again next month.The Australian federal police charged the man after it received intelligence that he attended an NSN gathering in Marsfield, in Sydney’s north, in late 2024.Neo-Nazis have occupied the steps of Victoria’s parliament twice in two years. Are protest laws to blame?Read moreFootage of the gathering, seen by Guardian Australia, shows about a dozen men clad in black exercise clothing in a public park.

Items seized included mobile phones which allegedly contained violent extremist and child abuse material.

The ADF would not comment on whether the man was already subject to such a process.The ADF also did not comment on whether state and federal law enforcement and intelligence bodies shared information with them about members suspected to be involved in groups such as the NSN.In 2021, a new Asio framework was developed to share information with the armed services about potential extremist links.The ADF also declined to comment on whether it monitors employees’ possible involvement with these groups, and how it educates its members about the risk of far-right groups.Last year, Guardian Australia revealed there had been at least 16 investigations into defence personnel allegedly engaging with extremism or supremacism since 2022.In October 2021, the ADF tightened its vetting procedures in an attempt to prevent nationalist and racist violent extremists from joining amid concerns former personnel were linked to local white supremacist groups.Asio also warned in its annual report that year that “some nationalist and racist violent extremists seek to join the Australian defence force to obtain training and capability.”Explore more on these topicsFar rightAustralian police and policingAustralian militarynewsShareReuse this content"

Dr Vanessa Pirotta, a whale scientist,told Guardian Australiaearlier this month during a separate entanglement that adults appear to be aware of the danger the nets pose.“But the calves obviously don’t know and get entangled,” she said. “Then the mums freak out and stay nearby, then they are getting entangled as well.”NSW is pausing its shark net reduction trial after fatal Long Reef beach attack. What’s the plan this summer?Read moreIn more bad news for marine life, a report released by South Australia’s environment department this week found the deaths of three great white sharks were linked to thestate’s ongoing algal bloom.Scientists conductednecropsies on the carcassesof nine white sharks found dead on the state’s beaches. The results showed three of those sharks had physical symptoms, including inflamed gills, consistent with a cause of death related to exposure to high levels of the algae Karenia spp.Mike Steer, the executive director of the South Australian Research and Development Institute, said many creatures affected by the bloom were “suffocating”.“The algae effectively impact the gills and prevent the animal from breathing appropriately,” Steer told a news briefing on the shark deaths on Friday.“The other thing that the bloom can do is, once it decomposes in an area, it can draw the oxygen out of the water as well. So it creates additional pressure for those marine organisms that rely on gill respiration to breathe appropriately … they effectively get suffocated.”Explore more on these topicsQueenslandMarine lifeWhalesSharksnewsShareReuse this content"

She said the man was a refugee and hence a person who Australia had protection obligations to under the Migration Act.She said persecution could include prosecution under sharia law and the penal code, being subjected to so-called“conversion” practices, and physical harm.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe man sought a review of a June 2022 decision by a delegate for the home affairs minister to refuse to grant him a protection visa.Appearing before the tribunal in July, he said he realised his attraction to men during high school years but hid his sexuality until he was 19 or 20. At this time, he began to “fool around with a friend”, the decision said.The man claimed his brother slapped him when he discovered him in his room with another man in 2016. He then chased him out of the house.The man said he tried to explain his feelings but his family would not listen “because they were very religious”, the decision said.Luo said she accepted the man was rejected by his family, who did not accept his sexuality. She also accepted the man was insulted, bullied and ignored by friends and colleagues in Malaysia after they discovered he was gay.“I accept that, as a result of the negativity he experienced, he became introverted and stopped trying to socialise or do anything other than work, which made him feel depressed,” the decision said.Luo also agreed that the man felt his sexuality was accepted in Australia.The Malaysian government’s stance on LGBTQ+ issues apply to all people but is more pronounced for Malay Muslims, who face both sharia and penal code offences for expressions of LGBTQ+ identity, the decision said. Malaysian authorities have also promoted conversion practices for LGBTQ+ people, primarily aimed at Muslims.The man travelled to Australia in February 2020. In his protection visa application that year, the man said he was gay and a supporter of LGBT rights. He claimed his family rejected him when they discovered his sexuality. He said he has not had contact with his family since he left Malaysia.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Germany’s interior minister has said he wants to authorise its military to shoot down drones, while EU leaders are due to meet in Copenhagen next week and are expected to discuss how to improve Europe’s defences and support Ukraine.On Friday, defence ministers from 10 EU countriesagreed to strengthen eastern defenceswith a so-called “drone wall” to deter Russia.On Saturday, Russia’s foreign ministry said the measures would lead to “an increase in military and political tensions on our continent”, according to state news agency RIA Novosti.The ministry added that the plans amounted to “personal ambitions and political games of the EU’s ruling elites”.The Danish public broadcaster DR reported that there were drones in the air inside and outside the fence of the Karup airbase about 8pm on Friday, according to Simon Skelkjær, spokesperson for the Central and West Jutland police.Skelkjær said he could not comment on where the drones came from, adding: “We didn’t take them down.”Karup airbase houses all the Danish armed forces’ helicopters, airspace surveillance and parts of the Danish defence command.In Norway, Brynjar Stordal, a spokesperson for the country’s joint headquarters, told AFP they were investigating the sightings but “handling it as a drone sighting”.EU to move forward with plans for drone wall amid Russian incursionsRead moreAt least two drones flew “for around an hour” in a restricted area close to Orland, the main base for Norway’s F-35 fighter jets and a key Nato base. “They were not engaged by us,” he said.There was also a drone spotted late on Friday over Germany’s northern Schleswig-Holstein state, which borders Denmark, state interior minister Sabine Sütterlin-Waack told local broadcaster NDR.Germany’s interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said on Saturday that the threat from drones was “high” and the government was considering allowing the armed forces to shoot down drones under certain conditions. Police have the main responsibility for defending against drones.Dobrindt told journalists in Berlin he wanted to revise air safety laws to allow the “shooting down of drones” by the armed forces, among other measures.“It’s about being prepared so that critical infrastructure or large gatherings of people, for example, can be protected,” he said.“What we are witnessing is an arms race – an arms race between drone threats and drone defence. We must prepare ourselves for this,” he added.Copenhagen has also said it plans to acquire new enhanced capabilities to detect and neutralise drones.Russia is the prime suspect behind the recent drone incursions. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, on Thursday said: “There is one main country that poses a threat to Europe’s security, and it is Russia.”Although no definitive proof has been provided to back this up, Denmark’s defence minister, Troels Lund Poulsen, said on Thursday that the flights appeared to be “the work of a professional actor”.The drone flights began just days after Denmark said last Wednesday it would acquire “long-range precision weapons” for the first time to counter the threat from Russia.Denmark’s justice minister, Peter Hummelgaard, said the aim of the attacks was “to spread fear, create division and frighten us”.This follows similar drone activity over Romania and Poland in the last few weeks, as well as Russian fighter jets violating Estonian airspace, which has raised concerns over the security of northern Europe and its vulnerability to air attacks from Russia.Moscow has denied breaching Nato’s airspace, calling the EU’s reaction a “hysteria” on Wednesday.Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsDenmarkDrones (non-military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Earlier this month,Ukrainespotted 92 drones flying towards Poland in a “choreographed” way. It intercepted most of them. Nineteen crossed into Polish territory, where the Poles shot four down.“I am not comparing our forces. We are at war and they [Poland] are not,” he said. Zelenskyy said representatives from several unnamed countries would travel to Ukraine to receive “practical training” in how to repel Russian aerial attacks. “We are ready to share our experience,” he added.Zelenskyy’s remarks follow what he said were “very nice” talks with Trump on the sidelines of the UN general assembly.

Asked to explain this apparent warmer tone towards Ukraine, Zelenskyy said he had briefed Trump about the realities on the battlefield. He told him Russia’s advances were often fleeting: “It’s not success. It’s temporary presence.”The US president now had greater “faith” in Ukraine and has discovered that Russia treated him and everyone else with “disrespect”, Zelenskyy said. He declined tocomment on reportsthat he had asked the White House for US Tomahawk cruise missiles capable of striking Moscow, saying: “It’s a sensitive issue.”In recent months Kyiv has carried out a series of successful strikes against Russian oil refineries using domestically produced long-range drones. Zelenskyy said that if the Kremlin tried to destroy Ukraine’s energy infrastructure again this winter its own capital will experience retaliatory blackouts.Explore more on these topicsUkraineRussiaEuropeVladimir PutinVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

I’d never spent so much time at such an altitude in my life, so that was a challenge in itself,” Bargiel said. “Skiing down Everest without oxygen was a dream that had been growing inside me for years.”More than 6,000 people have climbed the mountain, according to the Himalayan database, but only about 200 have done it without additional bottled oxygen. A few people have skied back down, but never a continuous downhill without supplementary oxygen.It took nearly 16 hours on Monday for Bargiel to climb through the “death zone”, which is above 8,000m where oxygen levels are dangerously low.At the top of the mountain the air is so thin that climbers only get about a third of the oxygen available at sea level. This can cause brain damage, fluid in the lungs, and even death.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not for Poles! Andrzej Bargiel has just skied down Mount Everest.”In 2018, Bargiel became the first person to ski down Pakistan’s K2, the second highest mountain in the world.In an interview with the Guardian in 2020 he said: “No one thought it could be done; even my own brother had doubts.

Pensions were put in peril. The cost of government borrowing shot up too.”While admitting she would like to be “less in hock to bond markets”, she added that “the reality is that we rely on those bond markets and those people participating in them to buy our debt”.Speaking tothe Financial Times, Burnham argued that his remarks on bond markets had been “deliberately misinterpreted”.

Rescue services attempted to resuscitate them but were unsuccessful.The two women died in a dinghy that launched at 3.15am off the coast of Neufchâtel-Hardelot. The boat returned to the beach at about 4.15am, after drifting without being able to start the engine.Firefighters were called to the dinghy after a report of a child suffering from hypothermia and found the two women in cardiopulmonary arrest.A doctor pronounced them dead at 5am. The child along with both parents, also suffering from hypothermia, were taken to Boulogne hospital for treatment.An investigation, under the authority of the Boulogne-sur-Mer public prosecutor, is under way to determine the circumstances of the tragedy.A spokesperson for the préfet of Pas de Calais said: “We still deplore this fact today: through greed and disregard for human life, smuggling networks are increasingly putting people, adults and children, at risk, selling them crossings across a dangerous sea aboard completely unsuitable vessels.“In the face of this criminal cynicism, the state is demonstrating the strength of its commitment: every day, lives are saved by the determined action of police officers and gendarmes, who tirelessly fight against these departures, and by rescue operations conducted at sea by the maritime prefecture or on land by the firefighters service.”According to a statement from the préfet of Pas de Calais, Friday night was a busy one for crossings. After a period from 20 to 25 September when there were no crossings owing to bad weather, a change to more favourable conditions meant smugglers resumed piling people into overcrowded dinghies. Officials said several crossing attempts were intercepted by police and gendarmes.The incident brings the number of Channel crossing deaths to at least 25 this year, according to an Agence France-Presse tally based on official data.A UK government spokesperson said:“We can confirm there has been a tragic incident involving a small boat that had attempted to cross the Channel which has resulted in the loss of two lives.“This latest tragedy underlines the terrible dangers of small boat crossings, and we continue to do everything we can to prevent callous criminals exploiting vulnerable people. Our thoughts are with those affected.”Since January, a record 31,000 people have arrived in Britain by crossing the Channel in small boats.Under a recent Franco-British scheme, the UK can return them after arrival if they are deemed ineligible for asylum, including those who have passed through a “safe country” to reach UK shores. In return, London will accept an equal number of people from France who are likely to have their asylum claims granted.AgenceFrance-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsFranceImmigration and asylumEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, said at the UNhis country “must finish the job”.However, the seniorLabourpolitician declined to conclude that Israel was committing genocide in the territory, despite pressure to do so from inside her party, repeating the government’s position that was down to a legal process.She admitted that “words seem hollow” in response to the catastrophic situation on the ground and said the priority must be trying to use new momentum behind a peace deal to end the “screams and pain” of Palestinian children.Cooper, believed to be one of the cabinet ministers who privately pushed Keir Starmer torecognise the Palestinian state, said that while she understood the horror many felt about the humanitarian situation it was her job to focus on ending the war.The White House is understood to be backinga plan that would have Tony Blairhead a temporary technocratic administration of Gaza. Cooper twice declined to say whether the former UK prime minister was the right person to lead the transitional authority.Washington backing plan for Tony Blair to head transitional Gaza authorityRead moreWhile Blair has good relations with the Gulf states after serving as Middle East envoy, and a route to the White House through Jared Kushner, the main architect of the plan and Trump’s son-in-law, he remains a controversial figure in the wider region over his role in the 2003 Iraq war.“I feel like there is a consensus, a real, huge consensus building, and there was real energy and determination [at the UN] around peace. I think we’ve reached a moment where the world wants to end this war,” Cooper said.The “beginning of the process” was a ceasefire, the restoration of humanitarian aid and the release of all the hostages, she added. However, she acknowledged the process was fragile and there were many obstacles ahead.View image in fullscreenIsraeli forces strike Gaza City.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty Images“We can’t pretend this isn’t incredibly hard, and how long the crisis has been going on makes it challenging. But there was no doubt that there is a real sense of determination and energy behind trying to get an end to the war and to try and get not just an immediate ceasefire, but a proper plan for the future.”Just days before hosting Netanyahu in Washington, Trump told reporters on Friday that it was “looking like we have a deal on Gaza”. Cooper acknowledged the US president would play an instrumental role in bringingIsraelon board.The 21-point White House plan for peace is, diplomats say,compatible with the plan for Palestineendorsed by the UN last week, with agreement on no mass displacement from Gaza, no role for Hamas and no West Bank annexation.But Foreign Office insiders are understood to be uneasy about aspects of the Trump plan, including what role Blair might play.“Tony Blair has been one of the people adding proposals to this process, and that’s been really important, but there have been lots of other processes as well,” Cooper said. “There’s still a huge amount of work to do. At this stage, there’s a sense of consensus building but we’ve got to keep that on track.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The war has to be brought to an end,” Cooper said.“I think the reason that there is just such a sense of distress is because everybody can see the horror of what has happened and the fact that it feels like nothing’s being done. It feels like nothing is changing. It feels like everything is just getting worse …“The challenge for us now is that there is a moment, and we have to make sure that that moment, through international action, is turned into a peace process.”Turning to Russia, and the drones and jets being flown over Poland and Scandinavian countries, Cooper accused Vladimir Putin of “deliberate provocation” and attempts to destabilise Europe.The foreign secretary urged the US to “go much further” on sanctions on Russian oil and gas, after Trump said a week ago he was ready to do so, but only if Nato countries met certain conditions. “There has to be a much more concerted effort,” she added.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warYvette CooperLabour conferenceForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The couple, from East Sussex, deny the allegations.Lindsay’s son, Joe Bennett, said that the family have “real concerns” about the pair’s health, and that his mother has been on a drip in prison and Craig has had several illnesses including stomach bugs and the flu.Son of British woman held in Iran speaks to her for first time in 213 daysRead moreSpeaking to BBC News, Bennett said: There are real concerns around my mum and Craig’s health.“Craig is constantly ill, multiple rounds of stomach bugs, flu, dental problems, without the correct medical care.“It’s to my understanding that my mum was on a drip last week. Unsure as to why, but obviously very, very concerning for us as a family.”This comes as the couple face court today in Iran, and the family said it is “deeply worrying” that theForeign, Commonwealth and Development Office(FCDO) appears not to have been kept informed.Bennett told Sky News that the family was “anticipating to hear” any news after a court appearance, and “it might be seven to 10 days after today’s hearing” before they get an update.The family have known little about the couple’s whereabouts or condition throughout their detention, but last month learned through the Foreign Office that Lindsay has been transferred to Qarchak women’s prison near the capital.Human rights groups have repeatedly criticised the dire conditions reported at Qarchak prison.Craig was believed to have been moved to Tehran’s infamous central prison, also known as Fashafouyeh, which is about 30km (18 miles) south of the capital and has a similar reputation.The FCDO warns all British and British-Iranian nationals not to travel to Iran because of a “significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention”.A spokesperson said previously: “We are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran. We continue to raise this case directly with the Iranian authorities.“We are providing them with consular assistance and remain in close contact with their family members.”Explore more on these topicsIranForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricaForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficenewsShareReuse this content"

Last week, relatives joined other families of Americans killed or detained by Israeli forces or settlers in a series of high-profile meetings with lawmakers on Capitol Hill.One year after Ayşenur Ezgi Eygi was killed, the US has not investigated. Her family wants answersRead moreThat trip included sit-downs with more than a dozen members of Congress, as well as apress conferencewith the representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and the families ofAyşenur Ezgi Eygi,Sayfollah MusalletandTawfic Ajaq, all of whom were killed by in the West Bank in the last two years. They were accompanied by the parents ofRachel Corrie, the American activist killed by an Israeli bulldozer in the Gaza Strip in 2003. The US government has not independently investigated any of these deaths, deferring instead to Israel’s own inquiries.The Guardianfirst reportedthat Ibrahim was arrested in February at age 15 from his family’s home in the West Bank over allegations of rock throwing. The Guardianfirst mentionedIbrahim’s imprisonment after reporting on Musallet, his cousin, who was allegedly beaten to death by Israeli settlers on the family’s farm in July.The teenager has lost significant weight during his detention and at one point had contracted scabies. His family said they have been unable to maintain regular contact with him.The Guardian has reached out to Israel’s prison service, foreign ministry and military for comment. Military court documents reviewed by the Guardian show Israeli authorities accuse Ibrahim of throwing rocks at Israeli vehicles in at least two separate incidents.The state department said in a statement that it provides appropriate consular assistance to all citizens detained abroad, but that it would not comment further given “privacy and other considerations”.The case has drawn attention from Florida lawmakers, including Kathy Castor, who haspublicly calledfor his release. More than 100 civil rights and faith-based organizations in the US alsosigned a letterdemanding his release and US government intervention.Özden Bennett, the sister of 26-year-old Eygi, who was killed by an Israeli sniper last year while attending a protest against settlement expansion in the West Bank, grew emotional when speaking of Ibrahim while in Washington. “He feels like my little brother,” she said in a meeting with Virginia representative Jim McGovern. “I can’t do anything for my sister but we can help him”.In a meeting with senators Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, she called on them to travel to the Ofer prison to demand his release, invoking Van Hollen’s visit to El Salvador to meet with Kilmar Ábrego García, a man who was sent there by theTrump administrationdespite an immigration court order preventing his deportation.Van Hollen and Merkley met with Ibrahim’s father during their Middle East delegation trip earlier this month, their offices confirmed.Merkley said in a statement to the Guardian that he was “heartbroken” to hear about Ibrahim’s imprisonment. “He deserves humane treatment and a fair trial,” he added. “My colleagues and I call on Secretary of State Rubio and the Netanyahu government to uphold Ibrahim’s basic human rights and dignity.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelWest BankPalestinian territoriesFloridaTrump administrationMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

Medicine, equipment, food and fuel are in short supply, while many doctors and nurses have been forced to flee.On Friday, Médecins Sans Frontières said it had been forced to suspend activities in Gaza City because of the deteriorating security situation.“We have been left with no choice but to stop our activities as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,” said Jacob Granger, the charity’s emergency coordinator in Gaza. “This is the last thing we wanted, as the needs in Gaza City are enormous, with the most at-risk people – infants in neonatal care, people with severe injuries and life-threatening illnesses – unable to move and in grave danger.”Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He is campaigning ahead of state elections that are to be held in early 2026.The 51-year-old said on X that his “heart is shattered” at the tragedy, adding: “I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of my dear brothers and sisters who lost their lives in Karur.”Videos from local media show thousands of people surrounding a large campaign vehicle on top of which Vijay is seen standing and speaking.During the rally, visuals showed Vijay throwing water bottles from the top of the vehicle to fainting supporters and calling for police help when the crowd became uncontrollable.Modi said the incident was “deeply saddening”.“My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones. Wishing strength to them in this difficult time,” he said in a statement on social media.Crushes are relatively common in India when large crowds gather. In January, at least 30 people were killed as tens of thousands of Hindus rushed to bathe in a sacred river during the Maha Kumbh Mela festival, the world’s largest religious gathering.In July last year, 121 people were killed in the northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.And 11 fans were crushed to death this June in Bengaluru during celebrations for the local team’s first Indian Premier League title.It is also not the first time Vijay’s rallies have been the subject of safety concerns. At least six deaths were reported by media following the first meeting of his political party when it was launched in October last year.Despite police-imposed restrictions, including limits on convoy size and venue changes, the sheer scale of public turnout has repeatedly overwhelmed local infrastructure.Explore more on these topicsIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

It was also the unprecedented second time this year that Munir – who holds no official government role – held an intimate meeting with Trump, which many took as a telling signal of where the power to cut deals really lies inPakistan.Islamabad’s charm offensive with Trump since his re-election has included handing over to the USa high profile member of Islamic State’s affiliatein Afghanistan and publicly crediting the US president with preventing hostilities between India and Pakistan escalating into all-out war, evennominating Trump for the Nobel peace prizefor his efforts.Thawing of relations between Pakistan and US raises eyebrows in IndiaRead moreYet what has appeared most effective is Pakistan’s touting of its allegedly untapped natural resources – namely oil, minerals and gas – for US exploration. In July, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that “we have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massiveOilReserves. We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership.”The messaging was affirmed by Natalie Baker, the US chargé d’affaires in Islamabad, who told local media that US firms had been “showing keen interest in Pakistan’s oil, gas and mineral sectors, in line with President Donald Trump’s vision”.Pakistan has already reaped rewards from its promise of oil. After an agreement in August, Trump gave Pakistan a generous 19% tariff on imported goods, the lowest of all south Asia nations and far below the punitive 50% tariffs that its neighbour and nemesis India is facing.This month, a $500m (£370m) deal for the US to invest in Pakistan’s nascent minerals sector – including copper and rare earths – was announced, despite a lack of definitive data on the country’s mineral reserves.Yet it is the promise of oil that has left experts and former government ministers even more baffled. They stress that there is no reliable proof that Pakistan has any substantive, untapped oil reserves, despite years of the world’s biggest oil companies attempting to find them.Moin Raza Khan, a geoscientist and former managing director at Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), which has been at the forefront of oil exploration, said: “What Trump is claiming about Pakistan’s massive oil reserves has nothing to do with reality. It is without the support of any data or evidence. We don’t even know where these massive reserves would be, as we don’t have any surveys and studies so far that show us.”Khan was among the experts who emphasised that despite more than half a century of exploration and drilling onshore and offshore, no large-scale commercially viable oil wells had been discovered on Pakistani soil. While some small oil repositories had been found, they produce about 65,000 barrels a day. In comparison, Saudi Arabia produces about 4bn barrels a year.This is far from the first time that proclamations have been made about Pakistan’s potential as a petrostate. The country imports more than 80% of its oil, which is one of the biggest drains on the state coffers, prompting successive leaders to make a push for oil exploration.Khanemphasised that over the years, more than 30 international companies, including Total, Shell and ExxonMobil, had come to Pakistan with the hope of finding oil, but had eventually leftdue to thehigh cost and security risk of exploration and low reward.In 2015, a survey by the US energy administration estimated that the lower Indus basin in Pakistan could have 9bn barrels of “technically recoverable oil”, a survey that was recently referenced by Pakistan’s minister of state for petroleum, Ali Pervaiz Malik.However, that survey has been called into question by oil companies. In 2019, the multinational oil corporations ExxonMobil and Eni worked with PPL to find oil and gas reserves offshore. But after spending more than $100m drilling the Kekra-1 Indus G block, nothing was found except a waterbed.Khan, who headed PPL during the recent failed oil exploration, said: “A total of only 1.2bn barrels of oil have been discovered so far – which is nothing – and they are claiming they can find 100 times this in just the next three years.“It’s just impossible. There is no magic wand to multiply Pakistan’s reserves.”Islamabad’s ministry of petroleum declined to comment on questions about Pakistan’s oil reserves.Despite the lack of any new evidence, the country is pressing ahead with 40 new offshore and 31 onshore blocks for oil and gas exploration, which will be awarded on 31 October. US companies are among those invited for bidding.GA Sabri, a former federal secretary at the ministry of petroleum and former director general petroleum concession, described the claims of massive oil reserves as a “political gimmick” and was sceptical about the success of the oil block auction.Much of Pakistan’s alleged untapped oil and gas reserves are said to be in the regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, which are in the midst of insurgencies by Taliban and separatist militants and where foreign companies have been routinely targeted.Sabri said: “When it comes to exploration of new fields, there are high security risks.”He emphasised that “even if the US does the drilling and starts now, it will take at least two to three decades and hundreds of millions of dollars to do this exploration – and nobody can say for sure reserves will be found”.Sabri said the success of Pakistan’s onshore oil drilling was nothing short of “a myth”.Explore more on these topicsPakistanDonald TrumpOilCommoditiesSouth and central AsiaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The prime minister, Keir Starmer, described the proposals as “national renewal in action”.It comes as the new towns taskforce, established in September last year, publishes a report with a raft of recommendations for fresh developments across the country.Labouris keen to present the proposals as a rejection of what it sees as the “quick fix” politics of Reform.Reed will tell delegates that the project is modelled on the “housing boom” overseen by Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, which built more than one million homes between 1945 and 1951. Reed’s project will rely on public and private funding but the total anticipated cost is unclear. The taskforce is expected to say that, collectively, the new towns could deliver “up to 300,000” homes over the “coming decades”.Reed, who became housing secretary just three weeks ago following the resignation of Angela Rayner, will say he will do whatever it takes to get Britain building to “restore the dream of home ownership” to thousands of families across the country.He will say on Sunday: “We will fight for hard-working people, locked out of a secure home for too long by the Conservative government of blockers. This Labour government won’t sit back and let this happen. I will do whatever it takes to get Britain building. We’ve got to ‘build, baby, build’.“That’s the way we put the key to a decent home in the pocket of everyone who needs a secure and affordable home. And not just homes, but communities, and not just communities but entire towns.“This party built new towns after the war to meet our promise of homes fit for heroes. Now, with the worst economic inheritance since that war, we will once again build cutting-edge communities to provide homes fit for families of all shapes and sizes.“I am launching the next generation of new towns taking the lessons from the postwar Labour government housing boom, mobilising the full power of the state to build a new generation of new towns.”Locations under consideration include Tempsford, Bedfordshire, Crews Hill, north London and Leeds South Bank, though final decisions are yet to be made.Each new town is expected to have at least 10,000 properties as well as GP surgeries, schools, green spaces and transport links. The taskforce will suggest that about 40% of the dwellings should be affordable homes, with 20% earmarked for social housing, it is understood.Academics say Britain faces a shortage of about 4.3m homes, and there are record numbers of people living in temporary accommodation. Labour has pledged to build 1.5m new properties before the next general election, although analysts have cast doubt on whether this target is achievable.Explore more on these topicsLabourHousingCommunitiesSteve ReednewsShareReuse this content"

A spokesperson for the prince went further, describing the quotes attributed to Harry as “pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son”.The spokesperson did not specify who the information might have come from.The Sun said Harry had confirmed parts of its report, telling the Guardian he “was given full right of reply yesterday in advance of publication and opted not to give a response to the Sun’s carefully sourced account of the meeting”.Harry’s spokesperson also corrected part of the Sun’s report about gifts that had been exchanged between the king and him.The Sun had initially said a framed photograph of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s family was exchanged.But Harry’s spokesperson denied the claim, saying: “While we would have preferred such details to remain private, for the sake of clarity we can confirm that a framed photograph was handed over, however the image did not contain the duke and duchess.”The duke carried out several charity events in Nottingham and London during his recent four-day visit to the UK this month.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The most recent government statistics show there were 131,140 households in temporary accommodation in England, including 169,050 children, at the end of March. This is the highest figure since records began in 1998, and an increase of 11.8% on the previous year, beforeLabourtook power.View image in fullscreenSiobhain McDonagh: ‘The real solution in the long term can only be building more social housing.’Photograph: Sophia Evans/The ObserverMcDonagh added that she hoped parliament would urgently process Labour’s flagshiprenters’ rights billin an effort tostem the tide of no-fault evictions, a major driver of homelessness. The party was elected on a promise to ban the practice “immediately” but the bill has not yet been made law more than a year after the election as Labour considers a number of amendments made in the House of Lords. The housing charity Shelter estimates that in England about 32,000 families have approached their local authority for housing assistance following a no-fault eviction notice since last July’s general election.Research by McDonagh’s group also found that the conditions in temporary accommodation had been linked to the deaths of at least 74 children since 2019.Speaking before Labour’s annual conference, which is due to begin in Liverpool on Sunday, McDonagh said: “The truth is, we don’t know how children are being harmed. We’ve got statistics on infant mortality but we are doing terrible things to a generation of children. A lot of the factors, because it was very young children [who died], was access to a safe sleeping space and the provision of cots.“Beds and bed configuration are a big issue in temporary accommodation. You’ve got parents and children sharing beds, you’ve got siblings sharing beds. Most temporary accommodation is basically furnished and the configuration of beds can often be not suitable for families.“Theissues of damp and mould growthexacerbate the conditions families already have – asthma and general bronchial stuff. Obviously, there are consequences tonot having access to a kitchen. People rely on takeaways, so obesity is an issue. Temporary accommodation is small, so you’ll have issues with children learning to walk.”McDonagh said local authorities were obliged to provide cots for children under two but it was “difficult to know” if this always happened in practice. She added: “Some councils are under immense pressure and the realities of what families get access to and what it’s claimed they get access to are two very different things.”‘It’s our house, but it’s their home’: tenants and landlords discuss renters’ rights billRead moreMcDonagh, who has been the MP for Mitcham and Morden in south London since 1997 and served as a whip under Gordon Brown, said she was aware of some homeless families from the south-east of England being accommodated as far away as Scotland and Wales, meaning children’s education is severely disrupted.She added: “I think there needs to be a mission in the short term to provide more temporary accommodation. People were delighted by the prefabs [built after the second world war] and they outlived their life expectancy. The benefit is you can use quite small pieces of land.“It’s just so desperate. It’s killing councils. They are falling over financially because they just can’t afford the rising costs. I think the renters’ [rights] act will have a big impact because landlords won’t be able to evict people so quickly for no good reason and the chase for ever-higher rents is made more difficult.“Labour has a problem in the Lords because there are so few compared to the combined forces of the Conservatives, the Liberal [Democrats] and the crossbenchers. It’s really very difficult to get things through the Lords at the moment.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Charlie Trew, the head of policy at Shelter, said: “If the bill doesn’t pass until 2026, we think that at least 3,000 more households are going to be marched out of their homes by bailiffs.”Emer Sheehy, a policy manager at Citizens Advice, said the charity was supporting about 100 people a day facing a no-fault eviction – known officially as a section 21 eviction.The government says it plans to build 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament to address the housing crisis in England. However, Hannah Aldridge, a senior research and policy analyst at thinktank the Resolution Foundation, said the “ongoing fall” in the number of properties given planning permission “casts doubt” on its ability to do so.A Ministry ofHousing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: “Every child deserves a safe and secure start to life, and somewhere to call home.“That’s why we’re investing £1bn in homelessness services this year to get families out of temporary accommodation.“And we are banning section 21 no-fault evictions and building more social and affordable homes with £39bn investment, to give families housing security.”Explore more on these topicsHomelessnessPovertyChildren's healthChildrenSocial exclusionHousingLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The week after Smyth’s suspension was announced, he was also charged over allegations a secret camera was placed in toilets inside the Scottish parliament – which he denies.The two MSPs’ suspensions are not believed to be linked. The Guardian has contacted Choudhury for a comment.After Choudhury’s suspension, the SNP MP Kirsty Blackman called on the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, to “urgently come clean on the reasons why yet another Labour party MSP has been suspended”.“The public deserve full transparency,” she said. “Whatever the explanation, with yet another scandal on the eve of their party conference, there’s no doubt the Labour party is in crisis.”The Scottish Conservative deputy leader, Rachael Hamilton, said Choudhury’s suspension showed “Labour are in complete chaos on the eve of their conference”.The Tory MSP said: “Confidence in Sir Keir Starmer is gone after a year of broken promises and U-turns, thedigital ID schemehas faced instant backlash, Anas Sarwar is engaging in bizarre attacks on independent experts, and now Scottish Labour have had to suspend another MSP.”Hamilton added that Labour should be “as transparent as possible about what has happened”.Choudhury is chair of the Edinburgh and Lothians Regional Equality Council. He was also one of the founding directors of the annual multicultural festival Edinburgh Mela, where he serves as vice-chair.Explore more on these topicsScottish politicsLabourScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

They urged people to stay away from the historic downtown of the former mining town because of compromised buildings and hazardous chemicals and debris, including propane tanks swept away in the flood waters.InSouth Carolina, the governor, Henry McMaster, urged residents on Saturday afternoon to closely monitor the weather and stay alert as potential bad weather approaches the state.Also on Saturday, North Carolina’s governor, Josh Stein, declared a state of emergency in advance of the system that is being identified by the National Hurricane Center in Miami as Tropical Depression Nine.

Investigators reported being told by his family that Robinson had become “more pro-gay and trans rights oriented” in the year prior to Kirk’s killing.Another comment Cole allegedly posted about the Abilene Pride parade read: “Theres only like 30 of em we can send a clear message to the rest of them.” Invoking an insult used to demean LGBTQ+ people, Cole also allegedly wrote: “come on bro let’s go hunting fairies.”In a sworn affidavit, FBI special agent Sam Venuti wrote that investigators confirmed the “Jay Dubya” account belonged to Cole.Venuti said that he had attempted to contact Cole at his place of work, where he had been employed for the past year. But the employer said that Cole had “just quit” and had “stormed out of the facility in anger”, Venuti said.Co-workers reportedly described him as a “hot head”, according to Venuti’s affidavit.Not long after, local police, with Venuti present, conducted a traffic stop on Cole.When the agent told Cole that he wanted “to talk to him about his online activity”, Venuti wrote that “Cole then sighed and his body posture indicated that [he] knew the reason for our discussion”.Venuti’s affidavit added that Cole “did not appear surprised”.Cole was then detained. According to the FBI, Cole waived his rights against self-incrimination and – during questioning – reportedly admitted to owning a firearm, to operating the “Jay Dubya” Facebook account and to making the threatening posts.The affidavit states that Cole reportedly agreed that “a reasonable person could interpret his comments as a threat”. He also said he did “not believe that the gay pride event should be allowed” though denied “that he was going to take action or shoot parade participants”.Venuti concluded in the affidavit that Cole’s “threats were not conditional”.“The threats were specific,” Venuti wrote. “The threats were also specific to a particular set of victims: people participating in the gay pride parade.”Based on the evidence, the FBI agent wrote, he believed that there was probable cause to arrest Cole for violating a federal law thatprohibitsthreatening communications.Cole could face up to five years in prison if convicted, according to theCornell University law school’s Legal Information Institute.LGBTQ+ Americans consider move to Canada to escape Trump: ‘I’m afraid of living here’Read moreAfter being jailed, Cole appeared briefly at a preliminary hearing, where a judge ordered him to remain in custody pending further proceedings.An attorney listed for Cole did not immediately respond to a request for comment.On 26 September, the Abilene Pride Alliance issueda public statementabout the incident.“We want to reassure our community that the safety of everyone at Pride has always been, and will continue to be our top priority,” they wrote. “The swift action and continued diligence of [authorities] reflect their commitment to protecting our city and ensuring that Pride remains a safe, inclusive and celebratory space for all.”TheTrump administration– which has threatened to crack down on leftwing groups who opposed Kirk’s views – did not announce and has not commented publicly on Cole’s arrest.Explore more on these topicsTexasLGBTQ+ rightsCharlie Kirk shootingTrump administrationUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

There is no threat to national security and there is no need for military troops in our major city.”“The number of necessary troops is zero,” Portland’s mayor, Keith Wilson, said. “I’ve been so deeply disappointed to see the footage from a half decade ago recycled,” he added, referring to a recent Fox News reported cited by Trump that misled viewers by wrongly presenting video from a 2020 protest in Portland as new.A visit by the Guardian to downtown Portland on Saturday morning confirmed that the city is placid, the farmers’ market was packed and the protest against immigration enforcement in an outlying residential neighborhood remained small. There were just four protesters on the sidewalk near the Ice field office Trump claimed was “under siege”. One, wearing a chicken costume and draped in an American flag, held up a sign that read: “Portland Will Outlive Him.” Passing motorists honked in appreciation.The White House did not provide details in connection with Trump’s announcement, including a timeline for the deployment or what troops would be involved.Portland residents scoff at Trump threat to send military: ‘This is not a war zone’Read moreAta hastily assembled news conferenceon Friday night, Wilson said that the city had become aware of “a sudden influx of federal agents in our city. We did not ask for them to come. They are here without clear precedent or purpose.”“The President has sent agents here to create chaos and riots in Portland, to induce a reaction, to induce protests, to induce conflicts. His goal is to make Portland look like what he’s been describing it as,” Oregon’s junior senator, Jeff Merkley said. “He wants to induce a violent exchange. Let us not grant him that wish. Let us be the force of orderly, peaceful protest.”The senator also drew attention tovideo evidencefrom the local newspaper, the Oregonian, which showed federal agents using force against a small number of protesters outside the Ice facility, who remained peaceful.Although a spokesperson for the Oregon national guardtold the Oregonianthat no official request for troops had been made yet, convoys of dozens of federal agents, in marked and unmarked SUVs, wereseen on Friday enteringa federal building downtown and an Ice field office in a residential neighborhood that has been the scene of regular protests by dozens of protesters.“The President of the United States is directing his self-proclaimed ‘Secretary of War’ to unleash militarized federal forces in an American city he disagrees with,” Representative Maxine Dexter wrote ina social media statementon Saturday, referring in part to the Pentagon chief, Pete Hegseth. “This is an egregious abuse of power and a betrayal of our most basic American values. Authoritarians rely on fear to divide us. Portland will not give them that.”Both of Oregon’s US senators and three of its House representatives had in recent days strongly rejected Trump’s claims about mass anarchy in the city as a fiction intended to justify the unnecessary deployment of federal troops as part of an “authoritarian” crackdown.Ron Wyden, the state’s senior Democratic senator, told reporters on Friday: “It’s important to recognize that the president’s argument is a fable – it does not resemble the truth.”“If he watches a TV show in the morning and he see Portland mentioned, he says it’s a terrible place,” Wyden added.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But life has long since returned to normal, and barriers around the federal courthouse and police headquarters downtown have been removed.The president, however, apparently deceived by video of a handful of protesters gathered outside the Ice facility in a south-west Portland neighborhood broadcast by conservative outlets, insisted that the city has been in non-stop “anarchy” since 2020 and is barely livable.“Portland is, I don’t know how anybody lives there, it’s amazing. But it’s anarchy out there,” Trump said. The president then claimed, falsely, that most of the city’s retail stores had closed, due to arson attacks, and “the few shops that are open” were covered in plywood.Describing the small number of protesters who have gathered outside an Ice facility that has been illegally used for detentions in a residential neighborhood, Trump claimed, without evidence: “These are professional agitators, these are bad people and they’re paid a lot of money by rich people.“But we’re going to get out there and we’re gonna do a pretty big number on those people in Portland that are doing that.”Representative Suzanne Bonamici, an Oregon Democrat, said on Friday: “This proclaimed ‘war on Antifa’ is completely a fallacy. Antifa is an ideology, it is not a group, and so we’re extremely concerned with what he’s going to try to do with that pronouncement.”“Donald Trump does not care about safety. If he cared about safety he would not have released 1,600 convicted insurrectionists into the streets. He cares about control and authoritarianism,” she added, referring to Trump’s clemency for those who carried out the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol after he lost the 2020 election to Joe Biden. “Portland does not need the military. We do not want them, we do not need them, we do not welcome them to come here under his orders.”Trump, a Republican, has sent military troops to the Democratic-controlled cities of Los Angeles and Washington DC so far in his second presidency. He has discussed doing the same in Memphis and New Orleans, which are also Democratic strongholds.Explore more on these topicsPortlandUS militaryDonald TrumpTrump administrationOregonUS politicsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Brashers, who had a lengthycriminal history, died by suicide in 1999 at age 40 during a standoff with police in Missouri.The Austin police’s announcement follows August’s release of a widely watchedHBO docuseriesthat was based on the quadruple homicide and garnered renewed attention to the case.The case’s victims were Amy Ayers, 13; Eliza Thomas, 17; and sisters Jennifer and Sarah Harbison, 17 and 15, respectively, who were bound, gagged, shot in the head and then set on fire inside an I Can’t Believe It’s Yogurt store in a strip mall. At least one of the girls had been sexually assaulted, authorities have said.Jennifer and Eliza were working at the shop that night and preparing to close up when Sarah and Amy, her best friend, arrived to meet them for a ride home. According to investigators, someone snuck into the store through the back door around closing time, attacked the girls and set the store on fire. The girls, who were shot execution-style, were discovered by firefighters with their bodies bound by underwear and their mouths gagged with cloth.According tothe autopsy report, Ayers was wearing small white earrings; Sarah had on a gold necklace and a Mickey Mouse watch; and Jennifer wore a high school ring as well as a Timex watch. The fire had severely charred three of the four girls, rendering them unrecognizable.The case, which shocked Austin and the US, sawhundredsof potential suspects over the years but remained unsolved until recently due to a lack of solid evidence. At the time, the store hadno video surveillance, and most potential evidence was destroyed in the fire.In 1999, investigators arrested four men in connection with the murders, including Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott, who were teenagers at the time of the crime. Springsteen and Scott initially admitted guilt and implicated one another but later retracted their confessions, saying that they had made their statements under police pressure.Nevertheless, the two men were tried and convicted. Their convictions, however, were later overturned when new DNA evidence identified a different male suspect, leading a judge to order their release from custody in 2009.The newest suspect, Brashers, has been connected to several other cases, including the 1990 strangulation of a woman in South Carolina, the 1998 shooting of a mother and daughter in Missouri and the 1997 rape of a 14-year-old girl in Tennessee,according tothe Associated Press.In its statement Friday,Austinpolice said the case remains an open and ongoing investigation, adding: “Our team never gave up working this case. For almost 34 years, they have worked tirelessly and remained committed to solving this case for the families of Jennifer Harbison, Sarah Harbison, Eliza Thomas and Amy Ayers, all innocent lives taken senselessly and far too soon.”Police said investigators “have been in touch with the families”.“We ask for your patience as we continue this process and remain mindful of the many people whose lives have been deeply affected by this case,” police added.Explore more on these topicsUS crimeAustinTexasUS policingnewsShareReuse this content"

But a senior Trump administration official told theNew York Timeson Friday that Hegseth intends to deliver a “rally the troops” message – and that one of the primary goals of the gathering is to “get our fighters excited” about the new posture of what was recently rebranded the Department of War.A White House officialtold CNNthat the event is intended as a “show of force of what the new military now looks like” during Donald Trump’s second presidency.“It’s about getting the horses into the stable and whipping them into shape,” the military official familiar with the planning told CNN. “And the guys with the stars on their shoulders make for a better audience from an optics standpoint. This is a showcase for Hegseth to tell them: get on board, or potentially have your career shortened.”Hegseth’s team reportedly plans to record and publicly release the address later, according to CNN, which cited three of its sources.A Pentagon spokesperson confirmed the upcoming gathering to the Guardian, saying that Hegseth “will meet with his senior military leaders”, but did not provide any further details.According to theTimes,the Pentagon informed congressional committees overseeing the military on Friday that Hegseth intends to use the gathering to share with “most senior service members his intent for the department”, including new guidance on “military fitness standards and several other areas of interest”.Sources cited by the Post say that Tuesday’s address will be the first of three short lectures by Hegseth. The second, the Post reported, will reportedly focus on the defense industrial base, and the third on deterrence.The meeting has reportedly stirred unease and anxiety among some military officers, especially given Hegseth’s efforts to reshape the Pentagon and his recent firings of several senior officers.In May, heordered a 20% reductionin the number of four-star generals and admirals across the military and a 10% cut in the number of flag and general officers. And in recent months, he has dismissed more than a dozen senior military officials, according to theTimes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It could be a preparation for a potential budget stalemate next week, or it could be concerns over information leaks.”“Secretary Hegseth has fired 12 senior ranking general officers, so he could be firing more,” Hertling added. “Or is it performative theatre?”In a post on social media on Friday, Lt Gen Ben Hodges of the armycomparedTuesday’s gathering to a 1935 “surprise assembly in Berlin” where German generals were “required to swear a personal oath to the Führer”, Adolf Hitler, in the lead-up to the Holocaust and the second world war.Hegseth, a former army national guard officer and ex-Fox News host,respondedto Hodges by writing: “Cool story, General.”Explore more on these topicsUS militaryPete HegsethTrump administrationUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

As a result, CME Group live cattle futures prices recently rose to a high of $243.58 per hundredweight. (Hundredweight is equivalent to $10 per 100lbs)Raging bulls: why Maga is pushing cow products on to AmericaRead moreThere are several reasons for ranchers’ hesitancy, says David Anderson, livestock specialist atTexasA&M University. The last time cattle prices set a record in 2014, ranchers quickly bred more bovines, only to see prices collapse. Now he estimates cattle ranchers are making well-over $500 per head selling cattle and so far show little incentive to expand their herds.After several years of losing money, ranchers are grateful for the higher returns but many are gun shy to rebuild.Brett Kenzy, a fourth-generation cattle rancher inSouth Dakota, who raises 2,700 head of cattle, isn’t planning to expand. “We have much better prices, but I see a real lack of confidence in the market,” he says.Narciso Perez, founder of Zia Commodities, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, raises cattle and is a cattle broker, echoes Kenzy’s sentiments. Instead of spurring ranchers to breed heifers, high prices are incentivizing producers to sell them to pay debts.“It’s a matter of, I don’t know how long this is going to last, but I know that today I can pay all my bills off, and I know for two decades I’ve not been able to do that,” he says.Even if ranchers decided to start expanding the herd today, it could take up to four years to produce slaughter-ready cattle. “Biology is tough to beat,” Anderson says.Beef production has dipped further recently because the US closed the Mexican border to cattle imports to prevent the spread ofNew World screwworm, a species of flesh-eating fly larvae. With domestic supplies tight, it has a ripple effect on the national beef price, he says.The cattle shortage is eating into the profits of major meat processors includingTyson,JBSand Cargill which all have reported lower earnings this year.Consumer preferences play their part in higher prices.Beefdemand has grown over the years, but Americans eat fewer roasts and more ground beef and steaks, says Bryan Flannery, owner of Flannery Beef, a San Francisco-area boutique meat processor and distributor to wholesale and retail buyers, who has seen his costs rise.Additionally, meat-eaters have gravitated to higher quality grades with more intra-muscular fat, such as upper choice and prime, which costs more than the leaner select grade. Because of this, grocery stores carry less of the cheaper select-grade beef, and ground beef contains more muscle meat than beef trimmings.Last year the US imported 16% of its beef needs, andtariffswill make your next burger more costly. Fifty percent of US beef consumption is ground beef, and Brazil is the biggest supplier of beef trimmings. The additional 50%tariff on Brazilimports means the total tax on those beef imports is 76.4%.Restaurant owners say they’ve seen their beef costs rise significantly and have no choice but to pass the costs on to consumers to stay in business. Leonard Botello, pitmaster and owner of craft barebcue restaurant Truth BBQ in Houston and Brenham in Texas, says when he opened 10 years ago, he paid $2.50 a pound for prime brisket and now pays about $8 a pound. He’s nearly doubled the price he charges diners for brisket to $37 a pound from $18 when he started.Jason Vincent, owner of three popular Chicago restaurants, Giant, Chef’s Special and Pizza Matta, says his beef costs rose by $3 a pound in the past two months.“You want to offer value, but, honestly, that’s out the window. I mean, we’ve absorbed everything we can,” Vincent says.Where there’s a will there’s a whey: cheese producers lean into their craft as Trump tariffs biteRead moreDespite having to raise prices, both Botello and Vincent say diners are undeterred as beef dishes are their biggest sellers. “Brisket is our highest seller, but lowest margin. The only way to make up for it is to sell a ton of brisket,” Botello says.Flannery, who sells dry-aged premium beef to high-end restaurants, says to make their margins, chefs generally need to mark up protein by three to four times what they purchase from him. “If I sell a steak that costs $25, they’re going to put that on the menu for $75 to $100,” he says.With alcohol consumption down in restaurants, there’s less wiggle room on costs. “In the old days, they could say, Okay, I’ll back off on my margins on the protein, because I’m going to sell $100 bottle of wine,” he says.So far there’s little sign of Americans eating less beef despite the high prices, but that’s the biggest worry, since beef prices have increased much more than pork or chicken. That’s what worries producers like Kenzy and Perez.“Demand destruction is the biggest risk,” Anderson says. “There’s not much evidence yet. But (consumers’) income is a concern, because if we were to go into a big recession, that matters a lot.”Explore more on these topicsBeefOur unequal earthFoodUS economyAgricultureTexasSouth DakotaBrazilfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Never in his wildest of dreams couldLuke Donaldhave imagined this scenario for his imperious European team. They will head into the final day of the Ryder Cup leading 11½–4½ and requiring a mere two and a half more points from 12 singles contests for retention. The fat lady is gargling.There will be analysis – and plenty of it – about American capitulation under the erratic leadership of Keegan Bradley but the scale of what they have run into must also be recognised. Tommy Fleetwood has won within half a point of the US tally on his own. Perhaps Bradley should deploy pairs of golfers again for day three. The Europeans have already made history, courtesy of their largest ever pre-singles lead.PGA silent after Ryder Cup MC leads foul-mouthed chants abusing Rory McIlroyRead moreEurope have therefore enjoyed the last laugh over American galleries who have let themselves and this sport down.Thuggish, moronic and personal insultstowards Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry especially dominated Saturday at Bethpage Black. Yet as Europe led their hosts the merriest of dances, thousands of punters streamed towards the exit gates. Resale prices for Sunday tickets, which were $750 (£560) to begin with, have crashed online.“The job is never done till it’s done,” said a typically pragmatic Donald. “So I’m not going to sit here and be complacent. I know how strong the US are. They will have plenty of fight in them, they had plenty of fight today. Our guys had a lot, too, though.”An example of how one-sided thisRyder Cuphas become can be taken from the clock. When JJ Spaun and Xander Schauffele defeated Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka at 6.20pm, it was the first US point on the board since 10.38am. In between times, McIlroy had backed off a birdie attempt on the 6th green with the utterance: “I am not going to putt until they shut up.”View image in fullscreenShane Lowry reacts to the crowd as Rory McIlroy looks to putt on the 6th.Photograph: Harry How/Getty ImagesSecurity, lots of it, followed McIlroy and Lowry over the back nine of a successful fourball clash with Justin Thomas and Cameron Young. While Thomas did his best to quieten hecklers at times, he also whipped up the audience. Lowry was held back by his caddie at one stage, with scores of offensive punters removed from the crowd. Whether reflective of a wider society or simply a New York Ryder Cup, this was a dismal scene.McIlroy turned into politician mode when asked to assess what he was subjected to. “When you play an away Ryder Cup, it’s really, really challenging,” said the Masters champion. “It’s not for me to say. People can be their own judge of whether they took it too far or not.

Justin Rose not unreasonably feltBryson DeChambeauand his caddie were fiddling about on his line as he waited to putt on the 15th. The Englishman’s request for the American duo to move brought a furious reaction. The matter rumbled on to the walk to the 16th tee, where DeChambeau had a pop at Fleetwood. The intervention of Fleetwood’s caddie Ian Finnis – all 6ft 7in of him – prompted DeChambeau to beat a hasty retreat. “I was waiting to putt, the boys were obviously working on their read,” Rose explained. “Obviously they going through a lot of calculations and bits and pieces.“I waited a few seconds and then I felt like they came up again. I questioned whether … I was like: ‘It’s my putt, right?’ Or however I said it. Maybe I didn’t say it as politely as I could have said it in the moment but by no means was there any disrespect or anything like that.

This has been an utterly miserable Ryder Cup for Scheffler. On Saturday morning, the world No 1 played with Russell Henley, losing by a hole to Robert MacIntyre and Viktor Hovland. Rahm had combined with Tyrrell Hatton again for foursomes success over Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay. McIlroy and Fleetwood eased to a win against Harris English and Collin Morikawa in the same section.The final match of the day was in the balance playing the final hole. Sam Burns and Cantlay held out hope of at least half a point from Hatton and Fitzpatrick. Europe had other ideas, both golfers hitting approaches to tap-in range. Fitzpatrick’s effort from a fairway bunker was special and a fitting denouement for those in maroon shirts. Europe took both sessions 3-1.View image in fullscreenThe Bethpage Black scoreboard spells out the scale of Europe’s lead.Photograph: Mike Egerton/PAHovland was due to partner Fitzpatrick in the afternoon before a late switch. The Norwegian has been troubled recently by a neck injury, which flared up during his foursomes match. Should Hovland be unable to play in the singles, the US would also remove a player, with both sides taking half a point. This would clearly edge Europe even closer to victory. Neither Donald nor Hovland will want such a situation to play out. Nonetheless, given the lack of sportsmanship afforded to them from the galleries here, the Europeans do not owe this event anything. They also, it must be noted, need no help.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupUS sportsGolfLuke DonaldJustin RoseBryson DeChambeaunewsShareReuse this content"

Now the only unbeaten side left in the Premier League having stretched their run to club record 18 matches thanks to this dramatic late victory over champions Liverpool, Palace are about to embark on their first European tour when they face Dinamo Kyiv in the Conference League on Thursday and have a manager that is proving to be a bit of a genius.Arne Slot’s expensively assembled side thought they had kept up their run of rescuing late points when Federico Chiesa equalised Ismaïla Sarr’s opener. But the winning goal came from another substitute as Eddie Nketiah’s volley in the seventh minute of stoppage time recorded their first victory against Liverpool here since November 2014 and sent the home supporters wild. While Marc Guéhi put in another faultless performance against the club thatcame so close to signinghim earlier the month and even provided the assist for Nketiah’s clincher, above all this was a triumph for the system that has been implemented by Oliver Glasner since he arrived in south London 18 months ago. On this form, Palace are a match for anyone.Crystal Palace merited last-gasp win over Liverpool, admits Arne SlotRead moreContinuity has been one of the keys to their recent success and the return of Sarr – who scored in a third successive game against Liverpool – from injury meant Glasner was able to name the same team that started the FA Cup finaland Community Shield, apart from new signing Yeremy Pino replacing the departed Eberechi Eze.Liverpool still haven’t settled on their first choice XI after a busy summer of recruitment. Having spent almost a combined £250m on Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, Slot probably felt compelled to start them both – especially afterHugo Ekitiké’s unhelpful red cardin midweek ruled him out of contention. But Liverpool looked a far cry from the team that started this season with five straight wins as Palace seized the initiative in the first half.As well as possessing a rock solid defence, Glasner’s side have also become lethal from set-pieces under the Austrian – asLiverpoolfound to their cost in the ninth minute. Virgil van Dijk’s loose pass was intercepted by Tyrick Mitchell and after breaking upfield, Palace won a corner that was contested by Slot and his backroom team. But the impressive Daichi Kamada’s inswinger was headed by Ryan Gravenberch under pressure from Guéhi and it fell perfectly for Sarr to sweep home. It should have been 2-0 in the next attack when Kamada pinched the ball off Gravenberch but Pino could not convert Sarr’s cutback.View image in fullscreenIsmaïla Sarr fires Crystal Palace into an early lead.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PALiverpool looked stunned and they had to wait almost five minutes to take a free-kick after a medical emergency in the crowd that required the intervention of medics. All was well in the end before Mohamed Salah hit the wall and a brilliant save from Dean Henderson somehow diverted Gravenberch’s piledriver on to the post. The direction of traffic was largely one way, however, and only two stunning saves from Alisson kept Liverpool in touch. First the Brazilian did well to scoop Daniel Muñoz’s effort off the line before he stood tall against Jean-Philippe Mateta in a one-on-one.Ibrahima Konaté had endured a particularly testing afternoon having earlier been booked for hauling down Mateta but the France defender was inches away from equalising when he headed Dominik Szoboszlai’s corner wide. Palace’s dominance was underlined by the fact that Isak recorded only his sixth touch of the first half during 10 minutes of stoppage time that were added on. Another flowing move started by Maxence Lacroix’s stunning pass ended with Mateta striking the post with a curling effort before he blasted just over on the volley. Half-time couldn’t come soon enough for Liverpool, while Palace left the field to a deserved standing ovation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Instead, Conor Bradley was replaced by Cody Gakpo as Szoboszlai reverted to right-back and the German moved into midfield. He seemed much more at home there than stuck out on the left flank, with Wirtz setting up Gakpo for a shot that wasn’t far away from Henderson’s post before forcing the Palace goalkeeper into a point-blank save from Szoboszlai’s cross that he really should have scored from.Isak was the next to spurn a big chance after wriggling his way into the penalty area before firing wide. “What a waste of money,” sang the Palace supporters. Liverpool camped out in their half as they pushed for a way back into the game. But it needed a mistake from Chris Richards when he failed to clear Gravenberch’s cross to allow Chiesa to slam home the equaliser and keep up their record of having scored in their last 39 league games. But Nketiah made sure this was another afternoon to savour for Palace when he chested down Guéhi’s flick-on and provided the killer blow after the visitors failed to clear a long throw from Muñoz deep into stoppage time.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueCrystal PalaceLiverpoolmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Minnesota trails the best-of-five series 2-1.It’s believed to be the first time in the history of theWNBAthat a coach has been suspended for a playoff game.Minnesota assistant coaches Eric Thibault and Rebekkah Brunson also were fined by the league. Thibault was fined for his inappropriate interaction with an official on the court. Brunson was fined for an inappropriate social media comment directed at WNBA officials.In her postgame rant, Reeve called for the WNBA to make changes at the league level when it comes to officiating. Monty McCutchen is the head of WNBA officiating, and Sue Blauch is the head of referee performance and development for the league.Reeve, however, focused her anger on the three game officials from Friday night: Isaac Barnett, Randy Richardson and Jenna Reneau.“The officiating crew that we had tonight – for the leadership to deem those three people semifinals playoff worthy – is fucking malpractice,” Reeve said.The play that drew Reeve’s ire was Alyssa Thomas stealing the ball from Napheesa Collier near the three-point line and going toward the other end of the court for the game-sealing layup.Collier injured her leg on the play and had to be helped to the locker room. Reeve said Collier “probably has a fracture”, though she didn’t elaborate on the injury.Though Collier crashed to the court after the players collided, the National Basketball Referees Association posted a highlight of the play on X with its description of why officials were correct to not blow their whistle.“This is NOT a foul,” the post said. “Thomas legally gets to the ball and knocks the ball loose prior to any contact. The leg to leg contact is incidental once the ball is clearly loose.”There have been several complaints about WNBA officiating this season. Las Vegas coach Becky Hammon has voiced her issues with the physicality in the playoffs.“You can bump and grab a wide receiver in the NFL for those first five yards, but you can do it in the W for the whole half court,” she said. “You put two hands on somebody, it should be an automatic foul. The freedom of movement? There’s no freedom. I’m not saying we’re not fouling, too. I’m not saying that. I’m saying it’s out of control.”WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert addressed the league’s officiating during All-Star Weekend in July.“As we go forward on the officiating, we hear the concerns. We take that employee input,” Engelbert said. “Every play is reviewed. We spend hours and hours and hours. Obviously, we use that then to follow up with officials’ training.“Consistency is important. I think some people observe our game versus other basketball formats [and think] there aren’t a ton of fouls called, but I realize consistency is the name of the game.”Explore more on these topicsMinnesota LynxWNBAPhoenix MercuryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Though it probably should have been three points rather than one. A point edged Tottenham into the surprise party Crystal Palace, Sunderland and Bournemouth are enjoying in the top five as João Palhinha’s strike in the depths of stoppage time denied Wolves. Showing a fight and determination hitherto lacking from their season, the visitors had seemed destined for victory via Santiago Bueno’s scrappy opener.So close to a tactical triumph for Vítor Pereira, who signed a new, three-year contract last week, despite his team being on nilPremier Leaguepoints. “The spirit was there, everything was there but the last minute, it’s football,” said the Wolves manager.Tottenham 1-1 Wolves: Premier League – liveRead moreHis team will require so much more than a single point, considering other expected relegation candidates’ promising starts. He had taken drastic action. From a home defeat by Leeds last week that heightened the growing disquiet at Molineux, Wolves’ starting team selection featured nine changes, the same formula successful against Everton in the Carabao Cup.A near repeat of the form that relieved Gary O’Neil of his duties almost a year ago had suggested the continued danger of asset-stripping a squad. At Tottenham, a number of Wolves’ summer buys who mystified fans showed they had something to offer, only for concentration to lapse at the last as Pape Sarr laid up Palhinha for a raking drive.As the final whistle sounded, Pereira threw his notes in rage at the turf: “Some players came at the end of the market and then went away with their national teams,” he said. “Now we are building the spirit and putting them on the tactical page. We came here to win this game.”Sam Johnstone could only watch Palhinha’s strike fly by, after an excellent performance. In replacing José Sá he repeated a fine performance against Newcastle a fortnight previously. Like many others, Sá’s performances have fallen below standard. “They understand the decisions,” Pereira said of the omissions. “The first half we had some problems but the second half my team were the best team on the pitch.”Johnstone said: “We have to be proud of today. That is our baseline performance now.”View image in fullscreenSantiago Bueno bundles home to give Wolves the lead.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesIn the midst of a heavy schedule, a trip to the arctic circle set for Tuesday in the Champions League, Spurs rushed to get their Saturday night assignment completed, missing a number of first-half chances. They were eventually relieved to collect a point they would have struggled to collect under their previous management.“We were clearly on top and in control,” said Thomas Frank of the first 45 minutes. Matt Doherty, the right-back, unprotected by Jhon Arias ahead of him, was booked when his hefty challenge stopped one of Destiny Udogie’s trademark overlaps. In the final action before the break Doherty hit the bar from a corner Spurs struggled with. It served as an unheeded warning.Pereira’s half-time changes reverted his defence to the usual back three/five from the previous four. The speed of Jackson Tchatchoua, the summer arrival, a half-time replacement, was deployed to stop Mohammed Kudus’s runs. Successfully, too; Udogie’s influence also faded.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jørgen Strand Larsen, who held the ball up expertly until being replaced late on, had been given a first bite of the cherry as Spurs again failed to clear their lines.Wolves did not completely sit on their lead, Hugo Bueno forcing a save from Gugliemo Vicario. Arias, a star of the summer’s Club World Cup with Fluminense, showed off serious chops with neat touches buying breathing space. His fellow South American, André, another former “Flu” player, impressed in midfield.Frank’s late changes included the withdrawal of the disappointing Xavi Simons. Like many of his colleagues, little had come off for the Dutchman.

Call it progress, consistency, momentum. Or just back-to-back Premier League victories for the first time. The manager had taken encouragement from last Saturday’s2-1 home win over Chelsea, even if United had almost located their own feet with heavy gunfire in the closing stages.It needed to be a platform. And yet, as so often, United followed one step forward with two in the opposite direction. The question beforehand had concerned which United would turn up because nobody can ever be sure, least of all Amorim.Ruben Amorim rues Manchester United lack of character after latest defeatRead moreThey gave their answer during a laughably bad opening 25 minutes when they conceded two horror goals and were fortunate that the damage was not worse. Igor Thiago continued his positive start to the season forBrentford, scoring both of them, and, for United, the tone was set.There was a first United goal for Benjamin Sesko in the 26th minute but his team pretty much went through the bingo card of frustrating stuff after that. Lack of conviction at the back. Lack of penetration in the final third. Errors all over the pitch. Check.There was even a penalty miss by Bruno Fernandes on 76 minutes, his second in west London of the season, after the one he blazedinto the Thames at Fulham. This time, after another long wait, Caoimhín Kelleher read his intentions and went the right way to save.View image in fullscreenIgor Thiago slams a thunderous shot past Harry Maguire to give Brentford the lead after eight minutes.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesAmorim finished with Kobbie Mainoo, Joshua Zirkzee and Mason Mount on as substitutes. It was Mainoo alongside Fernandes in midfield, Bryan Mbeumo at right-wingback, Mount at leftwingback. It was total attack. And yet, predictably, it would end in a total mess as Brentford broke in stoppagetime and the substitute Mathias Jensen flashed a shot from outside the box through the hands of Altay Bayindir.Quick GuideShould Nathan Collins have been sent off?ShowNathan Collins was behind Bryan Mbeumo and pulled him back. Craig Pawson awarded a penalty but Collins was only booked. The challenge was looked at by the video assistant referee but he did not recommend a review.Law 12 says:Where a player commits an offence against an opponent within their own penalty area which denies an opponent an obvious goal-scoring opportunity and the referee awards a penalty kick, the offender is cautioned if the offence was an attempt to play the ball or a challenge for the ball; in all other circumstances (e.g.holding, pulling, pushing,no possibility to play the ball etc.), the offending player must be sent off.It continues:The following must be considered:distance between the offence and the goalgeneral direction of the playlikelihood of keeping or gaining control of the ballThe Premier League match centre said on social media that Mbeumo was deemed not to be in control of the ball.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.For Keith Andrews, it was another good home result; the statement victory of his Brentford tenure so far. For Amorim, the numbers in the league are probably worth printing: W9 D7 L17.Amorim had called for an aggressive start. Actually, he had begged for one. Instead, United were pedestrian. They were loose. And they felt the early body blow. The finish from Thiago was quite something. He allowed Jordan Henderson’s long ball to bounce, set himself with a little header that was slightly away from goal and then lashed a rising drive into the near top corner.The major detail of the breakthrough was that Thiago had pretty much the entire United half into which to run. Matheus Cunha had looked for a cheap free-kick at the other end that was not there and when Henderson launched the pass, Harry Maguire rushed up to play Thiago offside, only he was too slow. It almost goes without saying that Maguire was never going to make the yards back.Where to start with the verdict on United during those first 25 minutes? It was just so bad with and without the ball – especially without it. Brentford had time and space. They worked their patterns. They threatened from set pieces, including Michael Kayode’s long throws.The second concession was another disaster from a United point of view. It followed another long ball and more meekness, Matthijs de Ligt and Maguire both guilty. Thiago had helped it wide left for Kevin Schade, who was allowed to cross and Bayindir could only parry weakly at the feet of Thiago, who had continued his run in expectation of an error. It was a tap-in.United’s lifeline came out of nothing. Patrick Dorgu stretched to cross high from the byline and when Mbeumo, who was given a warm welcome back from the home crowd, leaned into Kelleher, the goalkeeper coughed it up to Sesko. It was a case of third time lucky for the United striker. Twice, Kelleher denied him at close quarters. He was powerless when the ball broke for Sesko again.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Their best streak has been the three in January, two of them in the Europa League. Ilett, now with something approaching a privet hedge atop his cranium, simply lives in hope.United’s lack of goals under Amorim has been chronic and there was an edge to the pleadings from their fans on the hour. “Attack, attack, attack,” they chanted.

It was as though United were going through the motions.View image in fullscreenCaoimhín Kelleher saves Bruno Fernandes’s penalty.Photograph: Richard Pelham/Getty ImagesBrentford had chances to restore their two-goal cushion. Sepp van den Berg almost got to a Nathan Collins header in front of goal while Thiago was denied by an excellent Bayindir save.Brentford had structure in midfield. Henderson provided the assurance, Mikkel Damsgaard flitted in the No 10 role. Amorim went all out when he introduced Mainoo for the ineffective Manuel Ugarte. Now there was no defensive bone in the middle of the pitch for his team.United wanted a red card for Collins on the penalty because he did not look to have tried to play the ball when he pulled back Mbeumo. The referee, Craig Pawson, spared him. And when Fernandes missed the kick, United had that painfully familiar sinking feeling.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueBrentfordManchester Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They could have taken the £125m, bought players at their leisure, and the sense going into the season would probably have been one of quiet satisfaction at a decent summer.Premier League wants minimum six-point penalty for serious breach of planned spending rulesRead moreThere has, at least, been an attempt to address some obvious issues in the squad. Callum Wilson was getting old;Yoane Wissa is not only an upgradebut his pace and capacity to pull wide make him a more natural fit for the dynamic counterattacking approach Eddie Howe favours.Anthony Elangabrings pace and directness on the right and is probably a step up from Jacob Murphy. Jacob Ramsey adds to their creative options. There may be a sense that Malick Thiaw has not quite kicked on as many hoped he would when he first emerged at Schalke but, at 24, he’s a good young defender who adds depth and may yet develop.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak’s goal at Wembley helped Newcastle to Carabao Cup glory – but that triumph has a slight taint now.Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PAThe shadow of Isak, though, and more specifically the acrimonious nature of his departure, hangs over everything. IsNick Woltemadebetter than Isak? Obviously not. But is Woltemade plus Wissa potentially better in a year or two than Isak plus Wilson? Possibly.In terms of transfer value, the two pairs roughly cancel (while opening up significant PSR headroom given the nature of amortisation). But because so much emotional energy was invested in keeping Isak, Newcastle’s season has begun in a funk: not great, not terrible, but dominated by three0-0 drawsthat have highlighted the absence of a high-class centre-forward.Eventhe Carabao Cup triumphhas a slight taint now. How can fans settle down to watch a rerun knowing the clinching goal was scored by somebody many would be dismissing as a rat just a few months later?It is both the blessing and the curse of the big one-club, post-industrial cities of the north that the identification of club and city is so strong. That’s why that victory at Wembley in March stimulated such a feeling of civic pride, but also why Isak provoked such strong reactions: in rejectingNewcastle United, he was also rejecting the city and its people.What Newcastle are going through now is the equivalent of a painful break-up, reminders of lost love materialising at every turn. That feeling is likely to be particularly acute on Sunday as they face Arsenal, against whom Isak excelled last season. Hescored the winner in the league at St James’ Park– a glorious header from Anthony Gordon’s outswinging cross – and then in both legs of the Carabao Cup semi-final.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They also beat Arsenal 1-0 at home the previous season, a series of games that has seemingly contributed to Mikel Arteta’s adoption of an increasingly physical and cautious approach.Woltemade did score the winner against Wolves and has produced enough nice touches while sporting distinctive facial hair to raise the possibility he could become a cult figure, but – assuming he starts – facing Gabriel Maghalães and William Saliba or Cristhian Mosquera is a whole new level of challenge.Why, then, given the near-inevitability of Isak’s departure and the futility of keeping a player against his will, and the fact his sale could have been made into a positive, creating PSR headroom for significant spending, did Newcastle wait until the last minute to take the money?On one level it was simply a failure of leadership. With the sporting director, Paul Mitchell, having left in June, there was a vacuum, nobody to make the decision or to present the board’s position to the public. But perhaps it stung particularly because deep in the folk consciousness of the club is a memory of the 1980s, when Newcastle were forced to sell Chris Waddle, Peter Beardsley and Paul Gascoigne, contributing to the sense of the club as a diminished entity. Isak was not, as those three were, local – but he had been taken to local hearts and become an emblem of a possible future competing with the very best.View image in fullscreenNick Woltemade scores against Wolves – but the prospect of facing Arsenal’s defenders is a far bigger challenge for Newcastle’s new signing.Photograph: Richard Lee/ShutterstockThere is an echo of the sale of Andy Cole to Manchester United in 1995, the same bewilderment at letting a prolific forward join a Premier League rival, but at least then Kevin Keegan appeared on the steps to explain the decision and there followed a few months later the world-record signing of Alan Shearer. Sir John Hall’s largesse in funding transfers had not stopped. Whether the Saudis remain so committed is less clear.Ambitioustalk of a move to a new stadiumin Leazes Park in March seemed a reaffirmation of their commitment, but little has happened since, beyond a petition being raised to save the park. Perhaps there will be progress now David Hopkinson is installed as chief executive, but no decisions are expected until next year at the earliest, in line with the Saudi Public Investment Fund’s (PIF) generalpolicy of retrenchment.The “strategic realignment” is particularly directed at investments outside Saudi Arabia and, while it may be true that PIF has become frustrated by PSR as a check on the pace of growth, the regulations also serve as useful cover for investors scaling back. As theSwiss Ramblefootball finance Substack pointed out, a £73m loss from 2021-22 falls out of PSR consideration this year, meaning Newcastle can make a loss of about £80m this financial year and still be compliant.And that’s the other – ultimately more unsettling – element of the Isak debacle. It’s not just that he will be missed; it’s what he represents. He was the symbol of Newcastle’s imagined future as an elite club with world-class players, a bellwether of the success the Saudi money could bring. Now Isak has gone, and so too has much of optimism about the transformational impact PIF’s investment could have.Explore more on these topicsNewcastle UnitedInside footballSaudi Arabia and sportcommentShareReuse this content"

The play ended with Thomas hitting a layup that put the Mercury up by six.After running onto the floor to dispute the call, Reeve was given her second technical foul of the night, resulting in an ejection.Postgame, Reeve didn’t hold back on the profanities while weighing in on the officials.“This is the look that our league wants, for some reason,” she said of the game’s physicality. “We were trying to play through it, we tried not to make excuses. One of the best players in the league [Collier] shot zero free throws. Zero, and she had five fouls. Zero free throws. Got her shoulder pulled out and finished the game with her leg being taken out, and probably has a fracture.“And so this is what our league wants. OK. But I want to call for a change in leadership at the league level when it comes to officiating. It’s bad for the game.“Reeve added, “The officiating crew that we had for tonight, for the leadership to deem those three people semifinals playoff worthy is fucking malpractice. I can take an L with the best of them. I don’t think we should have to play through more than what they did.“We’ve got players – (Maria Kliundikova is) on the glass and gets fucking cracked, and there’s no call. And all of them decided, ’It wasn’t my call, I don’t know, I didn’t see it that way.’ They’re (bleeping) awful.“The Mercury shot 22 free throws in the game, hitting 18. The Lynx ended up 10 of 11 at the line.Collier, 29, scored 17 points and grabbed six rebounds.

How do they adapt to life in the public eye?Jacob UittiSat 27 Sep 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 05.01 EDTShareMichael Cooper knew pressure. The NBA’s 1987 Defensive Player of the Year had won five rings with the 1980s Showtime Lakers, blocking shots alongside Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and finishing “Coop-a-loop” passes from Magic Johnson for dunks. But in 2000, things were different. He wasn’tinthe game, he was coaching it from the sidelines for the WNBA’s Los Angeles Sparks. And despite Cooper being named coach of the year, the Sparks fell short in the playoffs to the Houston Comets.“When we lost that,” Cooper says, “people said, ‘Coop, you’re supposed to be this great coach. And you can’t get the Sparks over the hump.’” It was hard to swallow. When most people come up short at work, the world doesn’t know about it – or debate it on live television. “With fame comes consequences,” says Cooper. “You have to take the good and the bad.”Cooper, who was inducted into the NaismithBasketballHall of Fame last summer, has an interesting relationship with fame. Though he was on the Showtime Lakers, he never quite feltfamousin the 1980s. He wasn’t a big-name college player when he came out of the University New Mexico and his rise in the public consciousness was a slow burn. Cooper became the Laker’s premiere sixth man, coming off the bench, sublimating his ego for the sake of wins.“I felt famous,” Cooper says. “But I felt famousas a team. The team was very good, and people appreciated that. When I was walking down the street, if people knew basketball, they knew who I was. But they didn’t see me as an individual [star] – it was more the team.”Others on the Lakers, though, got major attention. Particularly Johnson. If LA lost, Magic would take the blame. Cooper was able to avoid the worst criticism because he wasn’t one of the big stars. He remembers the 1981 playoffs when LA lost to the Rockets. Johnson took a bad last shot and the Lakers lost out on a chance to repeat as champions.“The media talked about that all summer,” Cooper says. “For me, I had the luxury – I was able to receive credit when I did great things, and I was able to hide when I didn’t do great things.” That was not the case, though, when he was hired by the Sparks. “But all that changes when you become a coach,” he says. “Coaching – you can’t hide.”On the court, Kenny Anderson never hid. Ever since he was at middle school in New York City, people have been writing about the point guard. “Oh my god!” Anderson days. “Thirteen years old! I’ve been getting press, media since I was 13! I grew up in it. I was good with it.” Anderson, who was a star at a young agein the city that loves its floor generals, says he was able to succeed thanks to those who looked out for him. “I had great mentors,” he says.Anderson, who was raised by his mother, Joan, says he looked to the family of another New York City prodigy, Kenny Smith, as an example. Smith, who is five years older than Anderson, was also a point guard. An All-American, Smith succeeded in the city’s pressure-packed scene and went on to star at the University of North Carolina and make the NBA. It was Smith’s family, along with several other coaches and local figures, who helped show the future Georgia Tech star and No 2 pick what to do.“His family was very important to me,” Anderson says. “I saw how he was growing up, saw how he was raised.”When Anderson was a teenager, every newspaper in New York wrote about him – from the Times to the Daily News. They chronicled each game, seemingly every pass and shot. They debated where he would go to college and what his pro chances were. Anything and everything they could find to write about was fair game. Somehow, it never became too much pressure for Anderson, who would eventually become an All-Star with the New Jersey Nets. For others – even pros –it’s not that easy.“I was a humble kid,” Anderson says. “A humble young man, that’s just how I grew up. I had a great life.”Still, no childhood can prepare anyone for what NBA life is like. Not only are your best days lauded but your mistakes are picked over and your salary is discussed on television. “That was crazy,” Anderson says. “The salary and all the things that happen with your money. That was difficult at times. I didn’t know they were able to do that. Woah! But it is what it is. I was easygoing. I moved on.”Salary is one thing – but what if fans start to follow you? For Robert Parish, a four-time NBA champion and Hall of Famer, life as a 7ft 1in basketball star had its ups and downs. People started at him because of his height, even without his fame. How did he handle the scrutiny? “That depends on how aggressive people are,” Parish says. “I still think it’s flattering and it’s a compliment that people recognize me and what I accomplished … [but] sometimes people get a little pushy.”Parish says even in retirement people will still see him on the street and all but move his longtime partner, Esther, out of the way so they can speak to him. “I don’t like that,” Parish says. During his playing days, Parish says people would trail him around. “People have followed me home, followed me to the game, followed me to the airport. I didn’t feel threatened. I just thought they were taking it too far – it’s not that serious!”For Cooper, who earlier this year led his Miami 305 team to the Big3 championship, one of the beauties of working in sports – beyond the recognition – is that there is almost always another game just around the corner. “There is always a chance to make up for your losses,” Cooper says. “You lose a game one night, you can come back and score 30 and people will forget.”He experienced that up close with the Sparks. After losing in 2000 to the Comets and seeing them with the titleagain, Cooper heard the complaints from fans. Despite his Showtime Laker pedigree, he didn’t get his team to the promised land, even with one of basketball’s all-time greats, Lisa Leslie, on the Sparks. Cooper took the criticism to heart, but he didn’t ever let it break him.“It made me a better coach the following season,” Cooper explains. “I got back to the drawing board. The next year, we were able to break the stranglehold Houston had.” Indeed, in 2001, the Sparks won their first WNBA title. Cooper and company could celebrate at last. “People said, ‘Wow, I guess youcancoach! I guess youdoknow what you’re doing’” Cooper says, with his trademark chortle. (The Sparks won their second title the following season.)But few in pro hoops have won as many games as Cooper in their careers. Anderson, whose 90s New Jersey Nets team didn’t always rise to the level of expectations set for them, knows that. “I got negative attention,” he says. “It was all based on what I said and what I did. It was fair – hey, that’s just how the ball bounces. I understood that because I was a public figure I had to watch what I said and did. If I didn’t, it was coming back [on me].”Not everyone, Anderson notes, is able to handle that kind of weight.“I was built different,” he says. “I was able to overcome that because of the growth [from] the people that raised me.”Explore more on these topicsNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Yes, five, any fatalism blown away. So much for boring, so much for the title race being over already, so much for Real Madrid’s invincibility; this was a destruction that puts Diego Simeone’s side six points from the top – a gap, no longer an abyss – and it was thoroughly deserved.When that last one went in, it seemed almost absurd to recall that Atlético had been 2-1 down, that a familiar fear had hung here. This was fun instead. For almost the entire second half it had been certain too: there had been no doubts, just enjoyment, total control imposed through total conviction.They had gone a goal up through Robin Le Normand, just as they had taken the lead in every game this season only to repeatedly relinquish it, and that had slipped away from them again when Madrid scored two in 11 minutes. This time though, that came back again, goals from Alexander Sørloth and two from Julián Alvarez putting them 4-2 up. Now, here was one last flourish. Amanitathey call it in Spain: a little hand, a goal for each finger. Clenched perhaps: it had hit Madrid hard. They arrived having won every match, nine points above their neighbours; they left having been battered.View image in fullscreenJude Bellingham and Real Madrid had no answer to Atlético in the second half.Photograph: Susana Vera/Reuters“No excuses, we weren’t good enough,” Xabi Alonso said. Atlético were, a wrecking ball smashing away at the edifice Alonso has been building and doing so from the very start, the noise rolling down the stands and across the pitch, rising with every run. Madrid could not deal with this. At left-back, Álvaro Carreras in particular was struggling with Giuliano Simeone, the coach’s son who plays with an intensity that is as manic as his old man.They had only been playing three minutes when Atlético made their first chance and Sørloth had three of them before they finally got the breakthrough. Alone in the area, Sørloth slowed to shoot and was denied that time. The next, his header was pushed over by Courtois. And then, when Pablo Barrios caught Carreras and released him again, Courtois got there just in time. A moment later, Nicolás González struck just wide.Quick GuideEuropean roundup: Juventus held by 10-man AtalantaShowJuventusmissed the chance to move top of the Serie A standings at least temporarily when they were held to a 1-1 draw at home byAtalanta, coming from behind to equalise but unable to find a late winner when the visitors were down to 10 men.Kamaldeen Sulemana twisted and turned his way into the area in first-half added time before drilling his shot through the legs of Vasilije Adzic and into the far bottom corner for Atalanta. Two substitutes combined for the 78th-minute equaliser. João Mário’s ball into the box was mis-hit by the defender Odilon Kossounou and Juan Cabal pounced to poke home from close range. Two minutes later, Atalanta's captain, Marten de Roon, picked up a second booking, but his team held on.Interwon 2-0 atCagliarithanks to an early goal from Lautaro Martínez and a late strike by the substitute Francesco Pio Esposito, and moved up to fifth in the Serie A standings.Inter are on nine points in fifth, Juventus are on 11 in second and Napoli, the leaders, are on 12 before visiting Milan on Sunday.Borussia Dortmundoutclassed 10-manMainz 2-0 with goals from Daniel Svensson and Karim Adeyemi to secure a fourth straight league win that stretched their unbeaten run in the Bundesliga. Dortmund, who host Athletic Bilbao in the Champions League on Wednesday, have now gone 13 league matches without defeat, going back to last season, and have not conceded a league goal since the first matchday on 23 August.Bayer Leverkusenneeded the magic touch of Alejandro Grimaldo to set up goals for Edmond Tapsoba and Ernest Poku and earn a 2-1 victory atSt Pauli. There was a remarkable match atBorussia Mönchengladbach, whereEintracht Frankfurtled 6-0 by the 47th minute, but let in four in the last 20 minutes and won 6-4.ReutersWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The problem, though, was a recurring one: if Atlético had had a handful of clear sights already, Kylian Mbappé needed just one to wipe out all they had done, which had always been the fear. A sharp exchange with Arda Guler enabled him to spin in behind and strike a clean, low shot into a corner. At that point, it might have felt familiar. Coming into this, on average Atlético had conceded every other shot they faced, while it had taken them 10 to score. Meanwhile, this was Mbappé’s eighth league goal already.That average was brought down too, a move that started right on Madrid’s own byline with Dean Huijsen smashing a clearance long ended in the net at the other end. Le Normand misjudged the flight; Vinícius Júnior escaped and pulled the ball back for Arda Guler to score. Two shots, two goals. And as if to prove the point, that fear that what happens in the areas had been undoing all Atlético do between them, in the very next minute Alvarez hit a post. That was Atlético’s seventh shot.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Madrid had scored two from two but would not score again; they would barely shoot again, in fact. And although Atlético’s equaliser would have to wait until Koke’s glorious inswinging ball was headed in by Sørloth, they did not stop there. The striker sprinted into the welcoming arms of the supporters in the south-west corner and have returned again before the break. The latest in a long line of dangerous crosses, this time from González, just evaded his forehead as he was starting to turn the tendons in his neck.That left Simeone Sr on his knees over on the touchline but he would be up again, loving this. They all would. The second half had barely started when Guler tried to clear a corner, instead catching González in the chest and giving away a penalty. Alvarez, who missed one at Mallorca seven days ago, made it 3-2, another ghost exorcised and this place going wild. What an afternoon it had become. Sørloth had another superb chance and before Griezmann wrapped it all up, Alvarez curled a free-kick through the wall, the cracks in Madrid’s facade found, the foundations of this stadium shaken by the noise.Explore more on these topicsLa LigaAtlético MadridReal MadridEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Some managers decide attack is the best form of defence, but Enzo Maresca has twice gone in the other direction. Chelsea’s head coach made a baffling call duringlast Saturday’s loss to Manchester United, responding to Robert Sánchez’s early red card by removing too many offensive players, and it was less than encouraging to see Maresca decide there was no reason to tweak his approach when his stuttering side found themselves at a numerical disadvantage against Brighton.The frustration from the fans was audible asChelseafell back after Trevoh Chalobah was sent off early in the second half. Defensive players were introduced when Andrey Santos, Estêvão and Pedro Neto were sacrificed. Maresca had attacking options, but ignored Alejandro Garnacho, Jamie Gittens and Tyrique George.Fernandes blows penalty as Brentford defeat piles pressure on AmorimRead moreHe was out of substitution windows and unable to bring on a forward after Brighton, whose substitutions were far more positive and influential, took a 2-1 lead when Maxim de Cuyper scored his first goal for the club during stoppage time.It was a strategic error. The rumblings of discontent at Chelsea are growing louder. They have taken one point since the international break and have lost at home in the league for the first time since December. Chalobah’s dismissal for the denial of an obvious goalscoring opportunity means Chelsea’s only options in central defence for next Saturday’s visit by Liverpool are Jorrel Hato, Josh Acheampong and Benoît Badiashile – assuming Maresca does not decide to bring Axel Disasi out of cold storage.It is worth remembering that Maresca did not exactly hide his desire for a new centre-back after losing Levi Colwill to a long-term knee injury. His bosses disagreed. Incidentally, Behdad Eghbali, Chelsea’s co-owner, was joined by the recruitment team in going down the tunnel after full time.Were they heading for the home or away dressing room? Off to sign more Brighton players? This was sweet for Brighton. The celebrations were wild when Danny Welbeck’s second goal made it 3-1.Brighton have lost so many players and executives to Chelsea during the past three years. The enmity has grown. Brighton cherished their third consecutive victory over Chelsea. The only worry for Tony Bloom, Brighton’s owner, might be that Chelsea respond to this result by coming for one of his players. A defender, perhaps?View image in fullscreenTrevohChalobah of Chelsea leaves the pitch after receiving a red card for a tackle on Brighton’s Diego Gómez early in the second half.Photograph: David Cliff/EPA“In thePremier Leagueyou cannot give away presents,” Maresca said. “We need to learn quickly.”Maresca transmits frustration. Building on winning the Club World Cup has been more challenging than anticipated. Chelsea are not clicking and the injuries are piling up. Cole Palmer is out for three weeks with a groin injury and the problems at the back were exacerbated when Tosin Adarabioyo and Wesley Fofana were ruled out of this game.Time to use that deep squad. Hato, the 19-year-old Dutch defender, joined Chalobah in central defence and there was a first league start for Santos, whose initial drive in midfield was central to Chelsea’s early dominance.It was not a surprise when they led after 24 minutes, Moises Caicedo releasing Reece James on the right and the captain delivering for Enzo Fernández to head in his third goal of the season. “Chelsea dominated,” Brighton’s manager, Fabian Hürzeler, said. “After the goal everything changed. We played with more courage.”Chelsea, who lined up with four former Brighton players, dipped after half-time. The momentum shifted when James, who tired at right-back, went off for treatment after jarring his knee. A mixup followed, Santos inadvertently poking the ball to Diego Gómez, who was through on goal and just outside the area when he was brought down by Chalobah.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Brighton stirred. Maresca threw on Acheampong, Malo Gusto, Roméo Lavia and Badiashile. The pressure grew. Hürzeler introduced Welbeck and moved the outstanding Yankuba Minteh to the left flank.Faced by no counterattacks, Brighton pushed up and probed. Minteh and Welbeck missed chances. Eventually they combined, Minteh dancing past Gusto and crossing for Welbeck to head in the equaliser.Gusto, Maresca said, was on to help James deal with Minteh. Nothing worked for Chelsea and their composure disappeared. There was a brawl after Brighton appealed for a penalty.Brighton led when Yasin Ayari’s cross led to two substitutes combining, Mats Wieffer heading across for De Cuyper to score.Short of attacking outlets, Chelsea folded.

The right-back’s cross was smacked in at velocity and Oscar Bobb’s attempt rebounded off Estève and past Martin Dubravka.Nketiah’s stoppage-time winner ends Liverpool’s perfect start at Crystal PalaceRead moreThe 65th-minute strike left Guardiola hugging Pep Lijnders, his assistant, and will surely be pointed to by the manager as the blueprint City need to consistently call upon. Until this, his team had been ponderous, lacking the slickness that befuddles most foes.Guardiola said: “We started the game really well, but after we dropped [off]. In the second half we found the goals and it was much better in the last 20 minutes.”Scott Parker’s disappointment reflected this, too. “5-1 does feel harsh – for 70 minutes we were right in this game and we caused City some problems,” said Burnley’s manager.City kicked off holding a 12-1 aggregate lead from the past three meetings and inside 15 minutes it became 13-1. Doku’s fine early-season form continued as he burst in from the left and shot; Dubravka palmed the ball straight to Foden, whose hit, at close range, pinged off Estève for his first own goal of an unfortunate outing.With Rodri unavailable – Guardiola said the midfielder told him on Friday he was not fit enough to play, with pain in a knee – Nico González deputised, and one effort from him was deflected for a corner he flicked on for Erling Haaland, who marginally missed his connection. It came after another Doku thrust down the left was followed with a sharp shot the busy Dubravka repelled.View image in fullscreenPhil Foden of Manchester City celebrates the first own goal from Maxime Estève (No 5).Photograph: James Gill/Danehouse/Getty ImagesAfter a Friday eulogy about the returning Kyle Walker, Guardiola’s programme notes did not mention the former captain, who left on loan for Milan in January before summer’s permanent move to the Clarets. If this was a mere oversight, there was 20-20 vision from Foden when racing back to defend: from the left, Lyle Foster ran in and passed to Josh Laurent, and when he shot Foden was a barrier who blocked.They required a similar act from Rúben Dias when Quilindschy Hartman received on the left and crossed. But, caught square, Dias failed. Jaidon Anthony blazed at goal, the ball knocked the inside of the defender’s right ankle and Gianluigi Donnarumma was beaten.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It again exposed a soft City core that has opponents sniffing blood when attacking. At play is, partly, the loosening of his team’s former stranglehold – a corollary of Rodri’s absence; both here and for most of the past year. Another factor is the rearguard’s paucity of pace – Walker’s speed is a serious miss.As documented in City’s All or Nothing Amazon series, Guardiola has form for delivering impassioned team talks. If one was delivered at half-time he still had to watch Foster threaten to give Burnley the lead, the attempt hitting Nunes.When Tijjani Reijnders had a shot at the other end it followed precise Doku-González interplay; the midfielder sprayed wide, but City’s next foray yielded gold. Haaland, falling back, nodded across the area for Nunes to smash in to provoke joy – and relief – in sky blue ranks.City finally located their high gear via the Doku-Foden-Nunes-Bobb combination that caused Estève’s second dose of ill-luck.This was contest over, but there was still time for Doku, yet again, to help pierce Burnley. A dribble preceded a pass to Haaland and he made no mistake. Nor did Haaland when running through after a defensive horror show involving (again) the hapless Estève. Dubravka was allowed no chance.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueManchester CityBurnleymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It was the second week in a row the Gunners have dropped points,following a goalless draw at Manchester Unitedlast Sunday.“We’ve lost four points and that’s not what we’ve wanted,” Slegers said. “We need to learn from this and learn very fast. We had more possession and solutions, but we didn’t have enough urgency in and around the box. When the game is 1-0 the opposition always believe they can get back in it.”Damning results show how much work there is still to do for women and ethnic minorities in football | Suzanne WrackRead moreIt was a frustrating afternoon for the home side in front of 24,712 fans and the point was just reward for a resilient Villa performance that was let down only by a defensive error for Frida Maanum’s early opener. Missy Bo Kearns’s short pass was intercepted by Mariona Caldentey and fed to the Norwegian for her to slot her shot past Sabrina D’Angelo.Arsenal were worthy of the lead, dominating possession with Kim Little driving play from the middle, but they struggled to capitalise on that dominance, managing two shots on target in the first half despite 28 touches in the opposition area. Villa had a kinder return, one shot on target and four touches. That reflected the level of Arsenal supremac,y but Villa are not an easy side to play against, despite winning one point from their opening two games.Arsenal experienced their strength in April at Villa Park, with the home side 3-0 up inside 46 minutes before going on to win 5-2. Natalia Arroyo expected “a little bit of revenge vibes” in their first meeting since that defeat, but after the break it was the Villa who looked sharper.Ebony Salmon went closest in the 53rd minute, her effort slipping narrowly wide of the far post, while they failed to capitalise on a bursting run from substitute Kirsty Hanson.View image in fullscreenFrida Maanum opens the scoring for Arsenal.Photograph: Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArsenal made changes in the 65th minute, Victoria Pelova and Caitlin Foord replacing Maanum and Olivia Smith, and their best change of doubling their lead in the second half came when the ball landed at Foord’s feet in the area , but her hesitation allowed Villa to nullify the danger. A fine save from D’Angelo denied Katie McCabe, while the goalkeeper got low to halt Pelova’s effort from the edge of the area as they sought to lift the pressure late on.Villa were still much in it though. “The most important thing is dreaming, dreaming, dreaming, trying, trying, trying to the end,” said Arroyo.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

While the atmosphere improved, Celtic drew a blank for the fourth time this season as Kelechi Iheanacho and Marcelo Saracchi hit the bar and Hibs held on, which had the knock-on effect of doing a favour for their Edinburgh rivals.Brendan Rodgers said he could not fault his side beyond their finishing, with Celtic having produced 24 shots, six of which were on target. “If you look at all the metrics in the game, we created big chances, moved the ball really well. And our only downside was that killer touch in the box,” he said.“So I can’t be displeased with the performance. You always want to win and you want to win well. And if we get one of those opportunities in the first half, it just opens the game up. But we just couldn’t quite make the finishing touch. Why? It’s a bit of everything. It’s technique, it’s a bit of luck, it’s really good goalkeeping, defenders making blocks. But what’s important is I’ve been here in 0-0s before and some of the ones this season, we haven’t been creative. I thought we were creative in some really good areas.”View image in fullscreenCeltic fans unveil a banner protesting against the board during the 0-0 draw with Hibernian.Photograph: Jacob King/PAAsked about the protest, Rodgers said: “I can only focus on the football. That’s the challenge for me at the moment, to give the supporters that belief that we will continue to improve. And I think they would have liked that performance. Obviously, they would have loved to have won the game and I want people to be coming away and talking about the football and the performance rather than the protests and the silence. But the players reacted really well to it. And after that 12th minute, you really felt the support and the lift, which can make the difference.”RampantHeartsmoved two points clear of Celtic at the top after Alexandros Kyziridis’s wonder strike set them on the way to a 3-0 victory at Tynecastle. The Greek winger, one of several new signings unearthed for the Edinburgh club by the data firm Jamestown Analytics over the summer, broke the deadlock with an audacious effort midway through the first half. Lawrence Shankland, the captain, then fired home his third goal in two games before defender Craig Halkett headed the third early in the second half.Derek McInnes hailed Kyziridis afterwards, calling the strike “unbelievable … and it had to be to beat Scott Bain, who I thought was really good forFalkirk. He made some brilliant saves and it had to be exactly where it went, in the top corner. What a brilliant moment for Kizzy. I thought he carried the fight for us today and got them on the back foot. His goal was magnificent.”Jimmy Thelin insisted he does not fear the sack afterAberdeensuffered a late collapse to lose 2-0 againstMotherwell. The Dons’ winless and goalless start to the season continued as they conceded twice in added time at Fir Park. Aberdeen’s goalkeeper Dimitar Mitov let Johnny Koutroumbis’ shot slip through his grasp in the second minute of stoppage time and Apostolos Stamatelopoulos converted from the penalty spot minutes later.It is now 615 minutes since the Pittodrie side last scored a league goal. Thelin may have guided Aberdeen to their first Scottish Cup success in 35 years, but the reaction of the travelling supporters at Fir Park suggested the tide is turning against the Swedish manager.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was so dramatic, and so barely believable from a sporting perspective, that it felt like a moment that could surely never come close to being repeated.Leigh overcome Wakefield in playoff to set up semi-final rematch with WiganRead moreUntil now, that is. Almost exactly 25 years to the day, the same team – who history has shown can never be written off, even when all seems against them – produced another moment from the sporting gods to keep their season alive in a fashion that even just a few seconds earlier would not have seemed remotely possible.Make no mistake, in almost every single moment prior to Shane Wright scoring one of the greatest and most dramatic tries Super League has ever seen to secure victory for St Helens at the expense ofLeeds Rhinos, Paul Wellens’ side were labouring and, quite frankly, limping towards a miserable exit from the playoffs.They trailed for most of the evening and the knives were being proverbially sharpened when, with less than 10 minutes remaining, they were behind by eight points. The Saints, who have struggled in attack all year, suddenly needed two tries to keep their season alive. At that point, it seemed inevitable that it would be Leeds progressing to face Hull KR next week in the semi-finals.But what they did next beggars belief. Jon Bennison’s try and subsequent conversion brought the gap down to two before they were awarded a penalty as the full-time hooter sounded. They kicked deep, and produced a move in which the ball passed through almost every pair of hands, shifting left to right and then right to left, with Wright the lucky man to touch down.The Leeds players slumped to the turf, their season suddenly over. The Headingley crowd was stunned into silence. And the Saints’ squad and travelling support were sent into delirium. “Someone reminded me this week that the ‘Wide to West’ try was 25 years ago on Monday … it’s almost like it was written in the stars,” Wellens said.“To our credit tonight, we weren’t perfect but we stuck to the task and played to the end. That shows you the rewards you can get. But when the dust settles, we’ve only got into the next round and we’ve another big game next week.” That game comes against the all-conquering Super League leaders, where they will undoubtedly have to go up several levels.Because this playoff tie was fairly low on quality before that stunning finale. Leeds led 12-6 at the break thanks to tries from Chris Hankinson and James McDonnell, with Jonny Lomax briefly levelling the scores for the Saints. When Jake Connor added a penalty to make it 14-6 going into the final quarter, the destiny of the tie only seemed to be going one way.It was perhaps no surprise that what transpired in the final few moments left the Rhinos’ head coach almost lost for words. “It’s a tough game, isn’t it,” Brad Arthur said. “Sport can be unfair sometimes but we’ve had enough chances to win that game in the second half so we just have to go away and learn from it.”Arthur is right. Leeds could, and perhaps should, have put this game to bed. But that won’t be remembered now. What will be remembered for ever more is how the Saints, against all the odds, somehow plucked a victory from nowhere thanks to Wright’s miraculous late try. It will forever stand the test of time, and who knows where it could lead to next.Because the funny thing about that iconic West try a quarter of a century ago? It proved to be the catalyst for the Saints to go all the way to Old Trafford and win the Grand Final. The prospect of history repeating itself seemed impossible even after the full-time hooter had sounded on Saturday evening but now, no outcome can be ruled out.Explore more on these topicsSuper LeagueSt HelensLeeds RhinosRugby leaguenewsShareReuse this content"

Unbelievable atmosphere’Supported byAbout this contentSarah Rendellat Allianz StadiumSat 27 Sep 2025 15.44 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 21.53 EDTShareZoe Aldcroft, the England captain, said winning the Rugby World Cup was “what dreams are made of” and that winning 33 matches in a row made the case that the Red Roses team were the greatest in women’s rugby history.Aldcroft led England toa 33-13 win against Canadaat a sold-out Twickenham to cap off a dominant few years. Their last loss came against New Zealand in the 2022 Rugby World Cup final, which ended a previous unbeaten run of 30 games.The Gloucester-Hartpury co-captain, who was appointed Red Roses skipper in January, said: “Honestly it is unbelievable. It is literally what dreams are made of. We have so much belief in this group, we have built something so special over the last three years and today was about sticking to our processes and believing in ourselves.England outclass Canada to capture glorious Women’s Rugby World Cup triumphRead more“Everyone just had to do their own job and I think that is what everyone did today. I am just so proud of every single one of those girls. It was such an amazing occasion as well, playing in front of 82,000 people. That was next level and I think it was a chance to redefine women’s rugby.“We have been on this journey of ‘for the girls’, it wasn’t just about the girls in that circle but also the girls we inspire and the girls who have come before us. Also for everyone who supports us and wants to be a part of us as the Red Roses. It was just amazing. A dream come true.”Aldcroft was also asked if she believed the World Cup trophy sealed their title as the best team in women’s rugby history, to which she replied: “It definitely feels like that. We have had 33 wins in a row, we have finally put the cherry on top of the cake with winning the World Cup. It feels great at the minute.”John Mitchell took over as head coach in 2023 with all roads leading to this final, after the team failed at the last in the previous two World Cups. The New Zealander said the triumph was among his best achievements in his almost 30-year coaching career. He said: “It’s big. To be part of a winning World Cup side is huge. Sometimes you look back and: ‘Jeez, certain tournaments elude you.’ I must admit I am only normal. Could be sitting here saying: ‘I could have brought closure to a World Cup.’ Being part of bringing closure to a World Cup is very fulfilling.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The former Arsenal striker’s volley in the seventh minute of stoppage time after Liverpool failed to clear a long throw meant that Palace are the only unbeaten side in the Premier League and fare three points behind the leaders in second place.Liverpool – who had won their first five league matches – thought they had rescued a point after Federico Chiesa equalised Ismaïla Sarr’s opener three minutes from time after a corner. But while Slot refused to blame their defensive struggles on an inability to defend set-pieces afteralso conceding from twoagainst Newcastle last month, he was honest enough to acknowledge that Palace were deserved winners.Nketiah’s stoppage-time winner ends Liverpool’s perfect start at Crystal PalaceRead more“They had more than only two set-piece goals,” said theLiverpoolmanager. “They didn’t score more, but they had chances from open play, from transition. So there were more things not to like than only defending the set-pieces.“The good thing was that in the other moments, Alisson saved us. Palace have a few threats. Set-pieces are one of them, but counterattack and balls in behind are number two and three. From all these situations, they’ve created a lot of chances. We were able to create quite a lot against a Palace team, which hardly ever concedes a chance.“But when you look at the first half, they totally deserved to win. In the second half, it was a much better performance from us. If one team deserved to win, it was Palace.”Alexander Isak made his first Premier League start since leaving Newcastlefor a British record fee,but the Sweden striker had just six touches in the first half as he struggled before missing his only real sight of goal after the break.“It had a lot to do with the low intensity of the game,” said Slot. “He was close to a goal. He was very honest to stay on his feet. He got a little bit of a shirt pull. That’s why he was unbalanced when he had to shoot. He didn’t score, but quite a good performance.”The Palace manager, Oliver Glasner, was full of praise for his side after a first half that he described as the best they have played since he succeeded Roy Hodgson. But the Austrian, who had to wait until the ninth match of the campaign to pick up his first win last season, warned that being unbeaten at this stage and having matched the club’s record of 18 games without defeat in all competitions counts for nothing as they prepare to face Dinamo Kyiv in their Conference League opener on Thursday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The captain said: “We expected the tough start, we knew what Argentina was going to bring. They took their opportunities in the first half.“The message after half-time was to cut out the stupid errors and penalties we were giving away and to play as composed as we can.

He casually drop-kicked the ball towards Feinberg-Mngomezulu who was to take the restart, and Chocobares picked up the loose ball as the home players stood waiting and crossed the line.

But no more. They are world champions for a third time and this one may taste all the sweeter for being played out in front of a world-record crowd of 81,885. The result will have apermanent effect on the sport in England.‘Kildunne and Dusted’: Red Roses dialled up to 11 for emotional World Cup victory | Robert KitsonRead moreIt was just a few years ago when the Red Roses would run out to a few thousand fans who had stayed behind after the men had played. Now, they are turning a profit for the Rugby Football Union and securing silverware in the process. The celebrations do not stop at Twickenham, with an event at Battersea power station on Sunday.Ellie Kildunne’s brilliant individual attacking sizzle will rightfully be in the spotlight once again with her efforts making the difference at times, but Alex Matthews and Sadia Kabeya must share some of the acclaim. The No 8 is ever-consistent in an England shirt and showed up on the biggest stage with two tries, while Kabeya, the player of the match, fronted up in defence.View image in fullscreenThere is no stopping Ellie Kildunne as the England back sprints to the line with an immediate response to Canada’s early try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianCanada were expected to start fast and it looked like it until they knocked on to set up the first scrum. Both finalists boast an impressive set-piece, but England ate them up in the first instance. Back and forth went possession, but a lost lineout allowed Canada to pounce and the first blood went the way of Asia Hogan-Rochester.England responded well and after winning penalty advantage, Kildunne danced and twisted to the line in another phenomenal solo effort. For the next period it was all about the hosts, though they fumbled two attacks as the showpiece continued to be closely fought. However, just as the catch and drive undid them in the 2022 final, it was responsible for their next try through Amy Cokayne.View image in fullscreenAlex Matthews crashes over for England’s third try.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianTatyana Heard intercepted when Canada looked to be creating a promising attack and while Canada’s defensive set rendered plenty of penalties, they did prevent England from scoring. That was until Matthews, who won the World Cup in 2014, sniped when England went through phases after another impressive scrum.Canada were in desperate need of points, but despite continually knocking on the door, England’s defence was impressive, particularly through their captain, Zoe Aldcroft. Canada won a penalty with Sophie de Goede adding three points. At half-time the score stood at 21-8 after England had a try ruled out because of obstruction in the lineout.Livin’ on a Prayer by Bon Jovi was the soundtrack and “we’re halfway there” never felt more suitable for England’s supporters. Whoever scored first in the second 40 would land a psychological blow and the victor of that particular element were England through Abbie Ward.Quick GuideNew Zealand see off France to claim third in playoffShowThe New Zealand wing Braxton Sorensen-McGee ran in two tries as the Black Ferns finished third at the World Cup with a 42-26 victory over France in the playoff for bronze.The 18-year-old star Sorensen-McGee, the tournament's leading try scorer, produced her 10th and 11th  tries of this World Cup in a comfortable win at Twickenham for the deposed champions.New Zealand were taken apart 34-19 by Canada in the semi-finals and France faced the backlash, althoughLes Bleueshad their moments, especially in the second half.The Black Ferns had built a 26-7 lead by the interval with Ruahei Demant, Sylvia Brunt, Renee Holmes and Laura Bayfield crossing, rewarding their ambition in attack.France staged a fightback with Léa Champon, Gaby Vernier and Emilie Boulard going over, but Sorensen-McGee's finishing instincts ensured there was no danger of an upset.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.With England’s prop Hannah Botterman receiving a yellow card for a dangerous tackle, Canada took advantage with Hogan-Rochester going in again.

Scheffler went one worseSat 27 Sep 2025 19.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 22.15 EDTShareScottie Scheffler went to the 1st tee on Saturday afternoon backed by the theatrics of a prize-fighter making his ringwalk. He crossed the bridge from the practice green to the grandstand alongside Bryson DeChambeau, the thumping bassline and clavinet riff of Sirius by the Alan Parsons Project rattling the aluminum beneath their feet: the same track thatonce summonedMichael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls thundered from the speakers, the closest US analogue to the All Blacks’ haka for spine-tingling pregame stagecraft. The scene was set for the world’s best golfer to spark a comeback, to pull the United States back from the edge of humiliation at Bethpage Black.Instead, it became the overture to a historic dud.Europe had surged to an 8½–3½ lead after the morning foursomes, becoming the first side in the 98-year history of the competition to sweep the opening three sessions on foreign soil. The mathematics offered a sliver of hope. The psychology offered none. And at the heart of it was Scheffler, presumptive spearhead of an American fightback, becoming an emblem of its futility.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler tried to get things going but failed.Photograph: Jared C Tilton/Getty ImagesNo world No 1 had ever started aRyder Cupby losing three straight matches. No player in the modern era had begun 0–3 and been sent back out for a fourth try. Scheffler managed both. On Friday, he and Russell Henley had been flattened by Viktor Hovland and Ludvig Åberg, before falling 3&2 with JJ Spaun to Jon Rahm and Sepp Straka. On Saturday morning, paired with Russell Henley, he lost the anchor match to Hovland and Robert MacIntyre after he was left standing on the 18th tee with a chance to salvage a half, only to shove a wedge from 104 yards into ignominy. It was a shot that told the story of his week: the swing unbroken, the outcome betraying him.It wasn’t that Scheffler completely unravelled. Europe simply played sublime golf, all but devoid of mistakes. But by nightfall Scheffler had become the first American ever to lose in each of the first four sessions of a Ryder Cup, joining only two Europeans – Peter Alliss in 1967 and Peter Townsend in 1971 – in that unwanted company.There was no respite for Scheffler on Saturday afternoon as the agony piled on. Rising tensions and temperatures on either side of the ropes prompted spectator etiquette warnings that flashed across the grounds, drawing lusty boos from eight-deep galleries packed with mostly American spectators. When Justin Rose holed from seven feet to close out a 3&2 win on 16, the broader US defeat was in effect sealed and thousands of fans clad in red, white and blue made a mass exodus to the gates with two matches still on the course. Europe had not reached the 14-point threshold to retain the trophy formally, but the 11½-4½ scoreline when the dust settled made it clear we wouldn’t need Sunday to determine the winner.It was a bleak punctuation to what had been two years of near-unbroken supremacy for Scheffler. For much of that span it seemed only the Louisville police could slow his roll. The 29-year-old has won six times this year, with two majors, on top of seven titles and a second Masters crown in 2024. It’s the kind of all-time heater that has drawn straight-faced comparisons to Tiger Woods. But those comparisons cut both ways. Woods never imposed himself on the Ryder Cup, never looked quite the same in the fourball and foursomes crucible. Scheffler is tracing the same line, his authority dissolving the moment he is asked to blend his game with another’s.Ryder Cup: USA 4½-11½ Europe – visitors dominate fourballs to stretch lead on fiery day two – liveRead moreAnd it’s here where the flaws in his own game, papered over by the relentless volume of birdies in stroke-play golf, have been ruthlessly exposed. His ball-striking remains magnificent, the thing that separates him from everyone else. But the putting can be uneven, sometimes merely streaky, sometimes worse. At Bethpage it has looked fragile, a weakness that seeps into the rest of his rhythm, tightening the shoulders, clouding the judgment.He has tried to present an even keel. “We battled hard out there,” he said after Saturday morning’s loss. But his face told a different story: the blank stare later that afternoon following his approach on the 9th, which struck the flagstick and bounded into the rough; the sag of his shoulders as another par putt slid past the edge. For a player who has made a career of managing his emotions, of walking slowly, speaking softly, never flinching, the Ryder Cup has laid bare a rare unraveling.That detachment was something hespoke about openlythree months ago, on the eve of the Open at Troon (which hewent on to win). He expounded thoughtfully for five minutes on how he does not invest his ego in his golf. But after watching the camaraderie, respect and passion of the Europeans’ display this week, it gives rise to questions over whether his mindset is an asset or a liability in a team event.View image in fullscreen‘Keegan Bradley [left] had little choice but to keep calling Scottie Scheffler’s number.’Photograph: David Davies/PANothing in his scintillating form augured the results of the past 48 hours. He has been the best golfer in the world by a distance, at times so far clear in the rankings it invited statistical comparisons with peak Woods. Yet golf is cruelly specific about where it chooses to test you. A Ryder Cup is not a 72-hole marathon, it is five violent sprints. It does not reward the steady accumulation of small advantages anddumbfounding consistencythat has become his signature, but demands the nerve to hole a five-footer at the exact moment everything depends on it. That is where Scheffler has been found wanting.The USA captain, Keegan Bradley, had little choice but to keep calling his number. On paper he was always America’s best chance, the player most likely to conjure something from nothing in a competition where it got late early. And so Scheffler kept marching back to the tee, head down, music blaring, sent out to turn back a tide that had already swept the United States away.Quick GuideRyder Cup singles pairings and timingsShow12.02 EDT/17.02 BSTCameron Young v Justin Rose12.13 EDT/17.13 BSTJustin Thomas v Tommy Fleetwood12.24 EDT/17.24 BSTBryson DeChambeau v Matt Fitzpatrick12.35 EDT/17.35 BSTScottie Scheffler v Rory McIlroy12.46 EDT/17.46 BSTPatrick Cantlay v Ludvig Åberg12.57 EDT/17.57 BSTXander Schauffele v Jon Rahm13.08 EDT/18.08 BSTJJ Spaun v Sepp Straka13.19 EDT/18.19 BSTRussell Henley v Shane Lowry13.30 EDT/18.30 BSTBen Griffin v Rasmus Højgaard13.41 EDT/18.41 BSTCollin Morikawa v Tyrrell Hatton13.52 EDT/18.52 BSTSam Burns v Robert MacIntyre14.03 EDT/19.03 BSTHarris English v Viktor HovlandWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.There will be time to pick apart what this defeat means for the United States as a whole. The inquest will not be quick. For now it is Scheffler who embodies the horror of it, the champion who came in gilded and will leave diminished, the world No 1 who discovered that in the Ryder Cup, numbers don’t count, rankings don’t matter, reputation is immaterial. Only the shots you hit in the moment. And for Scheffler, too many of them have missed the mark.Explore more on these topicsRyder Cup 2025Ryder CupUS sportsGolfScottie ScheffleranalysisShareReuse this content"

In a dismal start to what turned into one of the most rancorous day’s play in the history of the competition, the female master of ceremonies employed to inject some life into the crowd at the 1st tee was recorded using a megaphoneto lead a chant of “Fuck you Rory!”before Saturday morning’s foursomes. The PGA of America, which is organising the tournament, was approached for comment but remained oddly silent.The incident set the tone for everything that happened after. The words became a recurring chant, and by the end of the day the atmosphere around his fourball with Shane Lowry against Justin Thomas and Cameron Young had become so foul that the PGA of America had brought in a squad of state police to try to restore order.Ryder Cup: USA 4½-11½ Europe – visitors dominate fourballs to stretch lead on fiery day twoRead moreIt has to be said McIlroy has not helped himself. During his Friday fourball, he flipped his finger at a heckler while he was walking off the 11th green after Lowry had made a putt to put the team 2 up. On Saturday, McIlroy responded to the chants on the 1st tee by blowing kisses at the crowd. But he finally snapped when he reached the 16th during his foursomes match with Tommy Fleetwood. Someone shouted out: “Freedom!” while McIlroy was getting ready to make his swing. He turned to face the crowd and snapped back: “Shut the fuck up!” before he stepped back up to the ball and hit it to three feet from the pin.“I don’t mind them having a go at us, that’s to be expected, that’s what an awayRyder Cupis,” said McIlroy after the round, although you guess he was being diplomatic given that a lot of what was said was about his wife and private life. “Whenever they are still doing it while you are over the ball and trying to hit your shot, that’s the tough thing. You know, look, in between shots, say whatever you want to me. That’s totally fine. But just give us the respect to let us hit shots. Give us the same chance that the Americans have.” It did not make any difference.Quick GuideRyder Cup singles pairings and timingsShow12.02 EDT/17.02 BSTCameron Young v Justin Rose12.13 EDT/17.13 BSTJustin Thomas v Tommy Fleetwood12.24 EDT/17.24 BSTBryson DeChambeau v Matt Fitzpatrick12.35 EDT/17.35 BSTScottie Scheffler v Rory McIlroy12.46 EDT/17.46 BSTPatrick Cantlay v Ludvig Åberg12.57 EDT/17.57 BSTXander Schauffele v Jon Rahm13.08 EDT/18.08 BSTJJ Spaun v Sepp Straka13.19 EDT/18.19 BSTRussell Henley v Shane Lowry13.30 EDT/18.30 BSTBen Griffin v Rasmus Højgaard13.41 EDT/18.41 BSTCollin Morikawa v Tyrrell Hatton13.52 EDT/18.52 BSTSam Burns v Robert MacIntyre14.03 EDT/19.03 BSTHarris English v Viktor HovlandWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.During McIlroy’s afternoon fourball match he had to step away from a putt because the crowd were making so much noise. This time it was his partner Lowry who reacted, shouting: “Fuck you!” after making his own putt to win the hole from 20ft. By the time the match reached the 8th, Thomas had started asking the crowd to quieten down when Lowry and McIlroy were over the ball, and the PGA of America had finally started posting frequent spectator etiquette warnings up on the big screens around the grounds. They were booed every time they appeared.“It’s really, really challenging,” McIlroy said when it was all over. He refused to be drawn on whether he thought the crowd had gone too far. “It’s not for me to say, people can be their own judge.” The look on Lowry’s face while he said it told you everything you needed to know about his verdict on it.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then his smart glasses failed on stageMatthew CantorThe Meta CEO fumbled a demo of his AI Ray-Bans, giving us hope that the robots might be too dumb to take overSat 27 Sep 2025 07.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 14.46 EDTShareAs humanity inches closer to anAIapocalypse, a sliver of hope remains: the robots might not work.Such was the case last week, asMark Zuckerbergattempted to demonstrate his company’s new AI-enabled smart glasses. “I don’t know what to tell you guys,” Zuckerberg told a crowd ofMetaenthusiasts as he tried, and failed, for roughly the fourth time to hold a video call with his colleague via the glasses.It was a limp follow-up to an ambitious opening to the event at Meta Connect 2025, a developers conference in Menlo Park,California, where the company is headquartered. The keynote was to feature the Ray-Ban Meta Display, the latest version of what is essentially a face-mounted iPhone – ideal for the consumer who lacks the energy to pull a device from their pocket and idolizes both Buddy Holly and the Terminator. Despite that undeniable appeal, the show was a technical mess – perhaps the perfect homage to the latest pointless iteration of digital hardware.The show had a promising start. Viewers witnessed Zuck making his way to the stage to thumping music, performing an alarming number of fist bumps en route. The moment was presented onscreen through the camera on his glasses, so that the audience could see “Mark’s POV”. All the while, he was receiving a flurry of text messages expressing enthusiasm that was no doubt genuine: “Let’s gooo” followed by a rocketship emoji, “audience is getting hyped” with a picture of two guys looking content at best, a gif saying “It’s time.”Finally, Zuck reached the stage, in his now signature big T-shirt and curls. He explained the company’s commitment to attractive eyewear, to the supremely ironic notion that “the technology needs to get out of the way” of human interaction, and to “taking superintelligence seriously”. Superintelligence is going to be “the most important technology of our lifetimes. AI should serve people, not just be something that sits in a data center automating large parts of society,” he said, sweetly assuming that society will exist beyond the next decade.If it was all an exercise in humanizing Zuckerberg, it worked: it was easy to pity the boy wonder, 41Things rolled along smoothly enough until it came time to actually use an AI feature. Zuck held a video call with chef Jack Mancuso, suggesting he make “maybe like a steak sauce, maybe Korean-inspired type thing”, which Mancuso admitted he had never made before, so he “could definitely use the help” of AI.“What do I do first?” he asked the oracle.“You’ve already combined the base ingredients,” the AI informed him wrongly, “so now grate a pear to add to the sauce.” Long silence.“What do I do first?” Mancuso asked again.“You’ve already combined the base ingredients, so now grate the pear and gently combine it with the base sauce,” the AI patiently reminded him.“I think the wifi might be messed up. Sorry. Back to you, Mark.” (Certainly it was the wifi and not the AI itself.)To his credit, Zuckerberg remained poised. “It’s all good. You know what? It’s all good,” he said. “The irony of the whole thing is that you spend years making technology, and then the wifi on the day kind of catches you.”AI demo failures are nothing new. They are something of atraditionat Google, where last yeara presenter used its Gemini toolto scan a Sabrina Carpenter concert poster listing her tour dates. “I’ll just open Gemini, take a photo, and ask: ‘Check my calendar and see if I’m free when she’s coming to San Francisco this year.’” The bot’s response was dead silence. (It finally worked on the third try, on a different device.)This year, when Google showed off a translation feature on its own smart glasses, it failed after about15 seconds. To be fair, just because there’s an error in a high-stakes tech presentation doesn’t mean a product won’t work, as anyone who watched a certain Tesla Cybertruck presentation will recall. When a designer threw a metal ball at the truck’s “armor glass” windows, it smashed them. That truck went on to a glorious future, earning the coveted title of “deadlier than a Ford Pinto”.At this point in his presentation, you might assume Zuckerberg would leave nothing to chance. But when it came time to demonstrate the Ray-BanMetaDisplay’s unique new wristband, he opted against using slides and decided to try it live.The wristband is what he called a “neural interface” – in a genuinely remarkable feat of technology, itallows you to type through minimal hand gestures, picking up on the electrical signals going through your muscles. “Sometimes you’re around other people and it’s, um, good to be able to type without anyone seeing,” Zuckerberg told the crowd. The pairing of glasses and wristband is, in short, a stalker’s dream.At least when it works. Zuckerberg attempted to call his colleague Andrew Bosworth over and over again, the audience sitting in silence as the incoming-call music played. But the CEO was unable to pick up. “That’s too bad. I don’t know what happened,” he said after the first failed attempt. Then came another – “I’m just gonna pick that up with my neural band,” he said with a straight face – but again, he couldn’t do it, as the “missed video call” alerts stacked up on the onstage display, still showing “Mark’s POV”.“I don’t know what to tell you guys, alright, but we’re gonna have Boz come out here and we’re just gonna go to the next thing that I wanted to show and hope that will work.” A sign at the back of the room, visible onscreen, read: “Live demo – good luck”.If it was all an exercise in humanizing Zuckerberg, it worked: it was easy to pity the boy wonder, 41, as he fidgeted with the controls and did his best to smile through it all.Do you trust Mark Zuckerberg to solve your loneliness with an ‘AI friend’? No, me neither | Emma BrockesRead moreBut the event as a whole felt like an out-of-touch millennial nightmare, a surreal relic of early 2000s optimism that only a cloistered Silicon Valley billionaire could embrace. The fanfare was reminiscent of Steve Jobs’ unveiling of the iPhone in 2007, with two big differences: back then, the US wasn’t collapsing offstage – at least not so obviously – and meanwhile, it was abundantly clear why a person might actually desire the device being announced. It was the internet! In your pocket! When could we get our hands on this marvel of human ingenuity?This event – and much of the AI push, as generative tools are crowbarred into hardware and software that appeared to work fine without it – wants to harness the same energy without a remotely comparable product.To a layperson, at least, it seems that consumer technology has long since entered an era of solutions in search of problems – particularly troubling at a time when the world is facing so many genuinely intractable crises. As entertaining as it is to watch our tech overlords flounder on stage, it raises bigger questions, such as: who exactly asked for this, beyond the billionaires cashing in?

However, that’s never stopped the very stable genius from inflicting his unhinged health views on the rest of us, has it? Back in 2020, for example, Trump memorably mused thatinjecting disinfectantcould help fight the coronavirus – which forced the maker of Dettol and Lysol to put out an urgent statement explaining that this was a very bad idea.Now the president, who once vowed to be aprotector of women“whether they like it or not”, has turned his attention to prenatal care. “Taking Tylenol is, uhhhh, not good,” Trump said on Monday, with his trademark eloquence. He was flanked by health secretaryRobert F Kennedy Jr, the guy who told Congressthis yearthat “people shouldn’t take medical advice from me”.Trump went on to link autism to prenatal exposure to acetaminophen, which is the active ingredient in Tylenol. If you’re feeling poorly while pregnant you should “fight like hell” not to take Tylenol to relieve your pain, the president instructed. Which basically means suffering instead: ibuprofen, for instance, is generally not recommended afterweek 20 of pregnancy.“If you can’t tough it out, if you can’t do it, that’s what you’d have to do,” Trumpcontinued. “You’ll take a Tylenol, but it’ll be very sparingly. Can be something that’s very dangerous to the woman’s health, in other words, a fever that’s very, very dangerous, and ideally, a doctor’s decision, because I think you shouldn’t take it and you shouldn’t take it during the entire pregnancy.”Like everything Trump says, this incoherent quote makes zero sense. But the bottom line here is that the Trump administration is advancing wildly irresponsible guidance. There isno evidencefor a causative link between acetaminophen and autism and many experts were aghast at Trump’s statements. Indeed, even the moral vacuum that isJD Vancebalked at repeating Trump’s advice, instead urging women to lean on their doctors. And while Trump claimed that there is “no downside” in avoiding Tylenol, an untreated feverduring pregnancycould cause problems for the baby.Trump’s demand that pregnant women “tough it out” is also deeply misogynistic and a reminder of how women’s pain is often misunderstood or ignored.Numerous studiesshow that the medical establishment takes men’s pain more seriously. A 2022 study from theJournal of the American Heart Association, for example, found that women who visited emergency departments with chest pain waited 29% longer than men to be evaluated.This sudden Tylenol scare is also yet another example of mom-shaming. “ We really have a long history of blaming mothers in this country, and we’re seeing that reinforced through the narratives around autism’s causes right now,” Martine Lappé, a sociology professor,told NPR.Women are shamed for not getting pregnant or waiting “too long” to get pregnant. They’re shamed (and, increasingly,criminalized) for losing a pregnancy. They’re shamed for everything from the size of theirbaby bumpto what they eat whilethey’re pregnant. They’re called out forexercisingwhile expecting – or not exercising enough. And if they give birth to a baby that isn’t able-bodied or neurotypical, women are often told it’s probably because of something they did. It’s their fault.While pregnant women are often treated like public property, expectant fathers are not treated with the same scrutiny. About 15% of couples in the US have trouble conceiving, and, by one count, over 50% of the time amale infertilityissue contributes. Yet women are traditionally blamed. Indeed back in the1940s researcherseven posited that women’s unconscious hatred of their husbands was what stopped them from conceiving. We’ve moved on from that a bit, but infertility is still widely thought of as a woman’sproblem.Studies have alsofound a linkbetween advanced paternal age and autism. But does society constantly shame men for having kids later in life? Of course not. When a 59-year-old Trump fathered Barron, he crowed to the press about his virility. “I continue to stay young, right? I produce children, I stay young,” said Trumpat the time.No doubt there are numerous things motivating this suddenTrump administrationobsession with Tylenol, including a need to distract people from those pesky Epstein files. However, a concern for women’s health is absolutely not at the heart of it. Rather, this is yet another way to control women; another way to reduce us to walking wombs rather than multidimensional human beings. This war on Tylenol is also very much a war on women. Now, if only there was a pill we could take to help deal with this Maga-induced malaise. As it is, we are all just going to have to tough it out.Elon Musk’s father accused of sexually abusing his children and stepchildrenConsidering it is common knowledge that Errol Musk fathered at least one child with his former stepdaughter, who was only four years oldwhen he married her mother, these new accusations, reported by theNew York Times, are not a huge surprise.

But in his determination to hound George Soros, Donald Trump wants prosecutors to become agents of his personal vendetta, facts be damned. That is the conclusion to be drawn from the instructionsissuedby one of Trump’s senior justice department officials to a group of US attorney’s offices across the country, telling them to investigate Soros’s foundation.This is the latest step in Trump’s implementation of the autocrat’s handbook, with the aim of chipping away at the checks and balances on presidential authority. Having already attackedjudges,lawyers,media companiesanduniversities, Trump now sets his sights on civil society. Soros, a longtime and extraordinarily generous funder of progressive causes around the world including in the United States, is Target Number 1. Trump shares this fixation with the likes of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, Europe’s most prominent autocrat, who for years has used Soros as ascapegoatfor widespread and growing dislike of his corrupt, self-serving rule.As the name of Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) suggests, he promotes the free and public exchange of ideas. Soros made his billions by recognizing that markets arefallible. He gave awaybillionsbased on the insight that human governance is imperfect, too, and that the best way to compensate is with independent voices engaged in free debate. Having survived as a Jewish boy in Hungary under Nazi rule, Soros understands that we are safer when people can contest government dogma.Soros has funded not only human rights activists who defend open societies but also intellectuals and journalists who have pushed the limits of public debate, as well as organizations devoted to redressing a range of injustices. My former organization, Human Rights Watch, was and remains a major beneficiary.Despite his brilliance, Soros is too modest to believe he has the ultimate answers to society’s most vexing problems. He is always self-critical, deeply aware of his inability to see the full truth, skeptical of any moment’s conventional wisdom.At age95, he has stepped back from an active role in his foundation, which is now chaired by his sonAlex. But his vision still guides the foundation and is antithetical to Trump’s delusional belief that he alone is the guardian of all wisdom while critics are to be demonized and persecuted. Soros has the self-confidence to eschew the kinds of sycophantic lackeys whom Trump prefers.The debate that Soros has long promoted is peaceful. That is the essence of the open society that he champions. OSF recentlyreiteratedthat they “unequivocally condemn terrorism and do not fund terrorism. Our activities are peaceful and lawful, and our grantees are expected to abide by human rights principles and comply with the law.”But that has not stopped Trump from insinuating without evidence that Soros and OSF are somehow supporters of people who engage in political violence. I have known Soros for more than three decades and have never seen a hint of that. It is the opposite of who he is. But stubborn reality has never impeded Trump and his acolytes in their universe of “alternative facts”.Straining to justify the vendetta, Trump’s justice department points to areportissued by a group that calls itself the Capital Research Center. It is filled with tendentious, McCarthyite allusions about OSF grantees having alleged sympathy for Hamas or tolerance of “direct action”, a supposed reference to violence.One of the prominent examples it cites is OSF’s funding of the highly respected Palestinian human rights groupAl-Haq, one of six Palestinian organizations that the Israeli government in 2021designatedas supposed terrorists. But the Israeli government bandies about accusations of terrorism the same way it tries to silence critics with false allegations ofantisemitism. I have worked with Al-Haq throughout my career and have always known it to be a fact-based, principled, and peaceful organization that fairly and objectively investigates and reports on Israeli abuses in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.Another OSF grantee targeted is the human rights groupDawn, which was founded byJamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist who was murdered by the Saudi government. One of its stated offenses is that while it condemned Hamas’s 7 October 2023 attack, it focused on the civilian, not the military, victims.That such “evidence” mighttemptTrump to order criminal charges against Soros under his newlyannouncedeffort to counter “domestic terrorism and organized political violence” means that almost anyone could be targeted.In persecuting Soros, Trump has taken on a tough target. Like Harvard, which successfullysuedrather than capitulate, Soros has the means to fight back. Moreover, unlike some law firms that cutdealswith Trump to escape his wrath, 100 progressive foundations haveannouncedthat they will mount a common defense if any of them faces Trump’s vengeance. That mutual support is the right response to Trump’s divide-and-conquer strategy.I would expect that the courts will promptly dismiss any action that Trump takes against Soros. Despite Trump’s efforts to bully them, federal judges have maintained their independence, and manycontinueto apply the law rather than Trump’s dictates. A fact-free prosecution of a well-known critic is a recipe for judicial rejection.But that doesn’t relieve Soros and his foundation from the burden of defending themselves from fabricated charges, which can be substantial. Trump’s abuse of his power to persecute an independent voice – his posturing to his base in utter contempt of the first amendment – should be widely and firmly denounced. Unless the pushback is intense enough, Soros may be Trump’s first civil society target but not the last.Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch (1993-2022), is a visiting professor at Princeton University’s School of Public and International Affairs.

It is also,says the newly mintedhousing, communities and local government secretary, Steve Reed, “putting working families in control of their lives and their neighbourhood”. This follows the English Devolution and Community Empowerment bill, which ploughs a similar furrow,legislating for, among other things, communities’ right to buy and ensuring sports venues are automatically listed as assets of community value.The strategy is being broadly understood as Labour’s answer to Boris Johnson’s much-touted “levelling up”. The investment, Keir Starmerhas said, will “get rid of the boarded-up shops, shuttered youth clubs and crumbling parks that have become symbols of a system that stopped listening”. Neighbourhoods and high streets are the place where the “change” promised by Labour’s winning manifesto must first manifest. It’s not all about the fastest-growing GDP in the G7: the strategy starts by asserting that the government’s “measures of success cannot just be shifts in national statistics but must include change that people see and feel in their local community”.Labour MPs are praising the direct investment the fund will bring to their communities. The funding allocations have been decided by, among other things, the index of multiple deprivation and the lesser-known community needs index, which measures quality of available services. When communicating the policy to their constituents and local media, they are generally leading with the cash amount being funnelled into their areas, as well they should. Money is what makes things real: policies about duties and responsibilities that cost nothing are cheap in all senses of the word.People working in what might be understood as the “progressive communitarian” space (including organisations such as Power to Change, the Independent Commission on Neighbourhoods, Locality and the Co-operative party) want to critique that narrative, however. They argue that Labour’s plans are different from the levelling-up funds because of the structures by which the money will be spent. It provides money and power.“Nothing destroys political trust like money that comes and goes,” says Caitlin Prowle, head of politics at the Co-operative party, drawing a direct contrast with Johnson’s plan: “This isn’t just about investment in communities, it’s about a genuine shift in power and ownership. This money comes with new powers to shape and own community assets, so that even when funding fades, the community owns those places and can determine their future.”As with the provisions of the English Devolution and Community Empowerment bill (but more so), it is being framed by Labour as a response to decreasing trust in politics – and, of course, toReform UK. Farage’s party placed second to Labour in a great many of the areas that will now receive funding. “This is our alternative to the forces trying to pull us apart,” says Reed in his introduction to the strategy. There are no prizes for guessing who he means.The theory of change here is based on ideas about political trust, understanding Reform as a manifestation of anti-politics. First, it argues that people want to see real delivery in their local areas – and that at this level it is possible to give it and make people believe politics is responsive to their lives. Second, it seeks to build up trust and positive feeling, from where it isstrong at a local level, so that its benefits might apply to national politics.Steve Reed is a Labour and Co-operative MP, and before entering parliament was leader of Lambeth council, in which time he set up the Co-operative Councils Innovation Network. In 2011, in his contribution to the Purple Book (an attempt at intellectually revitalising the Labour right after the 2010 defeat, featuring contributions from no fewer than five current cabinet ministers), he wrote about “handing more power to communities and the people who use public services”, something which requires turning the “traditional model upside down”.Reed is a long-term believer in the politics he is now attempting to put into practice; this background probably goes some of the way to explaining why this programme is the most fleshed-out iteration of Labour’s localism-against-Reform playbook thus far. Whether it is successful, however, depends on how well Labour can communicate the agenda and authentically own the changes that will be brought about by this shift of money and power. Reform is,many people acknowledge, significantly ahead of Labour when it comes to community organising (something no doubt due in part to the difficult legacy of the Corbyn-era Labour community organising unit, shuttered early in the Starmer years, which became for many on the then ascendent right of the party a byword for a kind of lefty excess that was both out of touch and insufficiently electorally minded). But the potential rewards are huge: a rebuke to the argument that politicians are removed from people’s real lives, and an injection of cash and autonomy to places that sorely need both.Morgan Jones is the co-editor of Renewal: A Journal of Social DemocracyExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionPovertySteve ReedLabour conferenceKeir StarmerCommunitiesReform UKcommentShareReuse this content"

I was willing to die on this hill, arguing that they distracted from the purity of the audiovisual experience: the cinematographer’s attention to detail, the glimpse of a tear in an actor’s eye, the punchline of an expertly timed joke, and so on.But I have been forced to recognise just how alone I am on this hill: in 2021, a surveyfound that80% of 18-25-year-olds used subtitles all or some of the time, while a new survey run by streaming service U found that 87% of young Britons are using subtitles more than they used to. There is no longer a debate about subtitles: among my peers, “two types” of people have given way to “mostly one type”. (Meanwhile, the 2021 surveyfound thatless than a quarter of boomers used subtitles, despite the latter generation experiencingmore hearing difficultiesoverall.)Why is this practice so common among people my age? If you aren’t hearing-impaired and are fluent in the language of the dialogue, what is it about subtitles that makes them more appealing?An easy assumption is that this is the result of a short attention span, passivity and a lazy nature, a failure of generation Zombie. But having experienced watching TV with and without subtitles, I’d say the former doesn’t beget lazy viewing so much as a quicker information download. The new status quo of “subtitles on” among the young reflects both a values shift and cultural conditioning as a result of big tech’s ever-encroaching impact on our entertainment experience.For example, the small screen in our living room has to share the limelight with the micro screen in our lap. The U survey revealed that 80% of gen Z and millennials “double-screen” when they watch. With subtitles on, I find myself being able to quickly gather what one character has said, look down at my phone, react to a message, then look up before that character has even finished their line. The viewing experience thus becomes multifaceted and efficient. The subtitles allow us to go on our phone but still absorb the content and gist of the TV show. Of course, that means they also function as mini-spoilers: when watching a comedy sketch recently, I found myself half-heartedly chuckling at a joke before it had left David Mitchell’s mouth – because I had already read it on the screen.I don’t need to use my little grey cells when watching most TV shows, but there are few, like Succession, where double-screening is a sad exercise. Even if I manage to successfully absorb each line in the script through reading, I’d be neglecting the exceptional acting. The same thing cannot be said for Love Island (although arguably the acting is of a high standard there, too).And social media itself has encouraged the use of subtitles across the board. It is now a given that most creators add text captions to their videos – without the option to turn them off. This cultural shift may explain the generational gap between boomers and younger viewers, the latter only appeased by rapid-fire content and videos with faster cuts, absorbing lightweight content at a higher speed, which text captions allow us to do.This isn’t simply a trend but a feature anchored in the algorithm itself. Text captions, rather than dialogue, encourage the video to crop up in the TikTok search engine, increasingreach and visibilityas well as viewer retention and viewing time. It began as an accessibility improvement, but the rapidity with which it has caught on suggests it’s business-oriented and crucial to getting that sweet algorithm boost. The fact that 85% of social media visual content is nowwatched on mute(while commuting, cooking, on the treadmill at the gym or in houseshares), coupled with the ease with which AI can generate subtitles without the need for human transcription, means we’re living in a subtitled world – one that is often poorly translated,low-qualityand error-ridden.Mumbling actors, bad speakers or lazy listeners? Why everyone is watching TV with subtitles onRead moreSeen this way, subtitles have been normalised as a result of our technology-infused lifestyle, rather than being something we have actively sought out or freely adopted. My flatmate, a keen TikToker, said she used to find subtitles distracting and annoying, then gradually started using them while watching TV. “I’ve felt very passive in it,” she said. “I don’t think I look at them most of the time.” Then why do you have the subtitles on, I asked. “I don’t know,” she said with a shrug.Amazingly, subtitles havenot been linkedto improvements in young people learning to read, although other studies have shown that they canimprove comprehensionof what happened in a given programme. Subtitles arguably keep us following more effectively than non-subtitles. Our TV habits are now influenced by a need for efficiency ported over from our social-media habits, which mean we can quickly glean the necessary content and then move on. In a 2023 survey,40% of Americanscited “enhanced comprehension” as the main reason they use subtitles.I have to ask: are people now watching shows just to find out what happens, and to prove they’ve seen it? Since when did we finish work, sit down on the sofa, cuddle up and think “thank god, I can’t wait for a bit of comprehension tonight”? TV is supposed to be fun. Shouldn’t we be focused on enjoying it?Isabel Brooks is a freelance writerExplore more on these topicsTelevisionOpinionDeafness and hearing losscommentShareReuse this content"

If you’re unfamiliar, the premise of the store is that shoppers identify themselves at the entrance, walk in, select the items that they want, and then a combination of AI, sensors and computer vision determine the items in their basket and process an automatic payment via a customer’s Amazon account when they walk out.If that sounds weird and disorienting then I can assure you – having visited an outlet out of pure curiosity and having left distressed – it is. Among the reasons given for the venture’s failure, from location choices to struggling to differentiate itself in the market, one financial analyst has suggested that till-less technology “always felt a little awkward”. When I visited I wasn’t totally clear on how to get in or, frankly, how to get out. A sense of panic overwhelmed me as I wondered if the sensors would process me changing my mind about an item and putting it back on the shelf, or charge me for it. Would I be prosecuted if, say, a large box of cereal blocked the sight of a tin of sardines and thus escaped the sensors?Of course every store has CCTV equipment, but the idea that sensors and cameras could be connected to my phone and track every item I touched felt like big tech overreach, surveillance on steroids. That you could just walk out of a shop without pressing pay seemed strangely incongruous with the direction of other grocery stores. Around two years ago the big Sainsbury’s down the road installedscan-receipt-to-exit barriers, a technology I had first seen in Paris, and which has been rolled out to many other big supermarkets. It is truly a nightmare. Not only does it feel like you’re going through an airport when you’re just picking up a meal deal, but the scanner is repeatedly faulty, often resulting in a pile-up of people trying to exit.Then there is the failure of self-scan checkouts. These tills were meant to save time, but that possibility immediately collapses once there’s an “unidentified item in the bagging area” or the overwhelmed shop assistant has to approve someone’s age.You might then think the idea of a till-free checkout would be a relief. But if anything, when you’re made to feel so distrusted and burdened by inconvenience it feels far more like a setup. No till? Surely someone is waiting on the other side ready to bundle me into a police van over an unscanned pot of pesto pasta.Mostly though, the failure of Amazon Fresh reveals that we are simply not ready for technology like this. It is the kind of futuristic development that you might have imagined would totally change the face of high street shopping, but shoppers have roundly rejected it. Like our reluctance totake up self-driving cars, it’s about a lack of trust in being totally at the whim of technology. Some stores have been able to win over the public – the Japanese casual wear brand Uniqlo’s self-checkout technology is pretty frictionless andgenuinely loved. But even then, as a frequent Uniqlo shopper, while the convenience is nice it makes me feel strangely isolated.View image in fullscreenSelf service checkouts in Tesco supermarket.Photograph: UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesWe need, and maybe even like, other people. Whether it’s grocery or clothes shopping, having a little chat or a flirt with a store assistant makes the experience. Recently, after a frustrating and failed attempt to find a suit for a wedding, I soothed myself by spending far too much money on a lovely knitted jumper at Drake’s on Savile Row. The shop assistant told me I looked good in it and, seeing how flustered I was, offered me an espresso. For that alone I’ll be back to blow more of my money.Of course I don’t expect that treatment on the high street or in a grocery store, but I do find myself missing the small comments of “I love these crisps, my favourite” at a supermarket till. And queueing, though I’ll rue saying this during the post-work rush, is not all bad. One of my favourite things to do in a supermarket queue is peer into other shoppers’ baskets to make a guess about what kind of evening they’re having or what kind of life they live. If you can simply walk out you might save some time, but you’ll learn less about the people around you, while a computer gets to know it all.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are two means by which they are achieved. The first is the mass killing and expulsion of the Palestinians. The second is rendering the land uninhabitable. Alongside the crime of genocide, another great horror unfolds: ecocide.While the destruction of buildings and infrastructure in Gaza is visible in every video we see, less visible is the parallel destruction of ecosystems and means of subsistence. Before the 7 October atrocity that triggered the current assault on Gaza, about40% of its landwas farmed. Despite its extreme population density, Gaza wasmostly self-sufficientin vegetables and poultry, and met much of the population’s demand for olives, fruit and milk. But last month the UN reported that just 1.5% of its agricultural land now remains bothaccessible and undamaged. That’s roughly 200 hectares – the only remaining area directly available to feed more than 2 million people.Part of the reason is thesystematic destructionof farmland by the Israeli military. Ground troops have demolished greenhouses; bulldozers have toppled orchards, ploughed out crops and crushed the soil; and planes havesprayed herbicidesover the fields.What is ecocide and could it become a crime under international law?Read moreThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) justify these attacks by claiming that“Hamas oftenoperates from within orchards, fields, and agricultural land.” And apparently from hospitals, schools, universities, industrial estates and any other resources on which the Palestinians depend. All the IDF needs to do in order to rationalise destruction is to suggest that Hamas has operated or might operate from the thing it wants to destroy. And if there’s no evidence – sorry, too late.The IDF is steadily expanding the “buffer zone” along Gaza’s eastern border, which happens to contain much of the Strip’s agricultural land. As the human rights specialist Hamza Hamouchenepoints out, rather than “making the desert bloom” – a mainstay of Israeli state propaganda – it is turning fertile and productive land into desert.The Israeli government has beenfelling Palestinians’ ancient olive treesfor decades to deprive them of subsistence, demoralise them and break their connection with the land. Olives are both materially crucial, accounting for14% of the Palestinian economy, and symbolically powerful: if there are no olive trees, there can be no olive branch. Israel’s scorched-earth policy, in conjunction with itsblockade of food supplies, guaranteesfamine.The IDF’s assault on Gaza has caused a collapse inwastewater treatment. Raw sewage floods the land, seeps into aquifers and poisons coastal waters. The same thing has happened to solid waste disposal: mountains of rubbish now rot and smoulder among the ruins or are pushed into informal waste dumps, leaching contaminants. Before the current assault, people in Gaza had access toabout 85 litresof water per person per day, which, while sparse, meets therecommended minimum level. As of February this year, the average hadfallen to 5.7 litres. Gaza’s crucial coastal aquifer is further threatened by the IDF’s flooding of Hamas tunnels with seawater: salt intrusion, beyond a certain point, will render the aquifer unusable.The UN Environment Programme estimated last year that on each square metre of Gaza there was an average of107kg of debrisfrom bombing and destruction. Much of this rubble is mixed with asbestos, unexploded ordnance, human remains and the toxins released by weaponry. Munitions contain metals such as lead, copper, manganese, alumnium compounds, mercury and depleted uranium. There are credible reports of the IDFillegally using white phosphorus: a hideous chemical and incendiary weapon that also causes widespread contamination of soil and water. Toxic dust and smoke inhalation have major impacts on people’s health.On top of the devastating immediate impacts on the lives of the Gazan people, the carbon emissions of Israel’s assault are astronomical: a combination of vastdirect emissionscaused by the war and the staggering climate cost of rebuilding Gaza (if that is ever allowed to happen) – reconstruction alone would produce greenhouse gases equivalent to the annualemissions of a medium-sized country.When you consider the ecocide alongside the genocide, you begin to grasp the totality of the Israeli state’s attempt to eliminate both the Palestinians and their homeland. As the Palestinian ecologist Mazin Qumsiyeh argues: “Environmental degradation is not incidental– it is intentional, protracted, and aimed at breaking the eco-sumud (ecological steadfastness) of the Palestinian people.”I’ve written very little over the years about the environmental impacts of armed forces, as I feel that if you cannot persuade decision-makers that killing people is wrong, you will never persuade them that killing other life forms is also wrong. I think many others have felt the same way, which is one reason why the military tends to be excused the environmental scrutiny that other sectors have felt. But its footprint, even in peacetime, is enormous. The Conflict and Environment Observatory estimates that the world’s armed forces produce roughly5.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Yet partly as a result of lobbying by the US government, they areexempted from mandatory reportingunder the Paris climate agreement. Nor are they properly held to account for their vast range of other environmental harms, from deforestation to pollution, soil destruction to unregulated dumping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For many years, green campaigners have pointed out that peace and environmental protection must go together. War is as devastating to ecosystems as it is to people, and environmental breakdown is a major cause of war.For the Israeli government, the erasure of ecosystems and people’s means of survival seems to be a key strategic aim. It appears to be seeking whatsome have called “holocide”: the complete destruction of every aspect of life in Gaza. Even without a specific law of ecocide, whichmany of us seek, the destruction of Palestinian ecosystems is in clear contravention of article 8 of theRome Statuteand should be considered alongside its great crime of genocide.But if the eventual plan is to create a “Gaza Riviera” or a similar scheme to build an eerie elite technopolis stripped of place and history, of thekind that Donald Trumpand somesenior Israeli politiciansfavour – well, who needs trees or soil or crops for that? There is no cost to the perpetrators. Or not, at least, until they are brought to justice.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Two benches and a table are bolted to the floor. Nothing moves. The bed is narrow, but I haven’t fallen out yet. When I was free, but already expecting arrest, I used to joke that prison would give me the time I always lacked – finally, I could read. But here in Rustavi Women’s Colony No 5, I have almostlost my eyesight. So now I write in encroaching darkness, about the darkness that is falling across my country, Georgia.The only window in my cell sits high up near the ceiling. On my 50th birthday, my friends and colleagues assembled on a hill opposite the prison to hold up posters and balloons. I climbed on to a chair but couldn’t quite see. I watched their greetings on the news later.For the past eight months, this has been my life under Georgia’srepressive regime: one that seeks to silence journalists, erase dissent and break our spirit. On 12 January 2025, I was arrested on charges of “attacking a police officer” during a demonstration. I spent almost seven months in pretrial detention while the case was heard. On 6 August, the judge reclassified the charge, and I was ultimately convicted of the lesser offence of resisting an officer,receiving a two-year prison sentence. This gives me the dubious honour of being the first female journalist imprisoned in Georgia for politically motivated reasons since the country’s independence in 1991. I was offered a plea deal – an admission of guilt in exchange for a lighter sentence – but I refused. To reconcile with injustice is to be buried alive.I had to find new ways to protest against the injustice this regime has subjected me to. I remember cutting off my braid shortly after I was imprisoned. They lent me scissors for two minutes, standing right at the door of the cell, watching how I used them. Back then, they offered me many things, but I took only 10 litres of water. I was on ahunger strikefor the first 38 days. I am now writing this letter to send to the offices ofBatumelebi, the outlet I co-founded, where my friends and colleagues continue the fight in my absence.I have moments of weakness. Sometimes my eyes fill with tears. But I try not to stay in that state for long. The truth is, I have no other choice: this illegitimate government is trying toabolish journalism, the profession to which I have devoted 25 years of my life. My colleagues are in mortal danger simply for doing their job. For me to stay silent now would be to betray them, myself and about 60 otherpolitical prisonersin Georgia today. Outside these prison walls, people have taken to the streets for nine months straight. Holding EU flags aloft, they have been drenched by water cannon, suffocated by teargas and brutalised by riot police. Yet they refuse to surrender. Their determination is our hope.We have faced stark existential choices before. In 1921, Georgia’s short-lived democratic republic was swallowed by Russia, with the help of Georgian Bolsheviks. Back then, the youth also fought valiantly in the streets, only to disappear for the next 70 years under the shadow of Soviet domination. Now history threatens to repeat itself, with Russia pulling us back into its orbit, aided by collaborators within our own government. The regime dances to the tune of the oligarchBidzina Ivanishvili, who made his fortune in Russia and continues to advance its interests. The regime has abandoned our European path and adopted the tools of Russian rule: propaganda, repression, corruption and fear.But Georgia is not Russia, and Georgians have consistently demonstrated resilience. Despite beinginvaded by Russia in 2008, and the ongoing arrests and kidnappings of our citizens in theRussian-occupied territoriesof South Ossetia and Abkhazia, we still choose Europe. The youth of Georgia are leading this fight against exhaustion, against despair and against the cold calculation of those who would sell our freedom.What can be done? Support Georgia’s beleaguered civil society and our independent media. Do not punish ordinary citizens by revoking visa-free travel. Target those truly responsible:Georgian Dreamparty officials and their business networks. Speak out for the people in the streets, for the journalists behind bars, for a society that refuses to bend.Offering your support toGeorgiais not only an act of solidarity – it is the pragmatic choice. Another repressive regime in the neighbourhood would endanger Europe’s own security. To abandon Georgia now would be to reward Russia’s aggression.Georgia’s national motto is “strength is in unity”. For me, being part of the EU means sharing in and contributing to that strength. We belong not in the Russian world of dictatorship and fear, but in the European family of free nations. From my cell, I can see more clearly than ever that Europe is not just about geography, it is about values: dignity, justice, equality and solidarity. And in Georgia, we are fighting for those values with everything we have – with our pens, our voices and our bodies on the streets.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I went to Vietnam last year and saw statues of Ho Chi Minh out the front of a Maserati showroom. I saw little Chinese influence. There was no domino effect.I also visited Timor-Leste, a country thatfinally is independent. It lost nearly one-third of its population and, yes, there were internal divides, but it is united in independence and no one doubts that the militias there were funded by Indonesian special forces.There were no weapons of mass destruction inIraqand the lies about them have led to wild schisms in the Sunni-Shia faultline that will play out for years.And for theWest Papuan youth, their war is not ending – it is just beginning.These were the truths that John Martinkus, among other independent journalists of his ilk, pursued with a passion. He died on 14 September.John was a handsome foreign correspondent. He was strongly connected to international affairs. He was a curmudgeon.David Bridie and George Telek on the life-changing friendship that led to one of Australia’s best albumsRead moreHis fellow correspondent Mark Davis said: “His patch was East Timor, and he did it when no one was interested and no one could get in. He broke the first stories of the forming pro-Jakarta militias, well before the referendum. The same withWest Papua– he got into West Papua.”John wrote straight, he described what he witnessed, what locals he’d befriended told him. He wrote about what we don’t get to see, what governments don’t want you to know or, if we’re letting them off the hook, can’t be honest about because of sensitive diplomacy.He was a master of courageous, no-bullshit journalism. And when the Alexander Downers of the world undermined his credibility – as was the case when he and his translator Hussein were kidnapped by insurgentsin October 2004, not long after three other journalists were killed – John became combative.He exposed the lie that Iraq was on the road to reconstruction. He said it was on “the road to shit”. He shot from the hip. On national television.I always though John was somewhat from another time, oblivious to what was going on around him. He was a character straight out of a 1930s-set Coen brothers film. The big overcoat, pork pie hat, the low growl from years of chain smoking, the constant jaw grinding.He was always an outsider, pushed out into the darker regions, and carried with him an understandable PTSD. He was there when those students he’d befriended in Dili were tortured and murdered. Hundreds of them. He was affected. He was emotional. Over his last years there was no doubt he was embittered. The demons never left him. He felt that no one was listening.Last year he travelled to Dili with his daughter Lilya.President José Ramos-Hortabestowed on him a medal “for his contribution to the benefit of the country, the Timorese and humanity.”View image in fullscreenJohn Martinkus.Photograph: Ben BohaneMark travelled with him: “It was incredible to see the groundswell of love for John … he’s a big deal in East Timor, as he deserves to be … Not too many guys can say, ‘I helped create a nation’ – and John certainly did.”After his death Lilya posted how proud she was of her “war hero” dad.John had said: “The award is not for me, it is for the students who fought proudly and defiantly for independence from the Indonesians, the translators who helped me understand …“I owe the ordinary people who gave me the information to faithfully report … They were the heroes who risked and sometimes lost their lives to give me the information that I needed to report the truth.”He authored six books, among them A Dirty Little War, about East Timor’s fight for independence. He was a four-time Walkley award-nominated investigative reporter and in later years taught journalism at the University of Tasmania.A friend said John wouldn’t want to be eulogised, wouldn’t want it to be about him – but he would have loved it.Long-form investigative journalism is gone as a genre. The era of the foreign correspondent is all but over. There’s no budget, no yearning. The work of journalists who bang the drum in our region like Ben Bohane, Jo Chandler, Mark Worth and Tim Page hardly exist any more.Last Saturdaywe played a Not Drowning Waving showwith Sir George Telek at the Melbourne Recital Centre in front of a thousand people. We dedicated the song Mr Suharto Man to John. Upon mentioning his name the love from the audience was palpable, the applause warm and loud. It was the sound of thanks and appreciation and recognition. He would have said in that low growly voice, after an exhale of cigarette smoke, “About bloody time.”David Bridie is an independent musician, producer and installation artist.

However,Tony Harrison’s collected plays run to six volumes, comprising 19 full-length dramas. Many of them are translations from Greek (The Oresteia, from 1981, is the most actable version of the trilogy by Aeschylus) or French (he did an astonishing rhyming version of Molière’s The Misanthrope in 1973). But, as Harrison’s theatre career developed, he also wrote original plays, of which The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus (1990) and Square Rounds (1992) stand as the best new verse dramas written in English since Eliot’sMurder in the Cathedralin 1935.The English versions of foreign dramas were a dividend from the extraordinary education in classics and languages available to a working-class child atLeedsGrammar School in the 1950s, before he extended his knowledge of Latin and Greek at Leeds University.View image in fullscreenTony Harrison in Canada for a production of his version of The Misanthrope in 1973.Photograph: Bob Olsen/Toronto Star/Getty ImagesThe poet-critic Sean O’Brien has observed that Harrison’s printed verse “insists that it is speech rather than page-bound silence”, and this vivid verbal quality led logically to writing words for performance by others.It was while teaching at Ahmadu Bello University in Nigeria from 1962-66 that Harrison wrote his first play, collaborating with a colleague on Akin Mata (1964), a vernacular version of Lysistrata, Aristophanes’ comedy about a pacifist sex-ban by Greek women. Harrison suppressed this text, although some have argued that the strongly visual and ritualistic nature of African theatre influenced his later stage work.Back in England in the early 70s, Harrison was picked by the director John Dexter to solve the problem of why French classic dramas rarely succeeded in English. The technical difficulty was the favoured Parisian style of alexandrine rhyming couplets, which frequently rely on soft and half-rhymes that are more elusive in English, encouraging translators towards blank verse or prose. Dexter set Harrison to translate Molière’s Le Misanthrope and Racine’s Phèdre while fully respecting their rhymes and 12-syllable rhythm.After much experimentation, delivering his drafts aloud while walking northern moors, Harrison perfected a compression technique, through lines such as “The loved one’s figure’s like Venus De Milo’s”, which had a speedy, speakable beat. By relocating the Racine to the period of English rule in India, Harrison also ingeniously widened the rhyme store: “Raj”/“sabotage”, “degrees”/“rupees”. Both starring Diana Rigg, Harrison’s The Misanthrope and Phaedra Britannica, staged by theNational Theatreat the Old Vic in London from 1973-75, were hits that still make pleasurable reading.View image in fullscreenFruitful experimentation ... Diana Rigg and Gillian Barge in Tony Harrison’s version of The Misanthrope at the Old Vic, London in 1973.Photograph: Donald Cooper/AlamyOne of Harrison’s signature stories about the English class system was of going to the gents on one of his first nights and returning to find his father beside the auditorium door, looking in bewilderment at his hand, filled like a tout’s outside a sports stadium. “People keep giving me their tickets,” said his dad, whose Sunday best had convinced the smart-casual middle classes he must be an usher.When the National moved to the South Bank in the mid 70s, artistic director Peter Hall set Harrison another frequently-failed theatrical test – rendering Greek drama into lines suited to be said rather than read. His solution in The Oresteia involved, as with the French texts, compacted content, this time through frequent hyphenated neologisms such as “grudge-dogs” and “blood-ooze.” Insistent on the actors keeping the exact syllabic beat, Harrison described his role in the rehearsal room, with characteristic wit, as “the man who came to read the metre”.Ever since being ticked off at school for his translations being too “demotic” (as described in his poemClassics Society), Harrison hankered after a literary rhetoric reflecting Yorkshire speech. He achieved this brilliantly in The Mysteries, first performed at the National Theatre in 1977. Harrison reshaped themedieval religious playsperformed by workers’ guilds in Wakefield, York and elsewhere into three plays – The Nativity, The Passion and Doomsday – that take a whole day to perform in full. Apart from Yorkshire vocabulary and vowels, the linguistic signature in The Mysteries was aggressive alliteration. Creating the world, God fills the sea with “fish to flit with fin / Some with scale and some with shell”.View image in fullscreenLost Sophoclean satyrs ... Harrison’s first original drama The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus revived at the Finborough theatre, London, in 2017.One reason that Harrison gravitated towards writing plays from scratch was frustration that even the most acclaimed translations are rarely revived, theatres tending to commission new versions. The dramatic move had also been influenced by immersion in television. In 1984, he had writtenThe Big Hfor BBC Two with composer Dominic Muldowney, a music-drama for children based on the Herod story. He also worked with BBC producer Peter Symes on a series of film-poems with verse commentaries, including The Blasphemer’s Banquet (1989), aboutthe death threatimposed on the writer Salman Rushdie.Harrison’s first theatre original,The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, ingeniously entwined expanded fragments of a lost satyr play by Sophocles with the story of the archaeologists who found them. Its successor,Square Rounds, examined the morality of scientists through the stories of the inventors of the machine gun and chemical weapons. The inventive staging incorporated live magic tricks, but audiences stayed away, and the then NT artistic director, Richard Eyre, recorded it in his published diaries as “a kind of noble disaster” that he should have done more to improve.The Guardian view on Tony Harrison: a people’s poet | EditorialRead moreEyre himself staged The Prince’s Play (1996), a version of Victor Hugo’s Le Roi S’Amuse, which channelled the anti-monarchist views that would lead Harrison to exclude himself, in the poemLaureate’s Block, from consideration for the role of poet laureate.Fram(2008), about Arctic exploration, felt unready for the stage, and was his last collaboration with the National, although The Trackers of Oxyrhynchus and Square Rounds both looked impressive on revival at London’s Finborough theatre in 2017-18.Despite lacking a thirst to sip the Queen’s sherry as national bard,Tony Harrisonbecame, across four decades, the National Theatre poet.Explore more on these topicsTheatreTony HarrisonPoetryNational TheatreYorkshireLeedsClassicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He recalls their intense bond, their last trip to Ireland and her memories of being romanced by Richard BurtonAndrew O'HaganSat 27 Sep 2025 04.00 EDTShareIfirst met Edna O’Brien on a mild spring evening in 2009. There had been a party to celebrate the 70th birthday of Seamus Heaney and I was running late, so I put up my hand for a taxi and a rumbling black cab drew to a halt. The door swung open and Edna stepped on to the pavement like Ophelia out of the weedy brook. She was a vision in black velvet and volumised hair. She paid at the window, clearly irked after some altercation with the driver, and when she turned she immediately took my hand and offered a Joycean, or possibly a Glaswegian, effusion.“I fucking hate the English. Do you?”“Not unceasingly,” I said, smiling.“You’re that Scottish boy,” she said.“And you’rethat country girl.”I made a move towards the cab. “How about I invite you to dinner on Tuesday?” I said to Edna.“Where?” she said.“The Wolseley?”“Perfect. Ask for the corner table. Lucian Freud’s table. If he’s not there, they always give it to me.”And so began a friendship founded on laughter. On the appointed Tuesday, Edna arrived wearing even more of her weed-like garments than before, and as we sat down (at the famous painter’s table) she asked for Sancerre. We were immediately into it: childhood, love, Ireland and Scotland, publishing, Harold Pinter. The waiter, who I think was Portuguese, kept being waved away by Edna when he tried to take our order, but eventually I held him by the sleeve and forced her to choose something. “We’ll have the small potato.”“Sorry, madam?”“The small potato. You have them. Delicious.”The man was totally baffled. “What about steak tartare?” I suggested. “A soufflé, maybe?”For 15 years, we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone“There was a terrible famine,” she said to the waiter. “In Ireland, Scotland. It’s all the same. And these small potatoes make all the difference.”After some negotiation, a purvey was agreed. I’m sure it involved herrings and small toasts and red meat and the small potato. By the time it was finished, Edna and I were fast friends and professional soulmates. She wanted to change publishers. She wanted to change agents. She wanted me to read something. She wanted more wine. But the stories flowed from her with the kind of talent you can’t fake. Edna was a pathbreaker, a brave artist, a brilliant diviner of human nature and folly, and from that night on, for the next 15 years, we called upon each other to complete thoughts we were unable to have alone.There was comedy at all times. Edna was anxious to a degree that could sometimes scupper any possibility of success. She often said that friendship was a benison, but just as often she feared – with some well-wisher, some visitor – that it might be a curse, and it made me laugh to see how intolerant she could be. She had what you might call the underdog’s sense of being done over, and had cause to think that way as her struggle had always been real.Her sense of outrage was a kind of energy. At the Duchess theatre, we once attended a production of Endgame, Samuel Beckett’s morbidly funny little masterpiece, and she made us climb 90 steps to look in on the actors. One of them, Mark Rylance, was perfectly nice though in a bit of a hurry, and the other immediately buttonholed Edna and suggested she write to Michael Billington, the Guardian theatre critic, to complain about his review of the play. “As if I don’t have enough to worry about,” Edna said as we thudded back down the stairs. “And not as much as athimbleof wine either!” Day in and day out for years, Edna would come on the phone speaking of “my present harassed condition”. She seemed to enjoy the fact of two writers bobbing separately and together towards their goals, but her instinct for friendship showed her when to go deeper. “We have to draw blood,” she would say, her face a mask of worry, as we sat down in her kitchen, belowJane Bown’s famous photographof Beckett. “He would get lonely sometimes and call me late at night,” she said of him. “Oh, Andrew. Beware of the man who calls you late at night, that’s all I can say.”“She’s a great part of the world, isn’t she?” Philip Roth said. The occasion was the off-Broadway opening of a play Edna had written, Haunted. She and Roth had been friends since the 1960s and she swore by his standards, by his industry, if not always by his editorial suggestions, over which she once threatened to excommunicate him. But that night their friendship was in full flower and he appeared at the theatre, proud, as he said, to know this tenacious Irishwoman with the bold prose style. She liked to say, of some of these older friends, that the friendship had survived many tests, but I was never sure if the testing had come from them or from her. (From them, she implied.) She was never reticent about sex or the part it had sometimes played in complicating a friendship. (There had been a fling with Roth but it had faded very quickly.) She liked men, but what she liked most in men who were also writers was their dedication to the task. She liked conversation with other writers, she wanted clues, and most of all she wanted an accompanying spirit to help as she moved things along.View image in fullscreenFast friends … Edna O’Brien and Andrew O’Hagan.Photograph: Bill HeaneyLate in her life, we went together for a week’s tour in the County Clare of her childhood. More than once on that drive, she grew fearful, I think, that the present-day was pulling away from her, and pulling apart her mastery of her own biography. At our hotel in Limerick, Edna told me she used to come here and look over all the churches and steeples, full of dread for her boys and her hopeless marriage. Some writers were rude to her back then. “Elizabeth Bowen,” she said, “was so condescending. She looked at me and said, with a stutter: ‘You are quite mad. Quite mad.’ She was right.”We’d arranged a visit to her childhood home, Drewsborough House. It was changed utterly, as Edna said, and I could see she was taking the house’s flexibility as an affront. “I couldn’t write about it now,” she said. “I could be drawn back into it, but I’ve done it.”We got back in the car and drove to the lough. “There’s going to be rain soon, I’ll tell you that now,” Edna said. Looking out at the fields, she played with phrases, just working with the sound of them, “the milk of the cow”, “the feel of the rain”, before rendering them into Irish. After a stop-off, she had “a little complain”, as she said, about some of the local men, their insistence and their clarion call of “listen now to me”. She felt there was some perpetual disquiet about her. She felt certain people had never forgiven her for her writing, which caused some of them to object to her plan of being buried on Holy Island (Inis Cealtra). We were headed there to look across from the bank of the Shannon at her final resting place.“Why do you want to be there?“ I asked.“Oh, because it’s beautiful. It’s isolated. And it’s full of birds. And trees all around it that are not cut down, and it’s wild. It has an old monastery covered in white lichen. And there are very few people buried there, so, if the dead commune, I won’t have much to worry about. I feel I could be buried in Tuamgraney where my mother is, but I want this house of splendid isolation.”We passed near the Bow River.“I used to love this little bit of road,” she said, “where the trees met.” I was driving but she put her hand over my hand. “I’m glad we came together. I wouldn’t have wanted it any other way and that’s the truth.”After a few moments, we dipped down a bank to the Shannon and we could see Holy Island through the slanting rain. “Oh, Andrew,” she said. “That is a very, very final thing. I have said I’m not afraid of it but I’m beginning to alter the script.”“What frightens you?”“The unknown. The nothing maybe.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

I’d better organise my demise in a sensible manner.” Looking over the sound to Inis Cealtra, it was hard to think about her demise. I saw images in my head from that decade and a half we had been friends. All the suppers, all the appearances together on stage, all the travels. But here we were, looking through the wild squall towards something on the other side of words, and she was ready for it. “I cherish our friendship and thank God for it,” she said. I took a photograph of her at the water’s edge. And at that point she turned and pushed her headscarf aside. “Shall I do a Virginia Woolf?” she said.View image in fullscreenEdna O’Brien on her trip to Ireland with O’Hagan, with her last resting place in the background.Photograph: Andrew O’HaganEdna slowly declined over the next few years but something burned in her – a kind of determination, I suppose. One May evening in 2023, she asked me to come over and bring a few things from Melrose & Mortgage, as we jokingly called it, an extortionate delicatessen in Primrose Hill. “Oh, Andrew, what’s going to happen?” she said. “I’m dying.”I suggested we open a bottle of Laurent-Perrier, which somebody said was Oscar Wilde’s favourite champagne. That made her smile. On the table there was a copy of her novel The Country Girls. She opened the book and read a sentence or two, beginning to weep as she did so. “There are some things in this world you cannot ask,” she read. “Oh,Agnus Dei. There are some things in this world you cannot.”“Give me your hand,” I said.She cheered up then. We spoke about a new play at the National Theatre. “I knew Richard Burton very well,” she said. “He courted me. He used to come to my house at midnight with roses. I always used to say the same thing: ‘Where did you get a shop open at this time?’ He sat and talked with me. I never went to bed with him. I was attracted to him and I liked his personality when he wasn’t too drunk – too drunk, he was a gangster. He loved a story of mine, The Love Object, and he used to read it aloud to Elizabeth when they were having sex. He told me that. I said I’d rather not know, if you don’t mind.”She spoke about Burton’s old habit of shouting verse into the trees in Wales. She said that the trees we’d seen at Drewsborough House had actually spoken back to her in childhood. I was intrigued and I don’t find such things alarming. “My mind isn’t gone,” she said. “My mind is the same as it was when I was a young girl. I’m crying. I’m sad. But I was sad then.” We burst out laughing.I told her I was directing a play about Truman Capote , alone in a room at the Plaza hotel. “I met him, by the way,” she said. “Truman. He was so drunk. There was a dead, Black poet called Edna and he thought I was her. I was standing in full flesh beside him at a party of Senator Javits’ s in New York.”We then turned to a question she’d raised several times about me writing about her once she was gone. “You have a free hand,” she said. “You could talk about things nobody else could. People have a very mistaken version of me. I’m like a child, a very gifted child … intelligent, but with unmitigated foolishness. I overspent. I have put it in my books and I don’t talk phoney talk like Blanche DuBois, but if they opened my brain and picked out the alphabet of my life – very painful – always been worried, managing, managing, nightmare father, nightmare upbringing, nightmare mother, nightmare husband, getting custody of children … dirt and ugliness you could not muster.”I poured her another glass. Ten years previously, Edna had asked me to record some of her final wishes on to tape. “Make sure it isn’t taken over by neanderthals,” she said. Her voice is strong on the recording, making jokes, making judgments, reaching out to posterity. Later that week, with the question of her afterlife still very much on her mind, she sent me a letter in the post, which I put into a file containing all her letters to me, but this one I never opened. I suppose I couldn’t face the end of our friendship: I believed it would be the final word from her, though of course the letter was not the last one, and it wasn’t the last recording either. But the letter sat unopened in the file.She levelled a powerful look at me and took a sip, saying: I think we can finally say that the great enemy is proseccoClose to her death, she moved into a flat in Belgravia, and I went to see her for the last time with the usual cargo of champagne. She wasn’t really drinking by then, and she lay on the bed, beautiful as ever. “Let’s have a glass,” she said. I opened it and we toasted each other. She levelled a powerful look at me and took a sip. “I think we can finally say, Andrew, that the great enemy is prosecco.”We reminisced about that trip to Ireland. She recalled her time at the water’s edge across from Holy Island, in the midst of all that rain. But it was to Drewsborough House that her mind turned during that last visit. “You would not think there are so many words for ‘hope’,” she said. “I wish I could do more, but I won’t.”I read to her from Keats, her favourite.“O for a beaker full ofthe warm South.”Edna O’Brien: her fearlessness paved the way for today’s female Irish writersRead moreEdna was 93. She spoke of the old house and the trees surrounding it, giving her the setting for The Country Girls, published more than 60 years ago, eight years before I was born. She drifted back to her childhood and told me how she had loved the natural world. She expected to be back in that garden in the next life.The sun was beating down the day we brought her remains over the Shannon to Inis Cealtra, which felt all in all like theLake Isle of Innisfree, that magical world conjured by another of her favourites, WB Yeats. There was a man who understood the ascending power of friendship. “Thank you,” was all I could say to Edna as I dropped two shovels of earth into her grave and turned away. “Think where man’s glory most begins and ends,”wrote the manhimself, “And say my glory was I had such friends.”“The real secret is loving,” Edna had said that last afternoon in Belgravia. “So I would love to meet Chekhov on a train.”“Do you think you will meet people?”“He will be in a higher place. But I hope he won’t be near Putin. Oh God, Andrew, the world has gone mad, do you know that?”After writing the last sentence, I walked through to my filing cabinet and brought out the unopened letter Edna had sent me 10 years ago. I fancied it still smelled a little of the tuberose that swirled about her papers. I took a wooden letter opener that I once believed had belonged to the family of Robert Louis Stevenson. Stamped along the side, it says: “1850. To my Sweetheart.” Edna’s letter was pristine. Neatly folded. Carefully dated, it is written in her characteristic hand, full of her usual curlicues and anxieties, pleading for acts of friendship that I hope will never end.This is an extract from On Friendship by Andrew O’Hagan, published by Faber on 9 October.

I found that the most healing,” she says. Since then, cats have kept coming to visit her garden. Not her cats – it is hard for her to have pets, what with all the touring – but neighbourhood cats, treating the place as if they live there. “I’m not saying anything, but more and more started coming, and foxes,” she says. She sees patterns and prescience in many things, now. “I don’t know. Or maybe I just noticed them more, because that’s what I needed to be around.”In August 2023, Welch had a miscarriage. Days later, she learned that the pregnancy had been ectopic, meaning that the fertilised egg had implanted in a fallopian tube, rather than the uterus. The fallopian tube then ruptured, causing massive internal bleeding. “The closest I came to making life was the closest I came to death,” she says. “And I felt like I had stepped through this door, and it was just full of women, screaming.”View image in fullscreenDress: Rockstar Boudoir. Belt: Rebecca sweeting. Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownWe are in her summer house, at the end of her lush garden in south London, still blooming, late in the season, in tasteful shades of pastels and white. She sits on the sofa, wearing a long, pale-green gown, wrapped in a shawl. She shifts and reclines, stands up and sits back down. The door is open. The air is brisk. There is a pile of blankets in the corner, she says, in case I get cold. We talk for almost two hours about what happened to her, and how the catastrophe of it all became her extraordinary, excoriating new album, Everybody Scream. The record is as strange, uncompromising and brutal as she has ever been. It will be released on Halloween, and no wonder. It is full of witchcraft and fury.Welch has long been such a fixture of the British music scene that it can be easy to understate how massive she is. When the first Florence + the Machine album, Lungs, came out, she was 22. (We are meeting on the day after her 39th birthday.) She had No 1 singles and albums at home, and she conquered the US, topping the Billboard charts with her third record. When Foo Fighters had to pull out of Glastonbury in 2015,she was bumped up the bill to headliner, a feat so rare for a British woman that, since the turn of the century, only Adele, Dua Lipaand Florence have managed it. Her performance that night made it clear that she was already a headline act.View image in fullscreenFlorence + the Machine headlining Glastonbury 2015.Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty ImagesIn 2022, she released a single called King. It was a conversation with herself about whether to have children, or to continue life as a performer. Could the two coexist? It contains the line “I never knew my killer would be coming from within”, and it was the opening track on her fifth album, Dance Fever, which was also partly inspired by a 16th-century phenomenon in whichwomen danced themselves to death. She thought, then, that she had made her horror record. “I really did,” she says, and sighs. “With that naivety … ”At the end of the summer of 2023, Welch cancelled a handful of festival shows, posting a note to Instagram explaining that she’d had to have emergency surgery, that it had saved her life, but that she didn’t feel strong enough to go into the reasons for it, yet. “Suffice to say I wish the songs were less accurate in their predictions,” she wrote, at the time.“Having that line in King was a strange thing,” she says, today, her lip beginning to tremble. “Because I had an ectopic pregnancy, on stage.” She talks through what happened, slowly and steadily. Two years ago, she and her boyfriend – a British guitarist in an indie band, whom she prefers not to name, as she is protective of his privacy, but who she has been with, on and off, since 2011 – decided that they would try to have a baby. “It was my first experience of even trying to get pregnant, and I thought, there’s no way, because I’m ancient,” she laughs. She was about to turn 37. She got pregnant the first time they tried. “It was a big shock. But it felt magical, as well. I felt I had followed a bodily instinct, in that animal sense, and it had happened.”With physical stuff, I have otherworldly strength. Emotionally, I’m an absolute nightmareThe miscarriage occurred early in the pregnancy, so early that they hadn’t yet told anyone about it. “I think, because it was my first time being pregnant, and it was my first miscarriage, I was like, OK, I’ve heard this is part of it. I spoke to my doctor, and they are not generally dangerous. Devastating, but not dangerous,” she says. She was due to headline a festival in Cornwall a week later, and made the decision to continue with the performance. “Emotionally, I was sad and scared, but I think, also, I was coping.” This sense of pushing through is not unfamiliar to her. A few years ago, she broke her foot on stage, bled everywhere, and still finished the gig before seeking help. (She notes, wryly, that the performance got a 4/5 review.) “With physical stuff, I have a strange, otherworldly strength,” she says. “Emotionally, I’m an absolute nightmare. Literally, will crumble,” she laughs. “But broken bone? Fine. Internal bleeding? Let’s go.”Ectopic pregnancies, like the one she didn’t yet know she’d had, are not common; according to the NHS, around 1 in 90 pregnancies can be ectopic. If there are complications they can be dangerous. On the day of the show, she was feeling unwell, looked pale, had started to bleed heavily, and was in a considerable amount of pain. Her doctor told her that, although ectopics were rare, she should get checked, just in case, so she made a plan to go for a scan as soon as she was back at home in London. She put on her white lace dress and got ready to perform. “Women! It’s funny. I took some ibuprofen and stepped out on stage.”There was a storm, and a gale, and there was mud everywhere. “I was in the elements, in the wind and rain, and I just felt something working through me.” The pain disappeared straight away. “And I felt this thing take over, the thing that’s always there, the safe space of performance.” The stage has always been where she feels at her most calm, a place where her chattering brain is finally quiet. “My sister says it might be because everyone’s looking at me. Like, ‘Your most peaceful place is where you’re the fucking centre of attention?’” She laughs. “It’s good, having little sisters.”It was, she says, an amazing show. On the tour bus back to London, the pain returned, but she woke up the next morning at home and felt fine. Still, she knew she had to get checked over. Before the hospital appointment, she went for a walk and got a coffee. She was so sure that it would be OK that her boyfriend didn’t go with her. “Do you know the fucked-up thing?” she says. “I didn’t want to go for the scan. I thought, I’ve done this show, I’m fine, I can cope. But my doctor’s insistence that I come in saved my life.”View image in fullscreenBlouse: Mairead Lewin Vintage. Bralette and boots: Ermanno Scervino. Skirt and belt: Rebecca Sweeting. Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownIt’s funny that she is so anxious, such a hypochondriac, in everyday life, she says. “Because when something bad really is happening to me, I’m like … ” She gets up off the sofa and marches around the room, breezily, as if she doesn’t have a care in the world. “I think I’m going to be fine!”During the scan, the doctor paused. “And I started to panic.” Her fallopian tube had ruptured. “I had a Coke can’s worth of blood in my abdomen,” she says. Her boyfriend came immediately. She was told she would need emergency surgery within the hour; in the end, the surgeons couldn’t save the fallopian tube, and it had to be removed. “I tried to run away,” she says, and begins to cry. But, again, this turns into laughter: she had her legs up in stirrups. “I couldn’t go anywhere!” She lies back, puts her legs into the air, and mimes trying to run away. “Then I was so embarrassed that I was causing a fuss.”That urge to flee sounds primal, I say. “It was animal instinct. Like, run. But there was an [ultrasound wand] inside me and a woman I’d never met before, and I was like, gotta go!” She laughs, and exhales, a long, slow breath out. She had been due to fly to another festival. “If I’d got on that plane, I’d have come off on a stretcher. Or worse.” When she got home from the hospital, she remembers that she howled. “I think the sound that came out of me was like a wounded animal or something,” she says, choking up. “And then, that was that.” She clears her throat. “Ten days later, I was back on stage.”As a child growing up in south London, Welch was anxious and introverted. She found school exhausting, and didn’t want to go. She used her imagination to soothe herself, finding solace in books and fantasy. “I was very interested in the Bible and Greek myths andGoosebumps, anything that could take me out of reality.”Even the Florence + the Machine origin story was an exercise in imagination, at first. In the mid-00s, many of her friends were in bands, and she would go to indie nights in London, claiming to have a band, too. Drunk in the toilets of a nightclub, she belted out Etta James’s Something’s Got a Hold on Me, for the woman who would go on to become her manager. She got booked for her first gig the next week.View image in fullscreenFlorence Welch at the Devonshire Arms in north London, 2005.Photograph: Gregory NolanRecently, Welch’s mother, Evelyn, a professor of renaissance studies and vice-chancellor of Bristol University, dropped round a box full of press clippings from the early days to her daughter. “She collected them all from 2009 to 2010, and then she just stopped,” she laughs. She thinks her mother assumed that she would be in the spotlight for a couple of years, and it would end, and she would move on. Opening the box was a strange experience. “I looked like I was being eaten.” When she first rocketed into the spotlight, people were not sure if she was indie or pop. “So I’d have an indie face, but I’d be in high heels and a minidress, with crazy red hair.”Commercially, Florence + the Machine was a huge success from the beginning, but Welch was pulled into that British cycle of being “lauded and then brought down a peg or two”, as she puts it, particularly in the music press. This was the era of male indie stars in ripped jeans and dirty T-shirts, making as little effort as possible in the pursuit of “authenticity”. “When I was becoming Florence + the Machine, there was a sense that if you are flamboyant, it’s contrivance. Actually expressing your imagination upon yourself and upon your body was inauthentic and attention-seeking, or annoying.” That early backlash was tough. “It made me shrink myself. I was still big on stage and big in my art, but offstage, I made myself smaller.”On stage, it was always a different story. Last year, she appeared alongside Taylor Swift, twice, as one of the special guests on the blockbuster Eras tour, performing Florida!!!, a song they had written together for Swift’s album The Tortured Poets Department. (In true Welch style, her part was inspired by a short story about a woman riding out a storm in a bathtub, haunted by her dead loved ones, holding a chicken and a bottle of red wine.) How do you get involved in something like that, I ask? “We’ve known each other for a while,” she says. “So she just texted.”I am grounded. Or as grounded as a famous person can beView image in fullscreenRobe: Rockstar Boudoir. Slip: Turner Vintage. Corset: Rebecca Sweeting. Boots: Gianvito Rossi.Jewellery: Rebecca Sweeting and Florence’s ownWalking out on to the stage to join Swift was something special. She jumps up off the sofa. “It was amazing,” she says, arms outstretched. “I will say that, yes, I’m someone who wants to hide from the vague humiliations of fame. But I did step out on that stadium stage with her and I was like, this is pretty fucking cool.” She decided that she was going to up her game, stop daydreaming, work harder. “After this, I’m gonna have to make some changes,” she laughs.In fact, mainstream pop had long ago caught up with Welch. Extravagant self-presentation is much more accepted now, if not the norm. She mentions Ethel Cain and Chappell Roan, both of whom have built careers around a persona. “They are allowed to keep their personal boundaries and create this incredible world and character. It’s amazing. But when I was coming up, if you created a world and a character, it was, like, ‘so contrived’. Now, there’s this celebration of people creating imaginative worlds.”View image in fullscreenOn Taylor Swift’s Eras tour last year.Photograph: TAS2024/Getty ImagesShe has a theory. “People really need worlds to disappear into,” she says. Fandoms are communities, and community is being eroded by phones. “So all these communities build up around artists, and I think people really, really crave it at the moment.” Welch says that Instagram is not good for her personality. She finds it too addictive. So she doesn’t post herself, and tries not to keep the app on her phone.Even so, she has a healthy knowledge of what her algorithm tries to feed her. “Like, why have I been looking at … raccoons and bardcore?” What, I ask, is bardcore? “It’s … the medieval Gregorian chant algorithm,” she laughs. She is nothing if not self-aware. She recalls seeing a meme that summed her up. “It said, Florence’s songs are either like, ‘and the mountains came down from the wind’ or ‘this guy hasn’t texted me back and I’m drunk’.” What does it feel like to be memed? She smiles. “When they get it right, they get it right. I can’t deny that that’s what it is.”Welch wishes she could do small talk, but she always gets it wrong. “It kills me. I just go in with something huge, it’s terrible.” Someone will stop her in the street and ask her how she is. “Well, I had to have my fallopian tube taken out the other day … ” she jokes. But she is more dry and funny with it than you might expect. “I am grounded,” she insists, then pauses, aware that her assistant has just placed lunch on the table in front of us. “Or as grounded as a famous person can be.” She looks down at her feet and hoots. “I’ve really got my velvet loafers planted firmly on the ground.”Everybody Scream is the antithesis of small talk. On it, Welch is grappling with a lot. There’s her new song One of the Greats, which she calls her “lunatic, enormous, poem-rant-joke thing”, and offers seething indictment of sexist double standards. In the video, she sits in the back of a limo, at night, in sunglasses and a suit, a rock star waving a cigar (she doesn’t smoke; it’s a liquorice stick). “It must be nice to be a man and make boring music just because you can,” she sings.That’s a cheeky line, I say. “Yeah,” she laughs. “It’s all quite tongue-in-cheek.” That one is about effort, and how much is required of women, as opposed to men. “You [male performers] get to be up there and be hot in a T-shirt, and everyone’s like, it’s amazing!” With women, it’s different. “Your body is the show, the clothes are the show.” Many of her male peers have three children and continue to tour, “because they have a partner with the kids at home. What I’m sacrificing to keep going is more apparent, and bigger, as you get older.” It is understandable that this is at the front of her mind, though once again the song was prescient: she wrote it before the pregnancy. “I will get those things, hopefully. I will get to have a family, but I haven’t had both. Or so far I haven’t, and then when I tried, I was sort of violently rebuffed,” she sighs.I don’t want to assume that it’s all autobiography, I say, but … how much of the lyrics are true? What happens, she says, is that she turns the real into the unreal, in order to cope with it. “I’ve shared parts of my life with [fans] that I haven’t been able to say to my closest friends,” she admits. “Addiction, and eating disorders, and whatever the fuck this one’s about.” After the trauma of the ectopic pregnancy and the emergency surgery, she thought that she wanted to put it all away. “But working again helped me. It was like little lanterns in a fog. I could just pick my way through. And I was so angry! There was a fury at how unsupported I felt by my industry, how clear it was, that it wasn’t built for me.”There’s a feeling of dying a little bit, every time I make a record. And, this time, I nearly diedView image in fullscreenCoat and dress: Florence’s own. Boots: Gianvito Rossi.

In the folk horror-ish video for the album’s first single, also called Everybody Scream, she commands a group of women who possess everyone they meet. On another song, Sympathy Magic, she explores going to a wise woman for a spell, in the same way that one might have gone to a priest for a prayer.She is aware of how all this sounds. “Modern medicine absolutely saved my life,” she says, “but you can’t go anywhere about birth without finding witchcraft and magic and medicine. Some of the first people tried as witches were midwives.” She saw a healer, whom she refers to lightly as “the womb witch”, a woman who helped Welch with her hormones and her natural cycles, who guided her through rituals of grief.For the album, she did her research and holed up in theWarburg Institute, a library in London that specialises in medieval and renaissance studies. Her reference points zigzag from Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Rosemary’s Baby, to medieval mystics such as Julian of Norwich andMargery Kempe.Did she feel changed by her brush with death, by the possibility of having not gone for the scan? We talk about one of the myths of experiencing something traumatic – that you are no longer supposed to sweat the small stuff, that you are supposed to move forward with a compulsion to seize the day. “It hasn’t happened,” she says. “I feel slightly more obsessive and fragile and wounded than I did before. But it has given me a sense of toughness in my work.”On another new song, called Music By Men, Welch makes a plea: “Let me put out a record and not have it ruin my life.” In the past, she and her boyfriend always seemed to break up when she released an album, she explains. “I felt like I couldn’t have both. Or something would happen that would blow up my personal life. So there was a sadness of why did that happen to me? Why do I have this record, if I didn’t get to have a kid?”After an ectopic pregnancy, there is a greater risk of it happening again. IVF might be the safer option, but right now they are waiting and seeing. “Once the record is out, you get this burst of energy that compels you to make something, and either that is a record or maybe this time, it’ll be something else.” In times of stress, Welch goes back to Buffy. She is rewatching it right now. “Seasons six and seven are incredible television,” she says. “I will do my Ted Talk on it.”She often finds the business of being Florence + the Machine exhausting. “There’s a feeling of dying a little bit, every time I make a record,” she says. “And, this time, I nearly died.” With every album, she says, she is trying to get it right. “Did I get it perfect? Is it good enough? Will I be satisfied? Will you be satisfied?” She is still afraid that she won’t be taken seriously, a hangover, perhaps, from those early days in the spotlight. Now that Everybody Scream is about to be released, she is wondering if she will finally be happy. She is still not sure. “It’s the Martha Graham quote,” she says, meaning the late US dancer and choreographer. “It’s the ‘divine dissatisfaction’ that keeps you going.”Everybody Scream by Florence + the Machine is out on 31 October on Polydor RecordsExplore more on these topicsFlorence + the MachineMiscarriagePregnancyHealth & wellbeingWomen (Life and style)Women (Society)featuresShareReuse this content"

New study challenges claims progressive films flop at the box officeFilm data analyst Stephen Follows finds no evidence that ‘woke-adjacent’ cinema is doomed commercially – and claims some genres may benefit from diverse castingAndrew PulverSat 27 Sep 2025 09.05 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 09.07 EDTShare“Go woke, go broke” is a movie catchphrase du jour, loved by rightwing culture warriors, who take aim at mainstream films judged to have adopted progressive values, and therefore are worthy of boycott and complaints. Films as varied as The Marvels, Charlie’s Angels, Ghostbusters (the 2016 reboot) and Pixar’s Elio have been attacked for their perceived commitment to inclusiveness and diversity, and in some cases their box office revenue appears to have been affected as a result.But is it actually the case? Film data analyst Stephen Follows, an adviser to Guinness World Records and author of The Horror Movie Report,has published researchon how audiences actually respond to “woke-adjacent” content in current cinema. First presented at the Zurich film festival on Saturday, Follows’ research suggests that there is no blanket rule for the success or otherwise of progressive-themed mainstream cinema, and adds that for some genres – horror, sports and music films in particular – diverse casting and identity-driven stories can have a substantially positive effect on commercial success.Conversely, however, Follows concludes that big-budget blockbusters face considerable risks if they indulge in “heavy-handed politics”, incurring a backlash if “audiences feel political messaging overrides story or character”. Moreover, weakening well-established characters or narratives – in films such as theJames Bondseries – carries what Follows describes as a “massive financial risk”. He claims: “Rewriting legacy canon or characters is one of the strongest negative signals for commercial performance.”Follows’ main tool for identifying audience reaction to themes and content – applied to around 4m publicly available comments – is textembedding, a machine-learning process that converts text into numerical values, which makes specific terms easier to identify. Follows then compared the strength of comments around individual ideas to profitability estimates to assess commercial impact.After analysing responses to more than 10,000 films, Follows concluded there was no consistent pattern to whether a film’s progressive themes harmed its box office. “Problems … are linked to execution,” he said. “Heavy-handed political messaging, clumsy canon changes, or anachronistic dialogue reduce audience satisfaction and profitability.”View image in fullscreen‘Identity narrative’ … Taron Egerton as Elton John and Richard Madden as John Reid in Rocketman.Photograph: Gavin Bond/Paramount/Kobal/REX/ShutterstockFollows added that “horror audiences, who are younger on average, are more open to reinvention and less resistant to changes”. Citing relatively recent films such as Candyman, the 2018 reboot of Halloween and Evil Dead Rise, he said: “Identity-driven perspectives, diverse casting, and reimagined canon often boost appeal by adding novelty and raising stakes.”In sports and music categories, Follows suggests that a number of films, including Creed III, Rocketman and A Star Is Born, had their commercial performance strengthened by “identity narratives” and “inclusive themes”.The biggest risks, however, are faced by long-running big-budget franchises such as James Bond, which is now being overhauled after beingbought by Amazon MGM, with a new director and screenwriter (Denis Villeneuve and Steven Knight respectively). A search is also under way for a new lead actor after Daniel Craig’s retirement from the role.According to Follows, departing from “core canon” can carry serious financial consequences. “Audiences react poorly when identity-driven changes are seen as imposed rather than motivated by character or story. The risks multiply when several shifts occur at once. A change to Bond’s race, gender, or nationality on its own would already be financially risky, but stacking multiple changes compounds the danger.”He adds: “[It] represents a high-stakes gamble with billions in potential revenue.”Explore more on these topicsFilmRaceLGBTQ+ rightsMarketing & PRFilm industryJames BondnewsShareReuse this content"

In several telling encounters, however, things went quickly south after it became clear many of those fans didn’t have the slightest idea who he was. “What makes you think I’m not in the band?” he would ask them, with increasing frustration. “If you’re in the Cars, then why aren’t you in the videos?” they’d say.‘This country’s gonna fall on its face. There’s nobody coming to save us’: Boston punks Dropkick Murphys take on MagaRead moreEven ardent followers of the Cars could be forgiven for not noticing that he actually was. In the clip for their 1984 smash single Magic, for instance, Robinson, as well as most of the other band members, appear for just 30 seconds, squeezed into a small corner of the screen. In the video for the Cars’ biggest hit, the worldwide smash Drive, Robinson and most of the others, only appear towards the end – as lifeless mannequins. Meanwhile, in the Magic clip the camera dotes on leader Ric Ocasek obsessively, while in Drive, Ocasek gets a whole backstory despite the fact that bassist/vocalist Ben Orr is the guy who actually sings the song.“With the Cars, Ric always had to be the one out front, calling the shots,” said Bill Janovitz, who has written the first authoritative book on the band, aptly titled Let the Stories Be Told. “One reason I wrote the book was so people could understand everything the other guys did to make the Cars the great band that it was.”In the process, Janovitz not only revealed the imbalanced dynamics that mar many major bands, but also the troubling mix of fear and insecurity that defined Ocasek’s darker side. Janovitz did so with the full cooperation of the surviving three members, including guitarist Elliot Easton, keyboardist Greg Hawkes and Robinson who, besides playing drums, also designed much of the band’s visual presentation. Janovitz never had the chance to speak to the two members who have died, one under tragic circumstances, the other under a cloud of bitterness. Orr, the group’s sex symbol and most flexible singer, died of pancreatic cancer at 53 in 2000. Ocasek, who wrote and sang the vast majority of the band’s songs, died in 2019 at 75 from heart-related issues. The latter’s death made tabloid headlines when it came to light that he had cut out of his will some of his children as well as his famous wife, the model Paulina Porizkova. Though the division of funds in Ocasek’s will was actually a bit more nuanced than that, the last-minute changes he made to his estate had a vindictive edge that left a rancid taste in the mouths of some key survivors.In his book, Janovitz worked hard to balance the brilliance of the band’s music with the issues that sparked rancor in their ranks. Easton and Robinson think he achieved that. “There are some rough parts to it,” Easton admitted, “but I think he told a true story.”View image in fullscreenThe Cars at the US festival in 1982.Photograph: Photo by Elaine Hawkes, courtesy of Greg Hawkes“Let’s just say that nobody is painted any worse they actually were,” Robinson said with a laugh.The most positive legacy of the band is the music itself. During their imperial years, between 1978 and 84, the Cars sold nearly 25m albums in the US alone, driven by eight top 20 hits, including top five smashes like Shake It Up and Drive. Their debut single, My Best Friend’s Girl, broke the British top five with a fresh and clever style that presaged what would become a signature electro-pop sound of the 80s. To Janovitz, “it was a sound that seemed both old and new at the same time.”Key parts of the older aspects came from Easton’s guitar. “I added a lot of the rock’n’roll elements,” Easton said. “Every song had a hook, a little solo break and an interesting intro and outro.”At the same time, the Cars’ records drew on the arty drones of the Velvet Underground and the sinister sputter of the art-synth band Suicide. Other parts of the Cars’ music had an incredibly specific influence – namely, the mid-section breakdown in Roxy Music’s debut single from 1971, Virginia Plain. Even so, they updated it with their own quirky hooks and the unique sheen of Roy Thomas Baker’s production. “Roy didn’t mess with the music or add parts to the songs,” Easton said. “He was more into the sonics, which made us sound great in the studio and gave us that massive background vocal sound.”Janovitz provides forensic detail on the construction of those songs, but he’s just as thorough in covering the personal demons the members faced, especially their controlling, self-involved and secretive leader. Many of Ocasek’s issues can be traced to his troubled childhood in Cleveland. His mother was an alcoholic, and his father would beat him. A gawky kid, he was also taunted and often excluded by his peers. “Ric himself often said in interviews that he needed to be in such control because he was bullied not only by his parents but by other kids,” Janovitz said. “In every band he was in, you see him taking control as opposed to letting things happen with the other members.”“A large component of Ric’s personality was insecurity,” Easton said. “It was like he believed someone was trying to take something from him.”Ocasek also had a troubled romantic relationship early on, having married when he was 18 to a high-school girlfriend mainly because she had gotten pregnant. They had two children before Ocasek abandoned them to pursue a career in music. An expert compartmentalizer, Ocasek told few people about his first wife and kids. Even the other band members didn’t know until years later. “Ric would dole out information on a need-to-know basis,” Janovitz said.His ambition to ditch domestic life for stardom ramped up after he met Orr, whose smoldering good looks and sweet voice offered a useful contrast to Ocasek’s awkward appearance and rangier singing. “He knew they could form a great partnership, balancing the dark and the light, the edgy and the smooth,” Janovitz said.In the early 70s, the two moved their nascent band to Boston, drawn by both its large student population and the fact that its music venues had the distinction of encouraging original material from new acts. They formed the Cars in 1976 with members who each had a healthy amount of prior experience in bands as well as distinct musical tastes. “Unlike a lot of bands who met in high school as friends and who all had the same record collection, we were five very different people,” said Easton. “I think that’s a big part of what made the Cars unique.”Not only did they have a notable disparity in their tastes but also in their ages; Ocasek was nine years older than Easton, something the band leader worked hard to hide from the press – for good reason. When the Cars’ debut album came out in 1978, Ocasek was already 34, putting him in the age range of 1960s rockers such as Mick Jagger who were, by then, considered the old guard. That could be a major problem for a group being marketed as part of a new wave. By that point, Ocasek had also begun losing his hair and wore a wig, something he barely mentioned to anyone. To Janovitz, that was part of a cycle of denial. “The lying begets the insecurity, which begets more lies,” he said.View image in fullscreenRic Ocasek, Elliot Easton, Greg Hawkes, Benjamin Orr and David Robinson.Photograph: Ebet Roberts/RedfernsRegardless, the Cars broke big almost immediately, selling over 6m copies of their self-titled debut while earning the title of best new artist in a Rolling Stone readers’ poll over emerging stars as vaunted as Elvis Costello and the Clash. Unfortunately, their success only seemed to fuel Ocasek’s need to claim all the credit. He was abetted by Elliot Roberts, the band’s powerful manager, who treated most of the other members as expendable. “Elliot separated Ric from us,” Robinson said. “If there was important information to be shared, he would only tell Ric.”Roberts’ choice to focus solely on Ocasek enabled the band leader to try to replace Robinson at one point, a move staved off only after the drummer made a pleading case for himself. Over time, Ocasek became just as disillusioned with Easton, whose playing he considered too rooted in the past. His critiques could prove wounding. “It was kind of a ‘hot and cold’ thing,” Easton said. “I thought we were really tight, then something would happen, and he would shine me on.”Roberts put no muscle behind any of the other members’ solo projects, and, in some cases, prevented them from taking outside session projects that would have boosted their personal profile. The result limited their income, as did Ocasek’s reluctance to tour as the years went on, something only he could fully afford to do since he had nearly all the publishing credits and, so, the big royalty checks. The fact Ocasek rarely shared any portion of the credits with the other members frustrated some of them. Though he did write the core of most every song, “the demos he brought to us were extremely skeletal,” Easton said. “What the band brought to them – the different motifs and grooves and hooks – was the meat that hung on those bones.”“Ric brought us a ‘Ric song’,” Robinson said. “But we made it a ‘Cars song’.”Though Ocasek felt closest to Orr, the member he knew the longest, eventually he became jealous of his sex appeal and began to put him down and severely limit his input in the recordings. That exacerbated Orr’s growing alcoholism, which progressed to such an alarming degree that at one point he allegedly threatened to kill himself and his then girlfriend, saying, “This ship’s going down, and I’m taking you with me,” according to Janovitz’s reporting.View image in fullscreenElliot Easton and Ben Orr performing in 1985.Photograph: Ebet RobertsOver time, Ocasek’s personal life became problematic as well. He dumped his second wife, with whom he had two children, nearly as abruptly as he had his first spouse and their kids. He did so to be with Porizkova, who was less than half his age: she was then 19 to his 40. At the time, one of his kids was older than she was. As obsessed as he initially was with her beauty, he grew tired of her, leading to sexual affairs. Porizkova told Janovitz that Ocasek withdrew from her sexually years before his death, but he still wanted her to remain devoted. She remained so, nursing him when he became sick in his later years. Regardless, he accused her of abandoning him – his greatest fear.Even so, Porizkova was surprised when Ocasek left the grand majority of his estate to his two youngest sons, minus 20% for the middle two kids. Not a cent was given to his first two. An earlier version of the will had given all the kids equal amounts, with plenty left over for Porizkova. Though she did inherit the Gramercy Park townhouse they shared, which later sold for $9m, Ocasek’s catalogue was the real prize. After his death, it sold for $45m.Despite the more troubling issues the band faced, Easton said he’s anything but bitter, stressing, too, that he retains great love and respect for their leader. For that reason, he hopes the more difficult parts of the Cars’ story won’t taint their legacy. Certainly it didn’t dampen Janovitz’s respect for them. Still, the author admits that, for all his exhaustive reporting of the Cars’ story, Ocasek remained elusive to him. “I’m sure I didn’t get the whole of him,” Janovitz said. “Ric always wanted to be an enigma. In the end, that’s just what he was.”Let the Stories by Told is out on 30 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsPop and rockMusic booksfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Kaleidoscopic in plot and setting, they move from aristocratic antics in a grand Jacobean house in Hertfordshire to a bedtime tale of two goddesses who arrive in “Tokio”, Japan, on the back of a whale.The mock biography was drafted in 1907, years before Woolf’s first novel appeared in 1915, and the writer – then called Virginia Stephen – did not, at least initially, want them to be seen. Sending a draft to Dickinson, she demanded that her subject and another friend, Nelly, be “the only readers”. To Nelly, she insisted: “dont quote it – see my vanity! And dont show it: I cant remember now how bad it is; but I know it will have to be re-written in six months; and I shant do it”.But in fact shedidreturn to fix the stories, we now know, thanks to a chance discovery of a revised manuscript, hidden away in a stately home for 80 years. Woolf scholar Urmila Seshagiri, a professor at the University of Tennessee, was in search of an unpublished memoir that Dickinson had written about Woolf’s childhood. She asked Longleat House, the Elizabethan home in Wiltshire where a collection of Dickinson’s papers are kept, whether they had it. Their response “bewildered” Seshagiri. Yes, they had the “Memoir of the Stephen Family”, but would she also like to see “Friendships Gallery”, an original Woolf typescript, hand-corrected by the author?Seshagiri knew that the original version of Friendships Gallery, Woolf’s largely ignored trio of short stories about her friend, was in the New York Public Library (NYPL), so she told Longleat they must just have a copy of them. “No no, we have an original document by Virginia Woolf,” they responded. So what was in it? Soon Covid threw a spanner in the works: because of international copyright law, Longleat couldn’t scan the text, or even show it via a video call, so it ended up being a “multi-year mystery”. Finally, in 2022, Seshagiri bagged an invite to the house.The archivist led her into a reading room and handed her a cream-coloured box. She lifted the lid, hands shaking, and opened the volume. There, professionally typed, were revised versions of the NYPL stories, with hundreds of stylistic changes. While seemingly minor, the edits, made in 1908, prove Woolf took the stories more seriously than anyone had realised. “It’s the kind of moment that you never think you’re going to have as a workaday scholar,” says Seshagiri.Next month, Seshagiri’s discoveries will be published by Princeton University Press under a new title, The Life of Violet. The Woolf we know is present in these stories. The “fantastical imagination that produced Orlando” – the 1928 mock biography inspired by Woolf’s friend and lover Vita Sackville-West – is “in full flower already”, says Mark Hussey, author of Mrs Dalloway: A Biography of a Novel. In one passage, a goddess “clapped its jaws as fast as it could like ivory castanets, and the wild Cherry tree shook her blossoms and chimed as though each pink flower was a silver bell”. In another, “her ladyship waved her fan as an elephant its trunk”.In the second story, The Magic Garden, the seed of the phrase “a room of one’s own”, the title of Woolf’s landmark feminist 1929 essay, is unveiled:“Do you know it seems to me – well don’t you think Violet – it would be very nice ---- ”“To have a cottage of one’s own? Yes, my good woman,” cried Violet.Violet’s proclamation is “the beginning of the great revolution which is making England a very different place from what it was”, Woolf goes on to write.Seshagiri sees these previously “invisible” stories as “quite radical”. In the third, set in Japan and inspired by a round-the-world trip taken by Dickinson and Nelly, Woolf imagines an “advanced and radically egalitarian” two-deity society, writes the scholar in an afterword. While Woolf’s cultural ignorance and orientalism are apparent in characters named “chin-chin”, “Rick-Shi” and “Rim-Shi-Ki” – which are, writes Seshagiri, “meant to sound exotic”, she observes a clear throughline between the utopian visions of The Life of Violet and Three Guineas, the author’s 1938 polemic on patriarchy and fascism in which Woolf imagines a collective of women committed to attaining “justice and equality and liberty”.View image in fullscreen‘Unmaking patriarchy’s cultural inheritances’ … Longleat House, Wiltshire, where the revised stories were rediscovered.Photograph: Neil Lang/ShutterstockIn this way, The Life of Violet “shows us a Woolf whomight have been”, suggests Seshagiri. “A fabulist unmaking patriarchy’s cultural inheritances through enchanting, surreal impossibilities rather than philosophy or history.”Given all they tell us about Woolf, how have these stories flown under the radar for so long? In 1955, Dickinson’s family offered the early, unrevised NYPL versions to Leonard Woolf, whom Virginia married in 1912. Leonard, perhaps swayed by Woolf’s initial shyness about the stories, declined to purchase the works, deeming them unworthy of publishing. The stories then wound up in a London junk shop, and were bought for a shilling by Booker prize founder Tom Maschler. He showed them to Francis Wyndham (who would go on to edit VS Naipaul and Jean Rhys), who pointed out what Maschler had failed to realise: the author “Virginia Stephen” was VirginiaWoolf.Leonard was approached again for permission to publish, but maintained that the stories were “a kind of private joke, and not very good” (Woolf’s sister, Vanessa Bell, on the other hand, found them “very witty and brilliant”). They ended up housed in the NYPL, and have since been repeatedly overlooked by scholars and editors of anthologies of Woolf’s short fiction.Woolf’s edits between the 1907 NYPL version and the newly discovered 1908 version affect “the rhythm of the sentences, something Woolf was always very concerned with”, says Hussey. In some cases, she incorporates Dickinson’s handwritten pointers: while Woolf initially wrote that Violet “shrieked” the line about the cottage; the edit to “cried” on her friend’s suggestion adds profundity, says Seshagiri.The scholar’s discovery shows that Woolf did not, as was long assumed, forget about this early work, Hussey says, “but returned to it with a seriousness of purpose, editing and revising it in such detail because she herself took it seriously as an experiment in the development of her own fictional style.”Quotes used with permission of the Society of Authors as the Literary Representative of the Estate of Virginia WoolfExplore more on these topicsBooksVirginia WoolfManuscripts and lettersFictionShort storiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Apart from a couple of festival appearances in 2016, the beloved garage rock band’s last proper headline show was 2010.But earlier this year, smoke signals: a secret set in a Prahran skate shop. A surprise single, Swimming Hole, and a new EP. A one-off at Melbourne’s The Night Cat that instantly sold out.

Suddenly the band are bouncing, people are hugging, Huntley has climbed into the rafters to sing, and I can’t remember smiling so much at a gig. It sounds like some mystical bullshit. It’s not. The mystical bit is how this moment always happens at an Eddy Current show.View image in fullscreenEddy Current Suppression Ring.Photograph: Maira TroncosoFormed in 2003 at the staff party of a vinyl pressing plant in Highett, the members of Eddy Current Suppression Ring grew up in Frankston. So did I. An hour south of Melbourne, Frankston is a rich-poor town built with its back to the sea. On clear days you can see the Melbourne skyline shimmering through the haze across Port Phillip Bay. Close enough to long for, but distant enough to make you question leaving. The subcultures here are staunch, based on the DIY tenets of graffiti, skateboarding, metal bands and mischief. If you get good at any of them, don’t get a big head about it.‘It’s probably fear’: why Eddy Current Suppression Ring ran away from fameRead moreFrom this melting pot Eddy Current emerged, home town codes intact. Record and release your own albums. Book your own shows. Don’t do it if it doesn’t feel right. This attitude was imprinted in their music: garage rock with speak-sing dramas that gently escalate. They famously recorded their 2006 debut LP in four hours. It’s a classic. Small, catchy songs about suburban dreams: cool ice-cream, insufficient funds, going to work. On record it can pass you by, but shoulder-to-shoulder in a crowd it turned cathartic. Noble, even. Eddy Current lit a match and everyone wanted to be near it.By 2010 the band were anxious about the increasing demands of their popularity. The previous year they’d collected the $30,000 Australian Music Prize for their second LP, Primary Colours. In April they played a sold-out show to 1,800 people at the now defunct Palace in Melbourne. I was there – it felt like a victory lap. It’s just the band were far away. “I had to question whether I’d want to go see a band like mine at a show that big,” Mikey Youngtold the Guardianabout it. They went on hiatus soon after.View image in fullscreenMikey Young ‘told a friend he thought only 2,000 might show up. Instead the crowd stretches as far as the eye can see.’Photograph: Maira TroncosoFifteen years after that headline show – one month after seeing them in Frankston – Eddy Current returned to Melbourne on Friday night at Federation Square. The programming team at the outdoor venue have been on a tear here, hosting free gigs for the likes of Kneecap, Caribou and Robbie Williams that have drawn 10,000 people. Mikey told a friend he thought only 2,000 might show up. Instead the crowd stretches as far as the eye can see.They start with Memory Lane. “I took a walk down memory lane, where everything looked quite the same,” sings Huntley, wearing a long coat and those black gloves “People smiled, people waved. They told me ‘bout the road they paved.” It sounds good. You can’t see the band for the bright lights behind them, but they look awesome on the big screen. Now they’re playing Wrapped Up – Huntley’s coat is off and he’s doing his funny nervous dance, eyes clamped tight, concentrating hard about jogging on the spot.The band hits the last chorus and it happens, the huge crowd lifts to join in: “I’m wrapped up in you.” Everyone around is beaming.Huntley climbs up on to a shipping container. Unrelated fireworks go off in the distance. The mystical bullshit. The Melbourne skyline shimmers – not hazy in the distance, but all around.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockMelbournefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But it’s a total delightHannah J DaviesSat 27 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTShareGlen Powellis Hollywood’s man of the moment, a Tom Cruise-in-waiting megastar who only has to breathe near a movie set to guarantee that a project will be a huge hit (see:Twisters,Hit Manand – of course – the extremely Cruise-yTop Gun: Maverick). It may come as a surprise, then, that his latest gig isn’t a blockbuster movie where he gets to share his surfeit of charisma with the world, but a small-screen comedy in which he spends most of the time smothered in latex and sporting a wig that will – for British viewers – almost certainly call to mind Corrie’s Gail Platt.The role in question is the titular character in Chad Powers (Disney+, from Tuesday 30 September), a Forrest Gump-ish southern college American footballer who is both unfailingly good-natured and deeply socially awkward (he’s described by one character as “a sweet, possibly inbred folk hero”). If this sounds like it could be in bad taste, fear not, for Chad Powers is, in fact, the alter ego of disgraced sportsman Russ Holliday, the sort of toxic chump who brags about wearing a blood diamond earring and proudly drives a Tesla Cybertruck. After fumbling a major championship – an “outrageous, improbable, inexplicable, painful loss” according to the commentary that replays numerous times throughout the series – Russ is persona non grata, less popular with the public than Bin Laden, we’re told. Disguised as Chad, there’s a way back, and the possibility of resuscitating his sporting career. Just so long as he keeps his face away from all and any forms of water!The character was the brainchild of ex-footballer and broadcaster Eli Manning, who disguised himself with some frankly terrifying prosthetics for a section on his ESPN series Eli’s Places back in 2022. But if making an entire series based on a TV prank sounds absolutely absurd, it truly works. Powell and co-creator Michael Waldron (Rick and Morty, Loki) have made a show that’s as farcical as it is warm-hearted, with a story as much about sports as it is friendship and navigating the travails of life. In Russ’s case, that means making an unlikely alliance with the South Georgia University Catfish mascot, Whiskers, who – under his big sea creature costume – is actually Danny (Frankie A Rodriguez), a theatre kid with some much-needed makeup skills. Danny’s also unafraid to tell it like it is – not least when Chad is considering plastic surgery in Brazil (“I think you’re having a psychotic break,” he deadpans).Rounding out the starting lineup areSteve Zahnas perma-frazzled Catfish (see what they did there) coach Jake Hudson, with Perry Mattfeld as his daughter and colleague, Ricky, who is desperately trying to fight off nepo baby accusations to forge her own career. Because of the sort of show this is, they get a lot of silly things to do: I have no idea how the actors kept a straight face during a scene where Chad refuses to shower, feigning a medical condition, and Coach Hudson senior has to tell him to “Tape up your peehole!”. But because it’s also a heartfelt show, they get a lot of really touching scenes, too, which – shock horror – feel far less cloying and Hallmark-esque than you might expect. Zahn is particularly plausible as a man trying to save his marriage, while also truly believing that he has “one of the hardest jobs known to man”.This, I think, is Chad Powers’ secret weapon: it really does have a lot of heart, even when it’s totally and utterly ridiculous, which it very frequently is. In a scene where it looks as though a dog has mistaken Chad for a rubber chew toy, I find myself both in fits of laughter and desperately hoping that this isn’t how his true identity will be revealed. Similarly, where else would running out of face glue be both a hilarious plot point and a potentially dramatic twist?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Written after football hooligans desecrated his parents’ gravestones, the expletive-laden work was described as a “torrent of filth” by the Daily Mail when it was broadcast on Channel 4, prompting an early-day motion in the Commons. It is now studied in schools.‘The man who came to read the metre’: Yorkshire poet Tony Harrison was the National Theatre bardRead moreHarrison grew up in a working-class family inLeeds, winning a scholarship to Leeds grammar school and studying classics at the University of Leeds. His poetry explored the tension between his working-class background and the arts, from the teacher who mocks him in Them & [uz] – “You’re one of those / Shakespeare gives the comic bits to: prose!’” – to the resulting separation he felt from his parents due to his education. In the poem Book Ends, he wrote of how he felt unable to talk to his father on the night of his mother’s death: “Back in our silences and sullen looks, / for all the Scotch we drink, what’s still between’s / not the thirty or so years, but books, books, books.”In 1962, his friendship with Nobel laureate and fellow Leeds graduateWole Soyinkacontributed to his moving to Nigeria, where he wrote the play Akin Mata, a version of Aristophanes’ comedy Lysistrata with African music and dance, and published his first poetry pamphlet, Earthworks, in 1964. Returning to Britain in 1967, his first collection The Loiners won him the Geoffrey Faber memorial prize in 1970.His 1973 adaptation of Molière’s The Misanthrope was his big break at the National Theatre. Adaptations of The Oresteia and The Mysteries would follow, as did original productions Phaedra Britannica, Bow Down andThe Trackers of Oxyrhynchus, which was based on fragments of a Sophocles play. But though his career would span theatre, opera, film, television and print, Harrison preferred to be regarded as a poet. “I hate being called poet/dramatist/translator/director. Poet covers it all for me,”he told the Guardian in 2015, after winning the David Cohen prize. “I want to do justice to my inwardness, my tenderness, my political rage.”In 1987, whenRichard Eyre’s film of Vwas broadcast, Harrison became renowned as a public poet, and a fearlessly political one, making headlines again two years later for his film-poem The Blasphemers’ Banquet, which was prompted by the fatwa placed on Salman Rushdie and led to the Archbishop of Canterbury asking the BBC to withdraw it. In his 1999 film-poem Prometheus, the story of the titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humans, Harrison reframed this act as an example of class warfare, with Yorkshire miners facing up to Zeus and Hermes, who are agents of capitalism.In 1995, the Guardian sent him to Bosnia to cover the war. A poem written while travelling in an armoured vehicle outside Sarajevo made the paper’s front page. “Why shouldn’t poetry address what happened yesterday, and be published in the newspaper?” he told the Guardian 20 years later ina 2007 interview. “Yes, I’ve got inwardness and tenderness, but I also get angry and vituperative, and you have to honour that as well.” His 2003 poemIraquatrains, published a month before the “dodgy dossier” scandal became public, urged readers to: “Go round to Downing St, get Tony Blair’s hard disc.”Harrison rejected establishment attempts to bestow accolades on him, calling honours “the nature of British life. It’s horrible.” When named as a possible contender for the poet laureateship in 1999,he made his feelings clear in a poem in the Guardian, titled Laureate’s Block. Harrison wanted, he wrote, to remain “free to write what I think should be written / free to scatter scorn in Number 10 / free to blast and bollock Blairite Britain”. He also took a swipe at the monarchy: “There should be no successor to Ted Hughes... / Nor should Prince Charles succeed our present queen / And spare us some toady’s ode on coronation.”The current laureate,Simon Armitage, however, has spoken of how Harrison blazed a trail. “He has allowed my generation to do our own thing without having to worry too much about where we come from and what accents we’ve got,”said Armitage in 2000. “Trying to write in a way that’s representative of our voices was a pitched battle for him.”Speaking in 2000, Harrison said that he hoped “the people who knew me will talk about me over a bottle of wine after I’ve gone”. “But what I’m proud of is that I can read poems about my parents in Leeds or Bradford, and men especially are suddenly sobbing in the audience. That a short poem has touched them that deeply and brings that kind of response is better than a rave review,” he said, going on to ruminate on his own inspiration.“I always feel, especially in my fallow periods, that I don’t recognise this monster who finishes my work with such intensity. It’s like Rumpelstiltskin coming in and turning all the straw into gold and then going away again. I’ve done poems for the page, the stage, the opera house, television, film and newspapers. It’s all one work. You know, maybe the life is really about dodging about to achieve moments where the work can happen. And often you fuck up your life in order to get that moment. But that’s the way it can be when the muses have your telephone number.”Explore more on these topicsTony HarrisonPoetryTheatreOperaTelevisionLeedsnewsShareReuse this content"

Now the 17th-century master’s hand has been confirmed in a painting that Sotheby’s and the Metropolitan Museum in New York had dismissed as a mere copy.Scientific analysis of The Lute Player, which was bought for Badminton House in Gloucestershire in the 18th century, has concluded that it is by Caravaggio, with a probability of 85.7%.Tests involving artificial intelligence showed a “strong match” with verified paintings. The study was conducted byArt Recognition, a Swiss specialist in authenticating artworks, collaborating on research with Liverpool University among others.Its head, Dr Carina Popovici, told the Guardian: “Everything over 80% is very high.”Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio is considered a revolutionary among artists, revered for his radical use of light and dark – chiaroscuro – and the realism of his compositions.Such is the rarity of his paintings that when one was discoveredin 2019, it was valued at around £96m. But in 1969 Sotheby’s sold the Badminton Lute Player as a copy “after Caravaggio” for £750. In 2001 it sold it as “circle of Caravaggio” for about £71,000.The buyer then was the British art historian and gallerist Clovis Whitfield, a specialist in Italian old masters, who recognised its quality and the fact that it “corresponded exactly” with a description by Giovanni Baglione in his 1642 Caravaggio biography.Whitfield said: “Baglione mentions minutely observed details such as the reflection on dew drops on the flowers.”His Lute Player is one of three versions. An undisputed one is in the Hermitage in Russia, and another – in which the lute player is a woman rather than a young man – is in the Wildenstein collection, having been displayed at the Met between 1990 and 2013.In 1990, Keith Christiansen, the Met’s then head of European paintings, described the Wildenstein version as an original and the Badminton one as a copy.Whitfield made his purchase with Alfred Bader, a collector who died in 2016, to whom Christiansen wrote in 2007: “No one – certainly no modern scholar – has ever or ever would entertain the idea that your painting could be painted by Caravaggio.”Whitfield said Christiansen and some Italian scholars were “a bit stuck in the traditional mud” in refusing to accept the attribution, even though other experts support it. “The AI result knocks Mr Christiansen off his perch,” he said.Art Recognition’s analysis also concluded that the Wildenstein was “not an authentic work”. Popovici said: “Our AI returned a negative result.”Evidence includes the depictions of the lute. David Van Edwards, a leading lute maker and president of the Lute Society, said the Wildenstein instrument had “many faults”, unlike those in the Badminton and Hermitage paintings.View image in fullscreenThe Hermitage (left) and Wildenstein versions of The Lute Player.William Audland KC, a barrister and art lover who is writing a book on The Lute Player, said: “As a barrister and a litigator, I look at all the evidence in any case very forensically. Taking all the evidence into account, it seems to me that a manifest injustice is being done by any scholar who suggests that the Wildenstein version is autograph and the Badminton version is a poor copy.“A holistic view of the relevant evidence points to the opposite conclusion, one which has now been corroborated by AI analysis, which is objective, unlike the subjective opinions of scholars which can get in the way. The Badminton version is an astonishing painting. It takes your breath away when you see it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Shortly afterwards, Caravaggio painted The Lute Player, showing off his talent to his then prospective patron.In the late 1620s, the Del Monte collection was sold. Antonio Barberini, a future cardinal, bought five Caravaggios including The Lute Player, which was bought a century later by the 3rd Duke of Beaufort of Badminton House.Whitfield and Popovici will discuss the painting in a new podcast titledIs It?, the first of a series that launches on 27 September. It is presented by Dr Noah Charney, who is preparing an academic paper on the painting.Geraldine Norman, a leading art market expert, will explore the full story of the painting in a feature documentary that is in development.The Badminton painting is now in London. Whitfield would like it to go to a public collection, just as theNational Galleryhas secured a landmark investment of £375m.In its 2001 sale catalogue, Sotheby’s noted that it “has been reasonably suggested” that the painter may have been Carlo Magnone, who in 1642 was recorded as having painted a copy after Del Monte’s Lute Player.George Gordon, a co-chair of Sotheby’s Worldwide Old Master Paintings, described the “lengthy” catalogue entry as “thoughtful and comprehensive” and noted that many of Caravaggio’s paintings were copied by other artists, even in his lifetime, “as early 17th-century Roman inventories and written sources show”.He said: “I don’t think there have been significant changes in Caravaggio scholarship in recent years which would radically alter the 2001 consensus about this work.”Christiansen declined to comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Wouldn’t it be nice not to have to think about potential traffic snarl-ups en route or missing connections? Just jump on a direct train and arrive fresh.That’s what these brilliantly accessible boltholes in the UK deliver – they’re all within easy reach of a train station and with everything you might need for a stress-free break on the doorstep.A wild swimming cabinin EssexFfion Francis and Ollie Speck quit their jobs in London to renovate a 15th-century former hunting lodge near the village of Thorpe-Le-Soken in north-east Essex. Alongside bringing the house back to life, the couple have built two cabins. The latest addition,The Lakeside Lodge, sits on the edge of a natural swimming pond surrounded by reeds and trees. From London, it’s a direct train (under 90 minutes) from Liverpool Street or Stratford, then a 20-minute walk down a quiet country lane.The aim is to rest and reset, and there’s a host of pros to help: yoga and breathwork teachers, sound healing, reiki and reflexology (from £55). Simpler still is a cold plunge in the pond, followed by a session in the sauna pod, or a warm soak in the hut’s outdoor cast-iron bath. An English breakfast hamper with bacon and sausages from the local butcher and eggs from their rescue hens can be dropped off (£25 for two), and on chilly evenings snuggle down in bed to watch classic films on the projector.Sleeps 2 (and a dog for an extra £20) from £210 a night,coolstays.comAn arty seaside hideoutin CornwallView image in fullscreenMousehole is three miles south of Penzance, near the tip of Cornwall.Photograph: Simon Maycock/AlamyWith sweeping views out to St Michael’s Mount, it’s hard to believe that the (now) beautifully decorated, glass-frontedLittle Pembrokewas once a rundown garage. The cabin’s mezzanine bedroom is the spot to hole up and take in the seascape these days – there’s even an easel and art supplies, should inspiration strike (the big house, Pembroke Lodge, was home in the 1800s to Walter Langley, pioneer of the Newlyn art school).Alighting in Penzance from theNight Riviera Sleeperfrom London to a morning blast of sea air is the loveliest way to arrive, even better followed by a dip in theJubilee Pool(seasonal opening, check website), but the station is also served by direct trains from Cardiff, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds and even Edinburgh. It’s a 10-minute taxi to Little Pembroke, or there’s a bus that stops just down the road.The cabin is tucked peacefully between Newlyn and Mousehole, and there’s gallery hopping and coastal walks to be had. Pick up a Beryl (the Cornish equivalent of a Lime bike) around Newlyn or Penzance to whizz off further afield. A welcome hamper includes Trink milk, local butter, sourdough bread (breakfast sorted) and it’s only a short stroll to Sunday lunch by the fire at historic maritime pubThe Tolcarne Inn, orMackerel Skyfor lemon sole katsu and crab nachos.Sleeps 2 (plus a baby and/or dog) from £230a night,littlepembroke.comSand and castles in NorthumberlandView image in fullscreenThe seaside village of Alnmouth, Northumberland.Photograph: by Marc Guitard/Getty ImagesAnyone who has travelled on the East Coast Main Line will have glimpsed Northumberland’s spectacular coastline when the train curves towards the North Sea, giving those on the east side of the carriages a front-row seat. But rather than speeding on through, hop off at the village of Alnmouth (3½ to four hours from London, one from Edinburgh, two from Leeds) with its pastel houses and seabirds wading in the Aln estuary.Overlooking the golf course to the sandy beach, two-bedroomMarine House Cottageis only a five-minute taxi from the station (or a mile’s walk; swing by Scott’s deli for supplies). Outside there’s a raised terrace that looks out to sea, while the window seat in the main bedroom is the spot for wave-watching and book-reading.Bikes (standard or e-bikes) can be delivered to the house, and from there the traffic-freeAln Valley cyclewayruns over to Alnwick (kids will love the Harry Potter-inspired broomstick training sessions at the castle) or pedal south to Warkworth Castle on theCoast and Castlesroute.

Inside, the mezzanine bed has a duvet made from plastic bottles, and the sleek, all-Scottish design includes Amy Britton tweeds, SkyeSkyns sheepskins and organic Siabann body products.The biologist-run estate has a 10-year plan to protect and enhance biodiversity, which visitors can learn about on a history and wildlife tour (£40pp). There’s oodles to do: cycling on gravel tracks, outdoor yoga sessions (from £65pp), walks through neighbouring Devilla Forest (look out for red squirrels) or through birch trees to a picnic set up in the woods (from £65 for two).

Oxenholme, on the West Coast Main Line, is less than three hours from London, under two from Glasgow and just over an hour from Manchester, with plentiful local rail and bus routes from there. It’s 20 minutes by train from Oxenholme to Windermere, and just a two-minute walk toThe Penn, a new room-only (no reception, no restaurant) hotel concept in a 19th-century stone house in the heart of the town.Check-in by keypad keeps prices down; the smallest doubles are snug, but roomier ones with rolltop baths are only around £30 a night more. From cosy crashpads to a suite with an extra bed for a child, each is done out in earthy colours with jazzily tiled bathrooms.

Make the most of it with these delicious recipesTim DowlingSat 27 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Sat 27 Sep 2025 16.01 EDTShareMonths of hot weather have produced a record-breaking year for apples in the UK, with the harvest coming in bigger and earlier than ever. That means it’s also going to bea record-breaking year for cider.According to the National Association of Cider Makers, the warm summer has also delivered apples“full of rich flavours and natural sweetness, perfect for cider making”. In orchards across the UK, boughs are breaking under the weight of the ripening fruit. Thatchers Cider has begun its earliest apple harvest in the company’s 121-year history. At Sandford Orchards near Exeter, they’re installing extra tanks to keep up with production.How will we cope with all the extra cider coming our way? The good news is we have time – the main cider apple crop isn’t harvested until October or even November. But if you want to make a head start, here are 17 choice recipes to help you use up your personal cider quota for the year.View image in fullscreenThe long cook … Thomasina Miers’s braised pork shoulder with cider and fennel seeds.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianAs a culinary ingredient, cider is particularly known for its affinity with pork, as demonstrated inThomasina Miers’s braised pork shoulder with cider and fennel seeds, in which the pork is left to braise in cider for three and a half to five hours; or inNigel Slater’s pork chops, cider and parsnips, which only takes about 40 minutes on the hob.View image in fullscreenSpeedy feast … Nigel Slater’s pork, cider and parsnips.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverYou can also, of course,simmer a whole gammon joint in cideralong with a few spices. Expect to use at least a litre of cider to cover the ham. In leaner times that might seem wasteful, but remember: we’re trying to get on top of a glut.Delia Smith’s bangers braised in cideradds a complimentary garnish of sliced and fried apples to the mix, whileYotam Ottolenghi’s chorizo, cider and chickpea stewis a Spanish take on the same idea – Spain has its own tradition of using cider, orsidra, in cooking.View image in fullscreenIn the Spanish tradition … Yotam Ottolenghi’s chorizo, cider and chickpea stew withajillo.Photograph: Louise Hagger/The GuardianBut cider is also versatile enough to do its work on other meats. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall puts it, “using cider in cooking is a bit like using fruit and wine and perhaps a little vinegar and a pinch of sugar, all at the same time”. Hislamb stew with ciderdeploys it where another recipe might call for stock. It serves a similar purpose inchicken Normandy, and inSlater’s chicken thighs with mushrooms and cider.View image in fullscreenStock alternative … Nigel Slater’s chicken thighs with mushrooms and cider.Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/The ObserverCider has a place in cooking seafood, too, most famously with mussels, where it’s used as a steaming liquid; a serviceable – and maybe, at this time of year, preferable – substitute for white wine.Angela Hartnett’s mussels with cider and pancettais an object lesson in keeping things simple.Cider and salt-grilled salmon, a winning Guardian reader’s recipe from 2015, uses cider as a marinade for the fish.View image in fullscreenKeeping it simple … Angela Hartnett’s mussels with cider and pancetta.Photograph: Sarah Lee/The GuardianAn onion soup made with cider instead of wine gives that French classic a distinctly British twist.Tom Kerridge’s versionis topped with cheese-and-apple toasts made with cheddar and a ripe granny smith cut into matchsticks.Dan Lepard’s rye loafrelies on a yeast, flour and cider mixture left to develop in the fridge overnight.While it’s less common to turn to cider as an ingredient in cakes and desserts, it’s not unheard of.Nigella Lawson’s cider and five-spice bundt cakeis one example, combining ginger, black treacle, cinnamon, Chinese five-spice and cider, baked in a fluted, doughnut-shaped bundt tin. Thiscider and pumpkin cakeuses two bundt cakes joined base-to-base, to recreate the shape of a pumpkin. The recipe tells you to bake the two cakes one after the other, presumably on the supposition that nobody has two bundt tins.Cider sorbet with cheddar and mintmay sound like a slightly challenging collection of flavours, but the cheddar here is a stick of cheese deployed as a garnish – the same way you would a flake in a 99 – and is therefore wholly optional.View image in fullscreenMull it over … cider gets hot and spicy.Photograph: Ray Kachatorian/Getty ImagesFinally, a classicmulled cider from Jamie Oliver. And just in case you think it’s still too early in the autumn to start mulling things, here’s another recipe for a cocktail calledcider gingerade, made from gin, ginger syrup, dry cider and lime juice. It can’t ever be too early for one of those.Explore more on these topicsCiderFoodFruitBritish food and drinkFood & drink industryMeatCocktailsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Most supermarket coffee disappoints: often stale and over-roasted, and with unpleasant notes of rubber and burnt ash. That said, as someone who prefers a lighter roast coffee (that is, bright, fruity and acidic), I was pleasantly surprised by some of the brands I found among all the dark-roasted offerings that dominate our supermarket shelves.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.I focused on fresh coffee that’s sold ready-ground for general use in cafetières, filters ormoka pots(depending on the grind size, some leaned better towards one method than another, which I’ve noted where necessary). Ideally, however, coffee should be freshly ground for purpose, with a fine, sandy grind for moka pots, and a coarse, gritty one for filters and cafetières. I judged each coffee on flavour, provenance, sustainability and value, while bearing in mind that its quality depends on every stage of the production process, from growing and selection to fermentation, drying, roasting and storage. Coffee also carries a huge social and environmental weight, which makes certifications such as Fairtrade and organic, as well as independent social and ecological initiatives, so important.The best coffee machines for your home: your morning brew made easy, according to our expertRead moreThe results were mixed. Some coffees were predictably dreadful, but others were surprisingly good value. One key finding stood out, however: the most expensive supermarket products rarely justify their price.Coffee is something of an art, so I brought in a professional to help guide my tasting. Will Whiting, founder ofCalm Coffee Roasteryin Peckham, south London, welcomed me to his space where two tables were carefully laid out for a cupping session (cupping is the global standard for assessing coffee quality). We measured 12g of each sample into individual bowls, noted the dry aromas, then filled the bowls to the brim with hot water. After four minutes, we broke the crust of grounds with spoons, and inhaled the aroma as the gases released. We then skimmed off any remaining grounds and let the brews rest and sit for 10 minutes before tasting from spoons, which spread the coffee instantly across the tongue, revealing its flavour in a burst. We then took notes on the acidity, body and nuanced flavour.What did we discover? The bottom-shelf coffees are as bad as we’d expected: harsh, bitter and good for nothing more than a morning caffeine kick. But there were surprises, too. Perhaps the biggest lesson was that the most expensive supermarket coffees – often priced on a par with coffee from top micro-roasteries – just don’t deliver. If you want truly exceptional coffee, skip the supermarket’s so-called premium bags and order online from independent roasters who provide small-batch beans of good provenance, named varietals traceable to individual farms and, crucially, clear roasting dates, which helps ensure a coffee’s freshness.The best supermarket coffeeBest all-rounder:Blue Turaco ground coffee 100% specialty Ugandan robustaView image in fullscreen£6.25 for 227g at Waitrose (£2.75/100g)£8.99 for 227g at Amazon (£3.96/100g)★★★★☆This farmer-owned lighter roast surprises the palate with malty, caramel notes, smooth body and a bright hazelnut finish.
