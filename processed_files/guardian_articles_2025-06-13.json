Guys, no one is safe!Fri 13 Jun 2025 07.31 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 13.34 EDTShareDid you see Elon Muskapologise for some tweetsthis week? (Please don’t be naff and call them “X posts”.) Like me, you will be so embarrassed for Earth’s primo edgelord that he feels pressed into doing something so excruciatingly conventional. This is worse than when Kate Moss wasscapegoated into rehab.Imagine owning the world’s premier shitposting platform – in fact, havingspent $44bn(£32bn) on it, specifically so that your magic mirror would tell you each day that you were the fairest shitposter of all – and then shuffling sheepishly on to your own pixels to mumble something about having gone “too far” with your hurty words. Buck up, sadsack – honestly.We’ll come in a minute to how this hilariously preposterous spectacle should surely mark the absurdist endpoint of humankind’s intensely brief, intensely passionate, and intensely destructive relationship with social media. But first, a recap. Elon’s apology, of course, related to last week’sspectacular online beefthat he’d started with US president Donald Trump over the latter’s OBBB. (Sounds like a specialist Pornhub search term; actually stands for One Big Beautiful Bill.) Amusingly, the two men were not able to directly confront each other, each feeling that they could only engage on their own platforms – X in Musk’s case, Truth Social in Trump’s. Going forward, we surely need some proxy platforms these two superpowers can fight on, like the proxy war countries of the cold war. Maybe Threads and Bluesky could play the role of Vietnam and Nicaragua?So long, Elon: the cuts didn’t go to plan, but you completely shredded your reputation | Marina HydeRead moreAfter all, I’m sure these two will do battle – covert or otherwise – once more. The path to war had been set the second they became buddies, despite the Maga crowd’s comic refusal to see the inevitable. It was only a few months ago that Fox News bobblehead Sean Hannity did afawning joint chat with the pair, telling them and his viewers: “I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here.” Yep. Caned and unstAbel. (Completely unrelated, but in 2019,polling foundthat 13% of Americans still believe that men are “better suited emotionally for politics than most women”. Could the poll be rerun in light of new information?) And it was only a few months earlier that Musk wasexplaining to a rally crowd: “I’m not just Maga, I’m dark gothic Maga.” Mm-hm.Anyway, in this battle, Elon ended up getting resoundingly beaten by the final boss of posting. As we know from the fact that Musk turned up to his first day at Twittercarrying a sinkand honking “let that sink in”, this is a guy who just loves a crashingly literal joke. So it’s a shame the president was too busy playing golf to turn up at Elon’s Texas babymother compound with some latex buttocks, an elated wink to camera, and the words: “I handed him his ass!” Maybe next time.This week was all about the apology, which should be a defining moment in man’s – and woman’s – understanding of precisely the pitfalls of being extremely online. It’s extraordinary to think that social media didn’t meaningfully exist 20 years ago, but has – in that very short span – now hurtled toward the spectacle of the world’s richest man functioning as a warning about what can happen to anyone if they spend way too much time on it. The man who literally owns X has been hoist by his own platform. Guys, no one is safe! How much more wake-up do we want our calls to be?For a long while back there, it was fashionable to refer to the particular disorder engendered by excessive Twitter use as brainworms.Elon Muskis surely riddled with them. Intriguingly, despite essentially running the free world from the platform during his first term in office, Trump himself has remained weirdly resistant to the brainworms. If anything, his particular arrangement reminds one of that old Private Eye headline when Rupert Murdoch had some prostate bother a few decades ago: “Cancer has Murdoch”. And so with Trump and the brainworms. Brainworms have Trump. Maybe Trump IS the brainworms?Sadly for Musk, he didn’t have the same mysteriously resistant gene. He loved Twitter so much he bought the company – for a price that was the sort of joke someone might make on Twitter – and it actually seemed to get him what he wanted for a time: a president who was buddies with him, a more-than-fair wind for all his government contracts, and every one of his posts liked by bazillions of followers who absolutely weren’t mostly bots. It might have lost money in and of itself, but seemed like a super-successful and lucrative political project when considered in the round, given his other business interests.But this is what spending too much time on social media does to you! It makes you feel like you’re being productive, and important, and “not complicit” in whatever you’ve just farted out a couple of hundred characters on. But – and spoiler alert for anyone still unaware of the import of watching Musk deliver his equivalent of the Notes app apology meme –this is all an illusion. Spending lots of time and energy on social media platforms simply means you work for the guys who own them. For free.Whether this week’s cautionary tale starring one of those very guys will shake humanity out of its potentially fatal attention spiral is, regrettably, doubtful in the extreme. But after watching Musk act like someone tearfully trying to de-cancel themself, no one can say the message of the spectacle was anything less than sledgehammer: delete your account, sir.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationSocial mediaUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

There is a feeling of global disorder and growing chaos. The threat of war edges ever closer. Some people are even predicting revolution in the UK. Two weeks ago,Dominic Cummingsgave an interview to Sky News prophesying violent uprising, then wrote on his blog that there is “Whitehall terror of widespread white-English mobs turning political … Parts of the system increasingly fear this could spin out of control into their worst nightmare.”I think something much deeper is going on beneath the surface of Britain today. Two years ago, a historian called Christopher Clark wrote a book that makes you look at your own time in a completely different way. Called Revolutionary Spring, it tells the story of the unrest that swept Europe in 1848. In a few weeks, uprisings spread like ferocious brushfire – from Paris to Berlin to Vienna, Prague and Milan. Thousands of demonstrators stormed national assemblies and kings fled their countries, caught up in a wave of violent upheaval never seen before. Clark’s book inspired me to make Shifty, my new series of films, because the world he describes feels so similar to today. One in which “the political horizon was dark. Neither nations nor governments knew where they were going.“Everyone had surrendered to doubt and anxiety. All forms of belief were enfeebled, all forms of authority shaken, social bonds had reached breaking point. The political horizon was dark. Neither nations nor governments knew where they were going. There was a sense of being ‘on the eve of bloody wars and internal strife’.”View image in fullscreen‘Power was shifting.’Photograph: Adam CurtisAll the revolutions failed in their original aim. But out of them came the bourgeois class that was going to run society in the future. Fascinatingly, Clark showed how from that came all the ways of ordering the world that we today accept as eternal – not just the political structures of left and right but fundamental ideas of our time, like social class. But he is clear that they may be temporary. “They belonged to the world that had not yet encountered the great disciplining identities of modern politics. We belong to one in which those identities are swiftly dissolving.”I wanted to make a series set in Britain over the past 45 years that shows how all our political certainties dissolved. It is built of hundreds of moments that try to evoke what it has felt like to live through this age. The mood is that strange twilight zone between history and memory; fragments that have not yet been fixed into a formal version of the past. From intersex dogs and fat-shaming ventriloquists to avant-garde hair. Leeks by moonlight. Ken Dodd’s suitcase. Nuns playing ping pong. Margaret Thatcher’s handbag. A scanner from Maplin. Netto. And dark moments – racist attacks, suspicion of others and modern paranoia about conspiracies in Britain’s past.Above all, I wanted to trace the rise of the thing that has destroyed the confidence of our age: distrust – not just of those in power, and of “truth”, but of everything and everyone around us and, ultimately, of ourselves.How everyone became badView image in fullscreen‘An extraordinary collapse in trust in politicians.’Photograph: Adam CurtisIt didn’t start like that. Thatcher believed that if you liberated people from state control they would become better and more confident. But to do this, she turned to radical rightwing economic thinkers – some of whom were very odd. About 15 years ago, I went to see a US economist called James Buchanan. I had to drive for hours deep into the mountains of Virginia to his farm. He told me that you couldn’t trust anyone in any position of power. Everyone, he insisted, is driven by self-interest.We sat in a darkened room, with a thunderstorm raging outside, as he told me firmly that human beings didn’t just follow their own self-interest when they were buying and selling stuff; they were driven by it all the time. So when people in power talked of being motivated by “public duty”, they were lying.He called this “public choice theory”, and it had an enormous effect on the advisers around Thatcher. It explained to them why all the bureaucrats that ran Britain were so useless. The economists invented a system called New Public Management (NPM) to control them. NPM said it was dangerous to leave people to motivate themselves through fuzzy notions such as “doing good”. Instead, you created systems that monitored everyone through targets and incentives. Constantly watching and rewarding or punishing. It was the birth of modern HR. Anyone who has ever dealt with HR and their monitoring systems knows instinctively that they don’t trust you. There is a very good moment that was captured on adocumentary about London Zoo in 1993made by Molly Dineen. The zoo had brought in a new HR expert who explains to the mild-mannered zookeepers how incentives and targets work. “Once you do that,” he says, “you’ve got them in the Grinder.”View image in fullscreenAn elephant at a celebration.Photograph: Adam CurtisThat’s Buchanan’s theories at work. And it was a terrible virus that was going to spread.But the roots of distrust didn’t just come from the right. The patrician liberals in Britain were completely shocked that large sections of the working class voted for Thatcher. They had always drawn their influenceand prestige from the idea that they cared for the “little people” and the “less well-off”. Now they turned on them in fury. I found a clip of the novelist Martin Amis promoting his book Money. Dripping with disdain, he says the working class have been seduced by the vulgar allure of money. They are, he said, stupid.It was at that moment the influence of liberal intellectuals began to slip. Power was shifting.17 years a Russian spyView image in fullscreenA police officer at a riot.Photograph: Adam CurtisThere was one institution Thatcher still trusted, though: the security services. Even that crumbled with the case ofGeoffrey Primewho worked at GCHQ. It started when Prime’s wife came home to find him being questioned about the assault of a local girl. After the police left, he told her that he was the man they were looking for. She asked him if there was anything else she should know. He said yes: he’d also been spying for the Russians for the past 17 years.Thatcher was stunned. MI5 had vetted Prime five times and hadn’t noticed anything. Even the Russians knew he was a paedophile. It became clear MI5 was hopeless. And when it failed to prevent the siege of the Libyan embassy in 1984, she ordered the home secretary, Leon Brittan, to reform it. MI5 fought back – spreading rumours through journalists that Brittan was a predatory paedophile, part of a secret ring of paedophile MPs in Westminster. Thirty years later, those rumours would burst to the surface as part of Operation Midland. None of it was true.By the end of the 80s the belief that you couldn’t trust anyone in public life, which Buchanan started, finally came round to the politicians themselves. It was basic logic. If you believed public duty was a fiction, and all public servants were lying when they spoke of public duty, weren’t the politicians also public servants? Which meant they must also be lying when they proclaimed they were working for the public good.To the MaxView image in fullscreen‘It is impossible to have coherent dreams of the future.’Photograph: Adam CurtisOne of the key figures in this process was the infamous publicistMax Clifford. He had picked up on the groundswell of distrust and found a way to monetise it. Clifford specialised in putting two or three of his clients together and cooking up stories from which they all benefited.He started in the late 80s with a famous radical leftwinger called Derek Hatton. He took him to a nightclub – which Clifford also represented. He photographed Hatton next to an heiress of the Baring bank family – whom he also represented – and cooked up a passionate romance between them. Then he turned to the Tories. When a government minister called David Mellor was revealed to be having an affair, his mistress – Antonia de Sancha – came to Clifford. He took her to meet the press in restaurants he represented, then told them stories about Mellor making love in a Chelsea shirt while toe-sucking and spanking.

In the early 90s, MP after MP was revealed to be a sleazy hypocrite who seemed far more concerned with his own weird sex life than governing the country and serving the people. The one I love is the story of David Ashby MP. He sued the Sunday Times in 1995 when they accused him of being a homosexual. He admitted he hadshared a bedwith another man, but said it was purely to save money on holiday. He admitted that his wife did call him “Queenie” and “Poofter”, but said that was only because she was lonely in the marriage. He had bought her a dog to make her feel better. But it didn’t work. Ashby told the court she threw plates and kitchen knives at him. She threatened to “kick him in the bollocks to stop him having sex with anyone”, and broke his glasses. Ashby lost the case, which put paid to his career. Soon, he was deselected by his local Tories as their parliamentary candidate. He later said of his ex-colleagues, on live radio: “They’re a bunch of shits, aren’t they, and we know they are.”The early 90s saw an extraordinary collapse in trust in politicians. Created not just by Clifford, but also by Mohamed Al-Fayed, who said that heregularly paid MPswithcash in brown paper envelopesto ask questions for him in the Commons. It seemed to prove everything Buchanan had been saying: you couldn’t trust anyone in public service.After I interviewed Buchanan in the Virginia mountains, I asked him about his life. He told me about how when he was training as an officer in the US Navy, he was constantly patronised by pompous officers from posh Ivy League universities. He was still angry about it – he knew they were all phoneys, he said, you could feel it. As I drove back I wondered if that was his real motivation. Dressed up in academic language, but beneath it was simply revenge. He was going to destroy that smug patrician class. And he succeeded. Big time.View image in fullscreenAvant-garde hair.Photograph: Adam CurtisBy the second half of the 90s, even the politicians came to believe they were bad. And they did the most extraordinary thing: they gave away power. They did it partly because they knew they couldn’t fight against the rising tide of public doubt. But they were also persuaded by another force they felt they could no longer fight against: the markets. The first to go was Bill Clinton. His secretary of the treasury, Robert Rubin, persuaded him to pull back from public spending. Instead, he should cut the deficit and allow the markets to create a financial boom. Clinton agreed – and the US boomed throughout the 90s. But it also led directly to the global crash of 2008.And behind the markets was a whole academic industry that had taken Buchanan’s ideas and run with them. They wrote articles that bluntly said the role of politicians in society should be marginalised because so much of what they did was “sub-optimal”. Journalists picked up these ideas and put them in simpler terms. Fareed Zakaria, editor of Newsweek Internationalwrote: “What we need in politics today is not more democracy – but less”.Things can only get worse?View image in fullscreen‘We are not trusted!’ Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.Photograph: Adam CurtisIn the face of this undermining of politics, New Labour also gave in. The day after their victory in 1997, the new chancellor, Gordon Brown, dramatically announced that he wasgiving power overthe setting of interest rates to the Bank of England. It was an extraordinary move. Labour MPs were aghast. Bryan Gould, once a candidate for the party’s leadership, exclaimed: “What then is the role of the chancellor? Or more simply, what is the role of democracy?”Brown later admitted the truth: that it was because politicians were now seen as dangerous. We did it, he said, “not for any fundamental economic reasons”, but because we weren’t trusted. Born out of a weird self-hate, that single act was largely responsible for the present powerlessness of politicians. It was also helped on by a new phenomenon – because liberal culture too caught the disease.The Thick of Itwas a comedy series based around a government minister and their advisers. They live in a constant state of self-interested hysteria. Reacting to events and having no control over the real world outside. It was seen as liberal satire – but it can also be seen as a very powerful expression of Buchanan’s idea that all politicians are completely venal, driven only by dark emotions.Rise of the panto villainsView image in fullscreenAn over-the-top baddy – who isn’t Boris Johnson.Photograph: Adam CurtisBut that wasn’t the end of it. Because a new kind of politician rose up, bred in the swamp of distrust. They saw that playing bad in an over-the-top way would give you a great deal of power. Because in a world of disenchantment, where no one believed that politicians could be good, being bad meant you must be authentic. I give you Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump: pantomime villains who are locked together with us in a feedback loop of shock-outrage-badness repeating endlessly.Outside this theatre, really bad people do really bad things – but we are distracted by the pantomime. Meanwhile, the classes that once made up society fractured. The liberals turned on those who voted for Brexit, using with one voice the word Amis had spat out 30 years before: “stupid”.It may be that Britain – and much of Europe – is in a similar moment to that described by Clark just before 1848: on the edge of a new kind of society we don’t yet have the language to describe. It feels frightening because without that language it is impossible to have coherent dreams of the future. To build a better world, you need an idea of what should change and how.And one of the things preventing that may be our obsession with constantly replaying the past. In the present age, the fog of experience has been thickened by the mass of recorded data that allows the recent past to be endlessly replayed, refusing to fade away. A constant loop of nostalgia – music, images, films and dreams from the past. It is another block to the future. And it is also the way this series is made.

TheMexicoCity restaurant where they work looks like most restaurant kitchens but it lacks one key element: there is no bin.Baldío was co-founded by brothers Lucio and Pablo Usobiaga and chef Doug McMaster, best known for his groundbreaking zero-waste spot Silo London. “In my eyes, bins are coffins for things that have been badly designed,” says McMaster. “If there was a trophy for negligence, it would be bin-shaped.”The food, which recently earned a Michelin green star, is creative but still quintessentially Mexican: squash tostada with guaca-broccoli, maguey flower, maguey worm, chinampa flower, or grassfed pork from Veracruz with tamarind mole, served with chinampa greens and house-made kimchi. Significant planning is needed from sourcing to preparation, and the founders are also behind Arca Tierra, a regenerative agriculture project that includes a network of 50 farmers in central Mexico as well as the organisation’s own farm in the pre-Aztec canal system at Xochimilco, an ancient neighbourhood in the south of Mexico City.“Restaurants can have a big environmental impact but they also have a big reach,” says Lucio Usobiaga. “We want Baldío to be a model that shows it’s possible to be both zero waste and to rely on farmers rather than supermarkets.”Although the food is finished off in the restaurant’s open kitchen, most preparation happens at La Baldega, a workshop where the team operates a fermentation programme that helps preserve ingredients as well as upcycle byproducts such as peel and gristle. This includes pre-Hispanic Mexican drinks such as tepache and pulque, as well as koji fermentation – popular in Japan and China for thousands of years – to transform fish guts into sauce.View image in fullscreenFermentation of leftover limes, lemons and tangerine peels.Photograph: Bénédicte DesrusGlobally, one-fifth of food is lost or wasted, according to the UN, equivalent to 1bn meals a day, at a time when one in every nine people is malnourished. When food decomposes in landfill it releases methane, which has 25-times higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide.Silo, when it opened in 2014, became the first restaurant in the world not to have a bin, raising the bar on what zero waste means. Less than 1% of food is composted and no single-use materials are used. A dedicated pottery transforms glass into porcelain that is used for tableware, light fixtures and tiles.Baldío is part of a new wave of restaurants that are moving beyond vague claims of sustainability to embrace a regenerative ethos. In Lisbon,SEM, from the Silo alumni Lara Santo and George McLeod, serves invasive freshwater fish such as the zander, which was introduced to Portugal in the 1980s for sport.Flores, a family-run restaurant in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, dries offal in koji before shaving it over meat dishes. Helsinki’sNolla(meaning “zero” in Finnish) gives compost to its suppliers and guests – a doggy bag with a difference.Baldío goes one step further through its symbiotic relationship with Xochimilco, the last remnant of the network of blue-green waterways that dazzled Spanish invaders when they arrived 500 years ago. The Unesco heritage site is a key stopover for migratory birds and the only place where axolotls still live in the wild.View image in fullscreenDiners at Baldío.Photograph: Bénédicte DesrusAlthough the unique ecosystem is severely threatened by urban sprawl, many Indigenous residents still farmchinampas(a pre-Aztec technique consisting of islands formed from willow trees, lilies and mud), gliding through the blue-green canals on wobbly canoes laden with lettuce, radish andverdolagas(Mexican parsley).“In agriculture, how you go about production really determines how much carbon you emit,” says Melanie Kolb, a researcher at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.As well as buying from five local families, Arca Tierra farms 18chinampasusing a three-row agroforestry system. The farming team led by Sonia Tapia Garcés combines ancestral techniques such aschapines– rich sediment cut into squares used for germinating seeds – with compost from Baldío’s kitchen and a hi-tech wood shedder that allows them to create mulch, which contributes to the soil’s potential for carbon sequestration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

It is enough to supply 50% of Baldío’s needs.

Reducing distance travelled and the need for refrigeration on longer journeys results in a fraction of the carbon emissions associated with typical restaurant supply chains.For 74-year-old Noy Coquis Saldedo, who rents land to Arca Tierra, the project offers an opportunity to preserve his identity at a time when just 2.5% of thechinampasare still used for traditional agriculture. “It’s very sad that young people don’t want to farm any more,” he says. “But now we are delivering food to the great city like my ancestors did.”A pod of young pelicans surf a warm gust between the verdant banks, practising for the journey they will soon make to California. For Lucio Usobiaga, closing the loop between thechinampasand Baldío could be a blueprint for the future. “Ultimately, I hope the project shows people that a more just and better food system is possible.”And the food? When the Guardian tasted it, it was delicious: flame-licked, spiked with salsas and texturally balanced, it is distinctly Mexican – yet also something entirely its own.Explore more on these topicsFood wasteThe alternativesFoodMexicoAmericasRestaurantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now, he’s back writing, performing – and rediscovering his political rageFri 13 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn the mid-90s, Omaha made a pretty decent tour stop for up-and-coming bands. Nebraska sits near-plum in the US’s middle, and in its most populous city, once famed for its fur trade, stockyards and railroads, there had grown a thriving subculture that centred largely on a book and record store named the Antiquarium and a small venue named the Cog Factory.Conor Oberst spent much of his early teens puttering between these locations, filling his young brain with music and literature. By 12, he had begun writing his own songs, and by 13 he had recorded his first album, releasing it on his older brother’s label and selling it in the record store. Sometimes he would take to the stage at the Cog Factory, a small, pale boy with an acoustic guitar and a lot of words.He had already begun recording asBright Eyesby the time the Texas band Spoon came through town. Oberst and his friends were huge fans, and turned up to the venue early to see the band arrive. “We loved Spoon,” he says. “But we didn’t know what anyone in the bands looked like, never seen their pictures. These vans pull up outside the club and you’re like: ‘I wonder which one’s the singer?’ There was a lot more mystery and fun to it then.”It would be another five years or so by the time Bright Eyes found success – by now a band rather than a solo project, they were widely feted for their fourth album, 2002’s Lifted Or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, followed by their twin 2005 records I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. By that time, the world was a very different place. Music and media were growing increasingly digitised, and the US was grappling with the presidency of George W Bush and the controversies of the Iraq war.Oberst, whose songs were heartfelt and literate and politically engaged, carrying titles such as When the President Talks to God, became the poster boy of a new generation. His face was everywhere. When Bright Eyes’ tour bus pulled up at the venue,everyoneknew he was the singer. “What happened to me wasn’t at all overnight because I had been touring since I was 15 years old, and at this point I’m 25,” he says. “But still, I think when that big push of fame or public persona, identity thing happened to me, it definitely affected me. I definitely felt the insanity of it.”In many ways, the last 20 years of Oberst’s career have been an attempt to shake off that intensity and find the mystery and the fun of music again. “It is a hard thing to hold on to, that innocence, and what you loved about music sometimes,” he says.Nevertheless, he has tried to grip tightly to that feeling; to remember what music is to him beyond a career. He learned the hard way, he says, that there is not much music in the music business. “But what I will say is music is consistently something that gives my life meaning, and is a source of solace and happiness – not just making it, but listening to it, and seeing people I love doing it,” he says. “Besides family and friends and loved ones, I would say it’s the most consistent thing in my life. There’s nothing else. I’m not religious, I’m not really a member of too many clubs or anything, it’s kind of just music that’s gotten me through it.”The past few years have not always been easy for Oberst – there has been a divorce, the sudden loss of one of his brothers and, in late 2013, an allegation of sexual assault by a female fan. By the following summer,the allegations had been dropped, and the accuser had apologised both to Oberst and to “actual sexual assault victims”. It is not a time the singer is keen to revisit.He speaks steadily, carefully, and gently declines to go on the record about the specificities of what happened. But one gathers that it led to the period he refers to now as “a time when I wished I never had made music, and wished no one had ever heard it. And that’s about the saddest feeling in the world when that’s your whole life, just wanting to not exist.”View image in fullscreen‘I lost interest in kind of everything’ … Oberst on stage in Los Angeles, 2003.Photograph: Scott Gries/Getty ImagesWhat he will also say is that music played an integral part in helping him back out into the world again. “I go into music as a place to understand what’s going on. That’s a place that I know I can go that’s just for myself,” he says. “But it’s all in your mind, so it’s up to you to take care of it and tend the garden. And sometimes if you’re not feeling well physically or otherwise, or the world’s got you down, you stop weeding the garden and the next thing you know your mind’s just overrun and snarled. The forest takes over the grounds, and it’s pretty dark.”Across the screen, Oberst looks small and bleary and slightly disoriented in his hoodie. “But you know, things tend to come back around and get better, and worse, and better again,” he says. “So it’s just trying to stay alive through those parts that seem insurmountable. And next thing you know I’m out here with some of my oldest, best friends in the world and everyone’s having fun,” he says, with a nod to the room behind him, a grey backstage space at the MegaCorp Pavilion in Newport, Kentucky, where Bright Eyes are on tour with fellow Omaha natives, Cursive. “This particular leg of this tour is probably the most old-school touring situation I’ve had for decades. It has been a relief of sorts to be travelling on tour buses again, hanging out till 4am, just fucking smoking weed in parking lots. Playing music. It’s great. It’s like nothing changed.”Last autumn, Bright Eyes released their 11th album, Five Dice, All Threes. It is their most limber record in some while, capturing a kind of musical camaraderie between Oberst and his longstanding bandmates Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott. For Oberst, the record “definitely captures that sort of youthful punk rock spirit that maybe I’d forgotten about”.He credits this rekindling in part to his friend Alex Levine, who helped in the writing of the songs at a point where the singer had “definitely lost interest in kind of everything”. “He was working at other studios with other people, and he’d come back and I’d still be sitting there on the porch, and he’d be like: ‘Why don’t we work on something?’ The first few times I was like: ‘Oh I’m good, man, let’s just sit around, I don’t care.’ And then he wore me down, and next thing we know we’re making demos. I think I really do have him to thank for lighting the fire.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Oberst today seems once again politically ignited, railing against Elon Musk, the anti-immigrant crackdown, the dismantling of academic centres and legal processes, the attack on trans rights and the funnelling of public money into private contracts, against an administration he describes as “the greatest grift of all time”. It is a return of sorts to his earlier self: “I feel there might have been a period in maybe my early 30s where I was like: ‘I should, like, grow up. You shouldn’t be angsty towards the world. You should turn into this real acceptable thing that a lot of people can get behind,’” he says. “Because people like the idea of anger more than they like anger. They like the performative aspect. But the thing is, I really feel it. I really fucking hate these things and I always have, and it’s hard because I can’t not show it.”Lately, at the band’s live shows, he has been encouraging his audiences to speak up. “The world is more fucked up and keeps getting more fucked up so I don’t think it’s time to act measured,” he says. “What I’ve been saying to the kids at the shows every night is you can’t wait. By the time you realise how bad it is, it’s too late, and that’s just something we know from history. Don’t wait till it’s cool to go down to the park and protest. There’s an alarm bell going off above our heads right now and we should all be screaming at the top of our fucking lungs.”He thinks back sometimes to those teenage years in Omaha, when Rage Against the Machine were pretty much the only common musical ground he could find with the high-school jocks, and wonders whether any of them were aware that they were essentially listening to the communist manifesto. “But it slipped into suburban houses, and it did a public service ’cos it influenced all these people. It turned a bunch of them into political activists,” he says.Each night, Oberst looks out from the stage into the crowd and sees a whole new audience before him, from little kids to an eightysomething woman there with her grandson, via people his own age, and “straight-up teenagers that could’ve been at a Bright Eyes show in 1999”. Somehow, amid all the darkness, he finds a hope in this crowd – perhaps even evidence of the role that music has to play in resistance. “I think music is magical,” he says, “I think it can cross all political lines.”Bright Eyes tour the UK and Ireland from16to 25 June; tour starts Nottingham.Explore more on these topicsBright EyesPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Brentford appointed Frank as manager in October 2018 and lost eight of their following 10 games. So nobody should panic if Frank begins slowly at Tottenham.In reality, though, the first couple of months will be a major challenge for the Dane. These are not easy circumstances for anybody to take the Spurs job. Usually a manager takes over after a run of poor form, with fans and players ready for a change and a regression to the mean in the offing. Spurs have been on a run of poor form – one win in 12 league games over the final three months of the season – but in that time they alsowon the Europa League, which means everything is seen in a different light.Tottenham confirm appointment of Thomas Frank as new managerRead moreFans may have grumbled, they may have stopped singing Angels, and there wasthe contretemps at Stamford Bridge, but many of the doubts about Ange Postecoglou were forgotten amid the ecstasy of Bilbao. To judge by the victory parade after the Europa League final and theoutpourings of love on social media, the players remained supportive of the Australian. Which makes this a very unusual situation: Frank inherits a side that finished fourth-bottom of the league, that is both buoyed by recent success and expectant of improvement.That Postecoglou started his first season so well only complicated the issue: unfair and unrepresentative of the whole as it may be, it’s easy to imagine the comparisons to his first 10 league games, which yielded 26 points.There are other doubts. After working in the youth ranks in Denmark, Frank has only ever managed Brøndby and Brentford. In terms of scrutiny and expectation, Tottenham is a whole new level. It’s one thing to be affable at the club with the second-lowest wage bill in the Premier League, quite another at a club such as Spurs, with a vast global fanbase. Already there has been some online scepticism about the wisdom of a club of their size and self-perception appointing from humble Brentford.While the examples of José Mourinho and Antonio Conte show the dangers of turning to a manager who believes the club should be grateful to have them, latent doubts about the scale of the step up could exacerbate the backlash if early results or performances are poor – as Tottenham experienced during Nuno Espírito Santo’singlorious 17-game reign.And then there’s the Champions League: after the Europa League win, there should be few fears about playing in Europe, and Spurs should at the very least qualify for the playoff round, but constant high-level games are a drain on both physical and emotional energy.Frank has limited experience of balancing the domestic league and Europe, the furthest he ever took Brøndby being the fourth qualifying round of the Europa League. His European record is notably poor: played 10, won three, and two of those were against Juvenes/Dogana of San Marino. His record in domestic cups, similarly, is dismal; his past history makes it unlikely a poor league season could be redeemed by other silverware – although the depth of the Spurs squad perhaps means the cups will not be such a low priority.There is one further doubt, which is more to do with Spurs than Frank. He is leaving an exceptionally well-run club, at which every component worked together to a coherent philosophy. There can be no certainty that any one cog from that system, however important, can achieve success in a different environment, something Chelsea have found as they accumulate more and more parts from Brighton without ever looking like replicating the efficiency of Albion’s model. It may be that such efficiency is not even possible at bigger clubs.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There can be no guarantees that what worked in one set of circumstances will work in another. Football is complicated, andFrank has not only thrived at Brentford– taking the club with the 19th-highest wage bill to 10th in the table is a remarkable achievement – but has given every indication he is flexible enough to adapt to a new environment.Brentford were promoted as a progressive side with 55% possession in 2020-21, stayed up in their first three Premier League seasons playing in a relatively low block with 44% or 45% possession and then, in the season just ended, began pressing higher and playing more in transition, their possession rising to 48%. That’s three clear and distinct ways of playing, even before you get to the frequent tweaks of formation.Not for Frank stubbornly sticking to a philosophy – only to then abandon it when the injuries became too much, leading paradoxically to glory – which is a large part of his appeal.Frank is 51, but he is a manager on the way up. He has Premier League experience. He is the sort of manager Tottenham should be looking to appoint. His track record is very good. It should work. But nothing in football is ever certain and there is a danger a poor start, combined with a confusion about realistic aspirations, could undermine his reign when it has hardly begun.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurThomas FrankcommentShareReuse this content"

Iran responded by launching at least 100 drones and ballistic missiles in Israel’s direction, most of which were shot down, according to the Israeli military. Iranhas vowed revenge, with the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, threatening “severe punishment”.The foreign ministries of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries all denounced the Israeli strikes and urged a diplomatic resolution to the conflict. Lebanon and Jordan issued similar statements.Saudi Arabia’s foreign ministry said the Israeli attacks against Iran “constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms”.What has Israel hit in Iran and who were the generals and nuclear scientists killed?Read more“While the Kingdom condemns these heinous attacks, it affirms that the international community and the Security Council bear a great responsibility to immediately halt this aggression,” a statement from the Saudi foreign ministry said. The Saudi foreign minister, Faisal bin Farhan, later called his Iranian counterpart, urging a “rejection of the use of force”.Though many states in the Middle East, particularly in the Arab Gulf, are historically hostile to Iran and its influence in the region, a fully fledged war between Israel and Iran is not in their interest.Escalation threatened regional fallout, with intercepted Iranian missiles falling in the countryside of southern Syria, schools closing in south Lebanon and Jordanian jets shooting down drones and missiles.In the past, Iran and its proxies’ targets have included oil facilities in Saudi Arabia and US military personnel in the Middle East. The US has military bases across the region, including in Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the UAE. Iran’s ability to disrupt the oil trade, with its control over the strategic strait of Hormuz, could threaten the economic interests of the Gulf states.Map of strike locationsIran backs a network of militias across the region, such as the Houthis in Yemen, the popular mobilisation forces in Iraq andHezbollahin Lebanon, which could all also be involved in an Iranian war with Israel.The militias are a core part of Iran’s defence doctrine, a concept it refers to as strategic depth, which relies on its allies and proxies to create layers of defence and deterrence throughout the Middle East. Under the doctrine, an Israeli attack could be met with a missile from neighbouring Lebanon, Yemen or Iraq.Iran’s allies, however, have been severely weakened by almost two years of fighting with Israel. Hezbollah, Iran’s most important regional proxy, had most of its senior leadershipkilled in Israeli strikeslast autumn and its weapons caches have been confiscated by the Lebanese state.The Iran-backed militias gave no indication on Friday that they would get involved in the Iran-Israel conflict, issuing relatively measured statements in the aftermath of the strikes.Hezbollah condemned the attacks but said the group would not initiate a strike on Israel, while theHouthissaid that they “support Iran’s right to defend itself”. Hezbollah and other members of the Iranian axis have been severely battered over the past year of fighting with Israel, as well as by the fall of Iran’s ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria.The lukewarm response by Iran’s allied militias was a strong contrast to its firstattack on Israelin April 2024, when drones and missiles were launched from Lebanon, Iraq and Syria alongside its own.Explore more on these topicsIranMiddle East and north AfricaIsraelHezbollahHouthisSaudi ArabianewsShareReuse this content"

In the same interview, he backed a Nato plan to lift defence spending from 2.5% of GDP in 2027 to 3.5%, though he said he would not commit to a date.1:03Iranian TV shows aftermath of Israeli strikes on Tehran – videoStarmer said on Friday: “The reports of these strikes are concerning and we urge all parties to step back and reduce tensions urgently. Escalation serves no one in the region. Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy.”Britain has justified previous interventions on the grounds that it was coming to Israel’s defence, providing a small contribution alongside US and Jordanian air forces. The US said itshot down 70 dronesin April 2024.Speaking at the Scottish Conservatives’ conference on Friday, the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch, said she agreed with Israel’s strikes on Iran and that the UK “should not be confused about whose side we’re on”.Badenoch said: “We cannot have Iran getting nuclear weapons. Iran has tried to carry out terrorist attacks on our soil. Let’s be very clear, Iran getting nuclear weapons would be destructive for the UK, so yes [I agree with Israel’s attacks].”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, described the Israeli attacks as “deeply alarming”. She said a diplomatic resolution was “more urgent than ever” for regional stability and global security.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, spoke with Starmer by telephone on Friday morning. Downing Street said the leaders “discussed the long-held grave concerns about Iran’s nuclear programme” and “agreed that a diplomatic resolution, rather than military action, was the way forward”.Merz said Berlin would use “all available diplomatic means” to avoid escalation. The aim must remain “that Iran not develop any nuclear weapons”, he said.Macron also appealed for restraint and said Paris had “repeatedly condemned” Iran’s nuclear programme. In that context, Macron said, France “reaffirms Israel’s right to defend itself and ensure its security”.The Italian foreign minister, Antonio Tajani, said he had called his Israeli counterpart to urge de-escalation and would make the same request to Iran’s foreign minister later. “I will insist on support for diplomacy,” Tajani told Italian TV.Some leaders were openly critical of Israel’s actions. The Spanish deputy prime minister Yolanda Díaz accused the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, of “dragging the world towards an escalation of war”. She called for “respect for international law, immediate sanctions against the Israeli regime and a multilateral route toward a just and lasting peace”.Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, described the attacks as a “clear provocation” and said Netanyahu “and his massacre network” were “setting our entire region and the world on fire”.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelForeign policyKeir StarmerMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

But this felt different, he said.“After seeing all the people who have been killed there, it is clear [Iran] will try to attack back. We don’t know where or when, but we are ready.”The TV studios were as frenetic as the streets were empty, with all the main channels going live from the moment news of the attacks first broke.The dominant mood was celebration, as military correspondents and analysts pored over satellite images and grainy video to discuss Israel’s targets, methods and the impact of their strikes.View image in fullscreenBen Gurion airport was closed ‘until further notice’.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/AP“Interim summary: a glorious intelligence and operational success for the State of Israel. The (air raid) alarms at 3am were unnecessary,” said Roy Sharon, a military correspondent and analyst with Kan news, in one post on X that captured national pride at Israel’s ability to strike high-level targets deep inside IranSigalit, 50, and Barack, 54, teachers from southern Israel who had come to Tel Aviv for pride weekend, agreed. “We feel safe now, more safe than ever, because we know we destroyed their nuclear weapons,” said Sigalit.Even so, the couple were heading back home after just one night because the parties had been cancelled, and they worried traffic might build up on roads out of Tel Aviv.Tourists who flew in from further away, including the parade’s guest of honour, Caitlyn Jenner, were stranded in Israel and Israelis abroad took to social media to ask for help getting home.Most international airlines rapidly suspended flights to Israel. Even Israel’s national carrier El Al, which has flown almost without interruption throughout the war in Gaza, cancelled flights on Friday, told travellers with tickets for Saturday and Sunday not to come to the airport and said it had suspended bookings through to the end of the month.For Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, the attacks brought a paralysing shutdown, with roads and checkpoints closed as Israel focused its military attention on Iran.The Palestinian Red Crescent warned that the blockades were costing lives because they were struggling to reach patients with ambulances or get them to hospitals. Israel also closed al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, one of the holiest sites in Islam, and often a flashpoint for regional tensions.In an address to the nation overnight, the Israel prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, had told people the crisis “may take much longer than you are used to” and urged Israelis to stock up on supplies “but the most important thing is to equip yourself with patience”.As attacks on Iran continued through Thursday, some in Israel said they were determined to carry on with normal life. Keter Benchimol, 55, had just flown back into Israel and on Friday she was headed to the beach with her son for a swim.Stretches of sand normally packed with sunbathers were emptier than usual but not deserted. “There’s no need to fear, God has us. If it’s my day to go, I could go anywhere,” she said, in a sentiment echoed by dozens of others. “I’m just relieved to be back here with my kids, not worrying about them from far away.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

For Tehran, this is not only a tactical loss but a profound strategic humiliation,” she added.The immediate question is how much damage was done at Natanz, where Iran has conducted most of its nuclear enrichment at a site thought to be 8 metres underground, largely protected by reinforced concrete and hard rock. Videos showed black plumes emerging from the area of the site, but damage is impossible to assess.MapIran said the Natanz site had been hit, but there were no casualties, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency, while the International Atomic Energy Agency said it was still assessing the damage. Meanwhile, Israel’s military spokesperson, Effie Defrin, said the bombing had struck the underground area and related critical infrastructure. “We inflicted significant damage on this site,” he added.At the same time, Israel’s external security service, the Mossad, claimed it had conducted a mixture of commando attacks, complete withgrainy thermal video, and strikes from prepositioned drones – in the style of Ukraine’s recent attack on Russian airbases – aimed at Iranian air defence systems, including at Esfejabad airbase.0:45Footage released by the Mossad claims to show Israeli agents in Iran – videoSome of the Mossad claims are likely to be propagandistic but the military reality is that so far there has been no sign of effective Iranian air defence or any reports of Israeli air force casualties. Israel appears to have a near total air superiority, allowing it to continue bombing into Friday with fresh attacks on Tabriz.Iran’s initial response, Israel said, was to launch more than 100 drones at its attacker, all of which were shot down by mid morning. The drones are slow-moving, taking up to seven hours to travel the 700 miles or so between the countries – and it would take a far larger wave before even a handful hit the ground.Tehran does have other military options, however. The most immediately dangerous is a store of up to 3,000 high-speed ballistic missiles, of which it used about 180 in its last attack on Israel in October 2024.Two dozen or sohit the Nevatim and Tel Nof airbases (where nuclear weapons are thought to be stored) in Israel and locations near the Mossad headquarters, but the damage done appears to have been relatively modest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Successfully destroying or disabling underground sites is notoriously difficult, however, and the true impact will emerge only if Iran launches a missile counterattack with whatever is left at its military’s disposal.Alternative possibilities may be cyber or terror attacks, though on a political level neither might feel like an equivalent retaliatory response, even if they are achievable – while strikes on American targets would be very risky for Tehran, bringing with it the possibility that the US, with all its firepower, would join the war.MapBut the option that is not on the table is to rely on traditional regional proxies. On Friday, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, its leadership eliminated during the two-month war with Israel last autumn, said it “will not initiate its own attack on Israel” in support of Iran. Yemen’s Houthis,attacked by Israel on Tuesday, are more than 1,000 miles distant and have only the ability to mount occasional ballistic missile attacks.The complication for Israel is that Iran has had a long time to prepare, and its nuclear facilities are well defended.Until Friday afternoon, Israel did not try to attack a second enrichment facility at Fordow, buried 80-90 metres underground, beyond the capabilities of its most powerful known missiles, the 1.8-tonne Rocks and 1.6-tonne Air Lora.Successfully attacking Natanz,according to an analysisfrom Rusi, “would likely require several impacts into the same crater to ‘burrow’ down to the facility and get a weapon through to explode within it successfully” – while the destruction of Fordow is considered feasible only with the US GBU 57/B “bunker buster” bomb, which, because it weighs nearly 14 tonnes and is 6 metres long,can be launched only from US B-2 bombers.Such hardened targets, combined with Israel’s air dominance and extraordinary confidence, point to an extended military campaign against Iran – two weeks long, according to some reports – as well as a tense and uncertain international period, which, absent an Iranian capitulation, may not have an obvious end point.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

The US president has scrambled to now present the Israeli strikes, which he publicly claimed he did not want on Thursday, as a means of continuing his efforts to convince Iran tonegotiate.UK government says it gave no military support for Israel’s attack on IranRead more“They should now come to the table to make a deal before it’s too late,” he said.But the discordant US response to the strikes, including Rubio’s Thursday evening statement, a hasty evacuation of some US personnel from the region and ambiguity over whether the US provided intelligence or would actively take part in Israel’s defence from a likely counterattack, has raised questions over whetherIsraelmay have moved ahead of the Trump administration as a way to present Washington with a fait accompli.“They made a bet on President Trump,” said Elliott Abrams, a former diplomat and senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, suggesting that Israel had pushed harder for strikes while the Trump administration had sought to maintain a diplomatic route. “The Israelis struck and then today Trump called it ‘excellent’.”While Israel had clearly given the United States advanced warning of the strike, claims that it was fully coordinated in Israeli state media have been subject to speculation: was Trump actually on board or was he repositioning himself on Friday in order to present the strikes as part of a coherent strategy.On Thursday, in remarks from the White House’s East Room, Trump said that strikes on Israel could “blow up” his diplomatic efforts to negotiate with the Iranian leadership and said he “didn’t want them going in”. He defended his decision to begin evacuating personnel because a strike “could well happen”.“The US started evacuating voluntarily non-essential personnel on Wednesday, barely 24 hours ahead of time, not enough time to really get people out of harm’s way,” said Rosemary Kelanic, the Middle East director for Defense Priorities, a thinktank that pushes for a more restrained US foreign policy. “So the question for me is what did the president know and when did he know it?”On Friday, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he was not caught unaware by the strike: “Heads-up? It wasn’t a heads-up. It was, we know what’s going on.” And he indicated that he had been apprised of future Israeli plans, writing that the “next already planned attacks” would be “even more brutal”.Senior Israeli officials also began to brief media that Trump had only pretended to oppose an Israeli attack and that they in fact had a “green light” for the attack. But Kelanic and others noted that Israel may be seeking a means to “entrap” the US into a war.In either case, it is doubtful that Israel could have prepared the attack in the past week without US knowledge.Officials at the Defense Intelligence Agency and other intelligence agencies would have seen the preparations for the airstrike – involving more than 200 Israeli fighter jets striking more than 100 targets across Iran – and probably understood that Israel was planning a major attack against Tehran.Late on Thursday, administration officials told Fox News that the US had replenished missiles for Israel’s Iron Dome anti-air batteries in recent weeks in preparation for an expected counterattack.And the US in recent weeks had deployed B-52 bombers to its airbase on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, where multiple B-2 bombers have also been stationed since late March. B-2s stationed at the base took part in airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen earlier this year, but the base would also serve as a launching point for airstrikes against Iran if the US were to join the conflict.But there are other explanations for the resupply of anti-air missiles to Iron Dome, particularly following the unprecedented barrage of ballistic missiles launched by Iran against Israel last year.And the US could have employed those B-2s and B-52s to strike the Fordow uranium enrichment centre, which is located deep underground and was not apparently struck in Friday morning’s strikes. Still intact, it represents an important element in Iran’s nuclear program that was not eliminated – at least in the first round of the Israeli attacks.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpIsraelIranMiddle East and north AfricaUS national securityanalysisShareReuse this content"

Construction work had been under way to expand the site.Natanz is where Iran has produced much of its nuclear fuel – including a stockpile of highly enriched uranium that the west has suggested could be used in a future nuclear weapon.Satellite imagery showedsignificant damage to two areas of the site: its electrical substation that powers it, and the above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant, which hosts hundreds of centrifuges.View image in fullscreenDamage to the Natanz substation.Photograph: @AirbusDefence/OSCView image in fullscreenDamage to an above-ground pilot fuel enrichment plant at Natanz.Photograph: @AirbusDefence/OSCIt was unclear, however, what – if any – damage had been done to the main subsurface Fuel Enrichment Plant, which is equipped with about 15,000 centrifuges. The IAEA said there had been no reported nuclear contamination.At the time of writing, the IAEA – quoting Iranian authorities – said a number of other key Iranian sites including theFordownuclear enrichment site, theIsfahannuclear site and theBushehrnuclear power plant had not been hit.What else was hit?Early reports suggestBid Kaneh,which houses several missile development and production sites, was hit on Friday morning.Iran has confirmed a number of senior military figures and scientists were assassinated, some in strikes on private residences, pointing to a military operation going far beyond Israel’s stated intention of preventing Tehran crossing the threshold for acquiring a nuclear weapon.Tehran strikes mapAmong those killed were the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces,Maj GenMohammad Bagheri, and the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC),GenHossein Salami, suggesting a broader “decapitation” strike aimed at weakening the Iranian regime.The Israeli prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, expressed hope the attacks would trigger the downfall of Iran’s theocracy, saying his message to the Iranian people was that Israel’s fight was not with them, but with the “brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years”.Who were Salami and Bagheri?Both officers were closely associated with the centres of power in Iran’s security hierarchy, having risen through the ranks after the Iranian revolution in 1979.View image in fullscreenHossein Salami (left) and Mohammad Bagheri (right), two of Iran’s top military officers, were killed in Israel’s strikes.Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPASalamibegan his career in the IRGC in 1980 duringthe Iran-Iraq war, becoming deputy commander in 2009 then, a decade later, commander of the 125,000-strong force that has played a key role in Iran’s forward foreign policy in the region. Salami had been sanctioned by the UN and US for his involvement in Iran’s nuclear and military programmes.“If you make the slightest mistake, we will open the gates of hell for you,” Salami warned Tehran’s foes during a tour of an underground missile base in January.Bagheri, who was in his early 60s, had also risen through theIRGC, like Salami fighting in the Iran-Iraq war with a background in military intelligence before being appointed chief of staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran – the country’s highest military position – in 2016. His position made him, formally at least, the second most powerful figure in Iran after the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Some press reports have suggested Bagheri was one of the revolutionary students that seized the US embassy in 1979.Gholamali Rashid, the deputy commander in chief of the armed forces, was also reported as having been killed.It was reported thatAli Shamkhani, a key adviser to and confidant of Khamenei, was killed in a strike on an apartment block in Tehran, as well as the head of the IRGC’s air force and a number of his senior aides.Who were the scientists killed?Israel has a history of targeting Iranian nuclear scientists, and this attack was no exception with at least six scientists killed on Friday.The Tasnim news agency named the six scientists includingMohammad Mehdi Tehranchi, who was the president of the Islamic Azad University of Iran, a theoretical physicist.View image in fullscreenProtesters in Tehran after the Israeli strikes hold posters of some of the nuclear scientists and military officers who were killed, including of Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi (left), Fereydoun Abbasi (centre) and Gholamali Rashid (right).Photograph: Abedin Taherkenareh/EPAAlso killed wasFereydoun Abbasi, a former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran.

If so, Israel knows more than the US or the UN watchdog didMiddle East crisis – live updatesFri 13 Jun 2025 11.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 14.02 EDTShareIn justifying Israel’s attack on Iran, Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said he had acted to pre-empt a secret Iranian programme to build a nuclear bomb, claiming Tehran already had the capacity to build nine nuclear bombs. Israeli officials also claimed to have presented information to the US that Iran had recently made the necessary technical breakthroughs.Netanyahu’s critics are saying he acted to pre-empt something else: a diplomatic agreement between the US and Iran on its civil nuclear programme, or even the demise of his own government. They point out thatIsraelhas been saying for 20 years that Iran is on the brink of building a bomb.Either way, his claim largely depends on Israel’s formidable intelligence community possessing a greater state of knowledge about Iran’s nuclear programme than either its US counterparts or the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).As recently as 25 March, Tulsi Gabbard, the US director of national intelligence, told the Senate intelligence committee that the American intelligence community had assessed thatIranwas not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon.However, Gabbard added that in the past years, there would appear to have been “an erosion of a decades-long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decision-making apparatus”.She added: “Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”A 22-page report declassified by the IAEA boardthis weekdid not say Iran was so close to a nuclear weapon. It said it had been unable to see aspects of Iran’s civil nuclear programme, and believed Tehran had repeatedly failed to cooperate, particularly over its past secret nuclear programme.It concluded that it could not verify that Iran’s civil nuclear programme was exclusively civilian. But it did not say Iran was on the verge of a nuclear weapon.The IAEA report looks at Iran’s progress towards building a bomb, its level of cooperation with UN inspectors and its stockpiles of enriched uranium.On the first point, the IAEA has since 2019 been examining Iranian human-made uranium particles at three undeclared locations in Iran: Varamin, Marivan and Turquz Abad. This was part of an Iranian nuclear programme codenamed Amad, which has been known about for years and is believed to have ended in 2003.The report concluded that “these three locations, and other possible related locations, were part of an undeclared structured nuclear programme carried out by Iran until the early 2000s and that some activities used undeclared nuclear material”.The IAEA director, Rafael Grossi, told the board: “Unfortunately, Iran has repeatedly either not answered, or not provided technically credible answers to, the agency’s questions. It has also sought to sanitise the locations, which has impeded agency verification activities.”The IAEA concluded that aftersuccessful implosion tests, Iran had intended to proceed with cold tests – conducted with a fully assembled bomb with a core of natural or depleted uranium rather than one of weapons-grade uranium – and had been conducting blast shielding tests in preparation.Together these conclusions appear to confirm the breadth of Iran’s previously disclosed nuclear programme, suggesting also that this knowledge will not have been lost in the Iranian scientific community.On the second issue – access to sites – the IAEA report states it is not being given the access it requires, and has not been shown plans for new nuclear facilities. Since February 2021, Iran has denied IAEA access to recorded data from centrifuge production plants. Although a few cameras were reinstalled at centrifuge production plants in May 2023, the agency still cannot access the recordings.From the Iranian perspective, all these steps were permissible countermeasures to Trump’s2018 withdrawal from the nuclear deal.The Guardian view on Iran’s nuclear programme: Trump undid a crucial accord. A new deal is urgently needed | EditorialRead moreOn the third point, the report found that Iran had been accumulating a stockpile of highly enriched uranium way beyond the levels set out in the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran’s stockpile of 60%-enriched uranium had grown from 274.8kg in early February to 408.6kg, an increase of about 50%. This is enough fuel for nine warheads, depending on how much highly enriched uranium is in the finished core of each nuclear weapon.The IAEA report concluded that it had “no credible indications of an ongoing, undeclared structured nuclear programme” and noted that senior Iranian officials had said that the use of nuclear weapons was incompatible with Islamic law.But it also pointed to statements from former Iranian officials who suggested that Tehran now had all the capabilities to manufacture nuclear weapons.“While safeguarded enrichment activities are not forbidden in and of themselves, the fact that Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60% remains a matter of serious concern,” it said.Asked in April when Iran might be capable of weaponising its missile warheads, Grossi said: “Dates are always arbitrary. But they are not far. It would be, you know, a matter of months, not years.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealNuclear weaponsBenjamin NetanyahuIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

It was not clear whether this opening was the door or a rupture in the fuselage.“The aircraft was pretty nose up when it hit the buildings,” said Cable, a former senior inspector of air accidents at the UK Air Accidents Investigations Branch. “It has presumably broken open in an area of the fuselage adjacent to this guy and fortuitously he has popped out without major injury.”Ramesh’s seat had space, rather than seats, immediately in front of it, which may have given him more room for escape than many of his fellow passengers. It may also have meant that while the passengers in front of him may have been crushed together on impact, he avoided that fate, Prof John McDermid, Lloyd’s Register chair of safety at the University of York, said.“My suspicion is that because of the nature of the impact, he was in a strong part of the airplane at the front edge of the wing,” he added. “There is not just the fuselage, but the extra structure of the wing to protect from the compression of the fuselage.”“It’s possible that the impact loosened the door and he could kick it out and get out,” McDermid said. “The external door was only just in front of him so he didn’t have far to go.”But before Ramesh could even consider an escape, he had to have the luck to survive the impact of the crash.“If you’ve got an accident like this, where you’ve got an aircraft full of fuel and it’s making a crash landing off the airport into the built environment, that’s unlikely to be a survivable accident,” said Prof Ed Galea, an expert in fire safety and evacuation at the University of Greenwich. “The fact that anyone has survived is miraculous.“He seems to have been lucky in that: a) he survived the trauma of the impact, b) he wasn’t severely injured in that crash, and c) he was sitting right by the No 2 exit. Whether he used that or exited via a rupture that was close by, is not clear. But he was very close to an exit point.”Galea has previously carried out research on plane crashes which found that, in less devastating crashes, people sitting within five rows of a serviceable exit have a greater chance of surviving than dying while those more than five rows away were more likely to perish. He said he always tries to reserve a seat within five rows of an emergency exit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Passengers who did not adopt the brace position may have struck their heads on the seats in front of them knocking them unconscious, but there were no seats immediately in front of Ramesh.While the structure of the plane may have given him a chance at survival, Ramesh still needed to move fast to take that chance, said McDermid. “If he hadn’t got out in a very few seconds, he would have been unlikely to make it out because of the fireball,” he added.The plane had enough fuel on board to carry it to London Gatwick and this appeared to ignite upon impact.Galea said Ramesh may have found himself exiting in front of the fireball if the aviation fuel had been pouring from the ruptured tanks in a rearward direction.“He was a very, very unlucky man being on that airplane, but he was also a very, very lucky man being able to get out,” McDermid concluded.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaPlane crashesAir transportSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

This followed Donald Trump’s extraordinary decision to deploy national guard troops to LA last weekend, over the objections of the governor of California, Gavin Newsom. The marines were to take over protecting a federal building, US Army Maj Gen Scott Sherman, who commands the taskforce of marines and national guardsmen, said.The streets had been mostly calm overnight going into Friday morning, marking the seventh day of protests across various areas and the third day of an overnight curfew in a small part of the huge downtown area.The civilian who was detained spoke to reporters after he was released, identifying himself as Marcos Leao, 27, an army veteran who was on his way to the Department of Veterans Affairs when he crossed a taped-off area and was asked to stop.Leao, who gained his US citizenship through military service, said he was treated “very fairly”.“They’re just doing their job,” said Leao, who is of Angolan and Portuguese descent.Sporadic demonstrations have also taken place in cities including New York, Chicago, Seattle and Austin on several days in the last week against Trump’s pushing of his mass deportation agenda, undertaken by targeting undocumented communities in the US interior.And millions more are expected to turn out to protest on Saturday at roughly 2,000 sites nationwide in ademonstration dubbed “No Kings”against what critics see as Trump taking actions on the brink of authoritarianism.The mass protests are timed to coincide with the US president’s controversial military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the formation of the US army, and coincidentally his 79th birthday.The protests inLos Angelesand subsequent deployment of California’s national guard by Trump, over the furious objections of Newsom, is a move that had not happened in the US in at least half a century, sparking a legal battle between the president and Newsom.Late on Thursday, a federal judge ruled that the federal deployment of troops by the president to aid in civilian US law enforcement in LA should be blocked. The administration swiftly appealed and a higher court paused the restraining order until Tuesday, when it will hear the case.Judge Charles Breyer’s ruling in Newsom v Trump stated that Trump had unlawfully bypassed congressionally mandated procedures.Newsom in an interview with the New York Times podcast on Thursdaycalled Trump a “stone cold liar”for claiming he had discussed a federal deployment with the governor by telephone.Democrats and advocacy groups view Trump’s deployment as an abuse of power aimed at suppressing free speech and supporting aggressive anti-immigration policies.Trump’s use of the troops follows earlier, unfulfilled threats during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in his first administration, when he considered, but ultimately declined, to deploy federal troops and has sinceexpressed regretabout not cracking down more forcefully.The president has defended his decision to send troops to LA claiming without any evidence that the city would have been “obliterated” and “burned to the ground” had he not initiated the deployment.In Washington, Saturday’s parade is billed as a patriotic celebration, while critics argue it is more about Trump’s personal brand and ego than promoting national unity. Organizers of No Kings protests have avoided planning a demonstration in the nation’s capital, in an attempt to draw attention away from tanks, armored vehicles, troops and aircraft on display.“The flag doesn’t belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,” read a statement from the No Kings protest movement.The parade will culminate on Saturday evening with a procession of 6,600 soldiers, dozens of tanks, and a live broadcast message from an astronaut in space. Inspired by a Bastille Day parade Trump witnessed in France in 2017, but with strong echoes of the kind of regular displays under authoritarian regimes such as Russia, North Korea and China, the event is expected to cost up to $45m, sources toldNBC News.Meanwhile, some members of the national guard troops deployed to Los Angeles and some of their family members have expresseddiscomfort with their mission, feeling it drags them into a politically charged domestic power struggle.“The sentiment across the board right now is that deploying military force against our own communities isn’t the kind of national security we signed up for,” said Sarah Streyder of the Secure Families Initiative, which advocates for military families. “Families are scared not just for their loved ones’ safety, although that’s a big concern, but also for what their service is being used to justify.”Chris Purdy of the Chamberlain Network echoed those concerns: “Morale is not great, is the quote I keep hearing,” he said, citing multiple national guard members who contacted his organization.Amid the ongoing legal and political fallout, arrests have continued, although sporadic incidents of early looting have subsided. Jose Manuel Mojica, a 30-year-old father of four, wascharged with assaulting a federal officerduring a protest in Paramount, a community in southern Los Angeles County.And on Thursday, Alex Padilla, a Democratic US senator for California and vocal critic of theTrump administration’s immigration polices, was forcibly removed and handcuffed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held byKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, inLos Angeles.Invideo takenof the incident that has since gone viral on social media, Padilla is seen being restrained and removed from the room by Secret Service and FBI agents. He warned that if this was how he was dealt with it spoke ill for ordinary civilians being summarily arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Most Republican national lawmakers criticized Padilla, although some Republican senators condemned his treatment, while Democrats overwhelmingly applauded his challenge to the administration and were appalled at his removal.Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesUS politicsProtestDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I’m immensely proud and it’s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”He had been on the verge of receiving a knighthood in 2014 but HM Revenue and Customs placed a red flag on his nomination due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme, according to previous reports. In 2021 it was reported that his finances had been cleared and he was now eligible.Daltrey, 81, who launched the Teenage Cancer Trust’s Royal Albert Hall concerts, said he felt “very humbled” to be made a knight for services to charity and music and would be celebrating with “a bottle of plonk”. He said: “It’s a dream come true for me, but it’s especially a dream because the charity means so much.”Oldman, 67, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, is recognised for services to drama.Barker, 82, said the bedrock of the awards were those who devoted long hours for free to what they believed in for the benefit of others, “and knights and dames are just cherries on the top of that cake. I am happy to be a cherry.”Gormley becomes a Companion of Honour alongside the astrophysicist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, 81.

So doClaudia Winklemanand her Strictly colleague Tess Daly. Winkleman said: “I am ridiculously lucky and will celebrate with Tess by doing a pasodoble.” Daly said: “I didn’t see it coming, and it almost didn’t happen, because the letter went to the wrong address.” Luckily, she said, “it ended well”.Georgia Harrison, 30, who has starred in The Only Way is Essex and Love Island, receives an MBE for hercampaigning on violence against women and girlsafter becoming a victim of “revenge porn”. She said: “It means the world to have this kind of recognition, not just for me but for all the survivors who’ve been through what I have.”Tracy-Ann Oberman, who has also been in EastEnders and played Auntie Val in the Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner, has been made an MBE for services to Holocaust education and combating antisemitism.View image in fullscreenCaroline, Duncan and Jenna Speirs of Calum’s Cabin.Photograph: James Manning/PAFor the first time, three family members have been named in the same honours list. Jenna Speirs and her parents, Caroline and Duncan Speirs, from the Isle of Bute, each receive a British Empire Medal (BEM) for their charity Calum’s Cabin, started after Jenna’s twin brother Calum died of a brain tumour aged 12. The charity helps thousands of people each year, providing holiday homes and Glasgow flats for families of children facing cancer to spend time together during treatment.Anti-knife crime campaigners recognised include Pooja Kanda, who said she felt “overwhelmed” after being made an OBE forpressing for changes in the lawafter her 16-year-old son Ronan was murdered with a ninja sword near his Wolverhampton home in 2022. Alison Madgin, 60, and her daughter Carly Barrett, 34, are made MBEs for setting up Samantha’s Legacy after their daughter and sister Samantha, 18, was stabbed to death in Wallsend in 2007. Barrett said the award was bittersweet: “We’ve had to lose Samantha to get these honours.”The king has personally recognised the queen’s GP, Dr Nicholas Hugh, who has the title apothecary to the queen, and Ranan Dasgupta, the sergeant-surgeon to the royal medical household, making both lieutenants of the Royal Victorian Order, honours that are in the gift of the sovereign and bestowed independently of Downing Street to people who have served the royal family.Dasgupta, a consultant urologist at King Edward VII’s hospital in London, specialises in a number of areas including treating prostate disease and kidney stones, and was working in the role of sergeant-surgeon when in January 2024 Charles underwent a procedure on an enlarged prostate, during which time his cancer – not affecting his prostate – was discovered.The oldest person on the list is 106-year-old William Irwin, a veteran and founder of Coleraine Winemakers Club, who receives a BEM. Carmela Chillery-Watson, 11, who has LMNA congenital muscular dystrophy, becomes the youngest ever MBE, for her fundraising for Muscular Dystrophy UK.Of the 1,215 people receiving an award, 48% are women and 11% are from minority ethnic backgrounds.Explore more on these topicsKing's birthday honours listGary OldmanRoger DaltreyDavid BeckhamAntony GormleyPat BarkerPenny MordauntnewsShareReuse this content"

She died in January of suspected lung cancer.Photograph: Family handout/PANHSSenior health figure accuses NHS of racism over care given to dying motherVictor Adebowale says failure to detect his mother’s cancer was example of ‘black service, not NHS service’Denis CampbellHealth policy editorFri 13 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTShareA senior figure in the health service has criticised it for deep-seated racism after his mother “got a black service, not anNHSservice” before she died.Victor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, claimed his mother Grace’s lung cancer went undiagnosed because black people get “disproportionately poor” health service care.The NHS’s failure to detect her cancer while she was alive shows that patients experience “two different services”, based on the colour of their skin, Adebowale said.His mother, Grace Amoke Owuren Adebowale, a former NHS nurse, died in January aged 92. He highlighted her care and death during his speech this week at the NHS Confederation’s annual conference as an example of “persistent racial inequalities in NHS services”.His remarks prompted fresh concern about the stark differences between the care received by those from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds and white people.“My mum, who worked for many years as a nurse, died earlier this year at the age of 92. It was difficult. It was not the dignified death that we would have wanted for her,” Adebowale told an audience of NHS bosses.“It wasn’t the death she deserved. So it makes me clear about the need to address the inequity. I think she got a black service, not an NHS service.”View image in fullscreenVictor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, said black people get ‘disproportionately poor’ health service care at the body’s annual conference.Photograph: NHS ConfedExpo/PAHe castigated the NHS for not having done enough to improve care for black patients, despitemounting evidence of their much higher risk of poorer outcomes, including dying.Referencing “the experiences that people who look like me continue to receive”, he added: “It just hasn’t got any better. It is not acceptable that someone who looks like me on average waits 20 minutes longer in A&E than white patients.”Speaking to journalists afterwards, Adebowale said: “Why did I do it [refer to his mother’s ‘black service’]? Because I’m sick of it not changing, like everybody else. My mum, I think, God bless her, I think she would have wanted me to say it.“[I am sick of] the disproportionately poor services that too many poor people and too many black people experience–that’s what I’m sick of.“You only have to look at the stats. You just see the stats across all the major disease categories we talk about. Black people have a worse experience and worse outcomes. We’ve known that for years. I’m not saying anything new. My mother is an episodic example of a systemic problem.”Adebowale spent six years as a non-executive director on the board of NHSEnglandand is a former chief executive of the addiction and mental health charity Turning Point.He and his family are still trying to find out why their mother’s cancer was only identified by an autopsy after she died after arriving “in a poor condition” at A&E at a hospital in England he did not name. Not knowing at the time why she had died made her death even harder for the family, he said. His mother – who came to work in the NHS from Nigeria – never smoked, he added.“We’ve only recently found out [about the lung cancer]. It made me angry, because how can you live for that long with something that a lot of people [did not spot]?“She died of lung cancer and by definition [a diagnosis being made] anytime earlier than when she died would have been good. She clearly wasn’t picked up by any screening as far as I know. Her medical records I’ve seen show that nothing indicated that she had cancer anywhere. That was poor care, wasn’t it?”Research has found that:Black British mothers are up to four times more likely to die during pregnancy or within six weeks of giving birth than white mothers.Those of black and African or Caribbean origin are twice as likely to have a stroke, and younger, than white counterparts.Black African patients are two and a half times more likely to be detained under the MentalHealthAct than white British patients.Kate Seymour, Macmillan Cancer Support’s head of external affairs, said: “Stories like Grace Amoke Owuren Adebowale’s highlight the heartbreaking reality for some when it comes to accessing cancer care in this country. Research shows that people from ethnically diverse backgrounds in England wait longer on average to be diagnosed for several types of cancer.“It is categorically unacceptable that some people with cancer are having worse experiences simply because of who they are or where they live.”Prof Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHSRaceand Health Observatory, said Adebowale’s remarks about his mother’s death should lead to change.“Sadly, black communities and families continue to experience many shortfalls in care, treatment and outcomes. They often face additional trauma at multiple stages of the life course,” he said.“We thank Victor for the candour in sharing his personal testimony and expect these insights to lead to learning and action from healthcare providers to improve the quality of patient care.”NHS England has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthRaceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The crimes took place in filthy flats, on rancid mattresses, in cars, car parks, alleyways, disused warehouses and on moors, the court was told.The prosecutor Rossano Scamardella KC told a jury at Manchester Minshull Street crown court that the crimes happened “under the noses of social workers and others who should have done far more to protect them”.After a four-month trial and three weeks of deliberation a jury on Friday returned unanimous guilty verdicts for 50 offences committed between 2001 and 2006.After the verdicts DCI Guy Laycock, the senior investigating officer on the case, paid tribute to the survivors, known throughout the trial as girl A and girl B.“They have been pivotal in bringing these abusers to long-awaited justice by bravely giving painful and difficult testimony during a four-month trial,” he said. “Without them this would not be possible and today is about them.“These seven men preyed on vulnerability for their own depraved sexual gain. The men abused, degraded and then discarded the victims when they were just children. This horrific abuse knew no limits, despite their denials throughout this lengthy investigation and court case.“They had a callous disregard for these women when they were girls, and continue to show no remorse for their unforgivable actions all these years later.”Three of the abusers, Mohammed Zahid, 64, Mushtaq Ahmed, 67, and Kasir Bashir, 50 – all born in Pakistan – were stallholders at Rochdale’s indoor market.Zahid, a father of three who was known as Boss or Bossman, gave free underwear from his lingerie stall to both girls, as well as money, alcohol and food and in return expected them to have regular sex with him and his friends.View image in fullscreenMohammed Zahid.Photograph: GMP/PAZahid was jailed for five yearsin 2016 as part of an earlier grooming gang case. He was found guilty of sexual assault of a child after he engaged in sexual activity in 2006 with a 15-year-old girl who he met when she visited his stall to buy tights for school.Bashir did not attend the 2025 trial and jurors were ordered not to speculate why. It can be revealed that he absconded while on bail before the trial began.It can also be reported that co-defendants Mohammed Shahzad, 44, Naheem Akram, 48, and Nisar Hussain, 41, had their bail revoked and were remanded in custody in January before the jury was sworn in.Police received intelligence that the three Rochdale-born taxi drivers were planning to leave the UK and had paid a deposit for their transport, the court heard.All three denied the accusation but the judge Jonathan Seely said the court was not prepared to take the risk that they too would abscond.A seventh defendant, Pakistani-bornRoheez Khan, 39, was also convicted in a previous Rochdale grooming trial. In 2013 he was one of five men convicted of sexually exploiting a “profoundly vulnerable” 15-year-old girl in 2008 and 2009. He was jailed for six-and-a-half years for engaging in sexual activity with a child and witness intimidation.View image in fullscreenRoheez Khan.Photograph: GMP/PAGirl A told the jury she could have been targeted by more than 200 offenders but said “there was that many it was hard to keep count”.The trial heard that social workers in Rochdale had labelled girl B a “prostitute” from the age of 10.Giving evidence, she said social workers raised concerns with her that she may be having sex with Asian men. “They said I was a prostitute. I was prostituting myself … I don’t remember them being concerned enough to do anything about it.“I remember knowing that they knew what was going on.”All the perpetrators were prosecuted as part of Operation Lytton, an investigation that has been running since 2015 byGreater Manchesterpolice into non-recent child sexual exploitation in Rochdale.Thirty-seven individuals have been charged so far, with five more trials scheduled to take place from September onwards.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

No 10 and government sources strongly denied this.A senior government source said plans were being drawn up for new ministerial appointments in case any frontbenchers resign to vote against the cuts. No 10 is said to be keen on rewarding new MPs who have made an impressionsince the general election a year ago.The government plans to introduce a bill next week that will contain its welfare changes – including controversial cuts to disability benefits.Government figures say that concessions by Kendall this week have won over some would-be rebels. The Guardian reported Kendall would put“non-negotiable” protections for the most vulnerable benefits recipientsin the legislation.Under the changes, people with less than 12 months to live and those with lifelong conditions would automatically get a higher rate of universal credit and would be exempt from reassessments, which usually take place every three years.Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of people who will no longer qualify forpersonal independence payments (Pip)under the changes will continue to receive payments for 13 weeks, instead of the usual four.But some MPs are unmoved by the changes. One seniorLabourbackbencher said: “This so-called olive branch is completely meaningless and won’t have persuaded a single Labour MP, many of whom are really concerned for the impact on disabled people in their constituencies. These reforms were rushed through with no proper impact assessment and the government has to go back to the drawing board.”The government’s proposed cuts to Pip, a benefit intended to help disabled people with their quality of life and unconnected to employment, havecaused uproar in the parliamentary Labour party. About 170 Labour MPs are said to have communicated their concerns to the government.Government sources say the number of prospective rebels has fallen as a result of Kendall’s concessions as well as ministers’ openness to scrapping the two-child benefit cap and the Conservatives’ decision to vote against the bill.Under the proposed changes, claimants would qualify for Pip only if they score a minimum of four points on a single daily living activity. Assessments score from 0 to 12 the difficulty that claimants face in a range of living activities such as preparing and eating food, communicating, washing and getting dressed.More than 370,000 people stand to lose their payments, while another 430,000 who would have qualified would no longer be eligible. On average these people will lose £4,500 a year.The government has arguedthe welfare system needs dramatic reform, with 1,000 new people a day making claims. Even with the cuts, Pip payments will continue to rise: an extra 750,000 people will receive payments by the end of this parliament.Explore more on these topicsWelfareBenefitsUniversal creditLiz KendallLabourDisabilitynewsShareReuse this content"

Both men appeared in court on Friday, nearly two years after police were called to Blackpool Victoria hospital, where the one-year-old died on 27 July 2023.Preston was taken into care by Oldham council six days after he was born, theBlackpool Gazettereported. After spending some time in foster care, a court order allowed him to be placed for adoption and he was moved to Blackpool on 3 April 2023. He died barely three months later.Varley spoke only to confirm his identity during the five-minute hearing at Lancaster magistrates court. The defendant is also accused of one count of manslaughter, two counts of assault by penetration of a child, five counts of child cruelty, one count of inflicting grievous bodily harm and one count of sexual assault of a child.He is further accused of 10 counts of taking indecent photographs of a child, one count of distributing indecent photographs of a child, two counts of possessing indecent pseudo-images of a child and one count of possession of an extreme pornographic image.Varley was teaching at South Shore academy, run by the Cidari multi-academy trust in Blackpool, when he was arrested in 2023. School records show that at various times he was head of years 9, 10 and 11.In a statement, the trust said: “Our thoughts are with the family of Preston Davey and all those affected by this case.”It said South Shore academy was run by Bright Futures Education Trust at the time of Varley’s arrest and he was immediately suspended while the police investigation was under way.His suspension continued when the academy was later transferred to Cidari Multi Academy Trust. “During this time he has not been permitted on to, or attended, school premises, or been permitted to contact pupils or colleagues.”The trust said senior leaders and specialist staff had been providing support to colleagues and pupils at the academy on Friday. It added: “Following the decision to charge Mr Varley, and the nature of those charges, Cidari is now considering its position in relation to Mr Varley’s employment.“This will be done in consultation with other agencies and within the relevant legislation and statutory.”McGowan-Fazakerley is charged with allowing the death of a child, two counts of child cruelty and one of sexual assault of a child. The defendant confirmed his identity and was also remanded into custody.All the charges for both men, spanning March to July 2023, relate to Preston. Both men, from Grimsargh, near Preston, will appear at Preston crown court on Monday.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The storms could lead to road flooding, difficult driving conditions, power cuts and flooding of homes and businesses.Katharine Smith, the flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Environment Agency teams have ensured rivers and watercourses are clear ahead of the storms and stand ready to support local authorities in their response to surface water flooding.“We urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.”Yellow thunderstorm warnings are in place for much of southern and south-western England and Wales between Friday afternoon and midnight. Another warning is in place across eastern and southernScotlandfrom midnight to 6pm on Saturday, with northern and south-western England and Wales also affected.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandWalesScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Asked how his grandfather might have reacted to the pass being reinstated, he said: “He’d probably say ‘about time too’.”The decision to revoke the pass is recorded in board minutes in 1895, when homosexuality was illegal: “The Trustees directed that Mr Oscar Wilde, admitted as a reader in 1879 and sentenced at the Central Criminal Court on 25th May to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour, be excluded from future use of the Museum’s Reading Room.”View image in fullscreenOscar Wilde in 1882.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveWilde’s downfall followed his decision to sue Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being a “sodomite” after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas, was Wilde’s lover. It led to Wilde being sentenced to two years of hard labour.Having been the toast of London society, Wilde died in abject poverty in Paris in 1900, aged 46. After his disgrace and imprisonment, his wife, Constance, fled to Europe with their two sons, Cyril and Vyvyan, and changed their surname to Holland, an ancestral family name.Holland said: “Oscar had been in Pentonville prison for three weeks when his [pass] to theBritish MuseumReading Room [now the British Library] was cancelled, so he wouldn’t have known about it, which was probably as well … It would have just added to his misery to feel that one of the world’s great libraries had banned him from books just as the law had banned him from daily life. But the restitution of his ticket is a lovely gesture of forgiveness and I’m sure his spirit will be touched.”In 2017, Wilde was assumed to be among more than 50,000 gay and bisexual men who were posthumously pardoned, although the Ministry of Justice said no individuals would be named.Holland said: “Oscar didn’t think there was anything wrong in same-sex love … I’m not absolutely certain he has been pardoned … If I had to ask for a pardon, I wouldn’t, because all it would do is make the British establishment feel better about itself … History’s history, and you can’t start rewriting it.”The British Library boasts arguably the world’s most significant collection of Wilde manuscripts, including drafts of his major plays, Lady Windermere’s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest.Laura Walker, the British Library’s lead curator of modern archives and manuscripts, said this extraordinary collection makes Wilde’s pass all the more meaningful: “We really want to honour Wilde now and acknowledge what happened to him. Section 11 of the law, which related to the criminalisation of homosexuality, was unjust.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But he was not afraid to criticise the institution. When he published his long poem The Sphinx, he was asked why he had printed only a few copies. He replied: “My first idea was to print only three copies: one for myself, one for the British Museum, and one for Heaven. I had some doubt about the British Museum.”Holland joked that Wilde was “setting heaven and himself above the British Museum in a teasingly arrogant way” – a “slightly naughty throwaway remark about a very august institute, exactly the sort of thing that he would have regarded as being slightly stuffy and conventional”.He added: “He probably would [be] obliged now to make an apology … on … his rude remark … once they’d given him his pass back.”The British Library event – on 16 October, Wilde’s birthday – will include a public talk by Everett and Holland, launching the latter’s new book,After Oscar: The Legacy of a Scandal, an account of Wilde’s posthumous life.Explore more on these topicsOscar WildeBritish LibraryBritish MuseumLibrariesShareReuse this content"

A huge blast at around 4am had gutted two upper levels, showering debris into the street below.It soon became clear why this particular floor on this particular block had been selected by Israeli military planners. It was the home ofAli Shamkhani, one of the country’s most senior security officials and a close aide of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.View image in fullscreenAli Shamkhani, pictured in 2018.Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesInitial reports said Shamkhani, who is also a key negotiator in ongoing indirect talks with the US over Iran’s nuclear programme, was injured. But by mid-morning it was announced that the 69 year old had been killed.By then, it was clear thatIsrael’s attack was on a much greater scalethan anyone had previously envisaged. Dozens of other targets in and around Tehran had been hit by warplanes. Across the capital, buildings were burning, with gaping blackened holes where flats had existed hours before.Othertop officialshad been killed in this first wave of strikes, including Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, and Maj Gen Hossein Salami, the head of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who died in an attack on the IRGC’s headquarters.Other casualties included officials in charge of Iran’s nuclear programme and its ballistic missile arsenal, including two well-known scientists. There were reports of further deaths and injuries, possibly among members of the dead men’s families, though no confirmed numbers.Golnar, a resident of Saadat Abad, northern Tehran, was asleep when blasts woke her just after 3am.“I woke up to the first explosion and rushed to the windows to check. Then minutes later I heard four explosions back to back … The windows were shaking and people in the building started screaming,” Golnar told the Guardian.“We knew from social media that tensions were heightened between Israel and the regime, but we were not told by the authorities that we must prepare. Everything happened so quickly. We were scrambling for information on whether this was an attack or a natural disaster,” she said.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in Tehran.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA human rights activist living near Shahr Ara Street in Tehran described “total chaos in the residential areas”.“Traffic jams and clueless crowds are still trying to make sense of what’s happening,” they said. “Smoke is still billowing from residential streets and there’s debris around homes. The sky is red and we fear there will be more attacks,” they said.1:03Iranian TV shows aftermath of Israeli strikes on Tehran – videoElsewhere in Iran, people were also waking up to destruction.Drivers could see plumes of oily black smoke pouring from the major nuclear facility ofNatanz,200 miles (320km) south of Tehran. Residents of the north-western city of Tabriz ran for shelter as several targets were hit. Others cowered as missiles slammed into a suspected nuclear site in the central city of Arak and amid blasts at air defence missile bases in Kermanshah, close to the border with Iraq.There were strikes in Hamadan province, where a long-range radar facility appeared to have been badly damaged; and at Piranshahr, in West Azerbaijan Province, a launch site for ballistic missiles was hit.For many Iranians, often unaware they are living next to critical military or nuclear infrastructure, the attacks prompted great fear.Among those opposed to the regime, the attacks prompted excitement, even jubilation.An emergency unit doctor in Tehran said mid-morning that no civilian casualties had been brought into his hospital so far.“Some of us in the emergency units have to cancel any planned leaves, and hospitals have been put on high alert. My elderly father woke up to loud explosions in western Tehran. He called me with a trembling voice, and for the past six months we have lived in fear that tensions will escalate,” the doctor said.Israel has said the attacks were just the opening salvo of a much broader offensive, which could continues for days, or even weeks.“We are already dealing with a dire economic crisis,” the human rights activist said. “We are stocking up on food and supplies which are already expensive. Where do we even flee to if attacked again today? We don’t have bomb shelters like the Israelis do and we can’t flee to Iraq or Afghanistan. We are stuck.”Azadeh, a resident of Vanak, said everyday Iranians had not asked for this war.“Around 3.40am, the explosion sounds started getting louder and louder. It got very frightening. There were loud screams across the streets. The explosion was near the main square which is scary.“However, [after] the news that IRGC commanders were killed and not civilians, some of us are happy about it. The mullahs are responsible for any civilian deaths that may occur this time,” Azadeh said.Though images of the aftermath of strikes suggested there were at least some casualties among the families and neighbours of targeted individuals, the overall death toll was unclear. Iranian state media were reported to have given an unofficial total of at least 78 people killed and more than 300 injured in Tehran.Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said most of the damage from strikes targeting its Natanz facility was at ground level and there had been “no casualties” there.0:43Footage captures moment Iran's Natanz nuclear site is hit by Israel – videoSome analysts say the attacks will prompt people to rally behind the regime, but others argue that Iran’s inability to either protect its own senior officials and infrastructure or, so far, strike back effectively will damage its credibility among the wider population.None of the 100 armed drones reportedly launched by Iran at Israel on Friday reached their targets, Israeli officials said. Iran’s state news agency denied any such attempted attack.Journalists in Iran told the Guardian they had been instructed not to share any news, images and videos on social media by the authorities, and editors had been warned off reposting phone footage from witnesses to the strikes.“The only videos shared should be [emphasising] how devastating Israel’s attacks were on the innocent people,” said a reporter in Karaj, west of Tehran. “The problem with this is, there are no ground reports for now that civilians were killed or seriously injured. The [authorities] don’t want to look weak in front of radical supporters. Only the state media’s assigned reporters are allowed on the explosion sites.”Israel has said its attack was essentialbecause Iran was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Iran has repeatedly denied such intentions, saying it wants nuclear energy only for civilian purposes, and has publicly rejected Washington’s demand to scrap enrichment, describing it as an attack on its national sovereignty.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he hoped the attacks would trigger the downfall of Iran’s theocracy, and that his message to the Iranian people was that Israel’s fight was not with them, but with the “brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years”.Khamenei said in a statement after the first strikes that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and thatit would face “a bitter fate”.The human rights activist in Tehran said ordinary people would “bear the consequences of anything that happens in the next hours and days”.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is characterised by progressive loss of language and changes in personality and behaviour.View image in fullscreenLead scientist Andrea Martorana filtering solution in the lab.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianMost cases are diagnosed in people aged 45 to 65, but it can affect those in their 20s and 30s. There are an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 people living with FTD in the UK, and between 1 million and 2 million in the world.Rowe says: “It’s a double-edged sword: the young onset, the high genetic burden and rapid illness are also features that perhaps make it more tractable to treat.”The Die Hard and Pulp Fiction actor Bruce Willis, who recently celebrated his 70th birthday, was diagnosed two years ago with FTD, which his family described as a “cruel disease”. They have not said whether he has a genetic form of FTD.The gene therapy developed by AviadoBio, which was spun out of Prof Christopher Shaw’s research lab at King’s College London in 2021, targets a type of FTD known as FTD-GRN. This is caused by mutations of a gene that lead to a deficiency of progranulin (GRN), a protein that is essential for maintaining healthy brain cells.AviadoBio, which employs 60 people, signed anexclusive licence agreement with the Japanese pharmaceutical firm Astellaslast October to develop the therapy. It is now recruiting patients for its clinical trial in the UK, as well as the US, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the Netherlands.The infusion was administered in Warsaw in March 2024 in one of six patients who have had the treatment so far, in Poland and the US. All patients will be followed for up to five years as part of the trial. AviadoBio expects to publish the first data next year.View image in fullscreenJulia and Jessica Crawford.Three years ago, Jessica Crawford, from Beverley in East Yorkshire, lost her mother, Julia, to FTD, caused by mutations of another gene, C9orf72. In 2014, when Julia was 58, her behaviour changed; the family suspected depression. Previously very sociable, she stopped going out and started playing games such as Candy Crush or watching TV shows “over and over”, her daughter recounts.Her mother initially did not want to see a doctor, and was only diagnosed with FTD in February 2019. By this time she was so confused she once put raw chicken in a sandwich. “Getting the diagnosis wasn’t easy because FTD wasn’t well known; my mum was acing in the memory tests,” Jessica says.Julia became increasingly confused and lost the ability to speak, and then to communicate at all. Jessica became her full-time carer in 2020, but her mother deteriorated so much that she had to enter a care home in late 2021, and died the following year.Jessica, 33, found out she also carries the gene mutation, and with her husband decided to conceive through IVF with a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis. When their five embryos were screened, four had the gene mutation, and the fifth resulted in the birth of their son. The couple donated their other four embryos to science and she takes part in GENFI – a long-running UK-led global study of families with FTD across 40 sites.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

ALS, the most common form of motor neurone disease, has also been linked to mutations of the GRN gene and leads to muscle weakness, paralysis and eventually death.Shaw acts as the company’s chief scientific and clinical adviser, and while the Lees are no longer involved in the firm’s research, all three remain shareholders.David Cooper, AviadoBio’s chief medical officer, says: “It was something that hit me when I first joined the company, [when] you look at the MRI scans of patients with a GRN mutation, the frontal and temporal parts of their brain are just melting away … So we really need earlier treatment, an earlier diagnosis and a more organised healthcare approach to deal with it.”View image in fullscreenDavid Cooper shows Robin the skull with placements for the cannula during surgery.Photograph: Alicia Canter/The GuardianAviadoBio’s lead product, AVB-101, is infused directly into the brain by a neurosurgeon using a cannula as thin as a strand of angel hair pasta, during a 90-minute procedure guided by MRI. It delivers a functional copy of the progranulin gene to restore appropriate levels of the protein to affected areas of the brain. It is a one-off treatment, and no immunosuppressant drugs are needed afterwards.Surgeons operating on a patient.Photograph: AviadoBio“The patients who have FTD are born with almost half of the progranulin levels that you and I might have,” says the chief executive, Lisa Deschamps. “Our goal in the study is to supplement the GRN gene and restore as much progranulin in these individuals as possible to normal levels to reduce the neurodegeneration effect.”Other medications in development around the world include two gene therapies, from Philadelphia-based Passage Bio and Eli Lilly-owned Prevail Therapeutics, but they do not target the thalamus, the “relay station” in the brain. Passage Bio’s therapies are delivered directly to the cerebrospinal fluid in a single treatment. Denmark’sVesper Bio has developed an oral capsule, designed to act on the GRN gene, that is being trialled at University College London hospital.AviadoBio, whose investors include Johnson & Johnson’s innovation arm and the UK not-for-profit LifeArc Ventures, is part of agrowing life science cluster in Canary Wharf. At its labs, scientists – assisted by robotics – research how to target a particular gene.“The UK has real strengths in this area,” says Rowe, pointing to the international GENFI study, run since 2011 by Prof Jonathan Rohrer, a neurologist from UCL Queen Square Institute of Neurology who also sits on AviadoBio’s scientific advisory board. “It’s a real win for the UK.”Explore more on these topicsDementiaMedical researchPharmaceuticals industryHealthMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The brothers had been travelling home after visiting family in India.Dr Prateek Joshi, Komi Vyas and three young children; twin boys Nakul and Pradyut, aged five, and daughter, Miraya, eightJoshi, who worked at the Royal Derby hospital, is believed to have been travelling back from India, where his wife and children were based.View image in fullscreenPrateek Joshi was a radiologist at the Royal Derby hospital.Photograph: UHDB/PAThe Derby Hindu Temple paid tribute to the family on its Facebook page, saying: “Dr Joshi [and his family] were devotees of our Mandir and supported us through their sincere service and dedication.”Neil Ryan, who lived next door to them for two years, also described them as “the nicest family”.Akeel Nanabawa, Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter, Sara, fourAkeel Nanabawa, 36, lived in Gloucester.The businessman built up a recruitment company, Rec2go, before establishing Iceberg Recruitment Services. The company’s head office is in Gloucester but it also has a branch in Ahmedabad, its website states.His business partner, Shoyeb Khan Nagori, told MailOnline: “I had dinner with them last night. They were a lovely family and Akeel and his wife were extremely successful people.”View image in fullscreenAkeel Nanabawa, his wife, Hannaa, and their four-year-old daughter, Sara.Photograph: PAVorajee, 30, a trained midwife, was the head of finance at Rec2go.In a statement paying tribute to the family, their imam, Abdullah Samad, said: “Together, [Nanabawa and Vorajee] were committed advocates for humanitarian causes – particularly the suffering of innocent Palestinians and the urgent need for accessible medical care in parts of India.“They were widely loved and deeply respected. His quiet generosity, her warmth and kindness and their daughter’s bright, joyful spirit made a lasting impact on everyone who knew them.”Their neighbour Safeer Shah, 47, said the family had been on holiday in Malaysia and Indonesia before heading to the Gujarat state of India to surprise Nanabawa’s father for Eid al-Adha festivities.The family had moved from Newport, south Wales, about 10 years ago. Nanabawa travelled to India regularly for business, he added.Nanabawa had three brothers who lived in the Tredworth area of Gloucestershire, as well as his mother, Shah said. “They had plans for the future,” he said.Next-door neighbours Henry and Ros Rickards, who have lived in the street for about 30 years, said the family were the best neighbours. “Sara was the loveliest girl; she loved our dog,” said Ros. “The dog never barked at her – she was so lovely. She was a gorgeous little girl.”Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-MeekFiongal, 39, and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, 45, ran the Wellness Foundry in south London and Ramsgate, Kent, a business offering psychic readings, tarot, reiki and yoga, and had partnered with major brands such as Netflix, Google and Dior.The couple married in 2022, with Jamie praising his “wonderful husband” in a Facebook post, and thanking him for “keeping me calm in times of stress (sunshine after the rain)”. He added that his heart was “so full of love and gratitude”.View image in fullscreenFiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek.Photograph: FacebookA former fashion designer, Fiongal founded the Wellness Foundry in late 2018 after experiencing a spiritual awakening following a mysterious illness, according to its website.His husband, a former professional dancer, joined the team in March 2023 as co-director and head of events. He also offered psychic readings and life coaching. Both were alumni of the College of Psychic Studies.The couple were returning home after a 10-day wellness retreat. The couple captured the happy time they had in India in a series of social media posts, including getting henna tattoos, shopping for fine fabrics and other gifts and driving through chaotic traffic in a tuk-tuk.They arrived in Ahmedabad just a day before flying back. Fiongal had posted in a video: “So, it’s our last night in India and we’ve had a magical experience. Some mind-blowing things have happened. We are going to put all this together and create a vlog. It’s my first ever vlog about the whole trip and we want to share it.”In the airport before takeoff, the pair filmed a video of themselves joking before the 10-hour flight back to London. Fiongal said the pair were “going back happily, happily, happily calm”.Adam and Hasina Taju and their son-in-law, Altafhusen PatelAdam Taju, 72, and his 70-year-old wife, Hasina, were flying with their son-in-law, Altafhusen Patel, 51, who lives in London with his wife.The couple’s granddaughter, Ammaarah Taju, spoke of her shock and disbelief at her parents’ home in Blackburn. She said her father, Altaf Taju, had driven to London to be with his sister as they received updates about the crash from Air India and government officials.Javed and Mariam Syed, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, fourJaved Ali Syed, a hotel manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia hotel in London, and his wife, Mariam, were travelling with their children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four.

Mariam worked at Harrods.View image in fullscreenThe Syed family.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersHardik Avaiya and Vibhooti PatelFriends of the couple, who lived in the the Belgrave area of Leicester, told Leicestershire Live of their shock at losing two people they described as “lovely”.Margi, 30, a close friend, said: “It’s devastating. They were very good people. I can’t believe it’s happened.”Margi said she knew Avaiya, 27, and Patel, 28, through her husband, who had been travelling to Gatwick airport to collect the couple when he learned of the crash. She said: “My husband was on his way to pick them up yesterday from Gatwick but halfway he got the news.”Avaiya worked with Margi’s husband, where they had built a close friendship over several years, she said. “The couple were also active members of their local temple community, where they were known for their kindness and generosity,” she added. Avaiya also volunteered at the temple.Raxa Modha, her daughter-in-law, Yasha Kamdar, and her two-year-old grandson, RudraRaxa Modha, 55, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and her two-year-old grandson, Rudra, were believed to have been flying back to England for a cremation and memorial service for Modha’s late husband.Modha had been in India for some time, fulfilling the dying wish of her husband, Kishor, who had wanted to live out his last days in his homeland. He died there in April. They were returning to the UK to organise a prayer meeting later this month at the Highfield community centre in Wellingborough.The couple, who ran an Indian food catering firm called Pooja Caterers, had three children and one grandchild. It thought that Kishan, Modha’s son, was taking another flight home.View image in fullscreenRaxa Modha.Photograph: Social mediaSpeaking to MailOnline, a family friend said: “It’s incredibly sad, the whole family is already grieving Kishor’s death.”Jaya Tailor, who lives in Wellingborough, said she knew Modha personally and that she was “a real people’s person”.“She helped her husband build a business,” she said. “She loved having people around her. She was kind, generous [and] loving.”Dhir and Heer BaxiThe sisters, in their 20s, were on their way back to London after having made a surprise trip to visit their grandmother for her birthday.Dhir was doing a degree in fashion design while Heer worked as a product manager in the investment and renewable energy sector.The Baxis’ elder brother, Ishan, told the Telegraph: “I can’t express what my complete family is going through – shell-shocked … is what I can say right now.“Both had a natural aura of helping and always cared about family values. They both had aspirations to be successful enough to roam around the world, tension-free. Along with their parents, they both had a proclivity towards modernisation without changing traditional values.“Both my sisters know what is right and what is wrong, thus whatever work they carried out, in academics or fashion, they always got success with no conflicts amongst peers or seniors.”Renjitha Gopakumaran NairRenjitha Gopakumaran Nair was returning to the UK after a holiday to see family in her home country. The nurse and mother had just left her job at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is thought to have been in the UK for a year.Her former colleagues at the NHS hospital said she was a “beautiful lady” who showed her patients and co-workers “so much love and care”.Gopakumaran, said to be in her 40s, “had the biggest heart and brightest smile”, one former colleague said.Arjunbhai PatoliyaArjunbhai Patoliya, 37, had travelled to India from London to scatter the ashes of his late wife, Bharatiben Patel, in a river in the village that they both grew up in. She had died just three weeks earlier from cancer.The pair are survived by their two daughters,eight and four years old. The children had been left with Patel’s sister while their father flew to Vadiya in Gujarat. A close friend and neighbour of Patoliya told the Telegraph: “He is just like my son. He was a nice person, a very nice person. It’s an accident. I don’t know what to say, I’m speechless – such a lovely neighbour. He was such a lovely character, he looked after me as well from time to time.”Patoliya was a furniture designer and was described by the neighbour as being a “family” person who was very active in the community.Sayedmiya and Nafisabanu Inayatali, and their son, Waqueeali, 25, and daughter, Taskin, 22Sayedmiya Inayatali, 48, had flown over to India to visit his 90-year-old mother with his wife, Nafisabanu, 46, and their children.Shahid Vhora, 52, a relative, had texted the family before the flight to let them know he would pick them up at Gatwick when they arrived.He told Metro: “I can’t believe this has happened. I was preparing to pick them up. They had been visiting Sayedmiya’s mother.“They took a picture as they were about to board. They were so happy to be coming home … When I received the news of the crash I was devastated. We are a very close family, we all live together. My life has been torn apart.”Sayedmiya was an IT programmer who lived in Wembley with his family. Vhora described the family as “perfect” and very hardworking, adding that Taskin was studying to be a doctor and Waqueeali had been working in IT like his father.He said: “Sayedmiya and myself did everything together. We have had so many happy times. Now I have to go to India to try to sort things out.”Adnan MasterAdnan Master, 30, was visiting relatives in India with his wife and child. It is understood he was travelling back to London by himself; his family live in Forest Hill.A friend of Master told the Telegraph that he was “probably one of the nicest guys you’d ever meet”. They added that he had two jobs, both as a delivery driver and working in a DIY shop in east London.They said: “He was just one of the hardest-working people you’d ever meet. He just didn’t stop, and everything he did was for his family. Everything he spoke about was for his family: ‘I want to make my child have a good life.’”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

I’ve not done so to settle old scores but because I want to settle old scores. A chance to relive broken friendships, dirty deals and to unconsciously act out my passive-aggressive fantasies on my ex-husband. In taking myself down I will take down most of those around me. Put simply, I am the former Westminster Wag with no fucks left to give.It is still dark when I open my eyes. It’s the early morning of Friday, 24 June 2016. My phone rings. It’s one of the special advisers. “We’ve won,” he says. “Gosh,” I reply. I had better wake Michael up. Michael had gone to bed early the previous night having drunk two-thirds of a jeroboam of claret.I think of Michael’s team frantically debating what to do next, as they had forgotten to make a plan for what they might do if Vote Leave won the referendum. So easily done. I think of the day before when I went to vote wearing the wrong clothes. I think of my family who will be very cross with Michael. I think ofSamantha Cameronand whether she will ever ring me again. Please do call, Sam. I’m always there. I hate upsetting people. Except when I am writing something unpleasant in my Daily Mail column. Then everyone is fair game.You think you have married a journalist, then, horrors, he becomes a politician. Let me start by writing about my early life. How my parents were cruel to me. How I was unhappy. (Please don’t. Can you just get to the bits about the Govester? Cheers, Ed.) So, after several jobs in journalism, I found myself working as the arts editor for the Times and while I was there I was invited on a skiing holiday. Imagine my surprise when I was told thatMichael Govewas also going to be staying in the same chalet. Michael was renowned for being the cleverest man at the Times because he could complete the medium sudoku at least six times out of 10.I asked my old friendBrian MacArthurfor tips on Michael. “He’s a lovely chap,” he said. “Though he is gay.” Reader, I married him. And let me tell you, Michael isn’t the slightest bit gay. Not that it would matter if he was.View image in fullscreenMeeting Michael opened my eyes to a whole new social whirl. The Camerons, Sam’s spiteful sister Emily, the Osbornes, the Lockwoods,Rachel, who went on to have an affair with Sam’s stepfather, a huge scandal at the time – I don’t know why I put that in, it has no relevance to my story but any opportunity to reopen old wounds shouldn’t be missed – Nick Boles, and Eddie Vaizey. Darling Eddie. I love him to bits even if he did unsuccessfully try to shag half of the women in London before he settled down! And my dear friend Imogen Edwards-Jones. PS. You won’t forget the jacket quote, will you Imy?Our wedding was a wonderful affair. Apart from my dad being beastly and Michael falling face down into his dinner and then passing out for 12 hours. He’s always been a romantic. Six months later, we moved into our first house in Barlby Road in North Kensington. Our friends were horrified that we hadn’t been able to afford Notting Hill, but the fact is that Michael and I were flat broke and only had a spare half-million. Let me tell you, Dave never felt comfortable coming to our home because there were poor people walking on the pavements outside and said we were very brave for slumming it.Not long afterwards, our first child, Beatrice, was born. Again, I came to realise that Michael and I weren’t truly part of the same social set, as many of our friends had their babies in private hospitals and Bea was born in an NHS hospital. That’s where I saw first-hand fathers who took no interest in their children. Michael could not have done more for me when I was in labour. He sat down in a chair for 12 hours and read the whole of Robert Caro’s biography of Lyndon Johnson. Just occasionally he would look up to check if I had had the baby yet and to ask me if I could get him a sandwich.“We need to have a talk,” said Dave, having invited us round to dinner with George, Eddie and Nick. “Now, we all went to Oxford so it’s obvious that we’re entitled to rule the country. We’re all MPs so it’s time that you became one too, Michael. It’s all the most tremendous fun. Just like the old days in the union. You get to completely fuck up the country for years to come with absolutely no consequences. And when we’re all done with being MPs, we get to join the House of Lords. What’s not to love?”It just so happened that a seat became available in Surrey Heath. “It will be perfect for Michael,” said Sam as we sipped martinis. “It’s an area full of common people just like you. People who can only afford half-million-pound houses. So you will fit right in.”“You say the sweetest, kindest things,” I replied. “Is there anything else I can do for you? Collect the kids from school?”“No, that’s fine. Just wash the dishes and close the door on your way out.”Being an MP’s wife took its toll. I just wasn’t any good at going to speeches given by Carol Vorderman, who was then a Conservative. I’ve never seen such a highly cantilevered bosom. Sorry, that bit just came out. You can take the girl out of the Daily Mail but you can’t take the Daily Mail out of the girl. Anyway, I hate her.While Michael was being very busy and ignoring me, I was struggling to adjust. It seemed completely unfair to expect us to buy a second home in Surrey and actually live in the constituency. Why would anyone choose to live in a shit-hole like that? We were doing Surrey a big enough favour as it was simply by offering to represent them in parliament. Plus, Michael had taken a massive pay cut to become an MP.Then camethe expenses scandal. I was at my lowest ebb, gripped by depression. A terrible, debilitating illness. Except when it’s Prince Harry who is suffering and I’m writing about him. Then he’s just a spoilt brat who needs to pull himself together. Anyway, back to me. No one had told us we couldn’t just buy whatever we wanted and put it on expenses. Besides which, everyone was at it. So when we were named and shamed by the Telegraph I just wanted to hide. Even now I don’t think we did anything wrong even though technically we did.The early years of the coalition were like living in Camelot. Michael was doing his dream job as education secretary and most weekends we would spend time at Chequers. Mostly getting drunk and doing a tremendous amount of good things for the country. When Dave and Sam got caughtleaving Nancy in the pub, I was furious on their behalf. It could have happened to anyone. Welcome to the toxic interface between politics and the media. Something to which I’ve never contributed in my life.Sam and I became the best of friends. She would ring to ask if I could do the shopping for her and I would drop everything to help her out. She made everyone feel so at ease and was always so well dressed. She always knew the right thing to say. I felt inadequate in her presence but she never used that against me. Though she was very cross when I moved to the Daily Mail. I tried telling her that Paul Dacre was the most compassionate man I had ever met and that he only wanted me to write nice, kind pieces. Like the one I wrote aboutEd Miliband’s kitchen! My, how we laughed.But slowly it all started to unravel. First,Dave sacked Michael as education secretary. It was OK for Dave, he was loaded. But for Michael, returning to the backbenches meant we would be struggling to get by on a combined income of more than £200,000. No one could possibly survive on that. Plus, we were still living in our shitty little house, which was now only worth about £1m. We were on the breadline.Michael always said that it was his closeness to Dominic Cummings, one of the most trustworthy men in Westminster, that was the nail in the coffin for us. Teachers used to shout at us in the street. What did they have to moan about? Some of them were earning as much as £35,000. I also have a theory that the media tried to get the public to hate us. They did it with Fergie and they did it with Meghan. Just saying. As for me, I’ve never had a bad word to say about anyone.Then we came to theBrexitvote. People have criticised Michael for breaking his word to Dave over his decision to back Vote Leave. But people forget that Michael is one of the most inherently trustworthy people I have ever met. It’s just that he has a habit of changing his mind and letting people down. And I, genuinely, had no idea of what he was thinking from one day to the next. Michael is the least sexist person I have ever met. He just didn’t want to trouble my pretty little mind with what he was worrying about.These days, Michael will tell you that he was always minded to leave the EU. That he had decided it was in the best interests of the country to take a 4% hit to GDP. It would make people proud to be British if they were worse off. Sam, Dave and many others in our set were furious with Michael. And with me. They said they would never speak to us and our kids again. That they had made Michael and I and we would be nothing without them. We had betrayed them and were not grateful enough. I sobbed and left the room. Who would do Sam’s ironing now?Boris seemed an ideal choice to lead the Vote Leave campaign with Michael. “We needed someone steady to keep us on the straight and narrow,” said Michael. “Someone with no career ambitions. Someone who would say anything that people wanted to hear. Someone who, like me, had a clear plan. A plan to have no plan.”The fallout from the referendum was horrendous. People unreasonably expected Michael and Boris to know what would happen next. But how could they, when they were both completely hungover? Then Dave threw a tantrum by resigning and the whole world hated us. He could have at least waited a few more hours until Michael had stopped throwing up. Even the Mail on Sunday turned against me bydoing a piece about how upset my brother was. If anyone was going to turn over my family, it should have been me.Thereafter, it felt as if we were a laughing stock. Of course, Michael was right to turn on Boris in the leadership campaign. How could he have known someone like Boris would be so unsuitable? It wasn’t as if he had been at his side throughout the referendum campaign. And people mocked when Michael forgot to mention that Rupert Murdoch was in the roomwhen he interviewed Donald Trump. That was a mistake anyone could have made.We eventually moved from our house in the north pole to another shitty area where houses were just over £1m. We could hardly swing a cat in it. I could hear the Camerons and the Osbornes sniggering at our demise. Michael just sat and did nothing throughout the move. Refusing even to open his boxes of books while I did everything. As usual. He’s at his most helpful when he’s doing nothing. A while later he stopped talking completely, just leaving notes around the house. One of which was: “Shall we get divorced?” So we did.

There is awed disbelief at the sheer skill and dedication of the medical teams who transplanted the heart of nine-year-old Keira, who had been killed in a head-on traffic collision, into the body of Max, a little boy facing almost certain death from rapidly deteriorating dilated cardiomyopathy. There is vast admiration for the inexhaustible compassion of the teams who cared for both children and their families, and wonder at the cascade of medical advances, each breakthrough representing determination, inspiration, rigorous work, and careful navigation of newly emerging ethical territory. And most flooring of all is the immense courage of two families, one devastated by the sudden loss of a precious child, the other faced with a diagnosis that threatened to tear their lives apart.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Subsequently, she has also become an acclaimed writer and committed campaigner, publishing three memoirs: Your Life in My Hands, Dear Life andBreathtaking. She turned to her medical training for guidance when writing The Story of a Heart. “I said to myself, my framework will be my medical framework, so I would conduct myself in such a way that they would, I hoped, trust me in the same way that someone might trust me as a doctor. And if at any point they changed their mind, then they could walk away from the project.”Medicine is the perfect marriage of hard science and beautiful, messy humanityEach family read the manuscript in its entirety, with Clarke determined that she would not publish if they had any qualms. On the morning that we speak, she has been in touch with them, and she reads me a message from Loanna, Keira’s mother. It says simply: “Keira really has made such a difference to so many people. She is just incredible.” Loanna, she goes on to tell me, now visits schools to tell children about Keira; Max’s mother, Emma, is an “indefatigable” ambassador for the NHS’s organ donation programme. Nobody who reads the book could forget the almost superhuman fortitude of Keira’s father, Joe, or her sisters, all of whom not only consented but pressed forward with donating her organs, even as Loanna and Keira’s brother were gravely injured. There, too, is the bravery of Max’s father, Paul, supporting his desperately ill son through the pain and trauma of treatment; and Max’s brother, Harry, now finishing his second year at medical school. It is because of these people that in 2020, Max and Keira’s Law entered the statute books, ruling that adults would be presumed to have given consent to organ donation, rather than having to opt in, an enormously important step in addressing the scarcity of donor organs.For Clarke, it was also important to shine a light on the care with which the medical teams treat those who, in death, are giving someone else the chance of life; from the “moment of honour” that precedes all surgery to retrieve donor organs, in which all fall silent to consider the patient, to the last offices of washing and dressing performed by nurses. “It’s the patient that’s the important person,” she explains. “And I think that says something very profound about us as a species, doesn’t it?”Women’s prize for fiction goes to debut novelist Yael van der Wouden’s The SafekeepRead moreClarke, who is the mother of two teenagers, spends half her time working with patients, and half on “other things”; not only writing books, but shining a light on the challenges her profession – and by extension all of us – are facing. At the moment, she is furious about the government’s recent decision to stop issuing visas to foreign care workers, because what they do is regarded as unskilled labour. With a shortage of 100,000 care workers, the result is patients unable to be discharged from hospital: “A direct consequence of that is I will see more patients on trolleys dying outside an A&E that they can’t even get into because we don’t have enough care workers. I will look them in the eye. Keir Starmer won’t. Wes Streeting won’t. But I will, and I will try to give them the best care I can in a corridor where there isn’t even a curtain to draw around them for dignity.”She has, she says, always been torn between the arts and science, but that medicine is “the perfect marriage of hard science and beautiful, messy humanity. And I try to write books that represent medicine accurately in that sense. You are not a good doctor if you’re just a scientist and you’re not a good doctor if you’re just about emotion and feeling: you have to marry the two.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's prize for nonfictionWomen's prizesNHSHealthinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Long before anyone hit send on those inflammatory tweets, or tensions spilled out over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB), Musk’s political downfall was written in the stitching.During his time in the White House, Musk shunned the sartorial rulebook of someone at the shoulder of a president, where suits and ties are the common code. He wore dark Maga baseball caps at the Oval Office and told a rally in New York: “I’m not just Maga, I’m dark gothic Maga.” Then there were the T-shirts with slogans such as “Occupy Mars”, “Tech Support” and “Dogefather”. At campaign rallies, commentatorsnotedhe looked “more like he belonged at a Magic: The Gathering tournament than a political event”, his dress sense the style equivalent of the k-holes that it is claimed Musk frequently disappeared into.The more casual styles of Musk and his Silicon Valley tech bros – where stiff collars are eschewed in favour or crewnecks, tailored jackets softly pushed out the door by padded gilets – are light years away from those of the suited-and-booted US Capitol.But if Musk’s clobber signalled a new DC power shift, it also spoke to different norms. “Disruption might be a badge of honour in the tech space,” says DC-based image coach and style strategistLauren A Rothman, “but in politics, chaos has a much shorter runway. The White House has been around for a long time. We’re not going to stop wearing suits … This is the uniform.”View image in fullscreenDeliberately dishevelled … Dominic Cummings, right, in 2019, with a foldback clip instead of a tie and a gilet.Photograph: Hollie Adams/GettyAll of this dressing down, dressing objectively badly and dressing “inappropriately” has form. Consider, if you can bear to, the case ofDominic Cummings. The former Boris Johnson aide subjected Westminster to dishevelment, Joules gilets, beanies, Billabong T-shirts and tote bags advertising the 1983 gothic-inspired horror novel The Woman in Black. He wasn’t just a Tory, he was a gothic horror Tory.As Jonathan Freedland, the Guardian columnist and host of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly Americapodcast, notes: “Dressing down is usually a power move in politics, just as it is in the boardroom: only the most powerful can get away with it.” That was, he says, the message Cummings sent “when he roamed Number 10 in a gilet: ‘You lot are worker bees who have to wear a uniform, whereas I’m so indispensable to the man at the top, I can wear what I like’.”It was the same with Musk, whose threads were a flipped bird to all those Oval Office stiffs in suits. As Rothman puts it: “His uniform of casual defiance stands in sharp contrast to that traditionally suited corridor of political power.” And that contrast screams out his different, special status.Before him, there was “Sloppy Steve” Bannon, a man never knowinglyunder-shirted. On this side of the Atlantic, Freedland points to former David Cameron adviser Steve Hilton and his penchant for turning up to meetings barefoot: “ditching the shoes was an instant way of signalling his membership of the inner circle”.It’s that age-old question: who has the privilege to be scruffy? As Freedland puts it: “Musk was happy to stand next to the Resolute desk of the president looking like he was dressed for a gamers’ convention. That was his way of reminding everyone of his superior wealth and unique status, outside conventional politics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scruffy Icaruses who flew too close to the sun; their clothes a foreshadowing of their fall. Trump might talk about draining the swamp, but his Brioni suits are very much swamp-coded – plus, while Johnson might have had strategically unruly hair and ill-fitting suits as crumpled as a chip wrapper, suits they still were.Ultimately, nobody likes a bragger. Because dressing in a way in which your privilege is omnipresent if not outright stated, is a surefire way to piss people off. Not least Trump, who noted that Musk had “some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually”, in an interview on Fox in February.“The contrast between Musk’s garb and Trump’s cabinet,” according to Freedland, “made them look and seem inferior: servants of the president rather than his equal. It was one more reason why more than a few in Trumpworld are glad to see the (poorly tailored) back of Elon Musk.”To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure and your wardrobe dilemmas solved –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterElon MuskDominic CummingsUS politicsSteve BannonMen's fashionnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Last night it won the Women’s prize for fiction.“I wrote this book from a place of hopelessness,” she says when we meet. “I was looking for a ray of sunshine.” This morning in London the sun is blazing. She could never have expected that her novel would see off shortlisted authors including Miranda July (of whose work she is a big fan) and Elizabeth Strout.Warm and open, the author is shorter than I expected. Coming as she does from a country of tall people, as she jokes: “I have tall energy.” She has great energy, despite several glasses of champagne last night and only a few hours’ sleep. On her shoulder is a tattoo of a hare – an important symbol in the novel – which she had done after completing the book.In her tearful acceptance speech, Van der Wouden told the audience that when she hit puberty: “all at once, my girlhood became an uncertain fact.” The fact that she is hormonally intersex “was a huge part of my 20s, and then I got the healthcare that I needed … I am receiving truly the greatest honour of my life as a woman, presenting to you as a woman and accepting this Women’s prize and that is because of every single trans person who’s fought for healthcare, who changed the system, the law, societal standards, themselves. I stand on their shoulders.”It was the first time she has spoken about it publicly. Not to have done so she tells me, “wouldn’t have been me. I had my five minutes on stage and I figured what better moment to share something that I care about? It’s heartbreaking to see so much hatred toward trans identities, queer identities.”Set in the Netherlands in 1961, The Safekeep is a tense psychological thriller and tender love story between two very different women, Isabel and Eva. It is a story of dispossession and self-discovery, national and intimate secrets and shame. “This is a novel about a woman who is obsessed with a house, and then a stranger comes and upends her life,” the author says. Isabel is gentile, Eva is Jewish. To say much more would be to give away clues in a narrative that unfolds in a series of jagged revelations, like the shards of broken china Isabel cherishes, that come together to make a devastating and beautiful whole.The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden review – the Dutch houseRead moreThe idea for the novel came to her “as a parting gift” in a car on the way to one of the funerals of her Dutch grandparents, who died within days of each other in 2021. “It came from a place of trying to escape grief,” she says. “I was trying to find distraction in my own head, as I’ve done since I was a kid.”Born in Israel in 1987 to a Jewish mother of Romanian and Bulgarian heritage and a Dutch father, Van der Wouden, who describes herself as a “Dutch-Israeli mixed-bag-diaspora child”, spent her first 10 years in Ramat Gan, a city just east of Tel Aviv. She is careful not to talk about her childhood through what she calls “a pink cloud” of nostalgia because of her vehement opposition to the Israel-Gaza war – she would like to see “a ceasefire with immediate aid”.How do we deal with knowing that we looked away from something terrible, and then move forward?Both her parents were animators (her father created an Israeli version of Sesame Street) and while she and her two younger sisters were encouraged to engage with all art forms, she was not at all bookish.It wasn’t until the family moved to the Netherlands when she was 10 that Van der Wouden discovered books – with Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden being a particular favourite. But she also discovered antisemitism, while living with her grandparents in a house in the forest. Though that home is still her “happy place”, going from cosmopolitan Tel Aviv to “being the only Jew in the village” wasn’t easy. To her new Dutch classmates she resembled Anne Frank.Now, she has no time for the rhetoric of tolerance. “I think that’s a terrible word, because tolerance is putting up with somebody. I want to be desired. I want to be loved. Rather than writing a story about tolerance, I wanted to write a story about love in the aftermath of war.”With Isabel, she created a character who goes from prejudice and repulsion to desire. There is a lot (an entire chapter) of sex in the novel. She laughs. “My goal was to imbue the whole book with a sense of tension, and that tension is erotic.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Van der Wouden had never read a novel that explored what she calls “the psyche of quiet complicity”. Through Isabel she wanted to show that “complicity comes from small and uninteresting acts of dismissal”, and it is something of which we are all guilty. “It’s part of the human experience. The question is, how do we deal with knowing that we looked away from something terrible, how do we then move forward?”The emotional power of the novel rests on the way in which Isabel reveals herself to be someone completely different, even to herself. “What’slikeme,” Isabel says to her brother. “There’s no such thing.Likeme.”This speaks to Van der Wouden’s personal experience. “We don’t leave this life in the same bodies were born into, we are always under flux,” she says. “This is not to say that gender and sexuality is a choice followed by change, but rather that change is an inherent part of life.” On the question of the supreme court ruling on gender rights, she adds: “To subject that to law feels baffling to me, especially as it is accompanied by legal, verbal and physical violence.”Much of The Safekeep was written during lockdown in Utrecht, where she had an attic apartment overlooking the canal. “A beautiful golden cage,” she says. She now lives half an hour away in Rotterdam, where she is thrilled to have a garden. She has already completed the first draft of a second novel set in a fishing village in the Netherlands in 1929.Her greatest hope for the novel as it goes on to find a bigger audience, “if this isn’t too saccharine,” she says apologetically, “is, in fact, hope.”Explore more on these topicsWomen's prize for fictionWomen's prizesFictionAwards and prizesYael van der WoudeninterviewsShareReuse this content"

Take its new reality show The Snake. It’s a game of secrets and betrayal, of feigning one emotion to gain trust while you stab your new friends in the back. In other words, it’s basically The Traitors.Everyone’s a winner: how awards shows became popular againRead moreI don’t know whether any of you have ever searched Merriam Webster for synonyms of ‘traitor’, but ‘snake’ is literallysecond on the list. And this laziness is indicative of the show itself, which is such a painfully halfhearted retread of The Traitors that it ends up being exhausting to watch.Hosted by Jim Jeffries, presenting in the style of a drunk guy shouting through his letterbox at 3am, The Snake gathers contestants from the most easily stereotyped professions – detective, ex-con, pastor, Onlyfans model – and has them connive at each other until only one remains. The runtime of the first episode is almost exclusively given over to letting these people describe exactly how unpleasant they are. Subsequent episodes involve gross-out challenges, like drinking meat smoothies or being relatively close to some insects, so in that regard a direct comparison to The Traitors is slightly unfair, because it’s actually ripping off The Traitors and Fear Factor in equal measure.But perhaps this isn’t such a surprise, because at the moment you could wade through television blindfolded and stumble into any number of shows that desperately want to be The Traitors. Maybe you saw Netflix’s Million Dollar Secret, which was a version of The Traitors set in a luxury hotel. Or Netflix’s The Trust, which was a version of The Traitors hosted by someone from CNN. Or maybe you saw the USA Network’s Snake in the Grass, or ITV’s The Fortune Hotel. Perhaps you even accidentally found yourself watching Amazon’s 007: Road to a Million, which was a version of The Traitors explicitly designed to make you feel depressed about the future of James Bond.None of these shows are shy about their inspiration. They are all about people encouraged to screw over their peers for a quick buck. But the problem is that, as a format, The Traitors is unbeatable. It is beautifully simplistic. People move into a castle. Some of them have to secretly undermine everything. Everyone goes crazy with paranoia. That’s it. It’s bulletproof. A monkey could understand it.But the networks can’t just produce a straight remake of The Traitors, because that would be cheating. And so every new iteration has to add some new element, a gimmicky format point that differentiates it just enough to be legally distinct. With The Fortune Hotel it was a sunny location. With The Snake it’s adding too many unnecessary insects. But this sort of tinkering can easily overwhelm a format.In the UK, ITV recently produced a Traitors knock-off called Genius Game that was so absurdly convoluted – every episode was full of endless tedious explanations about bags and tokens and codes and zombies and garnets – that it quickly felt like the worst kind of hungover Boxing Day board game imaginable, the kind where everyone gives up halfway through and just ends up eating Twiglets in silence. It was like watching The Traitors, but a version of The Traitors that had been loaded with so much superfluous paraphernalia that its ankles shattered under the weight.View image in fullscreenA still from Million Dollar Secret.Photograph: NetflixAnd, true, television has always done this. We’ve already lived through the Pop Idol phase, where civilians were alternately encouraged to either sing or cry on command. And then there was the Love Island phase, where we found ourselves inundated with an infinite number of nimrods copping off in villas. The Great British Bake Off formula has been variously transposed to sewing, pottery, dressmaking, glassblowing, flower arranging and, probably before long, bereavement counselling. Now it is the turn of The Traitors. A year or two from now another show will get its time in the test tube.That said, maybe The Traitors deserves this fleet of copyists. After all, The Traitors is not a new idea. It’s based on Mafia, a game devised in the halls of Moscow State University in the 1980s. It’s also incredibly similar to the board game Secret Hitler, not to mention a BBC showthat was literally called Traitorand ran for five episodes in 2004.Even so, The Traitors stands as the perfect refinement of the idea; it is thrilling and accessible in equal measure. None of its copycats have even come close to replicating it.Still, the night is young, and there are still 41 perfectly unused synonyms for “traitor” left in the thesaurus. Coming soon: The Rat (The Traitors but organised crime), The Quisling (The Traitors but wartime Scandinavia) or The Stool Pigeon (The Traitors but everyone eats cold chicken bones out of bins).Explore more on these topicsReality TVUS televisionTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If the decision is confirmed England would continue to host the event until at least 2031. The country is unique in its ability to fill the stands even for neutral matches and in having the ideal climate to host the match in its current and favoured June window. Unless the political situation changes any final in India would probably need to be relocated should Pakistan qualify, with relations between the two countries currently hostile.South Africa look set to become the third winner in the tournament’s short history, after the unexpected outbreak of ideal batting conditions prompted an outstanding and unbeaten partnership of 143 between Aiden Markram – who finished unbeaten on 102 – and his captain, Temba Bavuma, who at stumps stood on 65. Their performance carried the team to the verge of victory over Australia and a desperately-sought first ICC title since the 1998 Champions Trophy: they finished the day on 213 for two, 69 runs away from equalling the second-highest successful chase in Test matches at Lord’s.View image in fullscreenAiden Markram and Temba Bavuma put on an unbeaten stand of 143 on day three at Lord’s.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA“This would be massive for our country,” said Ashwell Prince, the team’s batting coach. “We’ve fallen short in some white-ball competitions with teams that have had very good chances of getting over the line, possibly favourites at times. But we haven’t done it yet, so we have got to knuckle down.”After 14 wickets fell on each of the first two days only four followed on the third, which started with a 59-run last-wicket partnership between Australia’s Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood that, while making their own task more testing, South Africa saw primarily as encouragement.“There was a little bit of frustration but we try to stick to the positives as much as we can,” Prince said. “Their tailenders were pretty comfortable against a pretty good bowling attack and you can feed off those things – if you reverse that it might happen when we bat. The message has been the same throughout: make them believe they can do it, and then step out of the way and allow them to go and do it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was an exceptional partnership, they navigated any tricky times and then were able to put pressure on us through their running, through their ability to dissect the field – it was a real clinic from those two. The hope for us is that we can get a wicket or two in the morning and just see what that looks like.”Bavuma spent the last 33 overs of the day labouring with a hamstring injury that nearly forced him out of the game. “At tea we had to make a big call, whether he continues to bat,” Prince said. “Both of them were adamant that Temba’s got to continue. Temba’s had to fight throughout his career and this could be a defining moment for him, on the biggest stage.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Test ChampionshipAustralia cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Rory McIlroy battled Oakmont’s treacherous setup and his own frustrations to survive for the weekend at the 125thUS Open. As McIlroy clung on, high-profile exits from Pennsylvania included the defending championBryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Dustin Johnson, Joaquin Niemann, Justin Thomas and Shane Lowry. In epitomising how Oakmont can mess with the mind, Lowry earned a one-stroke penalty after lifting his ball on the 14thgreen while forgetting to mark it. The Irishman could only laugh and, to be fair, did.McIlroy’s day began with two double bogeys inside three holes. By the 12th, the Masters champion flung his iron 30 yards down the fairway in anger at a loose shot. Five holes later, McIlroy broke a tee marker after cracking it with his three-wood. Yet amongst this was admirable fighting spirit; McIlroy fired an approach shot to within 4ft of the 18thhole, a birdie ensuring a 72 for a six-over aggregate. McIlroy last four, played in two under, were crucial. The madcap nature of thisUS Openis such that McIlroy will believe he has a squeak of winning. Only three players – Sam Burns, JJ Spaun and Viktor Hovland – are under par. Burns leads the other two by one at minus three.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau hits out of the bunker during a round of 77.Photograph: Jared Wickerham/EPAWelcome to Grindsville, Pennsylvania. Any golfer standing still was doing wonderfully well. They assessed four foot putts as if they were instead the Gaokao Exam. Smelling salts might as well have replaced energy drinks in the locker room. George Duangmanee shot 86, 89 on his US Open debut. The poor fella did not birdie a single hole amid a string of unmentionables. If watching elite golfers being reduced to quivering wrecks is your thing, this major constitutes essential viewing.DeChambeau’s departure at 10 over is still a shock. The Californian added a 77 to Thursday’s 73. Thomas four-putted from 22ft, the low point in back-to-back rounds of 76. Johnson, who won here in 2016, continues his slide towards early retirement.Denny McCarthy branded five and a half hour Oakmont rounds as “a punch in the face.” The steam was just about visible from Jon Rahm’s ears as he assessed his 75. “I’m too annoyed and too mad right now to think about any perspective,” said Rahm. “I am very frustrated. Very few rounds of golf I played in my life where I think I hit good putts and they didn’t sniff the hole, so it’s frustrating.” Whether Rahm thought pin placements were unfair was left for others to ponder. At four over, he remains a contender.Scottie Scheffler has matched Rahm’s aggregate. “Gosh, dang it” bawled Scheffler after a wayward drive, which is as close as he will ever come to an expletive-laden tirade. “I battled really hard,” Scheffler said. “It’s challenging out there. I was not getting the ball in the correct spots and paying the price for it. Felt like me getting away with one over today wasn’t all that bad. It could have been a lot worse. Around this golf course I don’t think by any means I’m out of the tournament.” Scheffler was still on the practice range three hours after he walked from the final green.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Burns converted from 20ft at the 9th, his last, for a five under par 65. Three under par claimed the clubhouse lead; Burns could sit back and watch the rest suffer. “The golf course is really too difficult to try to figure out what’s a good score and what’s not,” Burns explained. “You’re really just shot by shot and trying to play each hole the best you can. If you try to be too perfect with putting it can drive you crazy, so I just try to really read it, put a good roll on it, focus on the speed and hope for the best. I have tried to play too perfect and tried to force it a little bit at times. So now I am trying to really be patient and take what the golf course gives me.”Hovland lurks. The Norwegian found himself in precisely the place you would rather not be on this course, 80ft from the hole on the final green. Hovland calmly two-putted, his 68 meaning one under par at halfway. In this Ryder Cup year, Hovland’s return to form is excellent news for Europe and their captain Luke Donald.“I’ve just been in a really nice mental state this week,” said Hovland. “Both of my rounds have been very up and down. I feel like a couple times if it would have happened at another tournament, for example, I could have potentially lost my mind there a little bit. But I felt like I kept things together very well.” Indeed, Hovland played his closing stretch in level after a double bogey on his 11th.Brooks Koepka twice reached three under on the back nine, his front half. Koepka bogeyed three in succession around the turn before dropping further shots at the 4th, 8thand 9thfor a 74. Two over par might frustrate Koepka given his second round start but he is firmly in the mix.Koepka is arguably the most fascinating actor in this show; a one-time major specialist, he has produced inauspicious results since winning the 2023 US PGA Championship. Koepka missed the cut both at that event and the Masters this year. At Quail Hollow last month, Kopeka was heckled over his decision to accept tens of millions to perform on the LIV Tour. Whether it was that viral moment, a heart-to-heart with his straight-talking coach Pete Cowen or simply the ironing out of technical flaws, Koepka suddenly looks a threat once again. Oakmont is unlikely to faze him. It has already done exactly that to countless others.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenRory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rouse the majorettes from their state of indifference. Put out more flags. Put out some flags. Put outa flag. Er … is anyone actually there? IShowSpeed? Can you hear me Pitbull? Welcome to the almost-World Cup, an almost-real almost-event that will perhaps, with a favourable wind, now begin to feel like almost-football.­This week Gianni Infantino described Fifa’s regeared tournament as football’s Big Bang, referencing the moment of ignition from which all the matter in the universe was dispersed out of a previously cold and indifferent void. And to be fair, Infantino was half-right. So far we have the void.David Squires on … Infantino’s Club World Cup buildup in the land of TrumpRead moreAmerica, we have been repeatedly told, is ready for this, primed and hungry for Fifa’s billion-dollar event. The evidence on the ground is: maybe. But not in a way that you’d actually notice. Instead, as theClub World Cupbuilds towards Saturday’s opening night, Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami versus Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium, this is a tournament that exists at the fringe of America’s densely packed attention economy, an ambient drawl of half-heard voices, noises through the wall.The last week has brought almost-news of $4 tickets, star-player platitudes, immigration officials at the opening game. And all of this in a host city where people still look a little blank and say things such as:“TheClubWorld-what?”and: “Actually I like hockey, but my nephew, he loves Cristiano Ronaldo, and let me tell you, what a body that guy has.”This is a place where things keep almost-happening. Come and watch Inter Miami train on plasticised grass next to a private airfield, but no, not with Messi present. Wait! Infantino is giving a public address. Although it turns out he’s sent a video message (“un momento muy importante”) that people can video on their phones, while in turn being videoed by the official video crew, the only revelation from which was that Gianni appears to have acquired an excitingly badger-ish set of eyebrows. So there’s that.Otherwise, at times it has felt as if the only publicity around this thing is occasional in-house footage of Infantino appearing at some sealed indoor hype-event, looking like a fringe member of the intergalactic royal family being held hostage in a luxury basement, forced to stand next to Ronaldinho and the drummer from Spandau Ballet, and talk only about massive stuff, huge things, the biggest.Through all this, Infantino has become a slightly stretched figure. Understandably so. Here is a man charged with calling an imaginary sporting world into being, out there constantly saying things that are untrue about a thing that doesn’t exist to people who don’t care. Three days before the big kick-off it emerged that ChatGPT had simulated the entire tournament. Paris Saint-Germain beat Bayern Munich in the final. Do we actually need to play it?View image in fullscreenThe prospect of watching Lionel Messi may lure fans to the Hard Rock Stadium.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAnd yet, of course, we do. And with a duty, not to Fifa, or to the revenues of tomorrow, but to the idea this game still belongs even in debased form to the people who care about it.It is traditional at times such as these tohammer out a tournament preview, a distillation of all that stored excitement, the cultural collisions that have led to this place, the hard-edged imponderables of elite sport, the beauty in store. Hmm, yes. About that.This will be difficult on this occasion because this thing is ersatz, a pop-up. Sport is culture, memory and connection. But this is all borrowed culture, a burger made out of Plasticine, the tournament equivalent ofQatar’s desert city of Lusail, with its fake Rimini, its imitation Paris.It will be difficult because there are simply too many games, 63 of them across the next four weeks in 11 host cities, everything suitably maxed out in a country where even the act of buying a packet of crisps involves engaging with a sleeping bag full of violent toxic maize bombs, where there is a fear too many of these will be glazed, empty occasions, Warhol-ish performance pieces staged to capture a moment of perfect corporate emptiness. Next up: Ulsan HD against Mamelodi Sundowns at the Inter&Co Stadium Orlando. We’ll slide down the surface of things.For all that there is a sense this must matter, because the clubs matter, that we can still ingest this thing like a sporting amphetamine, some kind of engagement generated from a standing start. There have been some odd staging decisions, but there are still epic collisions here, A-list teams in great American cities. River Plate versus Inter at the Lumen Field. Bayern and Boca Juniors at the Hard Rock. PSG and Botafogo in Los Angeles. Anything yet? A flicker of the needle?For those who don’t have access to MLS there is a chance to see Messi again, here as a mobile marketing device, but also the most beautifully gifted footballer of the past 50 years. Real Madrid are genuinely interesting, the team of roving stars taking theirfirst steps under a systems manager, crowbarred into new shapes before our eyes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I hope my fight inspires others’Read moreThe continuingrebuild of Manchester Cityis a live event. There are subplots,a Trent at Madrid arc, Simone Inzaghi squiring his new love interest, Al-Hilal, around the place with Inter also in the ballroom. João Cancelo has played for six competing clubs, so is in effect Mr Club World Cup, out there non-celebrating all his as yet nonexistent goals on the almost-biggest stage.Is it good yet? Has it hit the bloodstream? This will be harder because of the unpalatable genesis of this thing, the fact it is in the end the work of a single autocratic leader. This is, of course, the over-empowered president of Fifa, with a sense at the big kick-off that only Infantino will feel any actual sense of ownership, eyes boggling on his executive banquette, legs in the stirrups, brow heaving as he births his personal god-league and holds it slithering to his chest.It will be difficult because this entity is also deeply disruptive, a case of Fifa digging its fingers hungrily into every league and club in the world. For all the blather about inclusion, Europe has 12 teams here. Fifa is pumping most of that $1bn (£739m) prize pot into European club football, in many cases equivalent to a season’s broadcast revenue. What is its mandate for doing this? Fifa is supposed to oversee and regulate, not act as an investor-disruptor, some kind of football-bro overlord.What other organisation allows this level of influence in one person, or lets its supposedly neutral leader cosy up to despots and political leaders, passing it all off, laughably, as Good for Football? So much so that the one element we know will cut Infantino to the quick is the fact Donald Trump will not be present at Saturday night’s opener.View image in fullscreenThere have been reports of tickets as cheap as $4 for some games.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersTrump will instead be overseeing a huge march-past in Washington called the Grand Military Parade (a great parade, the very best parade). Gianni, I’m sorry. They always let you down in the end. By an odd coincidence it is also Trump’s birthday, which does at least raise the prospect of a smudged and woozy Infantino performing his own alarmingly sensual rendition of Happy Birthday Mr President on the half-time big screen in Miami.On the day of Fifa’s opener there will also be 1,500 demonstrations across the US, including in Miami, under the banner No Kings, a movement that rejects the notion of Trump as a proto-regent in his wielding of power. Does this feel familiar, as if sport is again trying to tell you something, offering a front-row seat at the circus?It even feels right that this should be happening in Florida, a place built out of tax breaks and real estate finagling, a vast sun-baked fun palace, and now the green sunken hub of the football world. Let the games begin. There is, for all the absence of pre-energy, a lot more at stake here than a Tiffany trophy.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Between 1978 and 1997 Bath andLeicestercollectively won 15 national knockout trophies and over the first 15 years of the league’s existence they claimed 12 titles between them. Their reunion at Twickenham is akin to those other 90s chart-toppers, Oasis and Blur, dusting down their favourite guitars and appearing on stage together.The temptation is to dive head first into a foaming tub of nostalgia and wallow in the rekindled rivalry. If anyone had predicted in 1996 thatBathwould not win another domestic title in the next 29 years they would have been laughed out of the convivial old Rec clubhouse. Leicester, similarly, thought the ABC Club and the Tigers’ steely winning mentality would live for ever.Super Ted or Superman? Hill’s ‘different game’ key for Bath in Premiership finalRead moreIt is the here and now, though, that really matters in a grand final week. And how interesting that it has taken a South African and an Australian, neither of whom played Test rugby, to bring the good times rolling back to two famous English institutions. At first glance the outwardly calm, process-oriented Johann van Graan and the more animated Michael Cheika might not appear to have much in common. But drill a little deeper and the renaissance of their respective teams has been built on broadly the same tenets.Both are widely travelled family men who have long since understood that coaching is ultimately about people. And, specifically, about channelling the power of the collective, not least psychologically. Both have also looked beyond rugby’s normal tramlines for inspiration. Cheika, born in Sydney to Lebanese immigrants, used to run a successful fashion distribution business, which he says taught him plenty about how to manage and operate under pressure.And did you know that Bath’s rise has been partly shaped by the best strategic minds in the US army? Van Graan, it emerges, has made multiple visits to the US Military Academy at West Point, just up the Hudson River from New York, to discover how real combatants prepare for battle. “I often think about what I’ve learned there,” he said this week. “We speak a lot about war in training but I go to learn from guys who are actually in a war. I remember this one platoon leader taking us into a little restaurant and giving me live examples of training and battle and how the two differ.”View image in fullscreenJohann van Graan has taken his team training to the US Military Academy at West Point.Photograph: Tom Sandberg/PPAUK/ShutterstockVan Graan’s attention to detail has also taken him to several NFL teams including the New England Patriots, San Francisco 49ers and Miami Dolphins. The 45-year-old has also embraced the vision of continual improvement embedded in Japanese Kaizen culture and tapped into the benefits of mind-and-body yoga. At half-time in the dressing room, before a single coaching message is imparted, Bath’s players collectively take a deliberate yoga-style deep breath to help bring them back in sync. “Obviously rugby’s a very emotional game and when you’re in the middle of the battle it can be hard bringing yourself back to a calm state,” says Miles Reid, one of several local Bath boys yearning to bring the league title back to their rugby-centric home city. “Before a message is delivered in our huddles we take a breath. It just gets us all on the same page. It calms us down and then you’re clearer and more receptive.”Bath’s second-half surge against Bristol Bearsin last Friday’s semi-finalwould suggest it is working. As with his native Springboks, for whom Van Graan worked as an assistant between 2012 and 2017, Bath also possess a “bomb squad” bench who blow most opponents away. Van Graan will also tell you that relaying the infamously muddy pitch at the Rec – ironically after a narrow defeat by Leicester – has been even more vital to Bath’s resurgence, finally suiting the all-court brand of rugby they wanted to play.The Tigers have not had the luxury of Bruce Craig’s generous financial backing. Having won the title against the oddsin 2022, they trailed in eighth in the table last year and Cheika’s tenure will span only one year. As recently as January they contrived toconcede 80 points to Toulouse, forcing their resident Australian wizard to dig into his box of motivational tricks. He has plenty of them: among his more famous ploys was handing out engraved golf clubs to each member of his Waratahs squad before their Super Rugby final against the Crusaders in 2014. He wanted to encourage them to have a swing and not have any regrets. The Waratahs duly beat a strong Crusaders side 33-32.The 58-year-old Australian has not yet been spotted in any pro shops this week but, whether it be through tone, body language or symbolic messaging, he will unquestionably have Leicester pumped up for the big one. “He’s obviously unbelievable in terms of the strategic side,” says England’s Ollie Chessum, set to embark on his first Lions tour next week. “You don’t get as far as he has in rugby without having that rugby IQ. But for me he just finds a way to galvanise the group and get them to find a real meaning in what they’re doing. We’ve probably not learned too much technically that we didn’t already know but what’s really changed this year is around that mental and emotional side of the game. Cheik’s incredibly good at finding a way to motivate boys. He’ll also say that just believing you can do it makes a huge difference.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Not only do Bath have the baton-twirling Finn Russell but they have impressive power and pace across the field. Even without the injured Ollie Lawrence, Van Graan’s multifaceted squad is finally well placed to reward Craig’s investment.Then again the white-shirted Tigers will be feeling an emotional surge as they bid farewell to, among others, their retiring legends Ben Youngs and Dan Cole. “It’s sad seeing Coley retire,” says Joe Heyes, his front-row teammate. “Lenny too. They’ve been a huge part of this club. We want to send them off in the right way.” Chessum, increasingly influential for club and country, is another believer. “When we’ve needed it most in the last five, six weeks the squad has really clicked. As Cheik says, we’ve been playing under pressure for quite a few weeks now.”Or, to quote Cheika himself: “When the opportunity’s there you’d be mad not to take it, wouldn’t you?” But Bath and Van Graan have not come this far to abandon their process now and lose a second consecutivePremiershipfinal. If they can crack the title code it may just be the first of many.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipBathLeicesterRugby unionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Join Geoff Lemon on our over-by-over report, before he joins Ali Martin, Andy Bull and Simon Burnton to review all of the action.Premiership rugby final3pmBath v Leicester liveBath are aiming to roll back the years by claiming their first league title since 1996 against another of the game’s storied clubs at Twickenham. Under Johann van Graan the regular-season table-toppers have already enjoyed a bumper season, claiming silverware in the Premiership Rugby Cup in February and European Challenge Cup last month. What chance a treble 12 months on from their 25-21 final defeat by Northampton? Staging something of a grand farewell party are Tigers, who have a host of key figures bidding a last hurrah: Ben Youngs, Dan Cole, Mike Brown, Julián Montoya, Handré Pollard and the head coach, Michael Cheika, all bow out after the final – and signing off with English rugby’s prime silverware would be quite the sendoff.

Although he went on to miss the cut in 2016, the American world No 1 is back as a heavy favourite to win back-to-back major titles following his US PGA Championship triumph. That would give Scheffler the third leg of a career grand slam and he would join a list of Oakmont winners which includes Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus and Ernie Els.

The Red Bull driver has won for the past three years in Montreal, the last time after starting alongside Mercedes’s pole-sitter, George Russell – the same rival he clashed with two weekends ago – in a qualifying draw. How Verstappen will respond is an open question but others are sure to want to take whatever advantage they can of the situation at a circuit famed also for changeable weather.

Inter Miami’s involvement rests on their winning the MLS Supporters’ Shield for the best performance in the regular season, even though LA Galaxy went on to win the actual MLS playoffs and were left out.

Although she had fought hard and rallied after conceding a convincing first set against an imperious Zheng Qinwen, in truth she was never in control.Up 4-3 in the second set but down break point, Raducanu double faulted. A few minutes later, the match was over. The tension felt by the British No 1 in those decisive moments was a reflection of the constant pressure imposed on all contenders by the best players in the world, a challenge that she continues to struggle with.Emma Raducanu leapfrogs Katie Boulter to British No 1 after beating Sramkova at Queen’sRead moreHer positive week at Queen’s Club ended at the hands of an impressive Zheng, the top seed and world No 5, who overpowered Raducanu to reach the first grass-court semi-final of her blossoming career with a 6-2, 6-4 win.After two months of trying to adapt her game to suit slow, unfamiliar clay courts, the grass-court season on home soil has provided Raducanu with a helpful boost. She put together straight-sets wins against theSpanish qualifier Cristina BucsaandRebecca Sramkova, the world No 41, and she will regain her status as the British No 1 next week. Still, while she has performed well against players ranked outside of the top 30, her  game has often looked underpowered compared with the best in the world.Zheng and Raducanu are just one month apart in age. They first met at the Orange Bowl under-12s and they sometimes speak with each other in Chinese. While Raducanu broke through at 18, Zheng’s rise has been gradual but much more certain. Over the past year, she has established herself as a top contender, winning the Olympic gold medal in Paris. However, she has had minimal experience on grass. She entered this season 3-8 on the surface.This inexperience is countered by the massive weapons at her ­disposal, which means she is more than capable of being effective on grass. Although it can be inconsistent, Zheng’s first serve is a devastating, precise shot that is complemented by her vicious forehand. The 22-year-old is also one of the better athletes on the tour.Although Raducanu tried to impose her game on Zheng by attacking second serves on the rise and injecting pace into her forehand, she was overwhelmed by the Chinese player, who served brilliantly in the opening set and controlled the baseline with her far heavier weight of shot throughout.View image in fullscreenZheng Qinwen overpowered Emma Raducanu to win 6-2, 6-4 and reach her first grass court semi-final.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPARaducanu entered Queen’s Club still uncertain about her physical condition after a recurrence of her back spasms. Before the start of the second set, she took an off-court medical timeout to address her back.“It’s been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before. I think it’s just a vulnerability of mine,” she said afterwards. “I know I need to take good care of it. I’m not overly concerned that it’s something serious, but I know it’s something that’s very annoying and needs proper and careful management.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her first-serve percentage plummeted and her forehand errors began to pile up. Raducanu suffocated Zheng’s second serve and remained consistent as she twice broke for a 3-0 lead. Yet despite her fast start to the second set, the lead was never convincing.As soon as Zheng regained her rhythm on serve and range on her forehand, she took full control of the baseline again. At 4-3, Raducanu double faulted on break point to relinquish the second break as Zheng rolled through four consecutive games from 4-2 down to close out a strong win.“I think returning is one of my big strengths, and I think Qinwen served really well,” said Raducanu. “I didn’t see many second serves. And she hit her spots really well in some big moments. Credit to her. She kind of took away one of my bigger strengths. I think I have a lot of work to do, to be honest.”It remains to be seen how her back will hold up, but Raducanu will next head to the WTA 500 event in Berlin in search of more matches with the best players in the world.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

As the Formula One circuit hops back across the Atlantic for the weekend’s Canadian Grand Prix, he appears on the verge of reclaiming the role.Like Tim Robbins’ strong-armed and hot-headed Nuke LaLoosh character in the baseball film Bull Durham, the brash Dutch phenomenon announced his presence with authority – undeniable skills and unfortunate lapses in judgment or focus. He became well acquainted with the walls of many a race circuit and earned a gentle warning from F1 management.Max Verstappen must control his road rage to cement his legacy as a great | Giles RichardsRead moreHis ascendance to theworld championship title in 2021 at Abu Dhabiwas also controversial – some might instead say farcical, as if the rule book was tossed out of one of Abu Dhabi’s growing array of 300m-tall buildings. Race officials had no truly coherent reason for allowing some cars to “unlap” themselves while following a safety car, allowing Verstappen to start the final lap right on Lewis Hamilton’s tail, with a fresher set of tyres … and everyone knows what happened next.Since then, though, the Dutchman’s narrative has changed. He is no longer the impudent youngster with one tarnished championship. He’s a four-time winner, following up his breakthrough by taking the 2022 and 2023 titles with dominance not seen since Michael Schumacher’s heyday in the 2000s.But while he held off Lando Norris to winhis fourth straight title in 2024, for the past 12 months the wins haven’t been coming quite as easily. This year, he stands in third place and may be losing contact with the McLaren duo of Norris and Oscar Piastri. As his results have reverted to his late-2010s form,so has his temper. After taking out his frustration on George Russell in Spain and being demoted to 10th, he is on the precipice of a suspension, not a fifth title.View image in fullscreenMax Verstappen in his Red Bull during the Spanish Grand Prix, when the Dutch driver drove into the side of George Russell’s car.Photograph: Xavi Urgeles/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockAfter the incident in Spain, Italian taxi drivers fought back against the accusation thatVerstappen drives like they do. Anyone who has spent time in Italian taxis would agree that being compared to a four-time F1 champion would, under most circumstances, be considered a compliment. Not now.So Verstappen the Villain is well and truly back. Russell expressed surprise in Montreal on Thursday that the Dutchman had even offered an apology of sorts but suggested he would be unlikely to change his aggressive approach even if he did accumulate the 12 penalty points that would result in a ban. The question for F1, now and for the foreseeable future: is this a good thing? Does the sport do better when it has someone to root against as well as many drivers to root for?Other sports benefit from having foils for the fan favorites. If a supporter’s favorite team loses, there’s always a chance the New York Yankees or Manchester United might lose as well, and there’s comfort in schadenfreude. Consider Nascar, where fans either loved or hated Dale Earnhardt’s “Intimidator” style and often distrusted Jeff Gordon because he was a smooth-talking Californian, not a rough-edged man with a southern state drawl.Nascar also has long benefited from its unpredictability. In the modern era, champion drivers typically win no more than 25% of the races in a given season. In F1, Verstappen cruised to the 2023 title by winning 19 of 22 races.But F1 has been doing just fine during the era of Verstappen dominance, especially in North America. The 25 May F1 race in Monaco drew the third-highest TV rating in US history, ESPN claims, with an average of 2.3 million viewers and a peak of 2.6 million. Imagine what could happen this Sunday, with F1 on a less glitzy but less predictable circuit than the traditional but tedious Monaco streets. Last year, the Canadian GP averaged a robust 1.76 million viewers in the US, ESPN reports. In Canada itself, the ratings were reported at a record 1.4 million, with 3.5 million viewers on all platforms – nearly 9% of the country’s population.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Drivers have been shown to have delightfully quirky personalities, such that the top story on the 6.1 million-strong F1 Reddit sub on Thursday was a debate over the veracity of a photograph that may or may not show that longtime title contender Valtteri Bottas has broken a Colorado restaurant’s record by consuming 51 tacos in one hour. (A cursory check of Yelp finds a review from August 2019 confirming that the 51-taco record dates back at least that far, so at best, Bottas tied the record.)But the biggest development this year is that the title chase is far from a foregone conclusion. The season is still young, and Verstappen’s powerhouseRed Bullteam may respond well to F1’s in-season rules adjustments. But he’s nearly 50 points off the pace set by the Australian Piastri, with Piastri’s fellow McLaren prodigy Norris a close second.Verstappen the Villain surely is a boon for F1 fandom. But Verstappen the Vulnerable may have an even greater impact. He did set the pace in opening practice on Friday, though he fell to ninth in second practice, when Russell went quickest. Norris was second fastest second time around, with Russell’s teammate Kimi Antonelli setting the third-best time to underline Mercedes’s speed. Piastri was only sixth in second practice, with Lewis Hamilton eighth.Charles Leclerc suffered a heavy accident after nine laps in first practice.

The intermittent noise of jets on the final approach to Heathrow will be one of the few deviations from the sights and sounds when George IV first trundled his way up the course in 1825. The king and queen will ride in the first of the horse-drawn carriages, their liveried attendants will be upright in the saddle and, as they pass the Royal enclosure, the gentlemen’s top hats will be doffed in the familiar mark of respect.There is little else, in sport or the wider world beyond, that remains just as it was in the immediate aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. Demand for the Royal Ascot experience also remains strong. After a post-Covid surge, attendances are indecline at both the Derbyand Cheltenham’s festival meeting in March. At Royal Ascot 2024, though, the year-on-year crowd numbers were up.Passion remains at Derby but empty spaces among Epsom spectators are growingRead moreThe meeting’s most significant racegoer, meanwhile, has been present at (almost) every opportunity since his accession to the throne in 2022. The King attended all five days in 2023, when Desert Hero, a horse bred by his mother, carried the royal colours to victory in the King George V Handicap, and four days in 2024, missing only the Wednesday card when the Prince of Wales was there to present the prize for the feature race – the Prince of Wales’s Stakes.So the more pessimistic predictions of a steady decline, and perhaps even the end, for the crown’s association with Ascot – and, by extension, the sport of kings as a whole – after the death of Elizabeth II have proved to be unfounded. Charles III is the ninth reigning monarch to ride in the Royal procession, and the 10th to sit on the throne since the meeting was effectively established with the first running of the Gold Cup in 1807.“People tend to forget that there was aRoyal Ascotbefore Queen Elizabeth II,” Nick Smith, the track’s director of racing and public affairs, said on Friday, “and the level of interest from monarchs will vary. It’s well known that Queen Victoria didn’t go to Royal Ascot for most of the latter part of her life, when she was in mourning for her husband.“All monarchs past and present would come to Royal Ascot with varying degrees of focus on various elements of what they’re going to see. With Queen Elizabeth II it was primarily about the horses, but if anything, it’s a wider set of interests for the current King and Queen. For instance, there’s an exhibition this year around the Queen’s Reading Room, which is a charity very close to the Queen’s heart.”While the royal presence is a key ingredient of the meeting, it is not, in other words, a one-way street. Some monarchs focus almost entirely on the racing, others appreciate the social, cultural and economic benefits attached, including inward investment by the owners whose arrival in Berkshire each year creates a version of Davos for sovereign wealth.“Royal Ascot is one of Britain’s most powerful soft power assets,” Smith says. “It is a major promotion of the British summertime overseas, and a major promotion of British sport overseas. And if you’re getting presented with a trophy by the King and Queen, you can’t replicate that experience and that means an awful lot to an awful lot of people.“At the heart of it all, it’s the traditions that make it special. The procession is broadly unchanged in 200 years, and it’s the same with the dress codes, not just in the Royal enclosure but throughout the entire site. People who come to Royal Ascot know what they want to see and they know what they’re going to get.”View image in fullscreenKing Charles with jockey Tom Marquand after last year’s Coronation Stakes.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersThe King and Queen are expected to attend all five days of this year’s meeting, they will have a sprinkling of runners through the week and there is a real buzz in particular around Willie Mullins’s Reaching High, who is expected to line up for the Ascot Stakes at 5pm on Tuesday’s opening day.Reaching High became the first horse owned by a reigning British monarch to be stabled in Ireland when he was sent to Mullins’s yard after Sir Michael Stoute’s retirement. But he offers a link to recent history too, as he was one of the last horses bred by Elizabeth II, and a son of Estimate, the mare whose success in the 2013 Gold Cup was the most cherished of all the late Queen’s Royal Ascot winners.Marchogion appeals at YorkThe three-year-old sprint handicap, the feature race on York’s annual Macmillan Charity card on Saturday, is always one of the strongest races of its type all season, and the fact that just two favourites have won this century is worth bearing in mind with the many and varied betting opportunities of Royal Ascot so close at hand.This year’s favourite is Charlie Hills’s Double Rush, who was an obvious pick to head the early betting on the bare form of his two-from-two record this year. He has drawn stall 20 of 22, however, on a course where low numbers often enjoy a significant advantage, and makes no appeal at all at his latest odds of around 5-1.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He may have made it worseJonathan FreedlandIsrael has eliminated many of the brains behind Tehran’s nuclear programme. But don’t expect the regime to back downFri 13 Jun 2025 12.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 13.59 EDTShareThis is a war 30 years in the making.Benjamin Netanyahuwas talking about the threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb back in the 1990s and he has scarcely let up since. For decades he has believed that a nuclear Iran would represent the one truly existential threat to Israel and that military force is the only sure way to prevent it. Several times during the many years in which Netanyahu has sat in the prime minister’s chair, an all-out strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities has been weighed up, debated and planned for. In the early hours of this morning, it finally happened.Netanyahu will be pleased with the early results, including theelimination of key Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. But the ultimate consequences could look very different. By his actions, he may only have accelerated the very danger he has feared for so long.It’s not hard to see why Israel’s PM struck and struck now. The motive remains the same as it ever was, with Netanyahu’s statement overnight invoking the darkest chapter in Jewish history to insist thatIsraelwould never allow itself to be vulnerable to a “nuclear holocaust”. But the timing was down, in part, to the fact that the Iranian regime is in a state of strategic weakness.Its power in the region long rested on the allies and proxies it could call on, forming a “ring of fire” around the Israeli enemy: the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen, to say nothing of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. Now Assad is gone and Syria’s new leader, embraced by Donald Trump, is looking to Washington rather than Tehran. As for the three Hs, the Houthis have reached anagreement with the US; Hezbollah is leaderless and still reeling fromlast year’s Israeli onslaught, leaving the Iraqi militias who once co-ordinated with it weakened in turn; and Hamas has seen Israel wipe out its leadership and all but destroy Gaza. More directly, Israel’s response to Iran’s missile and drone strikes on the country in April and October of 2024 left Iran’s air defence system crippled. If the best time to kick a man is when he’s down, now, concluded Israel’s war planners, was the time to move.As for this specific moment, there was a helpful bit of context, if not exactly a pretext, provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Thursday the nuclear watchdog found Iran inviolation of its non-proliferation obligationsfor the first time in almost 20 years.And, as always with Netanyahu, domestic politics played a part: on Wednesday he warded off a threat to his coalition by warning one unhappy smaller party that the Iranian threat meant thatnow was not the timefor a dissolution and early elections.What may have loomed especially large in Netanyahu’s calculations was the meeting scheduled for Sunday in Oman between Trump’s personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his Iranian counterpart, their sixth such encounter. Did the Israeli PM fear a breakthrough in those talks that would have seen Trump agree a deal much like the one signed by the Obama administration a decade ago, an arrangement that would have allowed Iran to keep enriching uranium in a way acceptable to the US but unacceptable to Israel? Netanyahumanaged to persuade Trumpin 2018 to break from the Obama-era agreement, helped by the fact Trump likes nothing more thanto dismantle the legacy of a predecessor. But a revived deal with Trump’s signature on it? That had to be prevented by whatever means necessary.On this reading, Netanyahu has just defied the will of his biggest patron, the US, and done it brazenly. Supporting that view is the pointed statement by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, that Israel’s action was“unilateral”and that “We are not involved in strikes against Iran.” That would certainly fit with Trump’s own words just a few hours before Israel’s assault had begun. “I’d love to avoid a conflict,” the president said, explaining that the US and Iran were “fairly close” to making a deal. “As long as I think there is an agreement I don’t want [the Israelis] going in because I think that would blow it.”And yet, look at what Trump said next. “It might help it actually,” he mused, hinting that an Israeli attack could concentrate the Iranians’ minds in negotiations, nudging them towards saying yes rather than no. And note how Trump has reacted to the Israeli assault once it got under way.“I think it’s been excellent,”he told ABC News on Friday morning. “We gave [the Iranians] a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard … And there’s more to come. A lot more.”Perhaps that’s all front, Trump preferring to save face – and claim credit – than to admit Israel defied his wishes. But we know how Trump talks when he thinks he’s been disrespected. And so far there’s been no sign of that. Coupled with Trump’s promise to defend Israel from Iranian retaliation, it adds to the possibility that the Oman talks may even have been a pre-agreed ruse to hoodwink Tehran, that theUS is no mere observer of this war and that it could get drawn further into it.Which brings us to the question that matters more than either the motive or timing of this Israeli action: is it wise? Some will look at the region and think Israel has miscalculated, that some of the Arab states which quietly came to its aid against Iran a year ago will be reluctant to do that now. That may be to mistake public anger for private satisfaction. As the Economist’s Middle East correspondentputs it, “plenty of people in the Middle East are happy to see Iran hit … Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis who suffered for years because of the Islamic republic are glad to see it bloodied.”Others will note that the attack may have been spectacular, especially in its elimination of several key individuals, but that, if its ultimate aim is the prevention of an Iranian bomb, it is still bound to fail. The IAEAg has confirmed that the Natanz site was hit, but analysts explain that the business end of that installation is so deep in the ground, it is beyond the reach of conventional Israeli firepower. The same goes for the site atFordow, concealed inside a mountain. It would require US “bunker-buster” bombs to hit those, and even they might not be able to do it.But there is a less concrete reason why Operation Rising Lion might ultimately prove futile. Surely Iran’s hardliners will now become more, not less, determined to acquire a nuclear weapon. They will have learned what might be called the North Korea lesson. After the Iraq war, Libya opted to abandon its nuclear programme. Not many years later, the Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, was dead in a ditch. Ukraine too gave up its nuclear bombs, only to be invaded by its neighbour.Meanwhile, the dictator dynasty in Pyongyang made the opposite move: they held on to their nukes, and no one has ever laid a finger on them.That logic is bleak but compelling and seems to be hardening in Tehran. Witness today’sstatement from the Iranian governmentthat “The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on the right to enrichment, nuclear technology and missile power.” That sounds like doubling down.Even if the Iranians are somehow thwarted, the lesson will not be lost on the neighbourhood. Saudi Arabia and Turkey will not want to place themselves in Israel’s crosshairs by pursuing a nuclear programme, but nor will they want to be Libya or Ukraine. Despite the risks, they might conclude that it’s better to be North Korea. A nuclear weapon will only become more desirable. And a tinderbox region that is already the most unstable in the world will become more dangerous still.So yes, Netanyahu can look forward to fighting the next Israeli election as the man who humbled Israel’s archenemy. It will play well. But with this move he may well have brought the nightmare prospect of a nuclear Middle East one step closer. That’s a peril for his country – and the world.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For anything. Most of the rest of us go through life saying sorry on a regular basis. For being late, for not doing something we had said we would, for forgetting. And by and large an apology does the trick. The person we have let down feels heard and all is forgiven.But politicians would rather die than apologise. Take the winter fuel allowance U-turn. Almost the first thing that the new Labour government did was to cut the payment for almost every pensioner. It was Rachel Reeves’s way of showing the financial markets that she could be trusted to take the tough decisions in the interests of fiscal responsibility. Only it turned out that most people didn’t think the government should be forcing some of the most vulnerable members of society to choose between heating and eating.Cue the eventual reverse ferret from Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions a few weeks ago.And today we got the details. Any pensioner earning £35K or under would now be entitled to the payment. What had started out as a policy to save the Treasury £1.35bn would now, due to the increasing number of old people claiming pension credit, end up costing the country more than if the system had remained the same.What we didn’t get was an apology. Instead the government tried to claim its change of plan was driven entirely by an improvement in the economy. A suggestion that just made it look stupid as no one believes it. Saying sorry – “we wanted to means test the allowance to stop millionaires getting it but got the threshold wrong” – would have saved the Treasury all the embarrassment. Most people would have accepted the mistake and moved on. An apology is the first step to restoring trust in politics.TuesdayFor those of you who enjoy blue-on-blue Tory infighting,How Not to Be a Political Wifewill be this summer’s must read. But having finished the memoir, I can only conclude that Sarah Vine is a very complicated woman.At times she is ruthlessly self-revealing and at others seemingly hopelessly lacking in self-awareness. Almost as if she had no control over herself and the book she was writing. As a Daily Mail feature writer and columnist, she has plenty of form for writing snarky pieces about other women in the public eye – their weight, their looks, their mental health – but she seems to demand to be made an exception when it comes to herself.Mostly though there is a rich seam of self-delusion. A feeling of massive entitlement. That it was perfectly normal forMichael Goveand the rest of the Notting Hill set to be running the country. As if they were somehow doing the rest of us a massive favour. As if they were ordained to be the ruling elite with a consequence-free life and were outraged when things went wrong.Sarah moans bitterly about the sacrifices she had to make. The pay cut Michael took to become an MP. The struggle to get by on a joint income of more than £200K. The humiliation of having to live in North Kensington when all her friends lived in a posher part of west London. The unfairness that David Cameron and others had so much more money than them. The cheek of being expected to have a home in the constituency Michael represented. And of not being allowed to put all the furniture on expenses. Sarah is also at pains to point out she is not writing the book to settle scores and that she now gets on better with Gove than she did when they were married.And yet the book is riddled with score-settling and much of it reads as a passive-aggressive attack on her ex-husband. Michael comes across as insecure, needy and vain. She writes of her horror at absentee fathers and in the next paragraph tells of Gove reading a book while she was in labour. And when they moved house, Gove just lay on the bed doing nothing. If this is Sarah writing with love, I’d hate to see her when she’s angry.WednesdayThere’s a first time for everything. After decades of supporting Spurs with little to show for it, the club chairman has finally done something with which I agree. He hasfired the manager, Ange Postecoglou. A sacking that seems to have spiralled the club into near civil war. For some fans, Ange can do no wrong. He delivered a first European trophy in over 40 years and for that all previous sins are forgiven.For others, myself included, none of this could make up for the run of dismal form in the Premier League that saw Spurs finish one place above relegation. Never before can I remember walking up Tottenham High Road, week in, week out, feeling like such a chore.It is the reaction of the players that has been most telling. They normally take the sacking of a manager in their stride – a normal career hazard – and keep their heads down, ready for the next one. But this time, many of them have gone out of their way to speak up for Ange. Thanking himfor Bilbao, thanking him for standing by them, thanking him for his steadfastness of purpose. Which has left me wondering what the players thought of their league form. Did they think it was OK to look clueless, as if they were not really trying for much of the season? Was losing so many games really part of the plan? Does a trophy really justify everything? I think not. Worryingly, the players disagree. Thenew manager, Thomas Frank, may have his work cut out.ThursdayView image in fullscreenWith friends like these … Lily Allen ranks friends in order of who she likes best.Photograph: XNY/Star Max/GC ImagesSometimes I can’t help feeling that being a celebrity must feel like awfully hard work. TakeLily Allenwho has declared she ranks all her friends in order of who she likes best. Then – and this is the best part – she gets her assistant to schedule time in her day for her to get in touch with the lucky few who are near the top of the list and for which she may have time. Lucky them.Perhaps this is also normal in some circles. But even if you’re a bona fide A-lister like David Beckham you still have to work ridiculously hard to stay still. There’s the Netflix documentary in which ordinary people are invited to gawp at you hanging your shirts in a row. Personally I’d like to remain a mess in private.David is getting a knighthood. Something he’s apparently been covetous of for years. Just think of being the sort of person whose life goal was to become a sir. All those pointless establishment hoops you have to jump through only to find you’re still only there under sufferance. It all just feels a little sad. But maybe in celebworld it marks you out as a somebody. A sign you’ve finally arrived.FridayMy good friend Simon recently passed on something his father-in-law had told him many years ago. That getting old is like being given a prison sentence for a crime you haven’t committed. I now know what he was getting at. Don’t get me wrong, this isn’t a moanathon. As Woody Allen once said, getting old is better than the alternative. And I do know I am a lucky man. I could easily have died several times before I reached the age of 30 and I have a lovely family, good friends and a job I enjoy. It’s just that I feel like I am getting down to the business end of life. The time when things start to get serious.Take the last 12 months or so. It started with mehaving a heart attack in March last year. I had unbelievable treatment from the hospital staff but it’s left its mark. I feel more vulnerable, more mortal than I did before. It was a memento mori. My knee is also swollen and falling apart and I’m in constant discomfort. I had a knee replacement 13 years ago and it is reaching the end of its shelf life. But I can’t yet be bothered to go back to the surgeon as I can’t face another painful operation. And that’s just me.My mum diedin March.My dog diedthe following month. Plus I have also lost three other friends, one Simon and two Barrys. If you’re called Barry and you know me, I suggest you change your name.Nor does it look like life is going to get easier. All I can do is try to keep in the moment. Enjoy what I’ve got. Take it a day at a time, as they say in Narcotics Anonymous. Try to keep things as normal as possible until the time they become abnormal. So my tour goes on. My Brighton show at the Komedia on 22 June was sold out, but it has been moved to a bigger venue so tickets are now available once more. I’m also at Buxton Opera House on 23 July. Please do come. We can have a laugh and commiserate. Onwards and upwards.Digested week in picturesView image in fullscreen‘Wow.

Down one path lay negotiations that, while difficult, promised benefits to the citizens of both countries. Down the other path, a protracted war that promised little more than destruction.Back in 2018,Donald Trumphad blocked the diplomatic path by tearing up the existing nuclear agreement with Iran – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But since beginning his second term in January he has been surprisinglyopen to negotiations with Tehran. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seemed ready to go along.But theIsraeliprime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has now decided for them in favor of the path of war, and despite initial hesitation, Trump now appears to be following him. Thoughuniquely positionedto rein in Netanyahu – more than any US president in decades – Trump has jumped on his bandwagon.Benjamin Netanyahu must be stopped | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreAfter entering office, Trump rightly pursued a deal that would offer Iran sanctions relief in return for an end to its nuclear weapons program. This deal would have served the interests of both parties. The risk of an Iranian nuclear breakout would have been greatly reduced, thus reducing pressure on other regional and global powers to pursue nuclear weapons themselves. Global energy markets would have benefited. The United States could have meanwhile pursued the drawdown of its military forces in the region, thus furthering a goal of every US president since Barack Obama. Improved US relations with Iran would also have helped to complicate Iran’sdeepening tiesto Russia and China.But the Israeli government wanted none of this and has therefore spoiled the Trump administration’s negotiations. The Israeli government claims that Iran was days away from a bomb and that it had no choice but to attack. This is hard to believe. For years, experts, including theUS intelligence community, have estimated it would take months if not years for Iran to not only produce enough highly enriched uranium but to also build a bomb with it. If this timeline had changed in recent days, the US would almost certainly have joined Israel in these strikes.The strikes also will not end Iran’s nuclear program. The damage will be real, and military operations are ongoing, but Israel is ultimately only capable of destroying parts of Iran’s program. The destruction of the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz is a setback for Iran, but these facilities can be rebuilt. The assassination of Iran’s nuclear scientists is a blow, but their knowledge can also be replaced over time. History shows that so-calleddecapitation strikescan have a near-term effect, but they rarely work in the long term. Even if the United States now joins Israel in strikes, this will not eliminate Iran’s weapons program entirely without a regime change operation against Tehran. That strategy would repeat the tragic errors of the 2003 Iraq war, but on an even larger scale.Iran’s nuclear weapons program will thus remain in some form. But hope of negotiations to control it is now badly damaged. The result is the worst of both worlds: a vengefulIraneven more determined to get nuclear weapons and no hope of negotiating a way out.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has wiselyattempted to distancethe United States from Israel’s attack. Trump, however, whoinitially tried to rein in Israel’s attack, has now tried to use it as leverage to get Tehran to sign up for his deal. Aligning America so closely with Israel at this juncture is only likely to draw the United States more deeply into the conflict and expose it to Iranian reprisals.The Guardian view on Israel’s shock attack on Iran: confusing US signals add to the peril | EditorialRead moreAs a negotiating tactic it is also unlikely to work. The autocrats in Tehran cannot allow themselves to be visibly coerced into a deal lest it damage their domestic legitimacy. Some powerful Iranian officials moreoverbenefit from the status quounder sanctions, which have enriched a powerful few at the cost of the Iranian people.Israel’s audacious move is another example of US partners seizing the strategic initiative from Trump. Israel’s strikes come on the heels of the decision by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to strike deep intoRussiawith drones at the very moment the US was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire with Moscow.With the US focused on the turmoil theTrump administrationis whipping up domestically, and so much uncertainty about the trajectory of Trump’s global policy goals, other actors are probably going to do the same. Unless the administration can find the discipline and focus to get control over its own foreign policy, the United States risks getting dragged into more conflicts that will not serve the interests of the American people.Chris Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationIsraelIranUkraineRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

So why does the industry still hold governments to ransom?Fri 13 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 12.44 EDTShareIhave been saying this a lot recently: “At last!” At last, a mainstream film bluntly revealing the plunder of our seas. At last, a proposed ban on bottom trawling in so-called “marine protected areas” (MPAs). At last, some solid research on seabed carbon and the vast releases caused by the trawlers ploughing it up. But still I feel that almost everyone is missing the point.David Attenborough’sOceanfilm, made for National Geographic, is the one I’ve been waiting for all my working life. An epoch ago, when I worked in the BBC’s Natural History Unit in the mid-1980s, some of us lobbied repeatedly for films like this, without success. Since then, even programmes that purport to discuss marine destruction have carefully avoided the principal cause: the fishing industry. The BBC’sBlue Planet IIandBlue Planet Liveseries exemplified the organisation’s perennial failure of courage.You can see the results in public beliefs. While assessments have long shown that the primary reason for thedestruction of marine lifeis overfishing, in a poll last year, people in the UKplaced it fourth. Eating our fish dinners while shaking our heads at the state of the oceans, we have been systematically misled by those whose job is to inform us.Maybe Ocean will change that. The great public enthusiasm for the film shows, yet again, thatthe mantra endlessly recitedby broadcasters – environmental issues turn away viewers – is false. You just have to do it, as this film does, powerfully and well.Thegovernment’s announcementthat trawling and scallop dredging will be banned from half of England’s MPAs is welcome. But this should be seen as the very least it could do. Conservationists have beencalling for yearsfor these protected areas to be, well, protected from the major cause of destruction. While heralded as a great step forward, the new policy is actually a step back from the Tory position:the Conservatives planned“to protect all 54 English offshore MPAs from fishing activity by the end of 2024”.It also falls far short ofthe call last weekby the House of Commons environmental audit committee for full protection of MPAs, and the achievement of “good environmental status” for our seas. The statutory deadline for reaching this status was 2020, but we are still nowhere near. Nor does the new policy take us anywhere close to the promise of “30x30”: the protection of 30% of our land and sea by 2030. How will the government close this gap?Labour keeps slicing and dicing the problem. The new measures are intended to protect particular seabed features and particular species. But the fishing industry trashes everything. A government spokesperson told me “a full ban across MPAs is not needed as some MPAs are designated solely for highly mobile species such as birds”. But what about mobile species such as fish? In fact, almost all marine animals, at some point in their life cycles, are highly mobile.The spokesperson said protection was needed only where particular features occurred. Why might large areas of seabed possess no valuable features? Because they have been ploughed out by trawlers. Much of the bed of the North Sea, for example, wasonce covered with a biotic crustof oysters and beautiful sessile animals. Now it’s mostly bare mud, sand and gravel, and deemed unworthy of protection. But if boats stopped ploughing it, the crust would recover. Good environmental status requires very large areas closed to destructive fishing techniques, regardless of what currently survives there.Some of us had long speculated that trawling and dredging must release large amounts of carbon from the seabed. But data on the issue was remarkably slow in coming. Now, at last,solid researchhas begun, and we find that it is indeed a major problem, adding even more to the costs that the fishing industry imposes on society and the living planet.But in almost all public discussion of these issues, including Ocean, I feel the problem has been framed the wrong way round. Nearly everyone seems to agree that we should carve out some areas of sea from the fishing industry and other destructive forces. The implication is that the default state of the seas is exploitation, from which we should make exceptions.But as the marine campaigner Deborah Rowan Wrighthas long argued, it makes more sense to reverse this presumption. The default position should be protection, from which we might exclude some places (the least fragile) where some fishing activities (the least damaging) are permitted. Such residual fishing should be concentrated in the hands of local coastal communities, rather thancaptured by the huge industrial combinesthat, as Ocean showed, are snatching food from the people who need it most.This would cause the mother of all “spillover effects”. Spillover is what happens when fish and shellfish are allowed to breed and grow undisturbed in protected places: in many cases, as their offspring spread into surrounding waters, total fish catches increase, even though the area in which fishing is permitted has shrunk. If killing were allowed in only a minority of places, far less fishing effort would be required to catch more and bigger fish.Even then, we should remember that fish are wildlife, not “seafood”. They are not put on Earth for our consumption. They do not exist in “stocks”, but in populations and ecosystems. There is no such thing as “underexploited” or “underfished”, though these terms have long featured in the lexicon of official bodies and compliant scientists.The extraordinary thing isjust how tinythis industry is, yet it seems to hold the world’s governments to ransom. Last month, the British government announced that it was giving£360m to the fishing industry“to drive growth and boost the sector”. Why? The government’s own figures show that fishing costs us far more than it makes: it estimates that the proposed ban on trawling in half of England’s MPAs willcost UK businesses and public bodies £7.8m, while delivering “benefits from enhanced environmental protection” of approximately £3.1bn. Why the hell should public money, withheld from public services in desperate need, be spent on fishing, the most destructive of all private industries?I’ve watched for 40 years as governments, protected by timid broadcasters, have wasted every opportunity to prevent ecological collapse. As they assemble in France forthe UN Ocean Conference, they should pledge not to waste another day.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFishingOpinionOceansEnglandMarine lifeConservationWildlifeAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

Israel’s strikes on Iran – falsely described as pre-emptive – are the latest exampleFri 13 Jun 2025 13.19 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 13.37 EDTShareBenjamin Netanyahumust be stopped. The Israeli prime minister’s lust for war as a solution to his myriad problems is nothing short of a threat to us all, one that extends far beyond Israel’s neighbors. Netanyahu knows no other way. War is his doctrine. War is his reflex. War is his answer. He believes the power of war will unite Israeli society and will stifle any American criticism of him, necessary since the machinery he needs to make his wars comes mostly from Washington. And, with his aggression against Iran, he seeks to drag the United States further into another endless military quagmire in the region and light the world on fire.Early on Friday morning, Israel launched a series of unprovoked strikes against Iran, targeting Iran’s nuclear energy facilities, its top scientists, its military commanders, and parts of its military and civilian infrastructure. Television imagesshowa residential building in Tehran damaged by what looks like a missile attack. Iran, which has not suffered an assault this severe since its war with Iraq in the 1980s, isreportingat least 70 people killed and 320 injured thus far. Meanwhile, Israel’sgenocidal campaign in Gazacontinues out of the public eye, as aninternet blackouthalted most aid operations.Netanyahu argues that the Israeli attack on Iran was a “pre-emptive strike” against a clandestine nuclear weapons program. But that’s simply a lie. A “pre-emptive” strike requires an imminent threat of invasion or military force. Iran was not imminently about to attack Israel, with or without a nuclear weapon. What Israel engaged in last night was better described by its defense minister as a “preventive” strike against an opponent’s infrastructure.Regardless of what you think about Iran’s nuclear energy program, about the status ofnegotiationswith the United States regarding its nuclear program, or about recentpressurethe International Atomic Energy Agency has brought on Iran, a preventive strike by Israel against a sovereign nation is a blatant act of aggression. It is fundamentally illegal under international law and will further erode the prospect of sovereign states living in peace and security with each other.Iran has long claimed that it is only pursuing a civilian nuclear energy program and has no ambition to make a nuclear weapon. That might also be a lie, but who would blame them for wanting such a deterrent now? It’s widelyunderstoodthat North Korea’s nuclear arsenal effectively functions as a deterrent against an American attack, after all.Israel, which isbelievedto have about 90 nuclear warheads and enough plutonium for many more,refusesto sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the only country in the region to do so. That refusal has also made thelong desired goalof a nuclear-free Middle East impossible.And anyway, there’s always been something deeply racist about which country is or is not permitted to develop nuclear weapons. In a briefingpaper, the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons states that “racism is ingrained in nuclear weapons history and doctrine”, and that non-western states are regarded “as ‘irrational’, ‘emotional’ and somehow ‘less capable’ of negotiating a Treaty than Western governments”. Let’s remember that the United States is the only country to use a nuclear weapon. Twice. As the briefing paperpointsout, the US “public widely supported the bombing partly due to anti-Japanese racism, depicting Japanese people in subhuman terms, in some cases fit for extermination”.Netanyahu needs his external enemies to survive his internal divisions. A day before launching this aggression on Iran, his coalition barely survived a vote to dissolve parliament. (The issue driving the vote was the compulsory military service of ultra-Orthodox men.) As war with Iran has now become a very real possibility, talks about his fragile coalition will recede. This is the same Netanyahu whopropped up Hamas for yearsto thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state. This is the same Netanyahu whobroke the ceasefirein Gaza in March of this year. This is the same Netanyahu who, in the latest negotiations about a ceasefire in Gaza, reportedlywon’t even agree to Hamas relinquishing power in Gaza, so dependent is he on creating and maintaining external enemies for his own survival.Is Donald Trump getting dragged into a war of Netanyahu’s making or is he willingly joining a partnership of aggressors? Netanyahu hassaidthe US knew about the attack in advance, but even if the US is sleepwalking its way into war, the prospect of another US-sponsored conflagration is a terrible one (and certainly won’t get Trump his much-desired Nobel peace prize). If there is one thing the people of this region do not need, it is more war, the effects of which could also reverberate terribly around Europe and the rest of the world.Where are the European leaders now? Will Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Friedrich Merz stand up to Netanyahu and Trump? Will they use some real power to reject Netanyahu’s warmaking barbarism, based as it is on naked domination, supremacy, violence and conquest, or will we hear only vague and useless platitudes about “restraint” after the fact? Western European leaders constantly talk about how much they value peace, justice, equality and the rule of law. Now is the time to put those words into practice.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIrancommentShareReuse this content"

I imagine that Thursday’s events inLos Angelesmight be spoken of like this:A prominent opposition leader was attacked by regime security forces on Thursday in the presence of the national security tsar, as he voiced opposition to the federal military occupation of the US’s second-largest city following street demonstrations against the regime’s mass deportation efforts.Alex Padilla, a senator from California, was pushed against a wall,removed from the room, and then tackled to the ground and handcuffed, reportedly by Secret Service and FBI agents, at a press conference in LA byDonald Trump’s homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem. He was trying to ask a question about the deployment of marines and national guard forces to LA in his capacity as Angelenos’ elected representative. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, was later released; Noem, speaking to reporters after the incident, said both that she knew the senator and that agents tackled and detained him because neither she nor they knew who he was. In a video of the attack, Padilla can be heard identifying himself as a senator as Noem’s security forces begin to grab and shove him.Trump’s insurrection routine: fuel violence, spawn chaos, shrug off the law | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreSeconds later, after he has been pushed out of the room, Padilla can be heard yelling to the men attacking him: “Hands off!” The video cuts out after a man steps in front of the camera to block the shot, and tells the person filming, “there is no recording allowed here, per FBI rights,” something of an odd statement to make at a press conference. Several federal court decisions have upheld the right to record law enforcement.The violence toward a sitting senator is yet another escalation of the administration’s dramatic assertions of extra-constitutional authority, and another item in their ongoing assertion of the illegitimacy of dissent, even from elected leaders. In responding with violence toward the senator’s question, Noem, her security forces and by extension theTrump administrationmore broadly, are signaling that they will treat opposition, even from elected officials, as insubordination.They do not see senators as equals to be negotiated with or spoken to in good faith, because they do not believe that any of the people’s representatives – and certainly not a Democrat – has any authority that they need to respect. Padilla, like the people of Los Angeles and the people of the United States, was not treated by theTrump administrationas a citizen, but as a subject.The attack on Padilla by security forces, and the viralvideoof him being tackled to the ground and handcuffed by armed men, has threatened to overshadow the content of Noem’s press conference, which underscored in rhetoric this same sense of absolute authority and contempt for dissent that the attack on the senator demonstrated with action.Noem was inLos Angelesto tout the administration’s military escalation against citizens there, who have taken to the streets as part of a growing protest movement against Trump’s mass deportation scheme, which has led to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) kidnapping of many Angelenos and left families, colleagues, neighbors and friends bereft of their beloved community members.The protests have been largely peaceful – Ice and police have initiated violence against some demonstrators – but the Trump administration has taken them as an opportunity to crush dissent with force. The deployment of the California national guard – in violation of a law that requires the administration to secure cooperation from the governor – and the transfer of 700 marines to the city has marked a new willingness of the Trump administration to use military force against citizens who oppose its policies.But to the Trump administration, the Americans who have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to Trump policies are no Americans at all. “We are not going away,” Noem said of the military occupation of Los Angeles. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists.” By this, she meant the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, and California governor, Gavin Newsom, who are not socialists but Democrats.The term – “liberate” – evokes the US’s imperialist adventures abroad, in which such rhetoric was used to provide rhetorical cover for the toppling of foreign regimes, many of them democratically elected. The people’s elected representatives – be it Newsom or Bass or Padilla – are not figures they need to be “liberated” from. That is, not unless you consider the only legitimate “people” to be Trump supporters, and the only legitimate governance to be Republican governance.Why are people so triggered by the Mexican flag at the LA protests? | Daniel PeñaRead moreTrump, as he expands his authoritarian ambitions and uses more and more violence to pursue them, has made his own will into the sum total of “the will of the people”. All those other people – the ones marching in the streets, and trying to stop the kidnappings of their neighbors – don’t count.A few hours after Noem’s goons attacked Padilla, a federal district court judge ordered the Trump administration to relinquish control over the California national guard, agreeing with California that the guard had been illegally seized when Trump assumed control of the armed units without Newsom’s consent. “That’s the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” said district judge Charles Breyer in a hearing on the case earlier that day. “It’s not that the leader can simply say something and then it becomes it.”The judge was pointing to the constitutional order, to the rule of law, to the guarantees, once taken for granted, that the president has limits on his power. He gave the Trump administration about 18 hours to hand control of the national guard back to the state of California. It was not immediately clear whether they would comply. Hours later, an appeals courtplaced a temporary blockon Breyer’s order, returning control of the California national guard to Trump. So much for us having a “law and order” president.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsOpinionUS politicsLos AngelesUS SenateTrump administrationDonald TrumpKristi NoemcommentShareReuse this content"

The threat of fascism is backOpen letterAs in 1925, when Mussolini was in power, we must openly defy the brutal imposition of the fascist ideologyFri 13 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareOn 1 May 1925, with Benito Mussolini already in power, a group of Italian intellectuals publicly denounced his fascist regime in an open letter. The signatories – scientists, philosophers, writers and artists – took a stand in support of the essential tenets of a free society: the rule of law, personal liberty and independent thinking, culture, art and science. Their open defiance against the brutal imposition of the fascist ideology – at great personal risk – proved that opposition was not only possible, but necessary. Today, 100 years later, the threat of fascism is back – and so we must summon that courage and defy it again.Fascism emerged in Italy a century ago, marking the advent of modern dictatorship. Within a few years, it spread across Europe and the world, taking different names but maintaining similar forms. Wherever it seized power, it undermined the separation of powers in the service of autocracy, silenced opposition through violence, took control of the press, halted the advancement of women’s rights and crushed workers’ struggles for economic justice. Inevitably, it permeated and distorted all institutions devoted to scientific, academic and cultural activities. Its cult of death exalted imperial aggression and genocidal racism, triggering the second world war, the Holocaust, the death of tens of millions of people and crimes against humanity.At the same time, the resistance to fascism and the many other fascist ideologies became a fertile ground for imagining alternative ways of organising societies and international relations. The world that emerged from the second world war – with the charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the theoretical foundations of the EU and the legal arguments against colonialism – remained marked by deep inequalities. Yet, it represented a decisive attempt to establish an international legal order: an aspiration toward global democracy and peace, grounded in the protection of universal human rights, including not only civil and political, but also economic, social and cultural rights.Fascism never vanished, but for a time it was held at bay. However, in the past two decades, we have witnessed a renewed wave of far-right movements, often bearing unmistakably fascist traits: attacks on democratic norms and institutions, a reinvigorated nationalism laced with racist rhetoric, authoritarian impulses and systematic assaults on the rights of those who do not fit a manufactured traditional authority, rooted in religious, sexual and gender normativity. These movements have re-emerged across the globe, including in long-standing democracies, where widespread dissatisfaction with political failure to address mounting inequalities and social exclusion has once again been exploited by new authoritarian figures. True to the old fascist script, under the guise of an unlimited popular mandate, these figures undermine national and international rule of law, targeting the independence of the judiciary, the press, institutions of culture, higher education and science, even attempting to destroy essential data and scientific information. They fabricate “alternative facts” and invent “enemies within”; they weaponise security concerns to entrench their authority and that of the ultra-wealthy 1%, offering privileges in exchange for loyalty.This process is now accelerating, as dissent is increasingly suppressed through arbitrary detentions, threats of violence, deportations and an unrelenting campaign of disinformation and propaganda, operated with the support of traditional and social media barons – some merely complacent, others openly techno-fascist enthusiasts.Democracies are not flawless: they are vulnerable to misinformation and they are not yet sufficiently inclusive. However, democracies by their nature provide fertile ground for intellectual and cultural progress and therefore always have the potential to improve. In democratic societies, human rights and freedoms can expand, the arts flourish, scientific discoveries thrive and knowledge grow. They grant the freedom to challenge ideas and question power structures, propose new theories even when culturally uncomfortable, which is essential to human advancement. Democratic institutions offer the best framework for addressing social injustices, and the best hope to fulfil the post-war promises of the rights to work, education, health, social security, participation in cultural and scientific life, and the collective right of peoples to development, self-determination and peace. Without this, humanity faces stagnation, growing inequality, injustice and catastrophe, not least from the existential threat caused by the climate emergency that the new fascist wave negates.In our hyper-connected world, democracy cannot exist in isolation. As national democracies require strong institutions, international cooperation relies on the effective implementation of democratic principles and multilateralism to regulate relations among nations, and on multistakeholder processes to engage a healthy society. The rule of law must extend beyond borders, ensuring that international treaties, human rights conventions and peace agreements are respected. While existing global governance and international institutions require improvement, their erosion in favor of a world governed by raw power, transactional logic and military might is a regression to an era of colonialism, suffering and destruction.As in 1925, we scientists, philosophers, writers, artists and citizens of the world have a responsibility to denounce and resist the resurgence of fascism in all its forms. We call on all those who value democracy to act:Defend democratic, cultural and educational institutions. Call out abuses of democratic principles and human rights. Refuse pre-emptive compliance.Join collective actions, locally and internationally. Boycott and strike when possible. Make resistance impossible to ignore and costly to repress.Uphold facts and evidence. Foster critical thinking and engage with your communities on these grounds.This is an ongoing struggle. Let our voices, our work and our principles be a bulwark against authoritarianism. Let this message be a renewed declaration of defiance.Nobel laureates: Eric Maskin, Roger B Myerson, Alvin E Roth, Lars Peter Hansen, Oliver Hart, Daron Acemoglu, Wolfgang Ketterle, John C Mather, Brian P Schmidt, Michel Mayor, Takaaki Kajita, Giorgio Parisi, Pierre Agostini, Joachim Frank, Richard J Roberts, Leland Hartwell, Paul Nurse, Jack W Szostak, Edvard I Moser, May-Britt Moser, Harvey James Alter, Victor Ambros, Gary Ruvkun, Barry James Marshall, Craig Mello, Charles RiceLeading scholars on fascism and democracy: Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Timothy Snyder, Jason Stanley, Claudia Koonz, Mia Fuller, Giovanni De Luna and Andrea MammoneThe full list of signatories can be foundhereExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

The state departmentquickly declaredthat thedevastating overnight Israeli attack on Iran– which killedkey military commanders and nuclear scientistsas well as striking its missile capacity and a nuclear enrichment site – was unilateral. Mr Trump had reportedly urged Mr Netanyahu to hold off in a call on Monday, pending US talks with Iran over its nuclear programmedue this weekend. The suspicion is that Israel feared that a deal might be reached and wanted to strike first. But Israeli officials havebriefedthat they had a secret green light from the US, with Mr Trump only claiming to oppose it.Iran, reeling from the attack but afraid of looking too weak to retaliate, isunlikely to believethat the US did not acquiesce to the offensive, if unenthusiastically. It might suit it better to pretend otherwise – in the short term, it is not clear what ability it has to hit back at Israel, never mind taking on the US. But Mr Trump has made that hard bythreatening“even more brutal attacks” ahead, urging Iran to “make a deal, before there’s nothing left” and claiming that “we knew everything”. Whether Israel really convinced Mr Trump that this was the way to cut a deal, or he is offering a post-hoc justification after being outflanked by Mr Netanyahu, may no longer matter.Israel has become increasingly and dangerously confident of its ability to reshape the Middle East without pushing it over the brink. It believes that its previous pummellings of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran’s air defences have created a brief opportunity to destroy the existential threat posed by the Iranian nuclear programme before it is too late. Russia is not about to ride to Tehran’s rescue, and whileGulf states don’t want instability, they are not distraught to see an old rival weakened.But not least in the reckoning is surely that Mr Netanyahu, who survives politically through military action, onlynarrowly survived a Knesset votethis week. The government also faces mounting international condemnation over its war crimes in Gaza – though the US and others allow those crimes to continue. It is destroying the nation’s international reputation, yet may bolster domestic support through this campaign.The obvious question is the future of a key Iranian enrichment site deep underground at Fordo, which many believe Israel could not destroy without US “bunker busters”. If Israel believes that taking out personnel and some infrastructure is sufficient to preclude Iran’s nuclear threat, that is a huge and perilous gamble. This attack may well trigger a rush to full nuclear-armed status by Tehran – and ultimately others – and risks spurringmore desperate measuresin the meantime. Surely more likely is that Israel hopes to draw in Washington, by persuading it that Iran is a paper tiger or baiting Tehran into attacking US targets.“My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” Mr Trump claimed in his inaugural speech. Yet on Friday he said was not concerned about a regional war breaking out due to Israel’s strikes. Few will feel so sanguine. The current incoherence and incomprehensibility ofUS foreign policyfuels instability and risks drawing adversaries towards fateful miscalculations.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In that context, increasing diversity could be read as a measure of progress; a peace dividend after the Troubles. That isn’t how it has felt to families cowering in fear of racist mobs this week. The riotsstartedin Ballymena, ostensibly triggered by the arrest of two boys, reported to be of Romanian origin, accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl. A community vigil mutated into a racist rampage. Masked thugs targeted the local migrant population. When police came to quell the pogrom,officerswere attacked with bricks, fireworks, petrol bombs. There was contagion. Windows were smashed and a fire started at a leisure centre in nearby Larne that had been used as a temporary refuge for those fleeing the Ballymena violence. There were outbreaks of disorder in other towns.Leaders from across Northern Ireland’s political spectrum have condemned the violence. But on theunionistside in particular, there has also been much leavening of opprobrium with reference to “legitimate” underlying grievances. Judiciously expressed, the complaint is that migration has been poorly managed, putting a strain on local services. In its more pungent iteration, it is the insinuation that new arrivals get preferential treatment, especially regarding housing.On thestreet, that degenerates into a miasma of hatred – a generalised accusation of parasitism and criminality imported by the foreigners. Rumour and disinformation, propagated online, accelerates collective movement through the gears from inchoate frustration to vigilante rampage.Northern Ireland is the least diverse part of the UK. Immigrants make up about 3.4% of the population, compared with 18.3% in England and Wales, and 12.9% in Scotland. But that comparison belies relatively rapid and concentrated demographic change in places such as Ballymena. And while sectarian violence is no longer endemic, the Troubles cast a shadow of intercommunal suspicion that makes it harder for outsiders to integrate. There is also a developed infrastructure of far-right extremism that evolved through close ties to loyalist paramilitaries.Those are distinct Northern Irish inflections on a problem that is far from unique to the region. The escalation from a single spark to a conflagration of violent bigotry is grimly familiar from theriotingthat erupted across the UK last summer. Then it was the murder of three young girls inSouthportthat became the pretext for a malevolent carnival of xenophobic rage. Then, too, it was possible to excavate a kernel of socioeconomic grievance from the ashes.It is always worth tracking the underlying forces that lead to public disorder. But that analysis can also be used to sanitise and normalise the kind of political rhetoric that makesscapegoats of migrantsand inflames the grievances it purports to address. There is no justifiable pathway from a complaint about inadequate public service provision and fear of crime to terrorising innocent people, destroying public amenities and attacking the police.There areplacesacross the UK where deprivation and social alienation, simmering for years, can be mobilised as racist violence. There is a line between acknowledging the social conditions that make such a danger possible and narrating those conditions in ways that make violence more likely. The boundary is not hard to see, which brings all the more shame on the politicians who routinely cross it.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Rupa Huq, the Labour MP for Ealing Central, said the cost of living crisis would make assisted dying “quite attractive” to people who were struggling.“We know that BAME communities have lower disposable household income than standard households, and you can just imagine relatives in a housing crisis wanting to speed up grandad’s probate to get a foot on the ladder; or granny or nanny, ma or daddy even convincing themselves that, ‘look, they’d be better off out of the way given the cost of care’,” Huq said.Caroline Voaden, the Liberal Democrat MP for South Devon, recalled the death of her husband, who she said had been “in extreme pain” with terminal oesophageal cancer, and urged her colleagues to “mind our language” after words like “murder” were used.“This is about helping people die in a civilised way and helping their families not go through a horrendous experience of watching a loved one die in agony,” Voaden said.MPs voted in favourof a proposal by Kim Leadbeater, who is sponsoring the bill, to ban advertisements about assisted dying. But they rejected a separate proposal from the Labour MP Paul Waugh for tighter regulations which would have limited any exceptions to this ban. Waugh said he hoped “enough MPs now realise that it is not fit for purpose”.The bill passed its first stage by a majority of 55 in November. Since then more than a dozen MPs arethought to have switched sidesto oppose the bill, though at least three have moved to support it.A number of other amendments were passed on Friday, including a provision for assisted deaths to not automatically be referred to a coroner and an attempt to regulate substances for use in assisted dying. Demonstrators for and against the bill gathered outside parliament to make their views heard.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The government is neutral on the legislation.Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, said parliament had spent more than 90 hours debating the proposals so far, and more than 500 amendments had been considered at the committee stage.Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingnewsShareReuse this content"

Her decision to put the museum first is to be applauded and appreciated. I know this was not an easy decision. She put the needs of the Institution above her own, and for that we thank her,” Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian secretary, wrote in a Friday internal email that was obtained by multiple outlets.“We are grateful to Kim for leading the National Portrait Gallery with passion and creativity for 12 years. Throughout her tenure, she has reimagined and reshaped the impact and storytelling of portraiture.”The Dutchwoman guiding the gallery of America’s most famous facesRead moreThe announcement comes after the Smithsonian Institution earlier this weekrebuffed Trump’s attempt to fire Sajet,with the museum’s governing board asserting its independence and turning away the president’s claim of authority over the institution’s staffing.Trump announced on 30 May that he had fired Sajet, calling her a “highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position”.His attack focused, among other reasons, on her Democratic political donations and her rejection of a pro-Trump painting by artist Julian Raven. Sajet reportedly told Raven his artwork was “too pro-Trump” and “too political” for the gallery, the artist toldthe Washingtonianin 2019.In a statement on Monday, the Smithsonian’s board of regents declared that “all personnel decisions are made by and subject to the direction of the secretary, with oversight by the board”. The statement did not name Sajet or mention theTrump administrationdirectly.Following Trump’s announcement, Sajet continued reporting to work throughout early June, creating a direct confrontation between the White House and the Smithsonian Institution – the country’s flagship cultural institution that has a 178-year-old governance structure built against political interference.Appointed in 2013, Sajet became the National Portrait Gallery’s first female director. Kevin Gover, undersecretary for museums and culture, has replaced her as acting director of the museum.In a statement shared by the internal memo on Friday, Sajet said it had been “the honor of a lifetime to lead the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery”.“This was not an easy decision, but I believe it is the right one,” she wrote. “From the very beginning, my guiding principle has been to put the museum first. Today, I believe that stepping aside is the best way to serve the institution I hold so deeply in my heart.“The role of a museum director has never been about one individual – it is a shared mission, driven by the passion, creativity, and dedication of an extraordinary team.”A statement from a White House spokesperson, David Ingle, reads: “On day one,President Trumpmade clear that there is no place for dangerous anti-American ideology in our government and institutions.“In align with this objective, he ordered the termination of Kim Sajet. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring American greatness and celebrating our nation’s proud history.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpDEI policiesUS politicsArtnewsShareReuse this content"

They included Russell George, who represents Montgomeryshire in the Welsh Senedd and is now listed as an independent after he was suspended from the Tory group, and Thomas James, the suspended director of the Welsh Conservatives.Williams, who has been charged with cheating at gambling and three counts of enabling or assisting others to cheat, gave no intention of how he would plead. Nor did two others: Jacob Wilmer, a former government special adviser from Richmond, west London, and Jeremy Hunt, an ex-police officer from Horne in Surrey who was part of Sunak’s Metropolitan police close protection unit.The defendants could face prison sentences of up to two years if convicted.Williams served as parliamentary private secretary to Sunak between October 2022 and June 2024.Williams and the other defendants spoke briefly to confirm their names and provide an address. All were released on unconditional bail. A preliminary hearing will be heard at Southwark crown court on 11 July.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

They split the following year and while they reunited to tour on a couple of occasions, More is their first album since.The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis gave ita four-star review, writing: “A reformed band’s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn’t the case with More.”The band arenow on tour, playing two nights at London’s O2 Arena this weekend before dates in Birmingham and Manchester.Thanks to healthy physical sales, Pulp beat the US pop star Addison Rae to the No 1 spot. She is at No 2 with her debut album Addison – another critically acclaimed release, with theGuardian’s Shaad D’Souza sayingits “casually incisive tone suggests Rae might be a great popflâneusein the vein of Madonna or Janet Jackson”. Lotus, the sixth album from British rapperLittle Simz, is at No 3, a career high for the 31-year-old.Pulp: More review – anthems and rage for the next life stageRead moreAt No 4,Sabrina Carpenter’s album Short n’ Sweet makes her the female artist with the longest running spell in the UK Top 5 – it hasn’t dropped out since its release in August last year. The previous record holder was Shania Twain, whose Come on Over had a 41-week run between 1999 and 2000.Carpenter caused an online stir this week with the announcement of her new album Man’s Best Friend, thanks to a cover image depicting Carpenter on her knees with a man holding her by the hair, which some viewers found degrading.The lead single from it,Manchild, went straight to No 1 in the singles chart. It dethrones Alex Warren’s Ordinary, whose 12-week run at the top was a record for an American artist.Explore more on these topicsPulpUK chartsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockIndienewsShareReuse this content"

It is believed the toilet was broken up and disposed of. None of the gold has been recovered.Sheen, of Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, had previously admitted burglary, conspiracy to transfer criminal property and one count of transferring criminal property. Jones, of Oxford, was found guilty of burglary after a trial.The artwork, which had previously been on display in New York City, was created by the Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan, and was plumbed in at the time of the heist, so its removal led to flooding and resulted in damage to the 18th-century stately home and Unesco world heritage site where Winston Churchill was born.Cattelan created the sculpture – called America – to reflect the excesses of the art market and evoke the American dream of opportunity for all. It was made from gold that was itself worth about £2.8m.Passing sentence, Judge Ian Pringle KC said: “This bold and brazen heist took no more than five-and-a-half minutes to complete. America has never been seen again.”Sheen was jailed for four years and his sentence will run consecutively to the 19 years and four-month sentence he is serving for attacks on cash machines, a museum burglary and fraud.“You were part of the gang of five men who smashed their way into Blenheim Palace that night and stole the hugely valuable golden toilet,” the judge said.“You were almost certainly the figure that carried the sledgehammer on which your DNA was found and which was used to sever the functioning toilet from its connecting pipes.“I say straight away I have no doubt at all that the sentence I pass must be consecutive to the sentence you are currently serving. Not to do so would be to send out a message that you did this without any penalty at all.”Pringle jailed Jones for 27 months after concluding he could not be sure he was part of the gang that had carried out the burglary. “You paid visits on two occasions to Blenheim Palace in the days leading up to the burglary,” he said.“That your role was to carry out a reconnaissance of the museum, to know exactly where the golden toilet was situated and to work out the quickest route in and out of the palace, I have absolutely no doubt whatsoever.“Although you have no witnesses to where you were on the night in question, I cannot be sure that you were part of the group of burglars who broke into the palace that night.”Gold from the toilet may have been smuggled out of the UK as police hunt a “significant amount” in criminal assets linked to the thieves behind the heist.Sheen is believed to have had the toilet broken up before he tried selling the parts to underworld contacts, prompting searches in Birmingham and Hatton Garden in London, Thames Valley police said.But the force said it was working with international partners and had not ruled out the chance that the gold was moved overseas. Det Supt Bruce Riddell told PA media: “It could have got abroad.”He said the next stage of the investigation was the identification and recovery of criminal assets, including luxury goods bought after the crime.Riddell said the investigation after the toilet theft was “complex”, with hundreds of hours of CCTV footage reviewed, more than 2,000 statements recovered, mobile devices seized and 12 people arrested in total.Explore more on these topicsOxfordshireEnglandCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

New study aimed to find outResearch looked at records of 14,800 people in Bradford to see what happened after they moved to more polluted areaGary FullerFri 13 Jun 2025 01.00 EDTShareWhat happens to your mental and physical health when you move to an area with worse air pollution? That’s the subject of a fascinating new UK-basedstudy.Prof Rosie McEachan, the director ofNHS Born in Bradford, asked: “Do already unhealthy communities, who are often poorer members of our society, end up in unhealthier environments because no one else wants to live there; or is it the places themselves that are making people ill?”The researchers used information from theConnected Bradford database. This contains the health records of more than 800,000 people who have lived in Bradford, West Yorkshire, since 1970 that can be studied in an anonymised way. Specifically, the researchers looked at 14,800 people who relocated within the city during early 2021.With increasingevidence that air pollutionaffectsmental health, the researchers focused on prescriptions for drugs for common mental health problems including depression and anxiety. Before moving, 2,100 people were taking these drugs. The researchers then checked for prescriptions a year later.People without a prescription at the start of the study who relocated to an area with more particle air pollution had an 11% greater risk of developing a new mental health problem, compared with the other movers.Dr Mikel Subiza-Pérez, the lead author of the study, said: “We took account of the socioeconomic characteristics of each area, including income deprivation, employment deprivation, education, health deprivation, disability and crime.”Moving to an area with increased green space, as measured by satellite photographs, led to reductions in prescriptions for mental health drugs, but this depended on the quality of the local green space.Subiza-Pérez said: “It appears that living close to poor quality green spaces can worsen mental health. That makes sense if there is nothing for you in that space, or if you do not feel welcome or safe there because of current design and equipment. Many green spaces are not sufficiently equipped for people to use them comfortably, we need benches, shades and other stuff for people of all ages.”The study also revealed some of the difficulties faced by people with mental health problems. McEachan explained: “Our study clearly shows that people experiencing mental health problems tend to move more often and to areas with worse environmental quality, which, in turn, may impact their ability to recover.”The effects of moving to an area with worse air pollution are not confined to mental health.A 10-year study in southern Californiaalso showed that lung growth improved for children that moved to areas with less particle pollution. The opposite occurred in those who moved to more polluted places.A study of more than 10 million older peoplein the US showed that relocating to an area with different air pollution affected how long they lived.McEachan summarised the main message from theBradfordstudy: “If we want to make our cities healthier and happier places to live for all communities then we need to target investment in areas with greatest need. Policy makers should be considering initiatives to reduce pollution and improve the quality public realm space in inner-city areas via investment in regeneration, public transport and traffic reduction.”Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentPollutionwatchAir pollutionMental healthHealthPovertyInequalityBradfordfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The researchers calculated emissions from not only the parade route itself, but also the transport of the vehicles to the event and the upstream impact of producing fuel for the parade.The large quantity of emissions this activity is estimated to produce is equivalent to those from flying 4,700 people from North Carolina – where the parade helicopters are based – to the nation’s capital in first class.The calculation is probably an understatement as it does not include pollution from transporting thousands of people, horses and equipment to the parade, or other energy used for the event.Hanna Homestead, research analyst at the Institute for Policy Studies, noted the same kinds of vehicles deployed for the parade have also been used to transport napalm and other supplies to Vietnam, and are now being used by Israel in its siege on Gaza.“So we’re spending money to glorify a gas-guzzling equipment used for war, genocide and planetary destruction,” she said, “at the same time as critical services for populations at home and around the world are being slashed.”Reached for comment, a White House spokesperson, Anna Kelley, said the parade “will honor all of the military men and women who have bravely served our country, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedom”.The president reportedly sought to throw a similar tribute during his first term, inspired by Bastille Day celebrations in France, but was thwarted by the then secretary of defense, James Mattis.

The boundary conflict involved an ancient lagoon, depicted on the map.“The drawing depicted a lagoon brimming with rainwater,” says Ramón. Ravines were depicted forming below the high-altitude lagoon, indicating that it supplied watersheds further down – contrary to the typical flow where a watershed feeds into the lagoon.Ramón had discovered a long-forgotten ancient water management system conceived bythe Paltas, a pre-Incan civilisationthat inhabited the semi-arid region more than 1,000 years ago.View image in fullscreenGalo Ramón, a historian from Catacocha in Ecuador’s Loja province, discovered a map from 1792 that led to the discovery of an ancestral water-collection system in the area.Photograph: Alejo Reinoso/The GuardianRamón set out to recreate the Paltas’ lagoon system and, 40 years on, the region has enjoyed an environmental regeneration, offering solutions for Ecuador – which regularlyfaces severe droughts– and other parts of the world struggling to address water scarcity with limited resources.‘I’m switched off’: frustration and fatigue as power cuts keep Ecuador in the darkRead moreGalo Ramón was born in Catacocha, southernEcuador, in 1952, a time when access to water for drinking and irrigation was unreliable. As a young man, he moved to Quito for university and to pursue his career as a historian. Eventually, he directed his research towards the history of the Paltas canton in Catacocha’s province of Loja.“I was born in Paltas, where people have very little water. Although I don’t live there any more, I was eager to contribute with my knowledge,” he says.When Ramón began his research in Catacocha, an urban area with a population of 8,000, people barely had half an hour of water a day. “People here live in constant insecurity about the chances of rain,” says Ramón.The region has highly variable rainfall patterns due to its location at the convergence of two ocean currents – the Humboldt and South Equatorial.When the Humboldt current predominates, there is minimal rainfall, averaging about 300mm (12in) to 400mm a year. Approximately every seven years, when an El Niño occurs – warming sea surface temperatures – annual rainfall can rise to 4-5 metres.View image in fullscreenSan Vicente del Río in the Catacocha mountains, one of the main beneficiaries of the restored Paltas system.Photograph: Alexis Serrano Carmona/MongabayIn years with consistent rainfall, most of it occurs in just one or two months, with about70% falling in March and April. During this period, there are usually three to five intense tropical storms, when up to 850mm of rainfall can occur in the region – more than in many other parts of the country.But as the region has very steep, rocky and irregular soil with poor permeability, water rapidly runs off and waterways tend to dry out. From May to December, the region experiences no rain, strong winds and intense sunlight, which cause soil erosion and reduce moisture in the soil. Still, the Paltas people not only managed to survive but thrive in this environment.“So I began a historical investigation into the Paltas, including a series of Indigenous myths that still survive,” says Ramón, “as that, it seemed to me, could offer modern solutions to the problem of drought.”View image in fullscreenRamón indicates the lagoon he found on a map from 1792 drawn up as part of a land dispute between Indigenous communities and a Catacocha landowner.Photograph: Alejo Reinoso/GuardianRamón discovered that designs for the Pisaca lagoon were recorded in maps, wills, accounts of land disputes, property titles and interviews.He realised the Paltas had developed a system for sowing and harvesting water that involved collecting and infiltrating rainwater, groundwater and underground runoff (sowing) to recover it later when it reappeared in springs and wells downstream (harvesting).That system enabled the Paltas to regulate water flows and store water in aquifers for domestic use and irrigation during periods of drought. “The springs tend to increase significantly during the rainy months and then dry out by August due to poor soil permeability. Without the Paltas’ system, water runoff is rapid, so you don’t have a permanent source to feed the spring,” Ramón says.The main element of this system is the artificial lentic – or still water – wetland (cochain Quechua) created at high altitudes to collect rainwater during the rainy months. The Paltas built these lagoons on fractured rocky terrain – the permeability of the pond bottoms allowed for slow water infiltration and aquifers to recharge.View image in fullscreenAn artificial lentic wetland, orcochain Quechua, created at a high altitude to collect rainwater.Photograph: Alexis Serrano Carmona/Mongabay“Then they planted hydrophilic plants inside the lagoon, which developed roots that helped retain the water, slowing infiltration so that the lagoon could last all year,” says Ramón.As hydrophilic plants cover the surface of the lagoon, they also prevent excessive water evaporation. The Paltas also observed zones where plants retained their leaves even in the driest months of the year due to higher levels of soil moisture. This made it possible to follow the direction of the subsurface flow in the shallow aquifer.Little by little, the ancient water management system described in myths and stone carvings was aligned as a coherent wholeGalo Ramón, historian“The leaves are green because the aquifer is right below. So the Paltas observed that line of greenery in the dry months and were able to place the lagoons perfectly,” says Ramón.The Paltas also built small dams along rivers to control runoff during the rainy season, which infiltrated downstream, creating a wet microsystem that maintained soil moisture. They also cared for headwater forests that captured moisture from the mist and planted vegetation on slopes to reduce erosion and surface runoff.More than50 species of trees, shrubs and groundcover plantsemulating forest biodiversity enhanced the system, helping the Paltas retain water in their fields.View image in fullscreenThe Serpent lagoon, as it is known by the community, which was the first to be restored from the Paltas system.Photograph: Alexis Serrano Carmona/MongabayRamón and his colleagues noted the remains of those systems during fieldwork and interviewed local people, collecting stories and traditions.That was when Ramón deciphered the meaning of an Indigenous myth, that of “touro Cango” (Cango the bull), he had heard as a child.“The myth said that the bull, which was responsible for bringing rain, lived in Catacocha while there were lakes, as he liked the grass that only grew in them. If there were no grass, he would not eat,” says Ramón. “This means that when the lakes disappeared, the bull disappeared too, along with the rain.”The grasses that Cango the bull ate were hydrophilic plants essential to the wetland. “Little by little, the ancient water-management system described in myths, documents, petroglyphs and stone carvings was aligned as a coherent whole,” says Ramón.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Even gardens were abandoned because of a lack of water, which increased food insecurity. Pisaca lagoon was the last to dry out, less than a century ago.View image in fullscreenOne of the restored lagoons in the Pisaca hills, which provides water for people and crops.Photograph: Alexis Serrano Carmona/MongabayAs a result of the disappearance of the Paltas’ lagoon system, the Catacocha aquifers and springs became depleted, and water was available for only half an hour a day by 2001.In 2005, Ramón, who by then was the leader ofComunidec, a human rights foundation, decided to rebuild the Paltas’ lagoon system.Estefanía Maldonado, a constitutional rights lawyer who became involved with the foundation from the outset, says their goal at that stage was to empower peasant communities and civil society.Vilma Collaguazo, 44, who lives in Catacocha, began attending project meetings and workshops early on. She remembers that when she first heard of the plan, she didn’t believe it would work. “We had no idea how the lagoons were going to fill up, given that they were so big,” she says.Comunidec secured resources, and the project began with the restoration of the lagoon on the eastern slopes of Pisaca mountain between 2005 and 2008. It is now the largest, with a storage capacity of 78,420 cubic metres.View image in fullscreenThe local community working to reforest the Pisaca reserve.Photograph: José Romero“By the end of 2005, there were some hefty rains and the lagoons were filled,” Collaguazo recalls.“Since then, there was water almost year-round in the springs, and even new springs emerged. People had water to drink and for their crops, so we began to believe again.”In 2010, theNature and Culture International Foundationand bought 406 hectares (1,000 acres) of land around Pisaca, supported by Comunidec, to create a reserve, remove cattle and use the land to maintain the water system permanently.I live not far from the Pisaca lagoon and have plenty of water for my garden and my animals. It is truly a good thingAntonio Díaz, Catacocha residentBy 2013, 28 lagoons had been built, as well as other elements of the water management system, such astajamares(small dams or weirs) and water reservoirs, that had been part of the landscape more than 1,000 years ago.Since then, local people have reforested the area with native plants that reduce water evaporation, conserve moisture and protect the slopes. The project has increased Catacocha’s water availability from one to 10 hours daily and enhanced food security through community gardens, resulting in the creation of 250 lagoons and tajamares.Antonio Díaz, who has been involved with the project since 2005, has reaped the benefits. “I live not far from the Pisaca lagoon and have plenty of water for my little garden and my animals,” he says. “It is truly a good thing.”View image in fullscreenAntonio Díaz by the lagoon he uses to irrigate crops.Photograph: A Serrano Carmona/MongabayDespite its success in reducing water scarcity and food insecurity, successive governments in Ecuador have not been persuaded to invest in rebuilding the systems.“Perhaps politicians don’t see that it is an investment that will yield immediate returns,” Ramón says. “This year it rained little, so the hydroelectric plants lack water. When it rains, there is no runoff management. Ancient techniques allow you to do just that and could be a solution for all of Ecuador.”Maldonado believes that Catacocha demonstrates how water scarcity can be addressed with positive environmental outcomes and without significant investment.“Water is a constitutional right for all. Yet, how do you provide it to a rural community that may be in debt and lack the cashflow to carry out projects?” she asks.“We don’t necessarily need monumental projects to have water. We can also do it by recovering ancestral knowledge.”Explore more on these topicsGlobal developmentSouthern frontlines: Latin America and the CaribbeanAccess to waterEcuadorIndigenous peoplesAmericasDroughtWaterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They face charges carrying the death penalty, though their cases have not yet gone to trial. Captured by the CIA between 2002 and 2003, the men spent several years in secret prisons known as “black sites”.The tribunal heard how Hawsawi and Nashiri were held for several years incommunicado at the black sites, where they were “systematically” tortured and subjected to an array of brutal interrogation techniques, resulting in permanent physical and psychological damage.Lawyers for the men have argued there is credible evidence to infer that UK spy agencies, including MI5 andMI6, unlawfully aided, abetted, conspired or “were otherwise complicit” in their torture and serious mistreatment by the CIA.The government would “neither confirm nor deny” the allegations in open court, saying it had addressed the claims in secret proceedings before the tribunal, a special court with unique powers to obtain and consider classified evidence.However, the government admitted the intelligence agencies “were too slow to appreciate the risk of mistreatment to detainees in CIA detention” and “more detailed guidance should have been in place” to “cover their broader engagement with the US in this context”.Sam Raphael, a professor at the University of Westminster and expert on theCIA’s black site operations, said it was a “startling” admission that went further than previous official statements because it “appeared to explicitly concede for the first time that UK agencies were involved in the CIA’s detention programme”.Hawsawi and Nashiri’s lawyers argued that aiding or abetting torture and mistreatment by a foreign state would fall outside the scope oflegal powers such as section 7of the Intelligence Services Act 1994 – sometimes described as the “James Bond clause” – which creates protections for spies to commit criminal activities abroad.“They do not have unlimited powers,” said Hugh Southey KC, representing Nashiri. He argued that the law “cannot be interpreted as permitting the UK agencies to facilitate acts of torture”.While the government claimed the UK did not participate in, encourage or condone the use of torture or other forms of cruel treatment “for any purpose”, its lawyers said the intelligence agencies nevertheless possessed powers that could be used to authorise a broad range of criminal conduct.Edward Craven KC, for Hawsawi, urged the tribunal to “treat any denial of wrongdoing” by the intelligence agencies “with an appropriate degree of caution”. He noted that MI5 wasfacing allegationsthat it gave “false evidence” in a separate case before the tribunal.The tribunal will now hold a series of closed-door hearings, where the findings of its investigation will be considered in secret.Explore more on these topicsRenditionSeptember 11 2001MI5MI6CIATortureGuantánamo BaynewsShareReuse this content"

Ministers said the revenue would be used in part to recruit an additional 6,500 teachers for state schools.Thewritten rulingby Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Guy Newey and Mr Justice Chamberlain rejected a series ofclaims brought by parents and schools, seeking to block the VAT addition on grounds including religious freedom, parental choice and special educational needs.No exodus to state sector after VAT added to private school fees, say English councilsRead moreFor the families claiming their children required special needs provision that was hard to obtain in state schools, the judges said their evidence “shows not only how bad it might be for them if they had to transfer to the state sector, but also how bad it currently is for many of the 1.1 million children with [special needs] who are already being educated in that sector”.The judges found that while the legislation did interfere with some of the claimants’ human rights, the government had a “broad margin of discretion in deciding how to balance the interests of those adversely affected by the policy against the interests of others who may gain from public provision funded by the money it will raise”.Rejecting references on access to education within the European convention on human rights, the judgment said relevant parts of the convention went “no further than the right of access to whatever educational system the state chooses to provide … and the right to establish a private school”.It continued: “They do not include any right to require the state to facilitate one’s child’s access to a private school, even if the parent’s reason for preferring a private school is a religious one.”Robert Lewis, the head of the education group at the Mishcon de Reya law firm, said the result was anticipated in legal circles. He said: “From the outset, the claim faced formidable legal obstacles: it sought to overturn a fully democratically endorsed policy; one introduced in theLabourmanifesto, debated in parliament, and enacted into law.“Nonetheless, the judgment does offer a modest but meaningful silver lining for independent schools. It observes that an outright ban on independent schools would likely breach the UK’s obligations under the European convention on human rights.”Wealthiest English private schools spend below 6% on means-tested bursaries, research findsRead moreJulie Robinson, the chief executive of the IndependentSchoolsCouncil (ISC), one of the claimants, said: “This is an unprecedented tax on education and it was right that its compatibility with human rights law was tested.“The ISC is carefully considering the court’s judgment and next steps. Our focus remains on supporting schools, families and children. We will continue to work to ensure the government is held to account over the negative impact this tax on education is having across independent and state schools.”The Christian Legal Centre said it would support an appeal by claimants who said the tax discriminated against their right to maintain a private Christian education.Explore more on these topicsPrivate schoolsTax and spendingSchoolsSpecial educational needsEuropean court of human rightsLabournewsShareReuse this content"

The budget was more than halved despite the value of the C of E’s endowment fund rising by 10.3% to £11.1bn last year – the 16th consecutive year of increases.Arora said: “At a time when the evils of racism are increasingly rising to the surface in our world, there is a danger that extreme views from abroad and at home are starting to leak into the C of E’s decision-making bodies.“We know there are those who are deeply resistant to any funding for racial justice and who maintain a distinct indifference to such work. Justice is not an ancillary add-on to the work of the church, it is the very work of God.”The C of E’s latest spending plans, announced this week, include a 11% pay rise for clergy next year and an extra £4.6bn to support parishes and congregations over the next nine years. The church has also allocated £28.2m for the refurbishment of Lambeth Palace, the archbishop of Canterbury’s London headquarters.Buried in the details of the plans was a 55% cut in funding for work on racial and social justice. Arora and Rosemarie Mallett, the bishop of Croydon and his co-lead on racial justice, were not informed of the cut before it was announced.The C of E’s move comes amid a crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes by the Trump administration in the US, and a pledge by Nigel Farage, the leader of Reform UK, to follow suit in councils controlled by his party.It also comes four months after the C of E’s governing body, the General Synod, called for “crucial resources [to] remain available … to further embed racial justice in the life and practice of the church”. The motion was carried 311 votes to one.The C of E has sought to tackle racism and discrimination in parishes and national bodies in recent years. Justin Welby, the former archbishop of Canterbury, spoke of hisshame at the church’s “institutional racism”in 2020, and set up the Archbishops’ Commission on Racial Justice.In a foreword to the commission’s final report earlier this year, Lord Boateng, its chair, said: “Without the racial justice unit being adequately resourced, I am firmly of the view that we will not see the progress which we need.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The decision had been taken “without any evaluation on the effectiveness of current work” and was accompanied by a “lack of transparency that will inevitably impact on trust”.A spokesperson for the C of E said: “In 2023-25 specific funding was made available to provide a short term ‘boost’ and make a significant change in the area of racial and social justice in the church. At the time this was envisaged to be for one [three-year period].”However, further funding was allocated in the recent spending round in recognition of “the importance of building on the work carried out on racial justice over the last three years”.Explore more on these topicsAnglicanismChristianityReligionRacenewsShareReuse this content"

They found that while a minority encountered “extremely misogynistic content”, many users of the manosphere were critically engaged, selective and capable of discarding messages that did not resonate with their values.They found it was far from a unified community: many participants felt the various subcultures under the manosphere umbrella were misunderstood, with extreme misogyny being grouped with benign self-improvement content. Several participants were drawn to it by its perceived humour, open debate and irreverence as well as connecting with views they found about traditional gender roles and family dynamics.“This research does challenge the assumptions about the experiences and perceptions of individuals consuming manosphere content,”Ofcomsaid.“Many of the participants expressed a strong commitment to equal treatment and fairness. They showed particular sensitivity to situations they perceived as unjust or discriminatory. This extended to issues specifically concerning men.”The report’s author, Damon De Ionno, the managing director of Revealing Reality, which was commissioned by Ofcom to produce the study, separately told the Guardian it “suggests society has overestimated” the risk posed by the manosphere.It comes afterrising violenceagainst women and girls (VAWG) in England and Wales. Data published by the National Police Chiefs’ Councilin July 2024found that about 3,000 VAWG offences a day were recorded by the police in 2022-23, an increase of 37% since 2018, with one in every 12 women a victim each year.Beyond Andrew Tate: the imitators who help promote misogyny onlineRead moreSeparate expert studies have found some evidence that the language of the manosphere can escalate into physical violence. Asubmission to parliamentby a group of UK academics cited cases in which incels had gone on to commit offline acts of violence, including Elliot Rodger in Isla Vista, California, in 2014 and Jake Davison in Plymouth, England, in 2021.The Ofcom study involved 38 men, and more misogynistic men may have declined to take part. Some potential recruits refused to take part, considering the government-appointed regulator to be part of the “mainstream”. Perhaps the most impressionable group, boys under 16, were also not included.The study investigated several manosphere subcultures, including “red pill” (men who believe the world is unfair to men) and “black pill” (those who believe unattractive men have very limited options for relationships) communities, incels, “men going their own way” (MGTOW), men’s rights activists,pickup artistsand “looksmaxxing” groups (where young men share tips aboutachieving chiselled cheekbones or “hunter eyes”in an attempt to boost their sexual “market value”), as well as topics surrounding self-improvement, masculinity and gender politics.Some of the content trawled for the study was obviously misogynistic, including posts condoning sexual violence against women. In other cases the misogyny was more ambiguous, such as self-help posts about boosting sexual success based on assumptions about women’s sexual preferences.All of the men had engaged with content from Tate, the self-styled misogynist influencer who is facing charges in Britain including rape, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain, which he denies.But one participant said they viewed watching clips of Tate as “entertainment” akin to watching a horror movie or playing Call of Duty, and the researchers said none of the interviewees had agreed with Tate’s most extreme misogyny.Incel communities contained the most extremely misogynistic content, the Ofcom study found. They were notably full of messages promoting depressive and suicidal outlooks.“Our research suggests society has overestimated the risk of the manosphere to women,” said De Ionno. “It’s not zero risk, but most of it doesn’t have the power to radicalise people who are pretty discriminating and value-driven.”The research examined the attitudes of men who had become involved in several different corners of the manosphere from relatively mainstream content creators such as Piers Morgan to more niche groups such as those that talk about being “red pilled”.‘Incel’ accounts using self-improvement language to avoid TikTok bans – studyRead moreOne was the MGTOW movement, which discusses living without women. It has been described as misogynistic, but Ofcom’s interviewees insisted it was not because it was about choosing to live without women, not hating them.One survey participant’s pathway into the MGTOW part of the manosphere began with him being intentionally misidentified as a child’s biological father, known as paternity fraud. Richard became involved in supporting other victims and came to believe that “feminist ideology runs through” the courts system. He stopped dating and said: “Once you’ve red-pilled about all this, you can’t unsee it.”Another man, Matt, said the MGTOW influencers “prey on any … amount of bitterness and resentment you have in your life from a negative situation”.Ofcom said: “A minority of participants described encountering extremely misogynistic content online – with the most extreme examples more likely to be found on closed groups or among incel communities.“These spaces were also notably full of messages promoting ‘black pill’ concepts of self-loathing and hopelessness, as well as depressive and even suicidal outlooks. Participants that were more socially isolated offline tended to have greater depth of engagement within these closed communities, and so may be at greater risk of adopting harmful views or mindsets, due to their strong group identity and the individual’s wider vulnerability.”Explore more on these topicsMenSocial mediaViolence against women and girlsAndrew TateJoe RoganOfcomInternetnewsShareReuse this content"

Canada has reportedly pushed for more work on investigations into extrajudicial killings.Earlier this month, Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, was forced to defend his decision to invite the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to the G7 summit in Alberta after Canada’s federal police said the shooting death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar wasorchestrated by the “highest levels” of the Indian government.Carney said there was a “legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced inCanada”, following questions over his decision to invite Modi. Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.Carney also cited India’s status as the “fifth largest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and central to supply chains”. But the decision did not sit well with lawmakers from British Columbia. A member of Carney’s Liberal caucus, Sukh Dhaliwal, met with the prime minister earlier this the week to express concern over the invitation.“We as Canadians take pride to be a champion on human rights. We are the country of law and justice,” Dhaliwal, who represents the electoral district where Nijjar was killed, told the Canadian Press. “When it comes to protecting fundamental rights and serving justice for the victim, it is non-negotiable.”Dhaliwal said that the prime minister was “alarmed about the issue” and would be “very strong in dealing” with the issue when speaking to his Indian counterpart.Ever since former prime minister Justin Trudeau accused India of orchestrating the high-profile assassination of Nijjar, Ottawa and New Delhi have been locked in a worsening feud over the issue.India temporarily stopped issuing in visas in Canada and, soon after, Canada expelled six senior diplomats, including the high commissioner, Sanjay Verma. India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” Trudeau told a public inquiry into foreign interference, adding that Canada had not wanted to “blow up” its valuable relationship with India. But he said afterNijjarwas killed, “we had clear and certainly now ever clearer indications that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty”.The Bloomberg report, which underscores Carney’s attempts to mend relations with powerful nations, follows revelations that a suspected Indian government agent was surveilling former New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh as part of its network of coercion and intimidation.According to Global News, the person, with suspected ties to both the Indian government andthe Lawrence Bishnoi gang implicated in Nijjar’s death, knew Singh’s daily routines, travel plans and family. When the RCMP realized there was a credible thread to this life, they placed the federal party leader under police protection.“India targeted a Canadian politician on Canadian soil. That’s absolutely unprecedented. As far as we’re concerned, that’s an act of war,” Balpreet Singh, a spokesperson for the World Sikh Organization, said after of the Global News report. “If Jagmeet Singh isn’t safe … what does it mean for the rest of us?”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyNarendra ModiAmericasSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

Prosecutors suggested May could spend more than a decade in prison if found guilty.The files at the center of the case were uploaded and downloaded using May’s home wifi network and his cellphone, prosecutors said. Some were hidden by the use of a private network, but others were directly linked to his internet addresses.At his arraignment, May’s lawyer suggested someone could have used the wifi password that was shown on a board behind a photo May’s wife may have posted online. Attorney Dayne Phillips also suggested investigators did not link each Kik message directly to May.Prosecutors asked that May, 38, not be given bail because he lives at home with his wife and young children, and some of the files he is accused of sharing feature children of about the same age as his.Prosecutors said they also investigated whether May had used a fake name to travel to Colombia three times after finding videos on his laptop of him allegedly having sex with three girls or women. An agent from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) testified the three appeared to be underage and were paid. Agents have not been able to locate the three.Prosecutors said May created a Facebook account with his fake name, and his internet history showed him switching between his real account and the fake one – and even searching his primary opponent from the fake login.Phillips, May’s lawyer, told the courtroom that no sexual images of toddlers or young children were found directly on his laptop or cellphone.After spending the night in jail, May appeared in court on Thursday in shorts and a T-shirt with his wrists and ankles in cuffs. After being ordered to stay in jail, he appeared to blow a kiss to his wife, who was at the hearing.After May’s election in 2020, he helped create the Freedom caucus, a group of the house’s most conservative members who say mainstreamRepublicansin the chamber are not the true conservative heart of their party. He also helped the campaigns of Republicans running against the party’s house incumbents.“We as legislators have an obligation to insure that our children have no harm done to them,” May said in January 2024 on the house floor during a debate on transgender care for minors.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The court was divided in its opinion, with two Trump-appointed judges, Steven Menashi and Michael Park, dissenting.Carroll, a former magazine columnist, accused Trump of attacking her around 1996 in a department store dressing room in Manhattan. In 2023, a civil jury trial concluded thatTrump did sexually abuseher and then defamed her in 2022 when he denied the allegations as a hoax and said that Carroll was “not my type”.The jury awarded Carroll, who is now 81, a total of $5m in compensatory and punitive damages.

Although President Trump continues to try every possible maneuver to challenge the findings of two separate juries, those efforts have failed.

Then Unity Valkyrie, conceived in the little Canadian town of Swastika, and led presumably by nominative determinism to Hitler’s side; and her best friend and closest sibling, Jessica (Decca), an ardent communist from childhood. Their shared room, famously, had a line down the centre: swastikas and eagles on one side, hammers and sickles the other. The baby of the family, Debo, loved horses and dogs and looking pretty, and became a duchess.View image in fullscreenFive of the six Mitford sisters, from left: Jessica, Nancy, Diana, Unity and Pamela in 1935.Photograph: Pictorial Press Ltd/AlamyA big, splashy, high-budget period drama, Outrageous is just the latest flowering of Mitford mania. But why do we care? What could possibly be so compelling about six aristocratic women (plus one drippy Nazi-affiliated brother)? As a cast member said in an interview ahead of the show, they are the Kardashians of history, each with their own recognisable brand.In Charlotte Mosley’s 2007 collection, Letters Between Six Sisters, each sister is given a little symbol: a coronet for example, or a swastika. Even among the family (for of course Mosley is a relation), the sisters cannot escape themselves. Or, perhaps, especially among the family. Who among us is unfamiliar with this feeling? The messy one! The wild card! The golden child! The black sheep! . The beauty? The runaway? The dud? There’s a Mitford for that.There is, in fact, a Mitford for every possible persuasion: every permutation of political thought, up to and including “eat the rich”, is catered for by this array of blue-blooded, impossibly well-connected women, who are somehow there at every moment of historical significance throughout the 20th century.View image in fullscreenUnity Mitford in uniform in Berlin in 1933.Photograph: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesWe can offer you Churchill’s cousins (both the sisters, through Churchill’s wife Clementine, and Decca’s first husband were Churchill-adjacent); and Hitler’s “angels” (Diana and Unity, described as such by the Fuhrer); forming a band with Maya Angelou (Jessica), or getting tangled up with the curse of the Kennedy clan (Debo), or married to Mosley (Diana’s secret wedding to the leader of Britain’s Blackshirts took place in Goebbels’ Berlin residence in 1936 with Adolf as guest of honour) and Mr Guinness of Guinness fame (Diana again, whose first husband was heir to the Barony of Moyne); or – as the 2013 show Psychobitches put it in song form: “a Naziphile, a commie bore, a personal friend of Mr Evelyn Waugh.”Settings for their extraordinary lives range from the slums of Limehouse; the glittering prewar palaces of Mayfair; Paris, post-civil war Spain, Nazi Berlin, the Isle of Mull (the family owned Inch Kenneth, an island off its west coast,and it was one of the places Unity was sent to live after a second world war-induced suicide attempt); Versailles (Nancy lived there and wrote about The Sun King, Louis XIV); Oakland, California (Jessica’s home for 40 years with her second husband, American civil rights lawyer Robert Treuhaft); the Cotswolds (the Jacobean Asthall Manor was the sisters childhood home); to F Block, Holloway prison, where Diana spent much of the war behind bars.And who sent Diana to prison for fascism? Why, Nancy, of course. Or at least, that’s what Debo believed, though Nancy always denied it. Was Nancy’s first husband gay? Did Hitler really play Unity off against Eva Braun? Every book, every biography, every autobiography tells a different story.And there are dozens of books, including Mary Lovell’s excellent The Mitford Girls on which the show is based. There are biographies of each sister; autobiographies by most sisters (sorry Pam); and Nancy’s novels are never out of print. There are even retellings of Nancy’s novels: India Knight’s Darling, released just last year, updates The Pursuit of Love for the 21st century. One singular family – so unlike, and yet so like, all families in their chaos and commitment, passion and frustration.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

They forgive the unforgivable and hold tiny slights for almost a hundred years. They know each other so deeply, and can never see eye to eye. We see and we don’t see; we understand and misunderstand; we know the story of the Mitfords, and yet – like the Kardashians and the royals – we don’t know them at all.We know our own families deeply, and yet there’s so many things they think and do that have nothing to do with us at all. In all our simple silhouettes, there’s a wild everything bubbling underneath. This is the Mitford magic, but it’s our own magic, too. For all the ways they say, like the late Queen, “ears” instead of “yes” and “hice” instead of “house”; for all their grand houses and extraordinary behaviour and terrible entanglements with the great names of history – it turns out that the Mitfords: they’re just like us.But more fun to watch on TV.

But otherwise this is a richly sympathetic and thoroughly enjoyable portrait of an authentic queen of American musical theatre and movies; there is some wonderful modern-day interview footage of Minnelli, talking with waspish candour about herself, and apart from a slight vocal tremor, very robust. There is a great moment when, after having a FaceTime conversation with Mia Farrow, Minnelli is shown looking sharply at her own face in the little box in a corner of the screen: she instinctively frowns, pouts, assessing herself.That voice, with its unmistakable little gulp, or chuckle or suppressed sob that surfaces in the middle of an extended musical line, emerges as an extension of the way she talks with the media and – as far it’s possible to see this – in private. She got this weaponised vulnerability and superpower-fragility, you must assume, from her troubled mother, Judy Garland. We see the famous (or notorious) moment when they appeared together at the London Palladium and Judy started grabbing Liza’s microphone, pushing it closer to her mouth, suddenly aware of competition, wanting to school her on stage – or embarrass her. The imperious and shrewd sense of how things are going to play on camera no doubt comes from her late father Vincente Minnelli, who also showed her Louise Brooks’s hairstyle just before she did Cabaret, a look that Liza adopted for the rest of her life.From her unofficial godmother, the writer and dancer Kay Thompson, Minnelli learned the never-say-die ethos of the show going on, from Charles Aznavour she learned to dramatise the grit, the sorrow, the interior melancholy of a song. From designer Roy Halston she got the clothes. Then Broadway legend Bob Fosse and composer and lyricist John Kander and Fred Ebb gave her the role of a lifetime in Cabaret’s brilliant, sexy and thrillingly damaged survivor Sally Bowles, a persona which she was able to modify and reproduce in various forms for the rest of her career.And what of the un-hilarious tragicomedy of Minnelli’s marriages? The star herself gets this film’s biggest laugh with her wearied response: “Give me a gay break …” Her first husband was singer-songwriter Peter Allen (“She was devastated when she found Peter in a compromising situation with another man”); her second was producer Jack Haley Jr, son of Jack Haley from The Wizard of Oz (“Dorothy’s daughter marries the Tin Man’s son!”); her third was a carpenter and sculptor Mark Gero, about whom we learn nothing other than his civilian status, and the fourth was the manipulative David Gest, who was not candid about his gay existence. (Someone has to write a musical about these four men: The Four Husbands ofLiza Minnelli.) There is an awful poignancy in Minnelli’s attempts to have a baby, which were heartbreakingly unsuccessful.Like Garland, Minnelli has a gay fanbase which is passionate in its emotional connection and connoisseurship – and perhaps coming to terms with this, and compartmentalising it alongside her own heterosexual identity, is something which Garland actually managed rather better than her daughter. Otherwise she had doomed relationships with Desi Arnaz Jr, in the face of opposition from his mother, Lucille Ball, and with Peter Sellers – all amazingly unworkable situations, like the six impossible things that the White Queen could believe before breakfast. Perhaps, in the end, Liza Minnelli’s authentic relationship was with the audience.Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLiza MinnelliMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

It is a quirky story full of symbolism and dark humour that explores power and political oppression in Thailand.“One of the main intentions for the film would be [to talk about] how we deal with injustice in the past,” says Ratchapoom. “There’s so many people who suffered, who got punished, who disappeared,” he adds, referring to Thailand’s turbulent political history, marked by military coups, protests and deadly crackdowns.View image in fullscreenA still frame from the film, A Useful Ghost.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyA Useful Ghost’s success comes at a time of increased optimism about Thailand’s film industry. Domestic productions are increasingly driving box office sales, claiming a greater share of ticket sales than Hollywood movies, and achieving success abroad. This includes the 2024 release ofHow To Make Millions Before Grandma Dies, which broke records for Thai film in neighbouring countries, and became the first Thai film shortlisted for the international feature film at the Oscars.The Thai government, keen to foster the country’s film sector, has launched a $6.4 million film fund to support productions. Censorship rules are also being relaxed - though content that may affect the monarchy remains prohibited. The powerful royal family is shielded from criticism by a strict lese majesty law, which carries a jail sentence of up to 15 years.Golden age for south-east Asian cinema as local films break box office recordsRead moreRatchapoom says he is unsure what kind of reaction his film will generate when it premiers in Thailand. “I think it will cause some discussion,” he said.The film touches on history some would prefer to forget but which, over recent years, younger people have grown increasingly keen to uncover.“Trying to unearth what is censored or suppressed is one way to fight the authoritarian,” said Ratchapoom. “History is one of the battlefields.”Ratchapoom, 38, grew up in a Thai Chinese family in Bangkok, in a household full of film. His father, who had a small business, was obsessed with watching movies, mostly from the US and Hong Kong. Ratchapoom would pour over his dad’s film magazines in his spare time, and seek out international releases at pirate DVD shops in Bangkok’s Chatuchak market. He went on to study film at Chulalongkorn University, in Bangkok, and worked as a TV script writer before gaining international recognition with his short film Red Aninsri; Or, Tiptoeing on the Still Trembling Berlin Wall, about a transgender sex worker who goes undercover as a spy, which won the Junior Jury award at Locarno film festival in 2020.View image in fullscreenThai director Ratchapoom Boonbunchachoke poses at the 78th Cannes Film Festival, May 2025.Photograph: Benoit Pavan/Hans Lucas/AFP/Getty ImagesRatchapoom began writing A Useful Ghost in 2017, three years after themilitary seized power in a coup, arresting its critics, and pressuring news outlets into self-censorship. The film’s obsession with memory and mind control is inspired by a creeping trend that emerged under the junta: the destruction of monuments commemorating the 1932 revolution, when the absolute monarchy was overthrown and democracy introduced to Thailand. One plaque, which had laid on the ground in Bangkok for decades, was replaced in 2017 with a new monument that read: “To love and respect the Buddhist trinity, one’s own state, one’s own family, and to have a heart faithful to your monarch, will bring prosperity to the country”.In A Useful Ghost the destruction of monuments creates dust, a reference to Thailand’s continued air pollution crisis. But dust is also a symbol for “powerless people who are voiceless”, said Ratchapoom.Thai filmmakers have a long history of using metaphors and symbolism to allude to sensitive political topics.It wasn’t until the pandemic that Ratchapoom was able to put together the first draft of the screenplay. By then,youth-led pro-democracy protestshad filled the streets, demanding the removal of the former junta leader, and then prime minister,Prayuth Chan-ocha, and breaking a major taboo to make an unprecedented call for reforms of the country’s powerful monarchy. Protest leaders proclaimed that the “ceiling had been lifted”; the unspeakable was now being said.Thailand protesters ‘cross the Rubicon’ and risk all to criticise the monarchyRead moreAt the time, Ratchapoom wondered if his own film would appear old-fashioned, given how outspoken younger generations had become. Ironically, in the past few years, such expansions of freedom of expression have been reversed, he said, adding: “Suddenly, it’s not so obsolete. The ceiling has been lowered again.” Many protest leaders are in prison, facing charges or in exile.Thailand is no longer ruled by former military generals, followingelections in 2023, but Ratchapoom does not feel hopeful about Thailand’s politics. Under the junta, there was at least a sense that “there’s every reason to fight, to resist”, he said. Such momentum has dissipated.He does, however, feel more hopeful about the state of Thailand’s film industry. “I believe that in the next few years there will be more exciting projects, films or series coming off Thailand,” he said.The film’s premier in Thailand and elsewhere is yet to be confirmed. Ratchapoom hopes it will open fresh debate. “I hope these things that I talk about - the silenced and suppressed past, the injustice in the past – could be brought up or unearthed and people will start like talking about it again.”Explore more on these topicsThailandCannes film festivalAsia PacificFilm industryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Julianne Moore plays Kate, who runs a struggling horse-riding centre and is grieving her dead wife. Then her desperate junkie daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney) turns up asking for money – again – and Kate is reluctantly drawn into a world of drug deals, double-crosses and death. Michael Pearce, director of the edgy Jessie Buckley mysteryBeast, is great at withholding information for maximum dramatic effect while posing the moral question: how far would you go to protect your child? The fun here is working out your own answer.Out now, Apple TV+The Magnificent SevenView image in fullscreenGunslinging … Yul Brynner, Horst Buchholz and Steve McQueen in The Magnificent Seven.Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/AlamyThis sturdy,star-riddled 1960John Sturges western is an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai – which was itself influenced by John Ford and other masters of the genre. Yul Brynner takes the lead role of the experienced gunslinger who cobbles together a ragtag band of mostly American shooters (Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn) to protect a Mexican village from bandits. Initially only in it for the money, the vigilantes end up befriending the locals and finding common cause. Nicely rounded characters give depth to the shoot-em-ups.Saturday 14 June, 1.55pm, BBC TwoKidnappedView image in fullscreenA tragic true story … Paolo Pierobon and Enea Sala in Kidnapped.In 1858 in Bologna, a city state under papal rule, a young Jewish boy, Edgardo (Enea Sala), is taken away by priests. They claim he has been baptised and so must be raised a Christian in Rome. Marco Bellocchio’speriod dramais a tragic true story of religious intolerance and a family ripped apart, but it is also an origin story of the secular Italian nation. So we follow one father, Salomone (Fausto Russo Alesi), fearing his impressionable son is slipping away from him, while il pape, Pius IX (Paolo Pierobon), sees his God-given power over his flock collapsing.Saturday 14 June, 9pm, BBC Four28 Days LaterView image in fullscreenA masterclass in tension … Cillian Murphy in 28 Days Later.Photograph: Ronald GrantNext week sees the cinema release of the third in the dystopian horror series, with the first film’s director and writer, Danny Boyle and Alex Garland, reuniting for a new trilogy. Before the franchise runs away with itself, here’s the2002 originalto enjoy relatively unsullied. Cillian Murphy plays hospitalised bicycle courier Jim, who wakes up to find London deserted – apart from a host of rabid, rapid people infected by a virus. His flight through dystopian Britain, alongside Naomie Harris and Brendan Gleeson’s survivors, is a masterclass in tension and a study of the worst in human nature.Sunday 15 June, 10.30pm, BBC Oneskip past newsletter promotionSign up toWhat's OnFree weekly newsletterGet the best TV reviews, news and features in your inbox every MondayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This 1996 drama was her first, and follows best friends from childhood Amelia (Catherine Keener) and Laura (Anne Heche) as their bond is stress-tested by Laura’s engagement to boyfriend Frank (Todd Field). The title says it all, with the minutiae of female friendship, sex and relationships dissected by the pals in ways that aren’t always that helpful.Tuesday 17 June, 1.15am, Film4Joker: Folie à DeuxView image in fullscreenAmour fou … Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix in Joker: Folie à Deux.Photograph: Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros.The box-office success of his supervillain origin story,Joker, was probably a surprise to its creator Todd Phillips. Soa sequelis clearly a free hit for him, which explains why he’s gone Broadway or bust with a full-blown musical. It helps that Lady Gaga is on board, carrying the vocal weight as Lee Quinzel, who falls for Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck while both are incarcerated in Arkham State Hospital. Their amour fou is realised in a series of fantastical numbers that are very entertaining, though the mental illness storyline is less effective.Friday 20 June, 12.05pm, 8pm, Sky Cinema PremiereThe EntityView image in fullscreenSupernatural … Barbara Hershey in The Entity.Photograph: Moviestore Collection Ltd/AlamyAt first glance, Sidney J Furie’s 1982 film is just an exploitation flick riding on the coattails of The Exorcist and The Amityville Horror. But between the lines of the woman-in-peril plot, in which Barbara Hershey’s single mother Carla is sexually assaulted by an unseen supernatural assailant, is a story of controlling men. From Ron Silver’s dismissive therapist to the university parapsychologists giddy over a big new case study – and even the invisible creature itself – attempts to force Carla into a corner founder as she fashions her own responses to her trauma.Friday 20 June, 12.45am, Film4Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioThe seven best films to watch on TV this weekfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to think of a more fitting pair to embody the disappointments of Britain in the late 20th century. Curtis’s signature style – a mix of archive deep dives and uncanny juxtapositions – still startles. Loss is the theme of Shifty: it’s a story of Britain losing industry, community and empire, and struggling to come to terms with the individualistic complexity that replaced these certainties. It takes a while for the narrative to sharpen, but Curtis’s films are often best understood as impressionistic art installations so maybe abstraction is their natural final destination.BBC iPlayer, from Saturday 14 JuneThe WaterfrontView image in fullscreenLine of succession … Holt McCallany as Harlan Buckley and Maria Bello as Belle Buckley in The Waterfront.Photograph: Dana Hawley/NetflixA wealthy businessman with a recent health scare reasserting himself as his adult children jostle for inheritance? This drama from Dawson’s Creek creator Kevin Williamson has echoes of Succession, albeit without that show’s razor-sharp wit or psychological acuity. It centres on the Buckley family, whose fishing dynasty is threatened by environmental regulations and corner-cutting competitors. When a ship runs aground (and reveals its illicit cargo), it triggers conflict between ailing patriarch Harlan (Holt McCallany) and his son and apparent heir Cane (Jake Weary).Netflix, from Thursday 19 JuneTrainwreck: Mayor of MayhemView image in fullscreenAn early warning of Trumpite populism … Trainwreck: Mayor of Mayhem.Photograph: NetflixLooking back on the story of the late Toronto mayorRob Ford, it is tempting to posit his success as an early warning of Trumpite populism; a politician whose lack of polish (to say the least) only served to make him more relatable to certain sections of the electorate. However, as this documentary shows, Ford, who became mayor in 2010, pushed this trend to extremes. It explores his unlikely appeal to voters as well as his chaotic lifestyle, which included allegations of sexual harassment and culminated in revelations about crack cocaine use in 2013.Netflix, from Tuesday 17 JuneSomebody Feed PhilView image in fullscreenMore please … Somebody Feed Phil.Photograph: NetflixThe indefatigable Philip Rosenthal has,for eight seasonsnow, occupied one of the most desirable niches on television: he gets to travel the world, eating the best every country has to offer. As ever this is a convivial affair – Rosenthal sees food as an expression of friendship and cultural exchange, a means by which people can offer and receive hospitality. This time his destinations include Guatemala, Tbilisi, Amsterdam, Adelaide and San Sebastián.

In the first season, the brash American arrivals took London society by storm. Now, some of them have become the establishment. As we return, Nan (Kristine Froseth) is preparing for the corseted life of a duchess while Conchita (Alisha Boe) is now Lady Brightlingsea. Still, at least Imogen Waterhouse is keeping things messy: she’s on the run from the police and on the front page of the papers.Apple TV+, from Wednesday 18 JuneWe Were LiarsView image in fullscreenEveryone is hiding something … Emily Alyn Lind and Shubham Maheshwari in We Were Liars.Photograph: Jessie Redmond/PrimeThe Sinclairs are American old money – the kind of rich, complacent family who “summer” on a private island in New Hampshire. However, their idyll is jeopardised when a terrible accident befalls the golden girl of the family, Cadence (Emily Alyn Lind). Does their apparent paradise have a dark side? As Cadence tries to understand what happened to her, it starts to seem as if everyone is hiding something. This adaptation of an E Lockhartnovelis a glossy, melodramatic, YA-slanted story of wealth and privilege as a pressure cooker and, eventually, a prison.Prime Video, from Wednesday 18 JuneThe Great British Phone SwapView image in fullscreenHello hello… Anna Williamson and psychologist Dr Martha inThe Great British Phone Swap.Photograph: Channel 4This series will probably gain added traction in the wake of Adolescence and the panic about children’s online habits that has ensued. It sees parents and their children swap phones for 48 hours to sample digital life as it is experienced by another generation. Afterwards, psychologists assess the results and suggest possible solutions to problems around bullying, pornography and simple information overload. Expect a lot of frantic deleting from the younger participants but also, hopefully, some fresh understanding of the challenges they face.Channel 4, from Thursday 19 JuneExplore more on these topicsTelevisionThe seven best shows to stream this weekTV streamingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it all seems like a distant memory, Crowell’s meticulous narration of the events bring the frenzy and confusion of it all right back. From the underreported fatalities to the police’s painstaking investigation and the question of whether a government scientist could have been behind it, Crowell doesn’t skip over any of the details in a heavily researched series notable for its lack of sensationalism.Dancing With ShadowsFor many of the dancers who made it into the New York City Ballet, performing with the elite company was the pinnacle of their achievements. But the reality, as is so often the case in gilded institutions, was starkly different. The NYCB has been hit withallegations of harassment and abuseover the years – even towards its hallowed founder, the late, influential choreographer George Balanchine, AKA Mr B. Stak’s Nicky Anderson – herself a ballet enthusiast – delicately moves between past and present, as former dancers recount distressing memories.Hidden Histories With Nova ReidView image in fullscreenBringing the often untold stories of pioneering Black women to the fore … Nova Reid.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The ObserverWriter and activist Nova Reid hosts this sumptuous series for Audible, bringing the often untold stories of pioneering Black women to the fore. Among them, Queen Nanny of the Maroons, a Jamaican revolutionary whose life story teaches us much about the roots of the culturally diverse Caribbean nation. Closer to home, Reid crafts a loving portrait of activist Olive Morris – a member of the British arm of the Black Panthers – that doesn’t shy away from her identity as a queer Black woman.Mad, Sad and Bad With Paloma FaithView image in fullscreenNever less than eventful … Samuel L Jackson on Mad, Bad and Sad With Paloma Faith.Photograph: YoutubeFaith’s attempt to get to grips with what life’s lowest moments mean for people in the public eye is a highly personal, enjoyably chaotic listen. Its knack lies in blending the poignant and hilarious: Samuel L Jackson opens up about smoking cocaine while looking after his daughter, but also accidentally teaching her as a toddler to announce “that shit looks fucked up!” when she saw food she didn’t like. Anecdotes about crying during orgasms, jokes about vaginas that smell like roses, Aisling Bea’s tragic tale of striking up an unexpected friendship with an elderly neighbour during the pandemic, only for him to die – it’s never less than eventful.Scam FactoryScam podcasts – the kinds of stories that hinge on criminals gaining trust via calls, texts or emails, then emptying their victims’ bank accounts – are nothing new. But what if we could hear from the scammers themselves? Denise Chan’s series for Wondery does just that, zooming in on the horrifying story of Max, who was put to work on a brutal compound in Myanmar, where he extorted money from unwitting jobseekers.StalkedView image in fullscreenReveals a chilling campaign of stalking … Carole Cadwalladr.Photograph: James Veysey/REX/ShutterstockBest known for reporting on political corruption and the burgeoning “broligarchy” of tech moguls, Carole Cadwalladr ploughs a very different furrow in this absorbing, and terrifying, BBC series.Teaming up with “ex-stepdaughter” Hannah Mossman Moore, Cadwalladr unpicks a chilling campaign of stalking that ruined Hannah’s life … then realises there is something of a Venn diagram between Hannah’s experiences and the abuse she has herself suffered as a dogged reporter.SuaveHow to follow up a Pulitzer-winning podcast about the state of incarceration in the US, and a man who spent 31 years in prison? Simple – you follow him now that he’s out. The second run of this Futuro Studios/PRX pod isn’t here to offer a fairytale ending, though. Rather, Julieta Martinelli and Maria Hinojosa sensitively (and at times exasperatedly) show that even though David Luis “Suave” Gonzalez is free, the physical restrictions of his parole and the mental toll of spending three decades behind bars still dominate his existence.What’s My Age Again? With Katherine RyanView image in fullscreenAs always, she makes people open up … Katherine Ryan.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images for SXSW LondonTaking a sideways route into the celebrity interview podcast, What’s My Age Again? has seen the likes of Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Romesh Ranganathan find out how old theyactuallyare, thanks to a nifty test that sees how well your all-important organs and tissues are faring for someone of your age. It feels low-stakes enough for casual listening, but – like most things Ryan is involved with – that initial breeziness belies its frankness, as guests open up about topics including adoption, addiction, and – in Ranganathan’s case – the health conditions he might be more susceptible to as a person of South Asian descent.What We SpendA perfect pod for the curious (read: nosy), What We Spend offers a peek into the bank accounts of others – their outgoings, sure, but also what they’ve been gifted by their parents, the debts they’re struggling to pay off, and the often exorbitant amounts they’re shelling out just to stay afloat. The Audacy series – hosted by Courtney Harrell – has also provided a vital, unvarnished look at the struggles facing Americans in 2025. Not least in its episode about Maxine – a trucker forced to eat, sleep and work in her vehicle to make ends meet – and a follow-up instalment titled America’s Working Homeless.The World of WodehouseView image in fullscreenA ray of sunshine … PG Wodehouse in 1968.Photograph: F Roy Kemp/Getty ImagesMuch like the work of probably the greatest comic writer ever to have lived, this homage is a ray of sunshine. Hosted by Alexander Armstrong, president of the PG Wodehouse Society UK, it marks 50 years since the novelist’s death by inviting celeb fans such as Stephen Fry, Lynne Truss and Ben Elton to enthuse about the joy the author has brought to their lives – followed by laugh-out-loud readings of his sparkling prose.

The cascading notes heralding a wedding are the aural equivalent of the scent of freshly cut grass, in how they evoke British summer time. But played on a large, sombre bell, the monophonic tolling that announces the time seems almost nihilist: a reminder of the ticking clock of our own lives.All this splendid drama has been heightened by found-sound artist Jake Muir, an American living in Berlin. He has long been an inventive manipulator of sound – 2020’s The Hum of Your Veiled Voice pricked its ears up at night-time Berlin, while 2023’s Bathhouse Blues blended gay porn soundtracks into rudderless soundscapes – and his latest album, Campana Sonans (available on Bandcamp) is a deeply immersive pair of 20-minute works, built from recordings he made of church bells around Europe. He then applies effects to those recordings, chiefly a shedload of reverb.Allow Bandcamp content?This article includes content provided byBandcamp. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content,click 'Allow and continue'.Allow and continueThe first piece, Erzklang, focuses on the rather stern, even malevolent sound of church bells in Berlin, drawn out into long drones. The city’s club scene seems to throb like a memory of Saturday night on Sunday morning: there’s no pulse here, but Erzklang shudders with the reverberation of dub and the metallic beat of techno.For the second piece, Changes, Muir travelled to the UK and recorded at three churches: St Oswald’s in Oswestry, St Bartholomew’s in Edgbaston, Birmingham, and Holy Trinity in Stratford-upon-Avon, where Shakespeare is buried. English bells are often performed through “change ringing”: bells of different notes attached to a giant wheels, which are hauled around by rope-tugging players. This epic instrumentation allows for far more melody than the Berlin piece and, in the way Muir presents the bells, they’re almost like Steve Reich-style overlapping phases. In both pieces, the reverb makes the bells sound otherworldly, and yet Muir tempers this by including the chatter of tourists or the sound of footsteps. To listen to Muir’s work is to be lifted into a bardo, a between-space, looking back at our lives through soot-coated stained glass.This week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenBXKS.Photograph: PR​BXKS – Zagga DatA subtle yet insinuating digidub bassline powers this sensual club cut from the UK rapper, as she gives dance instructions with the imperious calm of a long-reigning ballroom announcer.Margo Price – Don’t Let the Bastards Get You DownWhat an absolute delight: at a perky trotting tempo, the country singer rails at the stiffs, suits and stuffed shirts in her industry: “Those tone deaf sons-a-bitches / don’t know your rags to riches!”Drain – Nights Like TheseNinety-odd seconds of funky, pit-shaking hardcore punk from the returning Santa Cruz band, flexing on the balls of their feet until an almighty head-banging breakdown in the final seconds.Salute – Gbesoke (ft Peter Xan)The speed garage revival continues to rev its engines and hare off down a dual carriageway in a hot hatch, and Salute’s latest has a beat like a funkily stuttering exhaust.Skream and Benga – Good Things Come to Those Who WaitThe dubstep legends serve up early-10s nostalgia on a heavily vibrating silver platter: a Pariah-like note of penetrating digital bass gives way to a gleefully corny trance breakdown.Nuovo Testamento – Picture PerfectEarly 90s piano house-pop done so faithfully you can feel the coloured disco lights warming your face.

Will its winner prove to be another Yunchan Lim-style sensation?Claire JacksonFri 13 Jun 2025 08.50 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 08.52 EDTShareAdistinctive line drawing of a grand piano adorns a clock face inSundance Square. At night, it beams like a Tracey Emin installation, presiding over Fort Worth’s downtown district. At the intersection leading to Bass Performance Hall the crosswalk has been replaced with an oversized keyboard, and, inside the cavernous venue, sartorial style favours black and white stripes. A pop-up gift shop in the lobby boasts an array of musical-themed memorabilia; there’s the line drawing on a bubble-gum pink T-shirt, an enormous travel mug, a steak-branding fork. The theme-park feel is confirmed by a white Steinway emblazoned with Mickey Mouse – a limited hand-painted Disney edition (price on request). Welcome to piano city, smiles the sign.Every four years, piano lovers from across the world gather in this Texas enclave for the Van Cliburn international piano competition – the instrument’s Olympics.It’s not just about the financial reward (the gold medallist receives $100,000 (£74,000); silver $50,000; bronze $25,000, plus there’s other discretionary awards): participation potentially catapults an early-career pianist into the industry’s orbit. In 2022, at the postponed 2021 instalment, a then unknownYunchan Limtook gold. Earlier this year I witnessed crowds of fans waiting to present the now 21-year-old with stuffed animals after a spectacular concert in Lucerne, where he played alongside Martha Argerich. Lim’s Van Cliburn performance ofRachmaninov’s third piano concertois now the most-watched version of that concerto online, with more than 17m views.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim performs in the June 2022 finals of the Van Cliburn competition.Photograph: Ralph Lauer/The CliburnIf Bass Performance Hall’s painted skylight and elaborate candelabras recall a European opera house, the dazzling white balconies are all-American. Conductor Marin Alsop pulls the reins on the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, the Cliburn’s house band. It’s finals week: six pianists (from the28 chosento compete in the competition) perform over four nights. Every performance is livestreamed – this year’s simulcast had 20m views across 145 countries – and, for the first time, is available via Apple Music Classical, along with curated playlists. A new Cliburn Keys View offers the option to watch a hands-only perspective, where disembodied lower arms deploy impeccable technique. While instructive, to do so misses the interplay between soloist and ensemble.Most major international piano competitions require their finalists to perform one concerto. There’s usually a standard list of repertoire – inevitably Tchaikovsky 1 – and the concert is make or break. The Cliburn finalists (an all-male group; only four women competed in Fort Worth, two of whom made it as far as the semi-finals) play two concertos, one from a designated selection, the other can be anything. Alsop deserves her own gold medal for her openness to the challenge, which this year included the quirky choice of Bartok 2. After one concerto I stepped into a lift alongside Alsop who looked thoughtful and exhausted. Most orchestral seasons feature Rachmaninov 3, Beethoven 4 and Prokofiev 2 over the course of a few months. Alsop had done them all in one evening.The Cliburn judges heard 55 hours of music over the course of the event, as 28 pianists became 12, and then six. British pianist Paul Lewis, head of the jury, described the process as “overwhelmingly intense”. From 2015-18 Lewis was chair of the Leeds international piano competition, the UK counterpart that feels positively quaint in comparison.Keir Starmer publicly wished participants luckahead of last year’s Leeds competition; Trump is unlikely to congratulate this year’sCliburn laureateswho include competitors from Russia, Hong Kong, the US, Israel and combinations thereof. He’s missing a trick: the Cliburn has always had political clout. Founder and Texan native Harvey Lavan “Van” Cliburn charmed audiences at the 1958 inaugural International Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, winning gold at the height of the cold war and returning to that most hallowed of US celebrations, a ticker-tape parade. While some of his recordings are historic gems (his 1958 recording with the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra and Kiril Kondrashin was broadcast with choreographed fireworks at the city’s afterparty), Cliburn’s main legacy is the quadrennial contest that takes his name. Set up in 1962, its importance for cultural unification was immediately confirmed.View image in fullscreenIntense … from left: Evren Ozel (US, 29), Vitaly Starikov (Israel/Russia, 30) and Aristo Sham, (Hong Kong, 29).Photograph: Brandon WadeThere are no public guidelines on judging, what one judge wants from their Brahms 2, say, might vary wildly from another.Aristo Sham’s Mendelssohn 1frothed;Philipp Lynov’s Liszt 2bubbled. “Why aren’t you standing up?” one lady scolded the press line, as each participant received rapturous applause and we struggled to scribble. “Y’all have a favourite?” one Texan asked me in the loos, where I photographed the doors decorated with a stave. I did, but mine was different to hers. Carter Johnson, the 28-year-old Canadian-American threw a curveball with theRavel left-hand concerto, a work composed for Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in the first world war. It’s a brooding piece demanding technical wizardry (British left-hand pianist Nicholas McCarthy plays it at this year’sProms opening weekend); Johnson danced and pedalled with elegance.Vitaly Starikovemployed some quirky tempi in the Schumann;Evren Ozel’s Tchaikovsky 1was almost as muscular and thrilling as Cliburn’s own historic performance. At this level, differentiation is down to matters of taste.View image in fullscreenUnassuming polymath … Aristo Sham, 29, performs in the Van Cliburn finals with Marin Alsop conducting.Photograph: Ralph LauerUnusually – judging at this level can require UN levels of diplomatic negotiation to reach a consensus, depending on individual rules – the announcement came on time, with all finalists and jury members present. (There are sometimes resignations: in 1980 Argerich left the International Chopin piano competition in protest at the elimination ofIvo Pogorelićin the third round; and there are sometimes huffs: one young pianist refused to participate in the celebratory performance at the conclusion of last year’s Hamamatsu international piano competition in Japan.) And, all prizes were awarded (theTchaikovsky competitionregularly withholds gold if a clear hierarchy of winners cannot be agreed, with joint silver given instead). Sham took the top spot, becoming the first pianist from Hong Kong to win in the Cliburn’s history. The unassuming polymath – Sham is a former child star (featured on Channel 4’s 2009 documentary The World’s Greatest Musical Prodigies) who studied economics at Harvard and music at Juilliard – was a surprise choice to the press, but not to Cliburn viewers – he won theAudience awardby more than 9,000 votes.Starikov won silver and Ozel placed third, also winning the Mozart Concerto award. I was disappointed not to seeLynov’s talents recognised – he was too; it was some time before he appeared at the reception, but crucially, he attended. Talk was all about the verdicts; everyone had a different top three. After the huge success of Lim, the pressure to find the Next Big Pianist was palpable. But Lim is exceptional; competitions spit up dozens of superb musicians and only one in a generation will have his distinctive touch.The latest clutch of piano olympians gathered at a small table, looking as if they wished it was a piano stool. Journalists asked the necessary inane questions and received the necessary inane answers (Q: how does it feel? A: good). At one point Starikov, fatigued or bored, passed on the microphone to Ozel. All three wore shiny medals and consulted unseen bank accounts, blinking into bright futures.Listen to live performances from this year’s Cliburn competition on Apple Music Classical:https://apple.co/2025Cliburn; watch all the finals round concerto performances atwww.youtube.com/thecliburnExplore more on these topicsClassical musicFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They found common ground over their shared love of psychedelic music and spent long, woozy nights jamming together. But while one wanted to focus on live electronics, the other secretly wanted to start a band. The outcome was Dâdalus & Bikarus, a project which sits somewhere between these two worlds, welding elements of krautrock, punk and big beat into tripped-out dancefloor rhythms.View image in fullscreenCover art for Off the ShelfTheir second album, Off the Shelf, captures the obsessive energy of those early nocturnal experiments, which they’ve since built a reputation for in their live shows. Anchored by drawn-out loops, each track slowly builds tension to dizzying, near-erotic heights. On Erebros, this takes place across a hefty 11 minutes: led by propulsive drums and a scuttling bass riff, the track pushes and pulls, eventually developing into an angular acid-punk workout. In Kill Your Feed, another standout, a simple drum sequence gradually kicks into a shuffling Madchester-esque groove, with plenty of feedback along the way. For all their repetition, the instrumentals are moreish and never dull, thanks also to the ominous sirens and metallic clangs scattered throughout. Merz’s vocals are similarly enticing, channelling Peter Murphy’s moody drawl at points, and gruff EBM-style yelpsat others.The less club-minded tracks are just as compelling. Kuhlio, about halfway through, sounds like it was snatched from the score of an 80s horror flick: weightysynths hang over it like a grey cloud. There are moments throughout the record when the storm clears: a dreamy arpeggiated synth line drifting over a swampy rhythm, or the sounds of tropical birds and trickling water that linger between songs. But even these intermissions are disquieting, only amping the intensity in this whirlwind of an album.Also out this monthThe latest from the brilliant DIY Basque label Hegoa iss/t, a small-batch tape release from a little-known artist calledJmur. It’s a lovely, cosy listen, full of rudimentary folk-pop jams and modular excursions from across his life. Highlights include a take on When You Sleep by My Bloody Valentine, with a granular quality that only adds to its melancholy feeling.Another charming collection of songs comes viaA Profound Non-Event, the debut album by Sydney-based groupDaily Toll(released by Tough Love). Think folky guitars, homespun production and unfussy lyrics with vocals so unaffected they recall the intimacy of K Records indie pop.One for the later hours isThe Art of Memoryby Salon des Amateurs affiliatesSequence of Events(Subject to Restrictions Discs). Combining EBM and new wave sensibilities with shoegaze scuzz, the Düsseldorf duo debut a collection of tracks that wonderfully evoke their post-industrial surroundings.Explore more on these topicsMusicExperimental album of the monthExperimental musicDance musicElectronic musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe was a staple, and the plays of Wole Soyinka: The Lion and the Jewel, most likely, or The Trials of Brother Jero. Often accompanying them were books by Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o – I remember we had both Weep Not Child and The River Between. And even if you didn’t have them at home, you’d soon encounter them in school – they were standard set texts, from secondary school to college.These three writers belonged to the so-called first generation of African writing, the generation that started publishing in the 1950s and 1960s. The three names stood, like the legs of the three-legged pot, under African literature, while in the pot was cooking whatever fare the minds of these writers conceived of. They shared a similarity of subject matter: pro-independence, pan-Africanist, postcolonial theory, but stylistically they were very different from one another. Kenyan Ngũgĩ, unlike the two Nigerians, was shaped by very stern political obstacles, pushing him to take very radical positions on politics and language.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

His home town of Limuru had been razed to the ground. This was during the emergency, what the British called the Mau Mau uprising. This incident formed one of the motifs in his early fiction. His early novels, Weep Not Child (1964), The River Between (1965), A Grain of Wheat (1967) and Petals of Blood (1977), were written in English, under the name James Ngugi, before he stopped writing in English and changed his name to Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o.In his time as faculty member in the English department in Nairobi University, in the 1960s-70s, he fought for a curriculum change – in nomenclature and in substance, from English Literature to Literatures in English. It was a very important move that would shape other nascent departments of English Literature around Africa, by insisting upon a parity in all levels between English literature and other literatures in their original languages and in translation – those of African languages in particular.Ngũgĩ’s generation saw the role of the writer as that of a teacher to the newly independent Africans, who were struggling to make sense of the modern world forcibly thrust upon them by colonialism. For Ngũgĩ, the teacher was always a Marxist activist, something of a community organiser. His plays, The Trial of Dedan Kimathi (1976) and I Will Marry When I Want (1977), were approached as community theatre, at the level of the people, for the people, and their highly political and critical content caused rioting on the streets when they were staged, for which Ngũgĩ was arrested by the Daniel Arap Moi regime.From the archive: Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o: three days with a giant of African literature  – podcastRead moreArrests and detentions and exile were rites of passage for African writers of the first generation. Ngũgĩ’s move into exile introduced his work to a new audience; he went on to produce some of his most important critical essays and polemical works. Decolonising The Mind: The Politics of Language in African Literature (1986), in particular, occupies a central position in his body of work because of the early groundwork it laid in the field of postcolonial literary theory.His migration also included a migration away from the English language to his mother tongue, Gikuyu. Even when his position on the importance of writing in one’s mother tongue grew less compelling than it was before the rise of world and global literatures, he held on to it, not for any practical value, but for the symbolic purpose of decolonising the mind. Growing up, we saw writers of Ngũgĩ’s generation like prophets, figures from the Old Testament. That is why, when they die, we realise that the age of prophets is coming to an end, and we who are left behind must murk about the best we can, while we can.Explore more on these topicsNgugi wa Thiong'oAfricaKenyacommentShareReuse this content"

At first it seemed a blessing: it ramped up people’s metabolisms, made them stronger and more productive workers, but when they ignored the advice to turn it off and sleep for at least a few hours a week, they turned into ravenous monsters. Thea is one of a group of scientists who developed the chip and are now barricaded in the Tower of London, struggling to reverse the damage they have caused, when two survivors turn up seeking shelter: a silent, traumatised woman and her protector, a nameless man who shows signs of having once been Sleepless himself.

All are sexually drawn to women and are isolated from their families. Other, darker connections are revealed as their separate stories become more closely interwoven.

Enka’s friendship and care rescue Mathilde from suicidal despair more than once, and later, when Enka is married to a tech billionaire, she sponsors new works. But she is secretly tormented by jealousy of her friend’s talent. When her husband’s company develops a neural implant intended to increase empathy, Enka decides to use it, ostensibly to help Mathilde by absorbing some of her trauma – and perhaps her talent? A satirical yet believable look at the extremes of the high-end art world, this is also a disturbing portrait of the dark underside of close female friendship.View image in fullscreenEsperanceby Adam Oyebanji (Arcadia, £10.99)In a high-rise apartment in Chicago, a man and his young son are found dead, apparently drowned in seawater. Police detective Ethan Krol struggles to solve this impossible crime, but there may be a connection to the unsolved murder of several of his family members in Nigeria, found dead in a swimming pool six months earlier. Meanwhile, in Bristol, Hollie Rogers befriends Abi, a visitor to the city who claims she’s from Nigeria. But Abi’s amazingly quick reflexes and strength, combined with her hi-tech gadgets and ignorance about 21st-century life, make Hollie suspicious. A fast-paced, superbly plotted blend of mystery and science fiction with roots extending back to the slave trade and a terrible crime committed in the Caribbean in 1791.View image in fullscreenThe Quietby Barnaby Martin (Pan Macmillan, £16.99)This debut novel by an award-winning composer opens with a dramatic prologue. Citing “the Atavism Act of 2043”, a man seizes Hannah’s little boy, Isaac, for genetic testing: “If he passes, he will be taken into the care of the State. If not, he will be returned to you.” It is not immediately clear whether this has already happened or is yet to come, when the novel begins. The narrator, Hannah, is wary of CCTV cameras and keeps Isaac close to her always. The world has changed dramatically since the arrival of something called the Soundfield. The sun’s UV rays are so dangerous that people now sleep by day and only go outside after dark. The reader, too, is kept in the dark until nearly halfway through the book: despite Hannah’s status as a Soundfield researcher, she reveals little about it, or how it connects to genetic testing, and the narrative is sometimes deliberately misleading. But her concern for Isaac comes through powerfully and, along with all the mystery, keeps the reader hooked in expectation of revelations to come. Only the how and why of the Soundfield is not among them – and such an intriguing concept deserves a sequel.Explore more on these topicsScience fiction booksScience fiction roundupFantasy booksHorror booksreviewsShareReuse this content"

We open our eyes and light floods in; the world is just there, waiting to be seen. But in reality there is an active element that we don’t notice. Our brains are always “filling in” our perceptual experience, supplementing incoming information with existing knowledge. For example, each of us has a spot at the back of our eye where there are no light receptors. We don’t see the resulting hole in our field of vision because our brains ignore it. The phenomenon we call “seeing” is the result of a continuously updated model in your mind, made up partly of incoming sensory information, but partly of pre-existing expectations. This is what is meant by the counter­intuitive slogan of contemporary cognitive science: “perception is a controlled hallucination”.A century ago, someone with an interest in psychology might have turned to the work of Freud for an overarching vision of how the mind works. To the extent there is a psychological theory even remotely as significant today, it is the “predictive processing” hypothesis. The brain is a prediction machine and our perceptual experiences consist of our prior experiences as well as new data. Daniel Yon’s A Trick of the Mind is just the latest popularisation of these ideas, but he makes an excellent guide, both as a scientist working at the leading edge of this field and as a writer of great clarity. Your brain is a “skull bound scientist”, he proposes, forming hypotheses about the world and collecting data to test them.The fascinating, often ingenious research reviewed here is sorely in need of an audience beyond dusty scientific journals. In 2017 a Yale lab recruited voice-hearing psychics and people with psychosis to take part in an experiment alongside non-voice-hearing controls. Participants were trained to experience auditory hallucinations when they saw a simple visual pattern (an unnervingly easy thing for psychologists to do). The team was able to demonstrate that the voice-hearers in their sample relied more heavily on prior experience than the non-voice-hearers. In other words, we can all cultivate the ability to conjure illusory sound based on our expectations, but some people already have that propensity, and it can have a dramatic effect on their lives.To illustrate how expectations seep into visual experience, Yon’s PhD student Helen Olawole-Scott managed to manipulate people’s ratings of the clarity of moving images they had seen. The key detail is that when participants had been led toexpectless clarity in their perception, that is exactly what they reported. But the clarity of the image on the screen wasn’t really any poorer.It’s sometimes a shame that Yon’s book doesn’t delve deeper. In Olawole-Scott’s experiments, for example, does Yon believe that it was participants’ visual experience itself that became less clear, or just their judgments about the experience? Is there a meaningful difference? He also avoids engaging with some of the limitations of the predictive processing approach, including how it accounts for abstract thought. Challenges to a hypothesis are interesting, and help illuminate its details. In an otherwise theoretically sophisticated discussion this feels like an oversight.One of the most enjoyable things popular science can do is surprise us with a new angle on how the world operates. Yon’s book does this often as he draws out the implications of the predictive brain. Our introspection is unreliable (“we see ourselves dimly, through a cloud of noise”); the boundary between belief and perception is vaguer than it seems (“your brain begins to perceive what it expects”); and conspiracy theories are probably an adaptive result of a mind more open to unusual explanations during periods of greater uncertainty. This is a complex area of psychology, with a huge amount of new work being published all the time. To fold it into such a lively read is an admirable feat.A Trick of the Mind: How the Brain Invents Your Reality by Daniel Yon is published by Cornerstone (£22).

It’s pretty much a straightcopy of the original: a huge soap bubble, half sunk into the desert floor, with its surface turned into a gigantic TV. Occasionally you’ll pull up near the Sphere while driving an electric vehicle made by Silva, the megacorp that controls this world. You’ll sometimes come to a stop just as an advert for an identical Silva EV plays out on the huge curved screen overhead. The doubling effect can be slightly vertigo-inducing.At these moments, I truly get what MindsEye is trying to do. You’re stuck in the ultimate company town, where oligarchs and other crooks run everything, and there’s no hope of escaping the ecosystem they’ve built. MindsEye gets this all across through a chance encounter, and in a way that’s both light of touch and clever. The rest of the game tends towards the heavy-handed and silly, but it’s nice to glimpse a few instances where everything clicks.With its Spheres and omnipresent EVs, MindsEye looks and sounds like the future. It’s concerned with AI and tech bros and the insidious creep of a corporate dystopia. You play as an amnesiac former-soldier who must work out the precise damage that technology has done to his humanity, while shooting people and robots and drones. And alongside the campaign itself, MindsEye also has a suite of tools for making your own game or levels and publishing them for fellow players. All of this has come from a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, whose production credits include the likes of GTA 5.View image in fullscreenAI overlords … MindsEye.Photograph: IOI PartnersWhat’s weird, then, is that MindsEye generally plays like the past. Put a finger to the air and the wind is blowing from somewhere around 2012. At heart, this is a roughly hewn cover shooter with an open world that you only really experience when you’re driving between missions. Its topical concerns mainly exist to justify double-crosses and car chases and shootouts, and to explain why you head into battle with a personal drone that can open doors for you and stun nearby enemies.It can be an uncanny experience, drifting back through the years to a time when many third-person games still featured unskippable cut-scenes and cover that could be awkward to unstick yourself from. I should add that there are plenty of reports at the moment of crashes and technical glitches and characters turning up without their faces in place. Playing on a relatively old PC, aside from one crash and a few amusing bugs, I’ve been mostly fine. I’ve just been playing a game that feels equally elderly.This is sometimes less of a criticism than it sounds. There is a definite pleasure to be had in simple run-and-gun missions where you shoot very similar looking people over and over again and pick a path between waypoints. The shooting often feels good, and while it’s a bit of a swizz to have to drive to and from each mission, the cars have a nice fishtaily looseness to them that can, at times, invoke the Valium-tinged glory of the Driver games. (The airborne craft are less fun because they have less character.)View image in fullscreenDriving between missions … MindsEye.Photograph: Build A Rocket Boy/IOI PartnersAnd for a game that has thought a lot about the point at which AI takes over, the in-game AI around me wasn’t in danger of taking over anything. When I handed over control of my car to the game while tailing an enemy, having been told I should try not to be spotted, the game made sure our bumpers kissed at every intersection. The streets of this particular open world are filled with amusingly unskilled AI drivers. I’d frequently arrive at traffic lights to be greeted by a recent pile-up, so delighted by the off-screen collisions that had scattered road cones and Dumpsters across my path that I almost always stopped to investigate.I even enjoyed the plot’s hokeyness, which features lines such as: “Your DNA has been altered since we last met!” Has it, though? Even so, I became increasingly aware that clever people had spent a good chunk of their working lives making this game. I don’t think they intended to cast me as what is in essence a Deliveroo bullet courier for an off-brand Elon Musk. Or to drop me into an open world that feels thin not because it lacks mission icons and fishing mini-games, but because it’s devoid of convincing human detail.I suspect the problem may actually be a thematically resonant one: a reckless kind of ambition. When I dropped into the level editor I found a tool that’s astonishingly rich and complex, but which also requires a lot of time and effort if you want to make anything really special in it. This is for the mega-fans, surely, the point-one percent. It must have taken serious time to build, and to do all that alongside a campaign (one that tries, at least, to vary things now and then with stealth, trailing and sniper sections) is the kind of endeavour that requires a real megacorp behind it.MindsEye is an oddity. For all its failings, I rarely disliked playing it, and yet it’s also difficult to sincerely recommend. Its ideas, its moment-to-moment action and narrative are so thinly conceived that it barely exists. And yet: I’m kind of happy that it does.MindsEye is out now; £54.99The subheading and captions on this article were amended on 13 June 2025 to correctly refer to the developer as Build a Rocket Boy and the publisher as IOI Partners, not “Build A Robot Boy” and “IO Interactive” as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsGamesShooting gamesRole playing gamesAction gamesVirtual worldsreviewsShareReuse this content"

The soaring gothic architecture, illuminated by the ever-changing daylight the big windows let in, belongs to another age. The painting self-consciously sees a difference between the medieval past embodied by the enigmatic stone fabric, and the artist’s own new era. The Dutch had fought a long war against Spain for religious freedom as well as national sovereignty, and the way worship and profanity are mixed here – no one minds that a dog is urinating – may suggest the Reformation’s disrespect for clerical power and idolatry. But this is also a painting illuminated by the new scientific spirit of 17th-century Europe. De Witte coolly observes patterns of light and shadow, reflecting the optical discoveries of his time.

Just ask Marvel Studios – once the box office equivalent of a cashpoint duct-taped to a golden goose, now resembling a busted slot machine in Skegness. Reports this week suggest thatThunderbolts*, the studio’s latest attempt to turn supervillain also-rans into marquee gold, has officially faceplanted at the box office despite strong reviews, a cast stacked with rising stars and indie darlings, and enough emotional baggage to ground a Sundance drama.In theory, Jake Schreier’s rowdy ensemble piece had it all: Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Wyatt Russell’s jawline, a marketing campaign whispering “this isn’t your dad’s Marvel film”, and the sort of melancholic indie sheen that usually comes free with a Bon Iver soundtrack. Critics even liked it. And yet audiences, perhaps stung by a mercurial ride for the once pristine superhero studio simply couldn’t be bothered to find out what all the fuss was about. With a production and marketing tab pushing $275m (£203m), Thunderbolts* needed to soar like Iron Man. Instead,Variety suggestsits $371m (£273m) global take after six weeks in multiplexes is likely to leave it some way short of the $425m (£313m) the film needs to break even by the time it slips quietly on to Disney+.View image in fullscreenThe emotional baggage of a Sundance drama … Hannah John-Kamen, Olga Kurylenko, Wyatt Russell, Sebastian Stan, David Harbour and Florence Pugh in Thunderbolts*.Photograph: Marvel StudiosThe hand-wringing in Hollywood has been palpable. But the reality is that Thunderbolts* sets up far more monumental Marvel instalments – that asterisk is all about teasingthe arrival in the MCU of the New Avengers, while the movie’s end-credit scene sees the Fantastic Four plummeting towards Earth-199999 in a suitably retro-futurist rocket ship from another dimension – so it doesn’t really need to hit $1bn to be considered at least a partial success. Audiences might have decided that the studio is no longer churning out fabulous content at such a guaranteed rate, but Kevin Feige et al will surely sleep soundly knowing that even if the audience isn’t buying the starter, the next 10-course franchise tasting menu is already in the oven.In many ways, Thunderbolts* was something of a free hit for the studio. Had comic book movie fans warmed to it,Marvelmight have had a completely new team of colourful miscreants to spin off into the glorious synergised future, just as they did with James Gunn’s Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy. But if fans aren’t feeling the new team, it’s really not a big issue, because Red Guardian, Ghost and US Agent are surely destined to be torpedoed by the real Avengers when they eventually trampoline in from whatever pocket dimension Robert Downey Jr is cryogenically stored in.View image in fullscreenCooking up the next course … Ebon Moss-Bachrach as the Thing in The Fantastic Four: First Steps.Photograph: Marvel StudiosWill we finally get a fabulous Fantastic Four film with First Steps?Read moreIn future years, Thunderbolts* might be remembered as warmly as the forgotten pilot episode for a series that never got made, or as a cinematic shrug that bridged the gap between multiversal crises and the return of a gaggle of box office big guns. On the other hand, we might be sitting here in 20 years’ time recalling the moment we realised Pugh was going to be the biggest thing in comic book movies since Hugh Jackman first sprouted sideburns.Maybe Thunderbolts* was never meant to save the MCU – just stall for time while the A-listers finished renegotiating their contracts. It may not have been the genuine thunderclap moment the studio needed to remind audiences why they cared about capes and cosmic nonsense in the first place, but with The Fantastic Four: First Steps and Avengers: Doomsday on the horizon, it certainly filled the gap. Because, in the end, even a Thunderbolts* movie held together with VFX and vibes counts as content. And in 2025, that’s still the most valuable substance in the known universe.Explore more on these topicsMarvelWeek in geekSuperhero moviesFlorence PughfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was Amber Waves in Boogie Nights, whose pornography career and cocaine addiction costs her access to her child. Or Maude, the outre artist – “My work has been commended as being stronglyvaginal” – whose determination to conceive drives much of the plot inThe Big Lebowski. Moore was the infernal, domineering mother – the Piper Laurie role – in the 2013 remake of Carrie, and a lesbian cheating on her partner with the sperm donor who fathered their children inThe Kids Are All Right. InMay December, the most recent of the five pictures she has made with her artistic soulmate, the director Todd Haynes, she became pregnant by a 13-year-old boy, then married and raised a family with him after her release from prison. Shocking, perhaps, but then she had already played a socialite with incestuous designs on her own son (Eddie Redmayne) inSavage Grace. Imagine that lot as a Mother’s Day box set.Her latest screen mum is in the jangling new thriller Echo Valley. She has a lot of heavy lifting to do as Kate, a morally compromised rancher whose farm is falling apart, along with her life. Some of that lifting is emotional: Kate left her husband for a woman (“I’m the one who ‘ran off with the lesbo ranch hand’,” she sighs) who then died. To add to her woes, Kate’s daughter (Sydney Sweeney), who has addiction problems, calls on her for help after accidentally throwing away $10,000 worth of drugs belonging to a dealer (Domhnall Gleeson).View image in fullscreenJulianne Moore.Photograph: Charlotte Hadden/Headpress/eyevineSome of Moore’s heavy lifting in the film, though, is literal: there is a corpse-disposal sequence that does not go off without a hitch. This is all handled expertly by the British film-maker Michael Pearce, who made his debut directingJessie Buckley in Beastand therefore has form when it comes to putting tenacious redheads in jeopardy.View image in fullscreenMorally compromised … Julianne Moore and Sydney Sweeney in Echo Valley.Photograph: FlixPix/Alamy“Michael and I talked about how we didn’t want Kate to be a superwoman,” says Moore, 64, perched on the edge of a sofa and sipping tea in a London hotel room. She is wearing a long-sleeved charcoal-grey dress, burgundy nail varnish and gold tear-drop earrings that swing in and out of her hair, playing peek-a-boo whenever she moves. “You shouldn’t think she’s capable of much when you see her. She can barely get out of bed. When she meets Domhnall’s character, you’re like: ‘Oh my God, he’s going todestroyher!’ Most of us aren’t action heroes. I’m not The Rock, right?”Yet Echo Valley does teeter at times on the border between thriller and action movie. “I didn’t see that on the page,” she admits. “But there are these physical fights, stuff with horses, there’s all this water and diving and pulling and carrying. It’s exhausting!”View image in fullscreen‘Kind of an action hero’ … Moore as Clarice Starling in Hannibal, 2001.Photograph: Mgm/AllstarWe puzzle together over whether she has strayed into action territory before. “I guess in The Lost World,” she says, citing the Jurassic Park sequel, a mediocre movie with one killer suspense sequence: Moore in an upended Winnebago dangling over the edge of a cliff, a splintered windscreen the only thing standing between her and certain death. And there was the overcooked Hannibal, where she took over as the FBI agent played by Jodie Foster in The Silence of the Lambs. “Yeah, Clarice is kind of an action hero.” Has she turned down many such parts? “Because they were too action-y?” she exclaims, laughing up a storm. “That’s really funny! I have, on occasion, turned things down if it’s something that was taking place outside, like,allthe time with no shade. ‘Guess what? We’re shooting at the beach every single day!’ That would be tough.” She gestures to her pale skin and copper hair. “I would incinerate.”Action heroes have been few and far between, but she can’t identify any other gaps on her CV. “I don’t think that way. I’m always thinking in terms of story. Hey, I’d like to do a ghost story! I’m fascinated by those because they’re about grief. But character for me doesn’t exist outside narrative.”Later, I email Wash Westmoreland, who, with his late husband Richard Glatzer, directed Moore as a linguistics professor with early-onset Alzheimer’s inStill Alice, which won her a best actress Oscar. He points out how she can pivot the tone of a scene with a simple line reading. In Haynes’s Far from Heaven, she was a hemmed-in 1950s housewife with a closeted husband and a taboo friendship with her Black gardener. “To access a character through the acting style of a different era while bringing nuance and emotional truth to it was a tour de force,” he says.View image in fullscreen‘The stuff of great cinema’ … Moore as Cathy Whitaker in Far from Heaven, 2002.Photograph: Focus Features/AllstarNear the end of the movie, when it becomes clear that her husband can’t curb his appetites, she adopts a newfound resignation and froideur, telling him: “I assume, then, you’ll be wanting a divorce.” Westmoreland singles out that moment: “The shift in her voice and demeanour is so dramatic. It’s the stuff of great cinema.”For Echo Valley, Moore dwelt on the areas where her character was morally compromised. “She makes a series of choices that are complicated,” she says. “You step back and ask: ‘Wait, is this appropriate parenting? Are you managing your child’s addiction rather than giving them the agency to change?’ There’s a lack of clarity about Kate’s behaviour. Does she do the right thing? I don’t know. Is it cinematic? Oh, it’s definitely that.”With her husband, Bart Freundlich, whom she met nearly 30 years ago when he directed her in the indie drama The Myth of Fingerprints, Moore has two children: Cal, 27, is a musician who teaches composition; while Liv, 23, is an assistant at a talent agency. Asking herself what she might do as a mother in Kate’s position, however, would have done her no good. “That kind of thought isn’t always helpful. Because if it’s me, well, I’m not going in a lake. Are you kidding? It’scold!But that doesn’t occur to Kate.”When Moore’s career exploded in the 1990s, with eye-catching roles in mainstream smashes (The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, The Fugitive) and indie masterpieces (including Robert Altman’s Short Cuts and the chilling Safe, her first film with Haynes), she was presumably the greenhorn on set. I wonder how it feels to have gravitated to a possibly maternal position with Sweeney in Echo Valley or Meghann Fahy in the crackling newNetflix comedy Sirens. “What’s fabulous when you’re on set with people of a different age is that it’s always a peer relationship,” she says. “You go in at, say, 24 and it’s terrifying, but everyone expects you to meet them emotionally.”View image in fullscreen‘You go in at 24 and it’s terrifying’ … Milly Alcock as Simone with Moore as Michaela in Sirens, 2025.Photograph: COURTESY OF NETFLIXShe experienced it on the set of Louis Malle’s Vanya on 42nd Street. “I was 27 and George Gaynes was 72 and I was supposed to be engaging in a romantic relationship with him, which felt crazy. But suddenly you’re doing this Chekhov piece and everything dissolves. You’re people without any barrier of age or experience.”Perhaps it helped, too, that she was always treated as an adult by her parents. Her mother, who moved from Greenock on the west coast of Scotland to the US as a child, was a psychiatric social worker, her father a military lawyer and later a judge. They discussed openly the intricacies of human behaviour in ways that Moore believes helped cultivate her fascination with character and story.Also vital was her sense of difference. Moore’s series of Freckleface Strawberry books for children were recently in the news afterbeing put “under advisement”by the Trump administration in schools educating the children of US military personnel – presumably because of their message that being different is nothing to be ashamed of. Less well known is another of her autobiographical children’s books, My Mother Is a Foreigner But Not to Me.How did she experience her mother’s nationality as a child? “Well, it’s very pertinent now given what’s going on with immigration in the US,” she says. “Many of us have parents who were from somewhere else, so that meant your parents had different customs or languages. My mother felt very different from the American mothers I knew. She had an accent. She cooked different things: nothing weird, just roast beef, for instance. We had little kilts. I had my hair braided and American mothers didn’t do that.”View image in fullscreen‘I love her’ … Julianne Moore with Tilda Swinton in The Room Next Door, 2024.Photograph: Warner Bros. EntertainmentHer Scottish background gives her a deep connection to Tilda Swinton, her co-star last year in Pedro Almodóvar’sThe Room Next Door. An earlier Swinton movie, The Deep End, must surely have influenced Echo Valley: both are water-adjacent thrillers concerning mothers who go to extreme lengths to save their children from thugs. “Oh Tilda, my Tilda!” she cries, clamping a hand to her chest. “I love her.” She reels off the similarities between them with a level of excitement that suggests they are only now dawning on her: “She’s Scottish and I’m Scottish-American. We both have red hair. Our children – her twins and my oldest – are the same age. And both of our sons have red beards. Isn’t that funny?”At that moment, she starts waving at someone behind me. “Michael, come on in!” she calls out to Pearce, who sits down beside her for the final 10 minutes of the interview. They are both in matching greys. “You got the memo,” she jokes.View image in fullscreenOutre artist … Moore as Maude in The Big Lebowski, 1998.Photograph: Gramercy Pictures/AllstarThroughout our conversation, Moore has been friendly, but always precise: at the end of each answer, she pulls up sharp, smiling tightly in a way that signals she has completed her thought. In Pearce’s presence, she loosens up a little, pinging ideas back and forth and even urging me on when I ask him something – “Good question!” – in a way that makes me feel I have been awarded a gold star.It’s no mystery why he cast Moore in Echo Valley. “She plays these everyday people – someone beside you at the checkout or on the train – but they’re going through these momentous crises,” he says. “Still Alice, Short Cuts, Magnolia: there’s never anything generic in what she does. It’s always the most specific and memorable version of that crisis.”This is what was needed for Echo Valley. “It lives or dies on the performances. We can’t only rely on the plot mechanics. You need to be a bit heartbroken by this film. And because Julianne’s done so many movies, she has this intuition for what works. When it came to the heaviness of the film – the grief, the addiction – she said: ‘Some of this can be done with a light touch.’ We didn’t need to show all the crying.”Moore is thinking about The Rock again. “When you see him, say, hanging from a helicopter, you’re like: ‘I can’t do that. That’s not going to happen.’ But when you see these people in domestic situations dealing with desperation and violence and grief, you think: ‘I recognise this. It exists all around us.’”Echo Valley is on Apple TV+"

His trip took him from bustling Ghana to the tranquility of Tanzania – and sparked the idea for a playFemi Elufowoju JrFri 13 Jun 2025 06.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 06.21 EDTShareAt 53, I made myself a promise. Having built a reputation as the go-to authority on African culture in UK theatre, I realised with uncomfortable clarity that my knowledge barely scratched the surface of the continent’s vast complexity. What followed was an extraordinary seven-year quest to visit all 54 African nations before my 60th birthday – a journey that would ultimately transform into my ambitious new theatrical project, 54.60Africa.The catalyst came during a 2015 world tour with theatre company Complicité that took me to Cape Town. Standing in the shadow of Table Mountain, I confronted a paradox that had long troubled me: despite my Nigerian ancestry and theatrical expertise, my understanding of Africa remained frustratingly limited. Cape Town offered me an opportunity to begin addressing that knowledge gap, and one I was determined to seize.The journey that followed defied every preconception I held. In a hotel lodge in Mbabane in what was then Swaziland, a receptionist’s eyes widened with incredulity at my arrival – a reaction that spoke volumes about the rarity of Black guests. Yet it was the gardener the next morning who provided the trip’s emotional core, abandoning his work to sit beside me, explaining how long it had been since he’d conversed with another “brother” on the premises beyond his own visiting family.View image in fullscreenHe bangs the drums … Usifu Jalloh in rehearsals for 54.60 Africa.Photograph: Alex BrennerThese encounters multiplied across 54 nations, each challenging global narratives of crime, instability and economic hardship that I had unconsciously accepted. Instead, I found peace in Ghana’s bustling districts, tranquility along Tanzania’s roads and avant garde modernity in airports across the continent; I was blown away by Mali’s Modibo Keita International. Even in Khartoum, months before civil war erupted, I stood on Mac Nimir Bridge absorbing the capital’s calm while admiring the translucent Blue Nile – a moment that would later haunt me as I processed how quickly human-made turbulence could create mass displacement.The process of transforming my personal odyssey into a theatrical production began with a conversation. In 2007, I accompanied my friend Ivan Cutting on a research trip to Kenya for a production that never materialised. A decade later, when I mentioned writing a book about my travels, Ivan immediately suggested a play should follow.What emerged at Omnibus theatre in south London, and later at the NationalTheatreStudio, was something far more complex than I had expected. Early workshops revealed a troubling tendency: the story centred on me rather than Africa. 54.60 Africa was completed on my 60th birthday – 31 October 2022 – in Bangui, Central African Republic – exhausted, but ecstatic and proud of the feat. This milestone intervened to shift the focus, transforming my production into an exploration of how Africa interrogated the African I claimed to be.This realisation led to a crucial creative decision: representing my journey through 11 fictional characters rather than direct autobiography. Africa is more than one person, and I should never be bigger than our mighty continent. The fictional ensemble allowed me to convey collective experiences while platforming Africa as a source of progress, inspiration and immense dignity.View image in fullscreen‘Progress, inspiration and immense dignity’ … Femi Elufowoju Jr with the play’s cast.Photograph: Alex BrennerThe production reunited me with performers from my previous collaborations, who brought not just talent but vast repositories of knowledge drawn from oral storytelling traditions. Ayo-Dele Edwards, the first Nigerian-descent female performer to infuse UK theatre with authentic Yoruba songs, joined Sierra Leonean animateurs Patrice Naiambana and Usifu Jalloh, whose contributions to UK arts education stretch back to the mid-90s.For the music I turned to the Ganda Boys, Denis Mugagga and Daniel Sewagudde, who I discovered were instrumental in shaping London’s east African cultural movement. Their infectious compositions and melodious voices provided my production’s sonic backbone while their advocacy for social justice aligned perfectly with my mission.54.60 Africa arrives at a crucial moment for African representation in British theatre. Despite nearly three decades passing since I established Tiata Fahodzi in 1997, authentic African voices remain marginalised on major commercial stages. While regional theatres increasingly listen to their communities, the West End continues to shy away from genuine African stories, preferring sanitised interpretations such as The Lion King over authentic narratives.My central mission remains unchanged: debunking tropes associated with my continent. Through lighthearted dramatic construction accessible to all ages, 54.60 Africa offers audiences a fresh perspective on Africa’s true standards and incredible human endeavours, far removed from problematic western media narratives. In doing so, it challenges not just theatrical conventions but fundamental assumptions about a continent too often reduced to simplistic stereotypes.54:60 Africa is at the Arcola theatre, London, to 12 July.Journey of discovery: Femi Elufowoju Jr’s fondest memories from his trip through 54 countriesThe Bee Keeper Women ofKitui, Kenya,2007 (main picture, above)Meeting a bee-keeping group in a nearby village in the Kitui district of Nairobi.

Is it him cheerily singing Always Look on the Bright Side of Life from a crucifix? Nudge-nudge, wink-winking Terry Jones down the pub? Or struggling with his habit alongside Robbie Coltrane in Nuns on the Run?Now 82, Idle is one of the most beloved comedians Britain has produced, an alumni of Cambridge Footlights,Monty Pythonand the Rutles, who became perhaps the most Americanised of the troupe after moving there permanently in the 1970s.Post-Python he was in films including The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Splitting Heirs (1993), Casper (1995), The Wind in the Willows (1996), An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn (1997), Ella Enchanted (2004) and Shrek the Third (2007).This much I know: Eric IdleRead moreIn 2005, Spamalot, his musical adaptation of Monty Python and the Holy Grail, debuted on Broadway to enormous critical and commercial success, adding Tonys and Grammys to Idle’s already busy mantelpiece.A vocal critic of the current US administration on X, Idle is returning to the UK for a tour in September – his first for 52 years.Always Look on the Bright Side of Life, Live!is a nostalgic one-man musical including “comedy, music, philosophy and one fart joke”.Idle was born in South Shields in 1943, and raised largely by his grandmother, after his mother fell into a depression following the death of her husband, who was killed in a road traffic accident while hitchhiking home after the second world war in 1945. Idle went to a tough boarding school in Wolverhampton aged seven, where he was unhappy but became head boy and got into Cambridge.As 1965 Footlights President, he was the first to allow women into the club, and became the Pythons’ musical specialist and also its only solo writer – John Cleese and Graham Chapman preferring to pair up, alongside Jones and Michael Palin.View image in fullscreenIdle in Life of Brian (1979).Photograph: Landmark Media/AlamyTheir comedy series Flying Circus ran for five years until 1974, while the films (Holy Grail, Life of Brian and Meaning of Life) extended the run until 1983. Idle’s affectionate Beatles parody, the Rutles, was a huge success in the US, where Idle was also a frequent host of Saturday Night Live.Other projects included voice work on the likes of South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, a staged reading of his play What About Dick?, the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympics, US tours, assorted Gilbert and Sullivan productions, and season eight of The Masked Singer (as Hedgehog).‘I didn’t cry until I knew I was going to live’: Monty Python’s Eric Idle on surviving pancreatic cancerRead moreIdle was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2019 and has since made a full recovery.

But I do remember that the film was central to a childhood obsession with whales – orcas, specifically – that followed me well into adulthood. (I still remember a lot of random facts, such as “killer whales can live up to 90 years old!” and “their pregnancies are17 monthslong!”)Released in 1993, just a few months after I was born, the film follows Jesse – a moody 12-year-old foster kid with abandonment issues – and his unlikely friendship with Willy, an orca confined in a far-too-small pool at a local marine park. Jesse and Willy have a lot in common. Both are antisocial, stubborn and mistrustful, but form a close bond – one that sees Jesse determined to free Willy from the park where he is being exploited for profit by an evil businessman. It’s a classic good v evil tale – and a coming out story.View image in fullscreenStrong, majestic, a little evil … the orca in Free Willy.Composite: undefined/Guardian Design; Collection Christophel/AlamyFree Willy isn’t queer in any explicit sense. But the film’s central theme is one of “chosen family” – a concept that has been central to LGBTQ+ life ever since our community elders were forced to meet in secret because they were criminalised, stigmatised and forced to the margins. In the film, Jesse’s longing for his mother – a woman who abandoned him as a young child – initially stops him from bonding with his new foster parents. It’s only when he meets Willy that he begins to find joy in his life. It’s a narrative we see repeated in anthems such as Rina Sawayama’sChosen Family, TV dramas such asQueer as Folk, or a reality show likeRuPaul’s Drag Race: that there is radical power in finding “your people.” (Or, in this case, your whale.)View image in fullscreenJoyous relationship … Jason James Richter as Jesse with Keiko the orca whale in Free Willy.Photograph: Warner Bros/Sportsphoto/AllstarIn 2023, for my 30th birthday, my boyfriend and I visited Norway for the first time. I was determined to see whales in the wild. On the day of the planned boat excursion the winds were high and the boat trip was cancelled. But we managed to find a smaller rib boat that, however misguidedly, was still heading out. A few hours later, I found myself shivering in the middle of the black ocean, facing huge swells and terrifying winds. It was a far cry from the idyllic scene I had envisaged, where the sun reflected off the calm sea, illuminating pods of whales swimming peacefully.First, our boat encountered a sperm whale – a gigantic and gentle creature who blew water high into the air and seemed completely unbothered by us. And then, just as we sped back to the shore, I saw it: the unmistakable black dorsal fin, gliding through the crashing waves with ease. At that moment, it suddenly became clear that we were intheirterritory – and it scared the crap out of me.Since that moment, I’ve wondered if I was particularly drawn to orcas, even as a child, not only because they are visually stunning, but because there was something inspiring about apex predators totally in control of their surroundings. (Strong? Majestic? A little evil? They’re what every gay man aspires to be.)‘You lied to us’: did the real-life saga behind Free Willy change the story for orcas in captivity?Read moreIn Free Willy, however, the film’s star is fairly helpless, like a slippery overgrown puppy who communicates through whining noises that are adorable and distressing. But eventually, Jesse and his foster family help Willy to break free from his enclosure.Placing this film within the queer canon might sound like a reach – a leap even bigger than Willy who, in an iconic final scene that required arocket launcher(and animatronic whale) to shoot, jumps over the harbour wall to escape his captors. But when he does, it feels like a moment of transformation, like a coming out story. And on the other side, there’s an ocean of freedom and possibility."

And so commencement season, somehow, occurred, with the world’s best and brightest politicians, entertainers and athletes, plus a frog, presenting their hard-earned wisdom. From Percival Everett to Simone Biles to President Trump himself, here are 10 lessons we’ve learned from the year’s graduation speeches.Your future can be derailed by irresponsible ejaculationElizabeth Banks advisedher fellow University of Pennsylvania gradsnot to put too much stock in pie metaphors.The biggest division in this country, the comedy actor and director said, was economic, with vast wealth concentrated in the hands of a small number of people. But they don’t have a monopoly on the future. “I can understand why you believe that life is a zero-sum game,” Banks said. “If one person takes a bigger slice, everyone else has to take a smaller slice and the total size of the pie remains the same. And that is true with actual pie. But not with life. Not with opportunity.“You’re really only ever competing with yourself, with the limitations you’re willing to accept, with the smallness of someone else’s idea of what you’re capable of. So stop competing and start beating the pie lie.”Unfortunately, one thing could stand in the way. “The biggest derailment to the future you want to build is irresponsible ejaculation,” Banks warned. “I know all the doctors on this stage with me agree that that is the cause of all unwanted pregnancy.” Everyone deserves to “be able to determine whether, when and with whom you become a parent”. So, she said: “Wrap it up. Keep abortion legal.”America remains addicted to racismLevar Burton, the actor and TV host who inspired several generations of kids to read,brought his messageto Howard University, where the crowd stillknew the wordsto the Reading Rainbow theme song.At a dark time for America, he offered some hope. “At every level, in every era as slaves and then as the descendants of slaves, we have challenged this nation to live up to the promise of its founding proposition that all men are created equal,” he said. “In 2025, America is still addicted to its racism,” like “an alcoholic who has yet to hit rock bottom”. Still, “only in America could a descendant of slaves, for whom simply knowing how to read was once punishable by death, grow up and become a celebrated champion for literacy and the written word. This, too, is America. This is still a land of great promise and opportunity yet untold.”Burton said he only wished the country could live up to its original promise. “To do that, she must shun the scourge of racist thinking and behaving and policymaking that holds this nation back.“There’s gonna be another day. You hear me? There’s gonna be another day,” he told the crowd, referencing an ad-libbed line from the show Roots that lifted him to stardom. “And even though the future may look uncertain, graduates … That day has arrived. This moment is yours to shape.”Impostor syndrome has its benefitsSpeaking at Yale University, Jacinda Ardernnotedthe unexpected benefits of impostor syndrome and sensitivity. “Self-doubt brings with it humility,” the former prime minister of New Zealand said. “It drives you to seek information, to listen to experts who can teach you and advisers who can guide you.” And sensitivity – “the thing that moves you to tears when you see the pain of others” – can “be what drives you to action,” she added.“In fact,” she said, “all those traits that you might have believed your whole life were weaknesses – questioning yourself, the doubt that brings humility, or sensitivity that comes with empathy – may just be what the world needs more of.”Put your phone in the other roomAt Bates College in Maine, the scholar and psychologistAngela Duckworth askedgraduates and faculty to perform an excruciating experiment: handing their phones to the people next to them for a quarter of an hour.‘Free Mahmoud’: Columbia students boo acting president at graduation as Khalil is still detainedRead more“I want to talk about something that might seem trivial, but in fact has profound implications for your future success and happiness, something as consequential as your major or where you land your first job, and that’s where you choose to keep your phone,” Duckworth said. Her research on goals and self-control had yielded a surprising conclusion, she said: “Willpower is overrated. In study after study, psychologists like me have found that achieving what you want out of life has very little to do with forcing yourself to act in one way or another.”Instead, she said, successful people “deliberately design their situations in ways that make wise choices easier” – a practice called “situation modification”. Teenagers are spending eight hours a day looking at screens, she said. “If you don’t like how your phone grabs your attention, directs your thoughts, triggers your desires, then push it away. On the other hand, if you do want something to take up more of your conscious awareness, art, poetry, a really good novel, keep it as close as possible.”That goes for friends, too: “Phones can connect us to people who are far away, but they can also separate us from the people right in front of us.”Reading is the most subversive thing you can doPercival Everett, author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel James, gave abrief but starkcall to action at Wesleyan University, describing this year’s graduates as perhaps “the last line of defense of and for American intellectual life”.Fascists, he said, burn books because “they are afraid of thought”. Students, however, had learned to read – and not just books. “You have learned to read the world, people, actions, conspiracies. You have learned to think for yourselves.” Everett called reading “the most subversive thing you can do. When you read, no one knows what’s going into you, even if they are reading over your shoulder, and they are.”His advice for graduates: “I ask nothing more from you than to do what you have been doing. Go out into the fray and keep reading.”To survive in a new world, learn to tell human storiesAt his alma mater, the University of Southern California – known for producing Hollywood luminaries – the film-makerJon M Chu emphasizedthe importance of a good story, especially at a time when it can feel like the world is falling apart.Right now, he said, familiar stories were disintegrating, and “fear, blame, and division dominate our airwaves.” But instead of despairing, he added, this was “a moment of profound opportunity. Because when the old stories fall apart, it means it’s time to write a new one.”He continued: “Whoever tells the best story holds the power. Your ability to understand, interpret, and ultimately shape stories is critically important no matter what you want to do.” Machines may be able to assess data and “even create art, but they cannot authentically feel or intuitively connect. In whatever field you are in, your power to convey information in ways that emotionally connect will be more valuable than we even currently acknowledge.”If Plan B doesn’t work out, try Plan C. Then Plan D, Plan E, Plan F …Simone Biles is, of course, a top contender for the Greatest of All Time – butshe told graduates at Washington University of St Louisthat “being the Goat was never the goal.” Instead, “my goal was to be the greatest Simone Biles of all time.” Biles urged listeners to do the same: be the “greatest you of all time” – and in the process, embrace failure.“When you’re reaching for things, you’re going to fall short, and yes, sometimes you’re going to fail,” she said. “When – not if, but when – this happens to you, just learn from it, and move on to Plan B. If plan B doesn’t work out, then make a Plan C, and then guess what – there’s the rest of the alphabet. The key to success is the willingness to always find a way.”Trophy wives can be problematicGraduates of the US Military Academy at West Point were treated toinspirational remarksby their commander-in-chief. Among other insights into the human condition, Donald Trump delved into questions of terminology, noting that the preferred term for people on the left is “progressive” rather than “liberal”, and “that’s why I call them liberal”.He also questioned whether it was acceptable to say “trophy wife”, ultimately deciding that it was. Still, he cautioned against obtaining one. “That doesn’t work out too well, I must tell you,” he said as he regaled the newly minted officers with the life stories of the professional golfer Gary Player and real estate developer William Levitt. “A lot of trophy wives – doesn’t work out, but it made him happy for a little while at least. But he found a new wife. He sold his little boat and he got a big yacht,” Trump said of the latter. The president also pointed out that he won last year’s election.Life is about community. Just don’t let them dissect youAt the University of Maryland – the alma mater of his creator, Jim Henson – Dr Kermit the Frog offered asunny vision in challenging times. Life, he said, was about “finding your people, taking the leap, and making connections”.“Rather than jumping over someone to get what you want, consider reaching out your hand and taking the leap side by side. Because life is better when we leap together,” the frog advised. But, he warned biology majors: “You’re not going to get me to step foot inside your lab.”Appreciate the rule of lawThe physician and author Abraham Verghesespoke at Harvard Universityas it defends itself from the Trump administration’s attempted crackdown on academia. Outrage over the government’s actions, he said, should lead to new appreciation – “appreciation for the rule of law and due process, which till now we took for granted”, he said, as well as “appreciation of actions that demonstrate thoughtfulness, decency, generosity, kindness, humility and service to community”.Verghese reflected on how, during the Aids epidemic, many young people returned to their home towns to spend their last days. “Given the prevailing sentiments against gay people in small towns in the rural south, I found myself pleasantly surprised to find my patients were so well received by their families. They were cared for lovingly to the end. You see, love trumps all bigotry. Love trumps ideology.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleUS universitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

TikTok misinformation and scaremongering (unsupported by significant clinical data) around rising cancer diagnoses on protected skin don’t help either. The dermatology community is united: high protection, broad spectrum SPF is the most important product you’ll use and the key defence against skin cancers and premature ageing of the skin.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The most important aspect of sun care is that people use it. The elegance of a modern sunscreen formula, the texture on fingertips and the comfort on skin, the smell, the packaging, the price, the finish and its ability to play nicely with other skincare and makeup products – these are, in my view, often the difference between someone’s decision to protect themselves or not. What follows are 57 user-friendly sunscreens I’ve enjoyed trying in recent years, all of which have proved popular with those to whom I’ve recommended them and none of which make sun protection a bind. I would gladly use any of them on my own family.The best sunscreens you can buy in 2025The best body sunscreensBest overall:Vichy Capital Soleil hydratingsolar protective waterView image in fullscreen£17.20 at Look Fantastic£19.49 at SuperdrugExtremely easy, comfortable SPF spray with an attractive (and subtle) golden tone.

It’s not that the SPF is in any way inferior to that of a dedicated sunscreen (all have to meet the same stringent cosmetic regulations), but it’s simply not possible to apply a sufficient amount of tinted sunscreen without looking caked in makeup. This tinted SPF from Ultra Violette is the most versatile and easy-to-use tinted SPF, with enough long-lasting coverage to skip foundation altogether.

Synthetic filters need 15-20 minutes to absorb before exposure, while mineral filters (which use zinc and/or titanium and usually leave a slight white cast) are effective upon application (which looks best done in two thin layers).Protection of either kind should then be reapplied every couple of hours, which few people do in everyday life, which is why I’ve included some SPF top-up sprays (such as theGarnier Ambre Solaire mist) to make this more practical.The article was originally published on 26 June 2024.

The quantities make more honeycomb than you need here, but extra snacking is inevitable. The cheesecake itself, which I’ve lightened with greek yoghurt, is super-simple to put together – just mix and chill.Cherry and honeycomb cheesecake potsPrep5 minCool1 hrCook30 minMakes6For the honeycomb200g caster sugar200g golden syrup2½ tsp bicarbonate of sodaFor the cherries255g pitted cherries,fresh or frozen and defrosted30g caster sugarSqueeze of lemon juiceFor the cheesecake150g digestive biscuits50g saltedbutter, melted330g greek yoghurt250g cream cheese1 tsp vanilla bean paste50g icing sugar100ml double creamLine a 20cm square cake tin with greaseproof paper. Put the sugar and golden syrup in a deep saucepan and heat gently until the sugar melts. Turn up the heat, let the mixture come to a boil, and heat to 150C on a sugar thermometer.Take off the heat, tip in the bicarb, then stir quickly and thoroughly with a rubber spatula or whisk until well incorporated (be very careful, because the boiling-hot mixture will bubble up). Carefully pour the hot honeycomb into the lined tin, leave it to sit for an hour or so to firm up, then break into rough chunks.Put the cherries, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan, heat gently until it comes to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for three to five minutes, until the mix turns syrupy. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely.To make the cheesecakes, blitz the biscuits and a quarter of the honeycomb in a food processor, then stir in themelted butter. Divide the mixture evenly between six ramekins, lightly press it down, then chill in the fridge while you make the filling.Whisk the yoghurt, cream cheese, vanilla and icing sugar in a bowl until smooth. In a second bowl, lightly whip the double cream to soft peaks. Fold this into the yoghurt mixture, then spoon on top of the biscuit base in the ramekins.To serve, top with some cherries, decorate with more honeycomb shards (they’ll start to soften over time) and take to the table immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingDessertCheeseCakeFruitBiscuitsrecipesShareReuse this content"

Almost all video game characters were hypermasculine military men, unrealistically curvaceous fantasy women wearing barely enough armour to cover their nipples, or cartoon animals. Most of these characters catered exclusively to straight teenage boys (or, I guess, furries); overt queer representation in games was pretty much nonexistent until the mid 2010s. Before that, we had to take what we could get. And what I had was Link, fromThe Legend of Zelda.View image in fullscreenLink.Composite: Guardian Design;  Zuma Press/AlamyLink is a boy, but he didn’t really look like one. He wore a green tunic and a serious expression under a mop of blond hair. He is the adventurous, mostly silent hero of the Zelda games, unassuming and often vulnerable, but also resourceful, daring and handy with a sword. In most of the early Zelda games, he is a kid of about 10, but even when he grew into a teenager in 1998’s Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, he didn’t become a furious lump of muscle. He stayed androgynous, in his tunic and tights. As a kid, I would dress up like him for Halloween, carefully centre-parting my blond fringe. Link may officially be a boy, but for me he has always been a non-binary icon.As time has gone on and game graphics have evolved, Link has stayed somewhat gender-ambiguous. Gay guys and gender-fluid types alike appreciate his ageless twink energy. And given the total lack of thought that most game developers gave to players who weren’t straight and male, I felt vindicated when I found out that this was intentional. In 2016, the Zelda series’ producer Eiji Aonuma toldTime magazinethat the development team had experimented a little with Link’s gender presentation over the years, but that he felt that the character’s androgyny was part of who he was.“[Even] back during the Ocarina of Time days, I wanted Link to be gender neutral,” he said. “I wanted the player to think: ‘Maybe Link is a boy or a girl.’ If you saw Link as a guy, he’d have more of a feminine touch. Or vice versa … I’ve always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate to Link.”Meet the gaymers: why queer representation is exploding in video gamesRead moreAs it turns out, Link appeals perhaps most of all to those of us somewhere in between. In 2023, the tech blog io9spoke to many transgenderand non-binary people who saw something of themselves in Link: he has acquired a reputation as an egg-cracker, a fictional character who prompts a realisation about your own gender identity.Despite their outdated reputation as a pursuit for adolescent boys, video games have always been playgrounds for gender experimentation and expression. There are legions of trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people who first started exploring their identity with customisable game characters in World of Warcraft, or gender-swapping themselves in The Sims – the digital equivalent of dressing up. Video games are the closest you can come to stepping into a new body for a bit and seeing how it feels.It is no surprise to me thata lot of queer peopleare drawn to video games. A 2024 survey by GLAAD found that 17% of gamers identify as LGBTQ+, a huge number compared with the general population. It may be because people who play games skew younger – 40 and below – but I also think it’s because gender is all about play. What fun it is to mess with the rules, subvert people’s expectations and create your own character. It is as empowering as any world-saving quest."

It sounds nonsensical, but that’s exactly the experience.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The gently undulating gravel trail in the country’s most sparsely populated region is not only a beginner-friendly cycle, it’s also enjoyed by people with a wide range of physical abilities.Natalie Gauld, 58, who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2022, has completed the West Coast Wilderness Trail multiple times and contributed to the trail’saccessible ride guide. “It makes me feel capable,” said Gauld on a phone call before my trip. “I enjoy its remoteness.”View image in fullscreenNatalie Gauld and Matt Rees-George cycling the boardwalk at Lake Mahinapua.Photograph: Jason BlairThe 133km trail from Ross to Greymouth (or vice versa) is one of 23Ngā Haerenga Great Rides of New Zealand. It’s in the West Coast region, a narrow strip of land roughly 600km long wedged between the frozen Southern Alps and the palm-fringed Tasman Sea. Its diverse ecosystems bizarrely buddy up: icy slopes and glacial rivers with steamy rainforests and pebbly beaches.Viewing the world from handlebars is the way my husband, Paul, and I typically like to travel. Long, short, challenging, easy-going; we’re not fussy once we’re immersed in the landscape on two wheels. Having said that, we are not fans of lugging our kit or working out the best places to stop, eat and sleep. Sowe joined three other riders on a five-day supported journeywith cycling and walking specialists Adventure South NZ, who took care of the tedious logistics and planned snack stops and short side hikes to severalWest Coast scenic spots.A bridge closure meant we had to slice off the first 15km or so and saddle up on the road outside Hokitika in the lashing rain. “A real West Coast welcome,” said our tour guide, Tereza Unzeitigova. The soggy start was forgiven as soon as we ducked into the protection of a mossy native rainforest. The West Coast is the only part of New Zealand where significant tracts of lowland rainforest remain, which includes giant podocarp trees that hark back to Gondwanaland.The boardwalk traversesLake Mahinapua’s wetlands, where the soundtrack was a sonic experience all its own. For the unversed, like me, it could have been anything from swans, ducks and royal spoonbills to bellbirds, tūī, kererū or cuckoos. A coastal hug back to our accommodation in Hokitika completed the first 20km.View image in fullscreenHosts Rob and Col Pieper, who feed cyclists doing the West Coast Wilderness Trail with Adventure South NZ tour group.Photograph: Tracey Croke“‘Coasters’ have to be more self-reliant because we’re geographically isolated,” said Adventure South NZ host Rob Pieper, who served the group a paddock-to-plate dinner of zucchini soup, organic beef goulash and vegetarian dahl with rice that evening at their architecturally designed off-grid home. “If we have an earthquake, we could be on our own for months.”Pieper and his wife, Col, prepare cyclists’ meals for the tour group. It is a natural fit for the delightful tandem-riding couple originally from the Netherlands, who – along with managing their smallholding, situated on the coast at Ruatapu in a rare white heron habitat – “make it work” by guiding, nursing, catering and school-bus driving.View image in fullscreenTracey Croke cycles the Kaniere water race.Photograph: Paul CrokeAfter a restful night at the Beachfront hotel in Hokitaka, we got a bird’s eye view of the native forest on awalk in the treetops, before continuing the ride on a narrow trail alongside the babbling waters of theKaniere water race. Before my trip, Gauld told me she can pedal her Motom here after “pinch points” on the trail were widened.Following a homemade lunch in a repurposed woolshed with Rob and Col, we spent the remainder of the day riding the shores of Lake Kaniere and hiking into the azure awe ofHokitika Gorge. Its glacial waters carry precious pounamu (greenstone) from the mountains down to the sea.Time-poor doctors Nikhil Patel, 36, and Anvi Butala, 31, chose the trail because it packs multiple experiences into a relatively short trip. In preparation for the ride, Butala found a hill near where she lives and rode it 10 times in one training session, she told me.View image in fullscreenNikhil Patel and Anvi Butala pose for a photo at Hokitika Gorge.Photograph: Tracey CrokeIt helped her get to the top of a sunny 400m climb on day three. There, the deserted oddity of Cowboy’s Paradise plateau served a collection of ramshackle buildings split by a broad dusty road. The forest trail down from the plateau to Kumara was fun, fast and flowy. That night we stayed at the Theatre Royal, the West Coast’s onlyfully restored gold miners’ hotel withcreaky floors and cheekily named rooms such as “King Dick”.On the final day, the icy crown of Akoari/Mount Cook came into view behind deserted, driftwood-laden beaches where blue penguins – the world’s smallest – hang out. A gusty finish around the harbour to Greymouth had us battling to keep our bikes upright. It didn’t deter 53-year-old road cyclist Litza Reed from Perth, who hired a hybrid bike for the trail. She said she’s buying a mountain bike as soon as she gets home.View image in fullscreenView from the West Coast Treetop Walk, which has a wheelchair accessible cafe and walkway.Photograph: Tracey CrokeThough the trail was over, the journey wasn’t: we still had the 30-million-year-oldPancake Rocks and Blowholesto marvel at, plus a meander along the tranquil trails of Paparoa national park, and a 20km pedal to break up our van journey back over the Alps to Christchurch the following day.Our only criticism of the West Coast Wilderness Trail: we wish it were longer. But fortunately, we have 22 other New Zealand Great Rides to explore.Getting thereAir New Zealand, Virgin Australia, Emirates and Qantas operate direct flights into Christchurch from Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne.

It can be approached from the dramatic Asco Gorge. For hikers, a network of donkey trails reveals arresting views, river pools and lost worlds, such as the abandoned village of Sepula. There are a couple of remote campsites off the gorge. There’s a ski resort halfway up Mount Cinto where the more challenging cross-islandGR20 mountain hiking pathcan be joined.

Days were warm and nights cool. We pootled about on rusty bikes, got coffee at the Etno village restaurant, befriended local dogs, went on herb walks and ran about naked in the birch woods, as well as making bigger excursions toDurmitor national park. We stayed at Nikola’s beautifulBrezan Lug chalet, in its own private woodland, with hot tub, barbecue, fire pit and all mod cons.BethHigh campiing in northern AlbaniaView image in fullscreenOur tipster Alex took a ferry on Lake Koman.Photograph: Hugh Mitton/AlamyMy partner and I had a magical time in the northern Albanian mountains. From Shkodër, we made our way to the Valbona valley national park via a two-night stay on (and boat across) Lake Koman. Once in Valbona, we camped with permission on the grounds ofHotel Rilindja, where the owner offered a wealth of hiking tips. From our base, we embarked on a series of spectacular hikes, including a three-day circular toÇerem. The first two days we saw no one apart from shepherds (and a few vipers, which were given a wide berth) before hitting a slightly more travelled section, where we encountered a handful of fellow hikers. The views were breathtaking; the hospitality, affordable and welcoming; and the experience, incomparable.AlexMountain cabins on Sweden’s King’s trailView image in fullscreenThe mountains of Nallo.Photograph: Alena Vishina/AlamyThe mountains and glaciers surrounding the mountain hut at Nallo in north-west Sweden were so spectacular last year that I’m returning to stay for longer in July. It’s roughly seven miles off the popularKungsleden trail(King’s trail) that winds its way through Lapland. There’s no mobile phone reception, or food, so bring your own supplies. These can be bought at the trailheads, three days’ walk away, or at other mountain huts along the way.

As you walk away from the sundial, the planets are revealed sequentially in large metal sculptures, informative panels and a hand-cranked audio track. Each one appears at its proportionate distance and size from the sun, so Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter are soon ticked off on a shallow climb. Twenty minutes later, a striking silver-ringed Saturn overlooks magnificent views of the valley and down to the Rhône a kilometre below. Uranus presages a refreshing paddle in a mountain stream, good preparation for a steeper, but manageable, 30-minute scramble to Neptune and lunch at 2,300 metres, distracted by panoramic views of the Swiss Alps from the deck of the 19th-centuryHotel Weisshorn.Bryan ConwayRare flowers high in Italy’s ApenninesView image in fullscreenAlpine asters in Abruzzo.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyI hiked through the Maiella national park in Abruzzo, just two hours east of Rome, where marsican brown bears,Abruzzo chamoisand wolves roam while griffon vultures soar above. The drought-tolerant vegetation and steep-sided valleys conceal caves that were once inhabited by hermits – it was amazing to imagine what it must have been like living there. Flowering plants galore, with rarities such as the Apennine edelweiss, Apennine gentian, Alpine aster and dryas (a glacial relic) on the high peaks. Exploring ancient pathways and clambering up rocky slopes rewarded me with far-reaching views over the Adriatic Sea.Monique GadellaRisqué mountain, GermanyView image in fullscreenA viewing platform on Mount Wank.Photograph: myLAM/AlamyRather than ascend the expensive and crowded Zugspitze (Germany’s highest mountain at 2,962 metres), during a summer visit to Garmisch-Partenkirchen we instead opted for a cable car up the magnificently namedMount Wank(1,780 metres). We were rewarded with lush mountain meadows, superb views of the valley below and peace and quiet. A cold beer on the sun terrace at theSonnenalm restaurantis a must.

I grow my hair and beard to look like him, while immersing myself in his work.On 24 March – his birthday – I dress as Morris and finish the quarter with some kind of absurd performance to highlight pressing social issues that he was concerned about, and that I want more people to focus on today.I first came up with the idea in 2020, but I had been reading and thinking about Morris for nearly a decade.Like Morris, I’m a middle-class artist and designer. And, also like him, I’m a compromised socialist. In 2020, after taking a five-year career break to look after my kids while my wife went back to work, I was 37 and feeling conflicted about returning to the art world. Throughout my life, I have wanted to create work with a social purpose. Yet the only way to make a decent living out of art is by operating in the high-end market.Researching Morris inspired me. He dedicated most of his life to creating a socialist movement in the UK – but he also said he felt conflicted about“ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich”. He made objects using natural materials and gave craftspeople some autonomy, so his products always ended up too expensive for most people.I was worried I would have the same experience when it came to making my own socially conscious art. But Morris gave me comfort. He was privileged like me, and yet he dedicated himself to the arts and to social purposes such as socialism. He provided a guide for me to get back into my artistic practice.Each 1 January, I begin my Morris quarter by rereading his 1890 novelNews from Nowhere. I read his other works, too, and try to build skill sets he had. I’ve had singing lessons to sing his socialist chants, made prints on his letter press in his house in Hammersmith, west London, and designed wallpaper based on the River Lea. Morris knew the river well and named one of his patterns after it. I’ve also made socialist flags in Leyton, east London, where his mum lived while Morris was at Oxford.I get some funny comments when I drop my kids off at school dressed as MorrisI’ve even attempted to write poetry. He was most famous in his lifetime for being a poet – he turned down the poet laureateship. I have also learned embroidery from my mother and taught it to my children. Morris taught his daughter, May, to embroider, and she became one of the greatest craftspeople in Britain.I get some funny comments when I drop my kids off at school dressed as Morris. Otherwise, no one where I live – in Hackney, eastLondon– ever gives me a second glance, as big beards and hair, and Victorian suits are trendy here.My children think what I do is very funny, while my wife hates my beard and can’t wait for me to shave it off. But I intend to keep my Morris quarter going for ever.Each year, my finale performance is different. This year, Icreated a digital plum orchardin Trafalgar Square, because Morris envisaged an actual orchard there in News from Nowhere. The novel is set in the year 2102, where everyone lives in an eco-utopia.Another time, I went fishing for salmon in the Thames, dressed in a Victorian workwear suit like Morris, because there is a famous sketch of him fishing in the Thames byDante Gabriel Rossetti. In News from Nowhere, the river is healthy enough for salmon to live in, but there’s no chance of finding salmon there today. Last year, I gave one of his speeches and flew a red handmade socialist flag at theWilliam Morris Gallery in Walthamstowfor his birthday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And I do it because we live in ridiculous times: it’s a ridiculous thing to do.Becoming Morris has made me feel more confident about my position in the world – that it’s OK to be an artist with a social purpose, and in fact it’s more needed than ever. It gives me a feeling of solace and validity. It helps me carry on.As told to Donna FergusonDo you have an experience to share?

Here’s how plants reproduce, and how to encourage themClaire RatinonFri 13 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 06.05 EDTShareIf you’re growing any plants for fruit, getting your head around pollination is key to ensuring a bountiful harvest. Thankfully, the plants and the pollinators – whether that’s bees, beetles or a summer breeze – have a system for making this happen. Still, any grower should be familiar with the pollination needs of their crops in case intervention is necessary.If GCSE biology is a distant memory, here’s a quick refresher. Pollination is the reproductive process whereby a flower’s pollen is transferred from the stamen to the stigma before travelling to the ovule, where fertilisation takes place. Seeds start to develop and, for those crops that coax a creature into dispersing their seed, a fruit will form and swell around them.Different plants have different pollination requirements and, as such, each can be broadly categorised as either hermaphrodite (also known as perfect), monoecious or dioecious. Hermaphrodite plants contain both pollen-bearing and fruit-bearing parts within their flowers: tomatoes, apples, aubergines and beans and many more fall into this group. This doesn’t necessarily mean all perfect flower-producing plants can self-pollinate, though – and even if they do, they’re believed to bear more fruit when grown with friends.Most plants need a pollinator. Bumblebees, hoverflies, beetles, butterflies, moths and even birds can act as the intermediaryMonoecious plants produce separate flowers that bear either pollen or fruit, so tend to need a creature to ensure pollination occurs. Edible examples include winter squash, courgettes and cucumbers. You can tell which flower is which by looking at the stem behind the bloom – the fruit bearer will boast a small, immature fruit while the pollen bearer will not.The rarest type of plant is the dioecious kind, in which pollen is produced by an entirely separate plant to that which produces the fruit. Not many edible plants reproduce this way. The most notable is the kiwi (although there are monoecious varieties too).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Here’s how to tend the tricky crop in your veg patchRead moreThe majority of plants need a pollinator to do the job. Bumblebees, hoverflies, beetles, butterflies, moths and even birds can act as the intermediary between one plant’s reproductive organ and another as they forage for food. Wind is another pollinator and an important one for those who want to grow corn (or limit the spread of dandelions). Planting your corn in a block – as opposed to a row – improves your chance of having juicy cobs to harvest. Even water acts as a pollinator for certain aquatic plants.If your immature fruit is withering, not swelling, it’s likely unsuccessful pollination is your problem. The best solution is to include pollen-rich flowers in your planting plan to attract a range of pollinators. Alternatively, you can act as the pollinator yourself and manually move the pollen from stamen to stigma with a small paintbrush or the tip of your finger.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rescue teams had begun disembarking the first people early that morning when the vessel capsized.Photos and videos of thechaotic scenesshow the boat partially submerged and completely overturned, with several people struggling to swim around it and others trying to climb on to the wrecked boat. Underneath, about 15 women and girls were trapped and fighting to get to the surface. Seven would not make it.View image in fullscreenThis grab from a video shows the boat capsizing while people were disembarking.Photograph: Television Canaria/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter a 10-day journey from the west coast ofAfrica, 145 people who had been on the boat made it ashore, but the seven women and children were buried in three cemeteries on El Hierro.The deaths shocked an island that has quickly become ahotspot of Europe’s migration crisis. As the EU seeks to crack down on routes across the Mediterranean, more people have resorted to crossing the Atlantic to reach the Canary Islands – one of the mostdangerous crossingsinto Europe. More than 20,000 migrants arrived in El Hierro in 2024, according to theRed Cross– almost double the island’s population.The incident also shone a light on the large numbers of women and girls now attempting the long and dangerous migration route from Africa – they made up almost half of the passengers on the capsized boat.View image in fullscreenThe funeral of one of the seven women and children drowned in the tragedy.Photograph: Borja Suárez/ReutersSince 2021, nearly 15% of irregular entries to the Canary Islands have been women, according to data collected by the Spanish Commission for Refugee Aid (Cear). Most of them are coming from the Sahel region, according to the UN’s refugee agency, which saysescalating conflictshave forcibly displaced millions of people from Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali.Human rights groups say increasing numbers of women are now visible on migration routes from Africa, driven by the familiar issues of armed conflicts and poverty, but also unique problems such as escaping gender-based violence and forced marriage. “Women are becoming the main actors in their own migration process, whereas in the past it was usually the men who migrated first and the women joined later,” says Juan Carlos Lorenzo, a coordinator at Cear.Madeleine*, who was travelling with her five-year-old niece on the capsized boat, has told the Guardian she decided to leave after her husband abandoned her. She was criticised by his family when she began looking for work. “They were saying I was seeing other men, which wasn’t true. I couldn’t take it any more and made the decision.”View image in fullscreenMany women and children were below deck in compartments usually used to store fish.Photograph: Anna SurinyachAt the time she was looking after her niece and decided it would be better for her to come too. “When her mother died, the family wanted to take the girl to undergo genital mutilation, but I refused to accept it. When I said no, they started to fight a lot against me. I couldn’t leave my niece there, so I brought her with me.”Madeleine says she was on the deck of the boat when it capsized. Both of them fell into the water, where Madeleine says she initially tried to hold her niece tightly, but had to let go because she couldn’t keep her own head above water. “I started screaming and crying. I had the girl in my arms, but we were both sinking. I let her go.” Ultimately, both were rescued.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They were reunited three days later.Other women from the boat were wary of going into details about why they had left Africa. Sira*, who was one of the women trapped under the boat when it capsized, says she left Guinea to help her family and give her two daughters aged four and seven more opportunities. She says she travelled inside enclosed compartments within the boat, typically used to store fish but repurposed for women and children during the voyage. When the boat capsized, she says, many women were struggling to breathe.View image in fullscreenThere were nearly 30 children on board the boat.Photograph: Borja Suárez/Reuters“Inside, there was a lot of water. We held on to ropes to lift our heads and breathe. My daughters were on the upper part of the boat; they were no longer with me at the bottom because [the rescue teams] had asked to disembark the children first. They fell into the water, but I stayed inside,” says Sira.Sira’s four-year-old daughter was one of the children who drowned.Initially, the rescue teams focused on helping those who had fallen into the sea, unable to see the people still trapped beneath the boat, as shown in footage broadcast by several television channels at the time. But after the boat flipped over again, several local residents jumped in to assist, pulling one person after another to safety.

What a nuclear wasteReaders respond to the energy secretary’s announcement of the new £14.2bn Sizewell C power station and Rolls-Royce winning the contract to develop small modular reactorsFri 13 Jun 2025 12.53 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 13.50 EDTShareRolls-Royce pressurised water reactors have powered British nuclear subs since 1966, but small modular reactors (SMRs) aren’t yet proven at scale anywhere on land (Rolls-Royce named winning bidder for UK small nuclear reactors, 10 June). Only three are operating worldwide: two in Russia, one in China. Argentina is constructing the world’s fourth; is Labour simply keen to keep up with historical geopolitical rivals (Sizewell C power station to be built as part of UK’s £14bn nuclear investment, 10 June)?The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) reported actualcost overruns of 300% to 700%for all four projects. Rolls-Royce claims costs of£35 to £50 per MWh; so should we triple this? The government says the SMR project would create 3,000 new low-carbon British jobs, but at what cost? The energy secretary, Ed Miliband, can’t know the true costs yet, and three reactors doesn’t scream “economies of scale”.Yet £2.5bn is already 10 times more than Great British Energy has invested into simple, cheap rooftop solar, which democratises energy savings. The true cost of renewables must consider intermittency and balancing costs, but why not invest more in flexibility through distributed renewables and grid-scale storage? And what of energy security? SMRs may mitigate against Putin snipping offshore wind cables, but increased reliance on imported uranium, and a heightened nuclear waste security threat, are significant risks.Last May, theIEEFA concludedthat SMRs “are still too expensive, too slow and too risky”, and that we “should embrace the reality that renewables, not SMRs, are the near-term solution to the energy transition”. Has this truly changed? The climate crisis requires scaling all feasible solutions as fast as possible, but, with limited capital, we should prioritise those that make economic sense today.Laurie HillMBA student, Cambridge Judge Business SchoolAs Nils Pratley says, Great British Energy’s budget has been nuked to divert funding away from local energy initiatives (11 June). But let’s get away from the idea that SMRs are a cutting-edge technology.Rolls-Royceis proposing a 470MW reactor, the same size as the first-generation Magnox reactors. Their “small” modular reactor, if it ever emerges, will use the familiar method of generating a lot of heat in a very complex and expensive manner, in order to boil water and turn a turbine. It will bequeath yet more radioactive waste to add to the burden and risk at Sellafield.In the meantime, if government SMR funding continues, it takes money away from opportunities for cutting-edge technical and social innovation, discovery and training all around the country, as schools, hospitals, community groups, network operators and all of us get to grips with renewables-based systems. This sort of innovation is necessary, it’s already benefiting us and it needs full-on government support rather than uneasy compromises with an increasingly redundant nuclear industry.Sarah DarbyEmerita research fellow, Environmental Change InstituteI’m a Scot who moved to the US in 1982. I returned to the UK seven years ago. In my time in the US, I worked with a few contractors as a chemist and health and safety manager on a number of environmental clean-up projects, chemical, biological and nuclear. The nuclear clean-up sites I worked on directly and indirectly wereHanfordin Washington state, andRocky Flats, Colorado.The multibillion-dollar Hanford cleanup is ongoing. Most of the problems there are as a result of gross mismanagement of nuclear waste during the cold war.I very much believe in wind, solar and other environmental solutions to energy production. I am cautiously supportive of small‑scale nuclear energy, but outraged by this government’s failure to include thecosts of the disposal of past, current and future nuclear waste in its support of “cheap energy”.HasEd Milibandtaken into account future waste management issues? Google Hanford cleanup to see the real expense. Can we trust this and any future government to protect the environment, public health and the taxpayer from future nuclear “cost overruns”?Peter HolmyardEdinburghThe more I read about the government’s nuclear intentions, the more it sounds like HS2 all over again, ie another financial boondoggle. Where are the detailed costings? What is our experience with cost overruns, eg atHinkley Point C? What is the overseas experience with pressurised water reactors (the kind proposed for Sizewell C) at Olkiluoto, at Flamanville, at Taishan? Uniformly bad in all cases, actually.No matter which way you look at this, viz the future cost overruns, the facts that we consumers will be on the hook for them, that reactors are never constructed on time, that nuclear wastes are unaudited, that we have to import all our uranium, that the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in 2023 that renewables are10 times betterthan nuclear at lowering carbon emissions, all point to a remarkably poor decision by the government, sad to say.Dr Ian FairlieIndependent consultant on radioactivity in the environment; vice-president,Campaign for Nuclear DisarmamentHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

During my 22-year career we have seen fundamental changes in medical training, including the introduction of tuition fees for medical school, loss of free accommodation for first-year doctors, the lack of expansion in training numbers, and pay erosion over 15 years.This has left many resident doctors with crippling debt on graduation, spiralling costs of training, deteriorating pay, and the prospect of unemployment. I, and the authors of the letter, were fortunate enough not to face such hardships during training.Hence I urge colleagues not to influence the negotiations between the British Medical Association (BMA) and the government regarding resident doctors’ pay. A mandate for strike action is a strong negotiating position, and I for one welcome productive discussions between the government and the BMA to reach a fair settlement. If senior clinicians cannot be supportive of our resident doctors, I suggest that they sit on their hands (with regard to writing letters) and bite their lip.Dr Ajay M VermaKettering, NorthamptonshireA group of medical professionals write urging resident doctor colleagues to vote against proposed strike action. They cite the Hippocratic oath. They appear to overlook the daily flouting of the oath by colleagues who are active in the systems of American‑accountable care that have replaced a NationalHealthService in England.In these, “first do no harm” appears to have been replaced by “first protect the bottom line”. The unrest among health workers is not merely about pay; it is about the degradation of an entire public service and its subservience to corporate interests, many of them American.Let’s have impassioned letters urging the expulsion of Palantir and co and a return to the principles of Bevan rather than BlackRock. It is untrue to say “there is no spare money”. The money simply goes into the wrong pockets.Kevin DonovanBirkenhead, MerseysideThe six senior doctors who wrote to you are key among those responsible for allowing the NHS to become such an unpleasant work environment for training doctors. As Wes Streeting so eloquently pointed out, the NHS treats training doctors “like crap”. A lot could be done to improve the working lives of doctors – simply telling them not to strike is unhelpful and suggests indifference to the challenges they face. Declared interest: parent of two resident doctors.Stuart EvansMonmouthI am a formerNHSGP now living and working in Canada. I read with interest that senior doctors recommend junior doctors don’t strike. Would these be senior doctors who had their university education paid for by the state, then had their hospital accommodation paid for by the state, and then enjoyed a fixed benefit pension that kicked in at age 60 (for most of their careers)? Society looked after them well. Could it be possible that today’s resident doctors have a different point of view for a reason?I suppose the other thing to say is that fixing morale in the NHS and deciding where society spends its money is outside the remit of the doctor. But fixing the NHS is the government’s prerogative.Tom NewthNelson, British Columbia, CanadaHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It is especially alarming that this conclusion was reached by one of the three principal authors of the recent strategic defence review.The false premise is that Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is the first step to make Russia “a dominant military power in all of Europe”. Evidence that Britain is already under attack is provided by “the poisonings, assassinations, sabotage operations … cyber-attacks and influence operations ... sensors … around critical pipelines, efforts to butcher undersea cables”. It follows that Britain’s economy and society must be geared up to resist the Russian menace. Deny the premise and the argument for a “whole society” mobilisation against Russia collapses. What it reveals is the strength of the warmongering mood of official Britain.This is not to deny that we have to take precautions against the real danger of a significant US pullout, perhaps amounting to rendering article 5 of the Nato treaty meaningless, and that the Russians can be quite ruthless in exploiting an advantage if they think they have one. But this is a far cry from proposing, as the strategic defence review does, a national mobilisation in face of an immediate and pressing Russian threat.Robert SkidelskyEmeritusprofessorof political economy, Warwick University,Richard BalfeFormerMEP,Anthony BrentonBritish ambassador to Russia, 2004-08,Thomas FaziAuthor and journalist,Anatol LievenSenior fellow, Quincy Institute for Responsible Statesmanship,Ian ProudSenior diplomat,British embassy, Moscow, 2014-18,Geoffrey RobertsProfessor, University CollegeCork,Richard SakwaEmeritus professorof Russian and east European studies, University of Kent,Brigitte GranvilleProfessorof international economics and economic policy, Queen Mary University of LondonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Different from urban areas, the bulk of their use is by those on low incomes, particularly pensioners, most of whom cannot afford a car or are unable to drive one. Over 20% of UK households do not have access to a car. Passenger demand for such services is relatively low in terms of numbers, but for those who do use them it is usually the only way they can get to the shops, go to the doctor, see friends etc. I have heard many describe their local bus service as a lifeline.The problem in terms of cost – but also in terms of image – is that a large standard bus, carrying six or seven passengers much of the time, is hugely expensive to operate and, for the onlookers in their cars, a “wasteful” use of council tax.The better, much cheaper option is to use 16-seater minibuses. Obviously these have a much lower capital cost, but also much lower running costs, particularly the cost of drivers as they are not required to have public service vehicle licences but merely, if under 70, a normal driving licence. They are also more manoeuvrable down country lanes or around housing estates. The local nature of the service means the regular passengers know the regular drivers and, of course, each other, which creates a friendly and supportive environment. Often the experience is so important for someone living alone.At the moment, virtually all the minibuses in passenger operation are converted vans. If the government recognises that minibuses are the most cost-effective solution for rural bus services then there is an opportunity here for entrepreneurs – or perhaps the government – to build minibuses specifically for passengers.Mike ParkerDirector general, Nexus (Tyne& Wear PassengerTransportExecutive), 1994-2006; chair, West Oxfordshire Community Transport, 2023-24Explore more on these topicsPublic transportTransportRural affairslettersShareReuse this content"

After his arrest, Ojwang was driven about 200 miles (350km) to Nairobi, where he died two days later.Mukhwana was the cell sentry officer on duty the night Ojwang, 31, was brought to the central police station in Nairobi, the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA) told a court in the capital on Friday.Presenting Mukhwana in court, the IPOA sought permission to detain him for 21 days in order to carry out investigations. The court will deliver its ruling on 20 June.Mukhwana’s court appearance is the latest development in what has become a fast-moving case.Police originally said Ojwang had died “after hitting his head against a cell wall”, but an autopsy showed that his wounds – including a head injury, neck compression and several soft tissue injuries – were likely to have been the result of assault. “These were injuries that were externally inflicted,” said Dr Bernard Midia, who led a team of pathologists for the postmortem examination.On Wednesday, Douglas Kanja, the inspector general of police, apologised on behalf of the police for suggesting Ojwang had died after hitting his head against a wall, saying that had been “misinformation”.The IPOA launched an investigation that encompasses the actions of the officers who arrested Ojwang in Homa Bay county and took him to Nairobi. On Tuesday, the police spokesperson Michael Muchiri said five officers had been removed from active duty to “allow for transparent investigations”.Ojwang’s death caused outrage online and protests in Nairobi as people demanded accountability and called for the resignation of the deputy inspector general, Eliud Kipkoech Lagat, who was the subject of Ojwang’s comments.Police fired teargas on Monday to disperse protesters as they marched to the central police station, then again on Thursday as protesters set vehicles ablaze.Ojwang’s death rekindled persistent public anger about police brutality and other high-handedness in Kenya, where officers are rarely convicted. It came nearly a year afterunprecedented proteststhat led to the killings of dozens of protesters and thedisappearancesand abductions of many more.Kenya’s president, William Ruto, said this week that Ojwang had died “at the hands of the police” and ordered the National Police Service to cooperate with the IPOA investigation. He said Ojwang’s death was “heartbreaking and unacceptable”, adding: “I strongly condemn the actions and omissions, including any negligence or outright criminality, that may have contributed to his untimely death.”Ruto has previously promised to stop extrajudicial killings by members of the law enforcement, but activists and rights groups have criticised his administration for failing to stop it and even accused it of concealing the crimes.Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It is the latest in a series of high-profile cases of violence against women and children in the country.Friends of Mongale, a former journalist who had been studying for a master’s degree in ICT policy, raised the alarm when she stopped checking in with them while on a date in Johannesburg on 25 May. Her body was found that day.The main suspect, Philangenkosi Makhanya, was killed in a shootout with police five days later, while another suspect, Bongani Mthimkhulu, remains on the run. South African police said more than 20 women had come forward to claim the two men had kidnapped and robbed them after masquerading as suitors at malls across SouthAfrica, in what police called a “romance dating scam”.South Africa has one of the highest rates of femicide in the world, according to available data. In the year to 31 March 2024, more than 27,600 people were murdered, 5,578 of them women and 1,656 children, according to South African policedata.Globally, in 2023, approximately 1.3 women per 100,000 were killed by an intimate partner or relative,according tothe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC) found that during the first year of the Covid-19 pandemicthe rate was 5.5.Cameron Kasambala, the community manager at the advocacy groupWomenFor Change, said: “Women die no matter what they do. They’ve been stabbed while they sleep, shot in broad daylight and had their houses burned down by former partners.”She pointed to the violent repression of South Africa’s black majority by the white minority during apartheid, which ended more than three decades ago. “Men compensate by becoming hypermasculine, by being violent and aggressive … It’s rooted in our violent history and exacerbated by poverty and substance abuse,” said Kasambala.Other high-profile cases have included Racquel “Kelly” Smithselling her six-year-old daughter Joshlin, and that of Uyinene Mrwetyana, a student whose rape and murder in 2019 sparked huge protests. However, activists emphasise that thousands more go unnoticed every year.View image in fullscreenProtesters sing and chant during a demonstration calling for gender-based violence and femicide to be declared a national disaster in Pretoria on 11 April.Photograph: Phill Magakoe/AFP/GettyIn April, Women For Change handed over apetitionwith 150,000 signatures demanding that the government declare “gender-based violence and femicide” (GBVF) to be a national disaster. Kasambala said: “This stance will then filter down to the police, the courts and hospitals.”Sindisiwe Chikunga, the minister for women, youth and persons with disabilities, replied in aletter: “The government remains fully committed to a whole-of-society, multi-sectoral response to the GBVF crisis.” She did not mention the national disaster demand.Naeemah Abrahams, who leads the SAMRC’s femicide research, said: “When we try and solve it, it’s not going to be just the law. We’ve got great laws.”Social norms around men being financial providers fuel violence, Abrahams said, with many believing, “if women step out of these societal expectations, she should be corrected for it”.Olorato Mongale, right, with a friend, was ‘a bubbly ball of energy’.Mongale’s loved ones were incredibly proud of her achievements, said Criselda Kananda, the best friend of Mongale’s mother, Keabetswe. These included teaching English in South Korea and buying a flat in her home city of Bloemfontein.Kananda said: “Olorato was such a bubbly ball of energy, who just lit up any space that she entered, who never took no for an answer.”On Monday, Mongale’s mother went to her only child’s apartment for the first time since her death and found baking ingredients ready to make a cake. Kananda said: “We really are struggling … It’s things like these that are now painting a reality that she is no more.”Explore more on these topicsSouth AfricaFemicideAfricaViolence against women and girlsWomennewsShareReuse this content"

Canada has reportedly pushed for more work on investigations into extrajudicial killings.Earlier this month, Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney, was forced to defend his decision to invite the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to the G7 summit in Alberta after Canada’s federal police said the shooting death of Hardeep Singh Nijjar wasorchestrated by the “highest levels” of the Indian government.Carney said there was a “legal process that is literally under way and quite advanced inCanada”, following questions over his decision to invite Modi. Four Indian nationals living in Canada have been charged with Nijjar’s murder.Carney also cited India’s status as the “fifth largest economy in the world, the most populous country in the world and central to supply chains”. But the decision did not sit well with lawmakers from British Columbia. A member of Carney’s Liberal caucus, Sukh Dhaliwal, met with the prime minister earlier this the week to express concern over the invitation.“We as Canadians take pride to be a champion on human rights. We are the country of law and justice,” Dhaliwal, who represents the electoral district where Nijjar was killed, told the Canadian Press. “When it comes to protecting fundamental rights and serving justice for the victim, it is non-negotiable.”Dhaliwal said that the prime minister was “alarmed about the issue” and would be “very strong in dealing” with the issue when speaking to his Indian counterpart.Ever since former prime minister Justin Trudeau accused India of orchestrating the high-profile assassination of Nijjar, Ottawa and New Delhi have been locked in a worsening feud over the issue.India temporarily stopped issuing in visas in Canada and, soon after, Canada expelled six senior diplomats, including the high commissioner, Sanjay Verma. India retaliated by ordering the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the acting high commissioner.“The Indian government made a horrific mistake in thinking that they could interfere as aggressively as they did in the safety and sovereignty of Canada,” Trudeau told a public inquiry into foreign interference, adding that Canada had not wanted to “blow up” its valuable relationship with India. But he said afterNijjarwas killed, “we had clear and certainly now ever clearer indications that India had violated Canada’s sovereignty”.The Bloomberg report, which underscores Carney’s attempts to mend relations with powerful nations, follows revelations that a suspected Indian government agent was surveilling former New Democratic party leader Jagmeet Singh as part of its network of coercion and intimidation.According to Global News, the person, with suspected ties to both the Indian government andthe Lawrence Bishnoi gang implicated in Nijjar’s death, knew Singh’s daily routines, travel plans and family. When the RCMP realized there was a credible thread to this life, they placed the federal party leader under police protection.“India targeted a Canadian politician on Canadian soil. That’s absolutely unprecedented. As far as we’re concerned, that’s an act of war,” Balpreet Singh, a spokesperson for the World Sikh Organization, said after of the Global News report. “If Jagmeet Singh isn’t safe … what does it mean for the rest of us?”Explore more on these topicsCanadaIndiaMark CarneyNarendra ModiAmericasSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

She sought help at another hospital, but was only given oxygen after waiting for 10 hours.Soon after, she fell into a coma. Twenty-two days after giving birth, she died.Now, five years later, her family has filed what is believed to be the first legal action against the Brazilian state over a maternal death linked to Covid-19. Although all the hospitals named in the lawsuit are federally funded, the case is being brought against the municipal government of Rio, which is responsible for managing the facilities.“One thing that stayed with me was a video, months after my sister’s death, showing the president [Bolsonaro]mocking people who were short of breath,” said Frazão’s sister, Érika, 37. “That really hurt because my sister arrived at the hospital exactly like that.”Her family argues that Frazão – whose two sons are now 16 and five – died due to negligence, malpractice and mistreatment at the state-run hospitals where she sought care.View image in fullscreenEny, mother of Lidiane Frazão, shows her daughter’s wedding album, taken while Lidiane was still pregnant with her son Carlos.Photograph: Leonardo Carrato/The Guardian“She told me she was mistreated at the hospital”, said her mother, Eny, 69, who is raising her two grandsons along with the children’s father.Eny still remembers how lovingly her daughter planned for the second pregnancy. “When she wasn’t working, she’d lie right here on this sofa, in this very spot, talking to him in her belly,” said her mother, sitting in the family home in a bucolic corner of Rio de Janeiro’s North Zone.A group of lawyers, researchers and activists supporting the lawsuit argue that the case is emblematic of a series of problems that, at one point during the pandemic, made Brazil the world leader in maternal deaths,accounting for 80% of the total.Often, the women struggled to get treatment, said anthropologistDébora Diniz, a professor at the University of Brasília and one of those behind the lawsuit. “They’d arrive at a maternity ward and the doctor would say, ‘You have Covid-19, go to a hospital.’ Then at the hospital, another doctor would say, ‘You’re pregnant, go to the maternity ward.’”Diniz coordinates a group at the universitythat carried out aqualitative studyto understand why so many maternal deaths were occurring in Brazil. The reasons included delays in Covid-19 testing and a reluctance to admit patients, as happened with Frazão.The researcher believes Frazão’s death was also the result of “denialism” by the then-president Bolsonaro, who activelyopposed vaccines, social distancingand lockdowns,while mocking victimsand promotingineffective treatments like hydroxychloroquine.Diniz says that the Bolsonaro administration also failed to “establish specific policies” for pregnant women, who were already known to be more vulnerable. “It failed her and all the other women in the same situation,” said the anthropologist.View image in fullscreenEny on the left, mother of Lidiane Frazão, and Mônika, Lidiane’s sister, walking back home together with a view of Guanabara Bay.Photograph: Leonardo Carrato/The GuardianThe lawsuit seeks compensation and a lifelong pension for her family, as well as formal recognition of the state’s responsibility for her death.The researchers and lawyers commissioned a gynaecologist and obstetrician to conduct an expert review of what happened to her.The list of alleged failings is extensive, and began as early as her prenatal care, when Frazão was reportedly never identified as having a high-risk pregnancy.According to the victim’s family, there was also a racial element, as Frazão was a black woman.“If my daughter were white, this wouldn’t have happened to her,” said her mother, Eny.Immediately after giving birth, Frazão complained of shortness of breath, but doctors at the hospital reportedly dismissed it as “anxiety” and told her to see a psychiatrist.View image in fullscreenEny, on the left, and Mônika Frazão sit side by side among photo albums filled with images of Lidiane from every stage of her life.Photograph: Leonardo Carrato/The Guardian“That’s racism,” said her sister Érika. “Black women are always treated as if we don’t feel pain or are seen as nervous or unstable.”In the lawsuit, they argue that Frazão was also a victim of “obstetric racism” and the systemic mistreatment of Black women within Brazil’s public healthcare system.During the pandemic, most of the maternal deaths were among black women; to this day, Afro-Brazilian women facetwice the risk of dyingduring pregnancy, childbirth or postpartum compared with white women.“There are protocols, and doctors are trained to deal with everything that happened to her – but when the patient is a black woman, all of that is ignored,” said Mariane Marçal, assistant project coordinator atCriola, the other organisation supporting the case.In 2011, Brazil became thefirst government to be condemnedby an international conventional body – the United Nation’s Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women – for a preventable maternal death.Alyne Pimentel Teixeira, 28, who was also black, died six months into her pregnancy after seeking medical care and being sent home with only a prescription but no tests.Outrage in Brazil as Jair Bolsonaro avoids five charges related to Covid responseRead more“If Brazil had fulfilled the obligations set out in that ruling, Frazão would not have died,” said Mônica Sacramento, programme coordinator at Criola.Rio’s city government said the events took place under the previous mayor, that “the teams involved have since been changed,” and that it would cooperate with the judiciary to “help clarify the case.”Frazão’s eldest sister, Mônika Frazão, 54, hopes the case will bring about change in Brazil.“We want the state to acknowledge that it failed us, that it failed her and her children … It might be wishful thinking, but we hope this means others won’t have to go through the same pain we did,” she said.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasCoronavirusRaceMaternal mortalityJair BolsonaronewsShareReuse this content"

Some overlap with Indigenous territories or conservation areas, including marine reserves around the island paradise of Fernando de Noronha. Arayara also argues that the ANP has failed to transparently assess the true scope of greenhouse gas emissions from exploration and possible future production of oil and gas in these areas.The Amazon basin is at the centre of the debate surrounding the future of oil exploration in Brazil. The state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, has spent years trying to obtain an environmental licence to drill there, and Lula has put pressure on the environmental watchdog, Ibama, to deliver the permit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Just a few months away from hostingCop30, continuing to bet on oil is a glaring contradiction.“The Amazon is dangerously close to a tipping point, and clinging to this model pushes Brazil and the world closer to climate collapse.”Explore more on these topicsOilFossil fuelsAmazon rainforestBrazilAmericasCop30EnergynewsShareReuse this content"

His office said he will meet Xi and China’s premier, Li Qiang, for a visit focused on trade, but which would also discuss “the comprehensive bilateral relationship and key regional and global issues”.“The challenging global outlook makes it vital that we are sharing perspectives and engagingChinaon issues that matter to New Zealand,” Luxon said.Chinese fighter jet in near miss with Japan military plane as Pacific tensions riseRead moreIt will be Luxon’s his first visit to China since he was elected in October 2023.The announcement of the visit comes a week after an open letter signed by former New Zealand political leaders, including former prime ministers Helen Clark and Sir Geoffrey Palmer, urged Luxon to use his visit “to make it clear at the highest level that New Zealand retains its bipartisan commitment to its strategic partnership with China”.The letter said recent government statements appeared to be “positioning New Zealand alongside the United States as an adversary of China”.“We see considerable disadvantage to New Zealand in becoming part of defence arrangements, including the associated prospective Aukus Pillar Two, which are explicitly aimed at China,” they wrote.“We do believe that a military relationship with the United States directed against China has many risks for New Zealand.”“It would not be surprising if China were to come to the conclusion that the special relationship which New Zealand has had with it since becoming the first developed country to have a free trade agreement with it in 2008 is no longer so valued by New Zealand,” the letter said.Foreign minister Winston Peters has dismissed the letter, saying there was “no value in indulging the tired arguments of various former politicians/officials who appear to be suffering from relevance deprivation syndrome”.In May, Peterstold the Guardianthe Pacific must be protected from becoming a military zone amid China’s growing push for influence in the region.New Zealand’s relationship with China has been subject to debate, as the US-Beijing rivalry heightens tensions in the region, and Beijing’s behaviour grows more expansionist. In February, China’s military heldlive-fire drills in the Tasman Sea, with little to no notice given, prompting rebuke from both Wellington and Canberra.Speaking to the Guardian at the Shangri-la dialogue in Singapore earlier this month, prior to the letter and Luxon’s announcement, New Zealand’s defence minister, Judith Collins, defended the government’s hawkish turn, which includes almost doubling its defence spending, saying it was “about time”.“The Pacific will become an area of strategic tension and competition. And the best way to prepare for that is to do our bit to defend ourselves, but also to work with Australia and like-minded partners as much as possible,” she said.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandChinaChristopher LuxonAsia PacificXi JinpingnewsShareReuse this content"

A separate motion from the Young Nationals calls for the Nationals to advocate for withdrawal from the Paris agreement.Nationals on brink of hammering out revised deal with Liberals while insisting ‘we did not blink’Read moreSince the federal election in May, the Nationals have continued to fight publicly and privately over whether to hold fast to the goal of reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050, a target they agreed to in 2021, despite strong internal opposition.A decision to abandon the target by the NSW branch, which contains more moderate elements of the Nationals, would be a new headache for federal opposition leader, Sussan Ley, who managed to patch up the Coalition last month after the Nationals briefly announced they would split.It would also increase pressure on the Nationals leader, David Littleproud, who has stuck by thenet zero target to date, despite deep internal dissent.The rapprochement in the Coalition was achieved by Ley agreeing to discuss the Coaltion’s future position on net zero internally in coming months.“We have to play, as a country, our part in the global response to climate change. Net zero, Paris targets, gas, all of the resources, conversations around critical minerals, they’re all part of that,”Ley said recently.But she has added it cannot come at any cost, leaving open a possibility of a more nuanced position.On the other hand, Ley faces deep concern in her own Liberal party over the lack of climate policy, particularly from the moderates.The Liberals have now lost all their federal heartland city seats in Sydney to independents who campaigned on tackling climate change.The Nationals state conference also passed a motion on immigration calling for the slashing of Australia’s immigration targets by 50% for four years, to below 100,000 a year.A motion from the Young NSW Nationals branch, aimed at providing incentives to boost Australia’s birthrate, was defeated.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe motion called on the party to support “a 25% income tax discount per child, up to a maximum of four children for parents … to encourage a strong and growing Australia”.A family with four children would have paid no income tax at all.Another motion from the Coffs Harbour branch, which called on the Nationals to provide subsidies to stay-at-home parents equivalent to the subsidies their taxes would have contributed towards government funded childcare, was also defeated.Both policies would have cost billions. The Howard-era baby bonus of 2004 caused only a slight uptick in the birthrate before the downward trend continued.The overall fertility rate has dropped in recent decades, falling from two babies per woman in 2008 to1.6 in 2023.The Northern Tablelands branch is proposing tough new policies on bail. The motion calls for no bail for offenders who already have a criminal record in the last five years and for offenders who commit a crime while on bail.The Cowra branch has proposed a motion that advocates for the removal of Australian citizenship from people born overseas and deportation if they commit serious crimes or demonstrate “toxic, antisocial behaviour or prejudice”.Explore more on these topicsNew South Wales politicsNew South WalesNational partynewsShareReuse this content"

Once it gets into the environment, it’s almost impossible to get it out and it’s causing devastation to our wildlife,” she said.“We need to be enacting domestic solutions … Recycling alone won’t end plastic pollution.”Jeff Angel, a leading plastics campaigner and director of theBoomerang Alliance, said Australia’s desire for a global plastics treaty “must also mean high ambition at home”.Australia had a substantial “unfinished” agenda dealing with plastics, he said, withrecycling and recovery rates stuck at just 12.5%.“The vast majority of plastic polluting our coasts, waterways, public spaces, soil and air is generated domestically,” Angel said.Protecting sharks and the open oceanWhile in Nice, Australia joined nine other countries, including France, the UK and Spain, in a new coalition tohalt the extinction of sharks and rays.A federal government spokesperson said this would “generate momentum for urgent, coordinated conservation efforts”.Watt told the conference Australia would expand its ocean area protected from fishing, drilling and miningto 30% by 2030.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree newsletterAdam Morton brings you incisive analysis about the politics and impact of the climate crisisEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It would also “promote, develop and deliver educational courses regarding game animals”.The authority would have eight members, while seven of those would have voting rights. Four of the voting members would be nominated by hunting organisations.The bill proposes other changes, including enshrining a “right to hunt” and recognition of hunting as a conservation management tool.It would also require managers of some public lands – primarily state forests and travelling stock reserves and excluding national parks – to consider the impact on hunters of any land management activity.James Trezise, the chief executive of the scientist-led Biodiversity Council, said evidence showed professional programs were most effective for controlling invasive species.For example, he said feral pigs had been effectively eradicated from Kangaroo Island off South Australia through a multi-year dedicated control program using professional shooters. He also pointed to the NSW government’s recent efforts in the Kosciuszko national park to use all tools available, including aerial shooting, to cull thousands of feral horses, deer and pigs.Explore more on these topicsNew South WalesChris MinnsnewsShareReuse this content"

EDTShareA select group of environment and industry leaders will be brought together in a fresh attempt to build consensus on a long-awaited rewrite of federal nature laws, Guardian Australia can reveal.The environment minister, Murray Watt, will soon detail the next phase of consultation as he presses ahead with an ambition to enactsweeping changesto the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC) in the next 18 months.Federal EPA a ‘very high and immediate’ priority of Albanese government, environment minister saysRead moreAfter the first-term Albanese governmentshelved proposed reformsamid lobbying from miners and the Western Australian government, Watt has restarted the process.The past failures, combined with the approval of major fossil fuel projects and the rushed passage of laws toprotect Tasmania’s salmon industry, have environmentalists worried about Labor’s second term.But they also believe Labor’s resounding election victory gives it scope to act “quickly and boldly” to deliver serious reform.“Australians are tired of the bush being bulldozed and burnt and elected a government that will act on nature and on climate,” the Wilderness Society’s national campaigns director, Amelia Young, said.A new standardAlmost five years have passed sinceGraeme Samuel handed his reviewof the EPBC Act to the then environment minister Sussan Ley, exposing how the systemic failures of successive governments had left Australia’s unique species in unsustainable decline.The centrepiece of Samuel’s 38 recommendations was a set of national environmental standards turning Australia’s laws from a process-focused system to one focused on outcomes.Standards that deliver outcomes for the environment and reverse wildlife decline are one of the big demands of the environment movement in this term.“You’d want to see national environmental standards stipulating places that development should be off limits, such as critical habitat or essential breeding populations,” said James Trezise, the director of the scientist-led Biodiversity Council.Sign up to get climate and environment editor Adam Morton’s Clear Air column as a free newsletterA suite ofnational environmental standardswas supposed to form the third stage of Labor’s Nature Positive Plan, which never saw the light of day as the government prioritised its ultimately doomed environment protection agency (EPA).The decision of Watt’s predecessor, Tanya Plibersek, tosplit the reform into stages– starting with the federal EPA – was widely criticised as delaying the urgent task of fixing the EPBC Act.Senior Labor sources confirmed Watt was leaning toward a different route, pursuing an EPA and amendments to the EPBC Act in one package to avoid dragging out the process.Environmental organisations also want an end to the “climate blindness” of Australia’s environmental laws, an end to loopholes such as the effective exemption granted to logging under regional forest agreements, and a clearer focus on what’s needed for the recovery of threatened species.Brendan Sydes, the AustralianConservationFoundation’s national biodiversity policy adviser, said any reform package needed to address the “highly discretionary” nature of the existing laws.“Because otherwise we just continue to have a situation where people can continue to bring forward proposals that destroy threatened species habitat,” he said.A watchdog with teethThe biggest point of tension between industry and environmental groups might be something the Samuel review never even recommended.Whereas Samuel advocated fora commissioner to monitor and auditthe processes governments used to make environmental decisions, Labor proposed an entirelynew agencythat would both enforce nature laws and assess projects.Anthony Albanese offered to strip the agency of decision-making powers in a failed attempt to win the Coalition’s support in the previous term.The design of the EPA 2.0 is up in the air – and will be fiercely contested.Environment groups including the Australian Conservation Foundation maintain the watchdog must have compliance and decision-making powers and be governed by an independent board.“We need an independent regulator with responsibility for decision-making on assessments and approvals, rather than just a compliance and enforcement EPA,” Sydes said.Industry groups that represent major mining companies are staunchly opposed to such a model, instead favouring Samuel’s approach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toClear Air AustraliaFree

Brent crude surged by more than 7% after news of the attacks broke, briefly moving above $75 (£55) a barrel to its highest level since April.Stocks fell on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 falling 1.1% and the Nasdaq down 1.3%. Airline stocks, including Delta, United and American declined on fears that fuel costs could climb if there were issues with oil supply.News of the strikes affected the aviation industry as airlines cleared the airspace over the region, while investors turned to safe investment assets such as gold.The British Airways owner, IAG, was the top faller on London’sFTSE100, closing 3.7% down, and shares in the airline easyJet ended the day 2.7% lower.One of the top risers on the UK blue-chip index was the weapons producer BAE Systems, up almost 3%, reflecting concerns that the Israel-Iran conflict could escalate. In the US, the share prices of military suppliers including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and RTX all rose. The oil companies BP and Shell also gained value, with the former closing nearly 2% up and the latter closing just over 1% higher.The price of gold was trading about 1% higher on Friday afternoon at $3,426 an ounce, close to the record high of $3,500 it hit in April.“The geopolitical escalation adds another layer of uncertainty to already fragile sentiment,” said Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo. Stocks dived in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei down 1.3%, South Korea’s Kospi falling 1.1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipping 0.8%.In Europe, major markets across Germany, France, Italy and Spain all closed at least 1% down. In London, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 34 points at 8,850, 0.4% belowThursday’s record closing high.Israel, which said its attack was a “pre-emptive strike” over Iran’s nuclear programme, has declared a state of emergency as its military said Tehranhad launched 100 drones in retaliation.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, called Israel’s strikes againstIrana “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved.The move to perceived safe haven assets has resulted in the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes falling to a one-month low of 4.31%.Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It’s not just the outlook for Iranian exports that’s a concern but also the potential for disruption to shipping in the Persian Gulf’s strait of Hormuz, a key route for about 20% of global oil flows and an even higher proportion of liquified natural gas haulage.”Much of the world’s oil, as well as key commodities such as grain, passes through busy sea lanes in the Middle East, including the strait of Hormuz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Greek shipping association has urged shipowners to provide details of vessels sailing through the strait.“Any closure of the strait of Hormuz would see services rerouted, with increased reliance on Indian west coast ports for connecting the far east to the Indian subcontinent,” said Peter Sand of the shipping analytics company Xeneta. “The inevitable disruption and port congestion, as well as the potential for higher oil prices, would cause a spike in ocean freight container shipping rates.”A large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea now “seems less likely”, according to Sand.Attacks on vessels by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen18 months ago led to many ships being diverted around the Cape of Good Hope, a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape peninsula in South Africa, adding thousands of miles to journeys and pushing up shipping rates.Energean, a UK gas producer, said on Friday it had temporarily suspended the production and activities of its facility off the coast of northern Israel.Energean told investors it had received a notice from Israel’s ministry of energy and infrastructure ordering the suspension “following the recent geopolitical escalation in the region”.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsOilGoldEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaCommoditiesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

The European Commission insisted the British territory had to align its taxation policies with the EU in order to join a customs union, an integral part ofthe deal struck on Wednesday.“The agreement that we have reached is that they will, in a period of three years, reach a level [on a transaction tax] that is acceptable for us,” the person said.The agreement, hailed as “historic”, will erase the border separating the British overseas territory from the rest of the Iberian peninsula. Gibraltar will be connected to the EU’s border-free Schengen zone, meaning Gibraltarians can move freely in the surrounding region, although without rights to work and settle elsewhere in the EU.Passport checks will be carried out at the port and airport by British and Spanish border guards. Spanish officers will be empowered to deny entry to the British overseas territory to any British national who has already exceeded their 90-day stay limit. Under Schengen rules, UK citizens are limited to stays of 90 days within a 180-day period.Spanish customs officials will check goods entering Gibraltar via the land border, the main entry point for nearly all items. The British overseas territory will eventually enter into a customs union with the EU, which requires a further agreement.Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, welcomed “the tax convergence process that will ensure that everybody is treated fairly”. He said: “Now Gibraltar is linked to the customs union. There will be fair competition for everybody.”Madrid has long been concerned that cigarettes from Gibraltar were being illegally sold in Spain, while European anti-fraud investigators havewarned about cross-border smuggling by organised crime.The Gibraltar agreement came weeks after the UK and EUagreed a wider reset. EU sources said completing the unfinished business of Brexit for Gibraltar was necessary to move forward in other areas, such as defence and a veterinary agreement.Spain has been blocking British participation in defence projects and could have proved an obstacle to future deals if the status of Gibraltar had not been agreed. “Everyone wanted to find compromises, solutions etc, and it was the right moment to do that,” the official said.A spokesperson for Gibraltar’s government, which is responsible for setting taxation on the British overseas territory, said: “Gibraltar will now move to a de-facto import duty rate, to be called a transaction tax, which will be ‘no lower than the lowest in the EU’. That is currently 17% in Luxembourg. Gibraltar will start at 15% on the day the treaty comes into effect [and] rising 1% each year for the next two years.”The foreign secretary, David Lammy,told the House of Commonsthis week that Gibraltar “will not be applying VAT and will maintain its fiscal sovereignty”.Explore more on these topicsGibraltarSpainEuropean CommissionEuropean UnionEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The tipster was also concerned that a “large proportion” of those loans were tocompanies in the metals magnate Sanjeev Gupta’s troubled steel empire.The message added that the recent collapse of another set of Greensill-backed funds offered by rival asset manager GAM “should be taken as a strong warning … you need to take care”.One senior manager forwarded the 2018 tipoff to Lex Greensill, adding: “People in CS are receiving anonymous mails … seriously, you have to rethink your communication strategy!”Greensill Capital, founded in 2011, offered corporate loans, giving companies advances on their invoices in exchange for a fee. But its founder, the Australian melon farmer turned City banker, entered into a series of complex financial agreements and marketed his lender as a tech firm stacked with high-profile advisers including Cameron.Greensill went on to attract a series of large investors including General Atlantic and SoftBank, whose investments were purportedly meant to expand Greensill’s activities.“However, as it later turned out, these funds were primarily used to pay out private investors and to provide Greensill Bank, which was increasingly coming under regulatory scrutiny, with additional capital,” the Finma report stated. “Under the management of Lex Greensill, the company provide[d] customised suits for its employees, elegant business premises and its own fleet of business jets.”Finma’s report, which was compiled in December 2022 after nearly two years of investigations, showed Credit Suisse bosses continued to receive warnings over their dealings with Greensill as late as June 2019.Greensill was, at the time, still on the rise and had hoped to launcha £22bn stock market flotationbefore the Covid pandemic put its clients and investors under severe financial strain.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It came amid growing concern over the firm’s management and its outsized exposure to Gupta’s metals empire, which ultimately sparked astring of financial and political scandals.It forced Credit Suisse to close its $10bn Greensill-backed funds, leaving wealthy customers nursing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of losses and further eroding confidence in Credit Suisse. That led the Swiss regulator, Finma, to launch what became a near two-year investigation into its dealings with Greensill.The full resulting Finma report was never previously released. But key findings, released in February 2023, declared that Credit Suisse “seriously breached its supervisory obligations” and would face additional oversight for senior managers and important business relationships. The 167-year-old bank collapsed a month later, leading to its emergency rescue by rival UBS.UBS is still trying to recoup money for former investors of the Greensill-backed Credit Suisse funds.Commenting on the Finma report, UBS said: “This is a legacy Credit Suisse matter. The conduct described in the report pre-dates UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse.”A representative for Lex Greensill declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsCredit SuisseGreensillBankingEuropean banksFinancial sectorSwitzerlandEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In northern Tehran, residents reported fresh explosions as Iran’s state news agency, IRNA, said Israel had launched further strikes.The Fars news agency said two projectiles had hit Tehran’s Mehrabad airport, and Iranian media said flames were reported there. Close to key Iranian leadership sites, the airport hosts an air force base with fighter jets and transport aircraft.An Israeli military spokesperson said earlier that Iran had fired up to 100 missiles in waves earlier in the evening, and that most had been intercepted or missed their intended target, but several appeared to penetrate Israel’s multi-tiered defences.At about 9pm in Tel Aviv, sirens sounded and phones buzzed with urgent alerts. Half an hour later the city echoed with the mid-air explosions of the Arrow missile defence systems taking out some of the Iranian arsenal, debris smashing into the ground and the blasts of several Iranian warheads that struck their targets.View image in fullscreenIsrael’s Iron Dome air defence system fires to intercept missiles over Tel Aviv, Israel.Photograph: Léo Corrêa/APSmoke from one impact site rose up in columns so thick they obscured the city skyline including nearby skyscrapers, as bright fragments of intercepted missiles arced above. One missile hit a high-rise residential building near the heart of Tel Aviv, shattering windows down most of the facade, and reducing the worst-hit areas to a tangle of exposed, twisted steel bars.On the ground floor, fire fighters picked their way through the rubble beside the crumpled remains of a car caught in the blast, a report on Israeli TV showed.Israel’s ambulance service said 34 people were injured on Friday night in the Tel Aviv area, most with minor injuries. Police later said one person had died.The barrage began after a televised address from Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who pledged: “The armed forces of the Islamic republic will inflict heavy blows upon this malevolent enemy.” He warned the consequences of Israel’s attack “will bring it to ruin”.Earlier, the new head of the Revolutionary Guards, Mohammad Pakpour – hastily appointed after his predecessor was killed in Israel’s attack – threatened to open “the gates of hell” in retaliation, as the Middle East faced the prospect of a full-scale war of uncertain duration.View image in fullscreenIsraeli troops and first responders at a Tel Aviv building hit by a missile from Iran.Photograph: Gil Cohen-Magen/AFP/Getty ImagesIsrael’s defence minister, Israel Katz, accused Iran of crossing “red lines” by attacking civilian areas, although some of Israel’s own strikes earlier in the day hit residential parts of Iranian cities.“We will continue to defend the citizens of Israel and ensure that the Ayatollah regime pays a very heavy price for its heinous actions,” Katz said.Middle East countries call for urgent de-escalation after Israel’s strikes on IranRead moreThe Israeli pre-dawn strikes on Friday hit more than 100 targets in Iran, including nuclear facilities and missile sites, and killed senior military commanders and scientists in what Tehran said was a “declaration of war”.Iran’s envoy to the UN security council, Amir Saeid Iravani, said 78 people including senior officials had been killed in the Israeli attacks, and that more than 320 were injured, most of them civilians.In a video statement on Friday night, Netanyahu said: “In the past 24 hours, we have taken out top military commanders, senior nuclear scientists, the Islamic regime’s most significant enrichment facility and a large portion of its ballistic missile arsenal. More is on the way. The regime does not know what hit them, or what will hit them. It has never been weaker.”More explosions were reported in Iran on Friday evening and early on Saturday, suggesting a secondary phase of Israeli attacks was already under way, in the early stages of a war that has been brewing for a quarter of a century, ever since Iran’s secret underground uranium enrichment facilities were first exposed, and the US and Israel insisted the country would not be allowed to build a bomb.0:43Footage captures moment Iran's Natanz nuclear site is hit by Israel – videoThe focus of much of the Israeli munitions on Friday was the mostly subterranean uranium enrichment plant at Natanz. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, told the UN security council that the above-ground pilot enrichment plant at Iran’s main nuclear facility in Natanz had been destroyed, although he said the level of radioactivity outside the plant remained unchanged.Grossi said the UN was still gathering information about Israeli attacks on two other facilities, the Fordow fuel enrichment plant and at Isfahan.Officers of the Israel Defense Forces made clear their war aims were to seize the opportunity offered by Iran’s flattened air defences to wreak lasting, crippling damage on Iran’s nuclear programme.“That’s the goal, to remove the threat and to make sure they don’t have a nuclear bomb and that there is not an active existential threat on the Israeli people,” an IDF officer said.Among the uncertainties hanging over the region was how much of Iran’s arsenal of ballistic and cruise missiles were still usable, and whether Tehran would take revenge on the US as well as Israel.The US role in the attack remained murky. In the run-up to the Israeli 200-plane attack, Donald Trump had publicly urged Israel to give diplomacy more of a chance, before US-Iranian talks that were planned for Sunday. On Friday, the US president insisted he had been well informed of Israel’s plans, and described the Israeli attack as “excellent”.Asked by the Wall Street Journal what kind of heads-up the US had been given, Trump responded testily: “Heads-up? It wasn’t a heads-up. It was, we know what’s going on.”Trump scrambles to claim credit for Israel’s Iran attack he publicly opposedRead moreSpeaking separately to ABC News, he praised the attacks and linked the timing to a 60-day ultimatum he had given Tehran in the spring, to negotiate a deal. “I think it’s been excellent. We gave them a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard. They got hit about as hard as you’re going to get hit. And there’s more to come. A lot more,” Trump said.On his own Truth Social online platform, Trump urged Iran to make a deal or face further planned attacks that would be “even more brutal”.ABC quoted a “source familiar with the intelligence” as saying the US had provided “exquisite” intelligence and would help defend Israel as needed.Iravani told the UN security council that the US was complicit in the attack, saying “by aiding and enabling these crimes, they share full responsibility for the consequences”.He accused Israel of seeking “to kill diplomacy, to sabotage negotiations and to drag the region into wider conflict.”View image in fullscreenRescuers at the site of an Israeli strike in Tehran.Photograph: Iranian Red Crescent Society/ReutersThe US website Axios quoted two Israeli officials as suggesting the apparent disagreement with Israel had been a ploy, aimed at convincing Iran that no attack was imminent so the generals and scientists on the target list would not move to new locations. “We had a clear US green light,” one of the officials said.Israel’s first wave of airstrikes took place soon after 8am Iranian time. About 200 Israeli warplanes hit 100 wide-ranging targets.In a televised address recorded in English for the benefit of foreign audiences, Netanyahu declared: “We struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear enrichment programme. We struck at the heart of Iran’s nuclear weaponisation programme. We targeted Iran’s main enrichment facility in Natanz. We targeted Iran’s leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. We also struck at the heart of Iran’s ballistic missile programme.”Iranian state media said the head of the Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), Gen Hossein Salami, the army chief of staff, Maj Gen Mohammad Bagheri, and the commander of the Khatam al-Anbia joint forces headquarters, Maj Gen Gholam Ali Rashid, were killed in the strikes, as well as six nuclear scientists, including Fereydoun Abbasi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization from 2011 to 2013.Israel said its assault had killed most of the senior leadership of the IRGC’s air force.IDF officers said that operation, codename Rising Lion, had involved the infiltration of Mossad commandos before the strikes, as well as drones, to target air defences and Iran’s ballistic missiles.0:45Footage released by the Mossad claims to show Israeli agents in Iran – videoLater in the day, the Mossad released grainy footage that it said showed agents on Iranian soil. Another video showed what the agency said was an attack on an Iranian defence system, while a third appeared to show an Iranian long-range missile being targeted.Iranian civilians described a night of terrifying explosions. Golnar, a resident of Saadat Abad, in northern Tehran, said she woke to loud explosions just after 3am.“I woke up to the first explosion and rushed to the windows to check. Then, minutes later, back to back I heard four explosions. The windows were shaking and people in the building started screaming,” she said. “Everything happened so quickly. We were scrambling for information on whether this was an attack or a natural disaster. This morning there’s debris all over the explosion site and surrounding streets.”Ahmad Moadi, 62, said: “How much longer are we going to live in fear? As an Iranian, I believe there must be an overwhelming response, a scathing response.”Additional reporting by Deepa ParentExplore more on these topicsIranIsraelIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

For Tehran, this is not only a tactical loss but a profound strategic humiliation,” she added.The immediate question is how much damage was done at Natanz, where Iran has conducted most of its nuclear enrichment at a site thought to be 8 metres underground, largely protected by reinforced concrete and hard rock. Videos showed black plumes emerging from the area of the site, but damage is impossible to assess.MapIran said the Natanz site had been hit, but there were no casualties, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency, while the International Atomic Energy Agency said it was still assessing the damage. Meanwhile, Israel’s military spokesperson, Effie Defrin, said the bombing had struck the underground area and related critical infrastructure. “We inflicted significant damage on this site,” he added.At the same time, Israel’s external security service, the Mossad, claimed it had conducted a mixture of commando attacks, complete withgrainy thermal video, and strikes from prepositioned drones – in the style of Ukraine’s recent attack on Russian airbases – aimed at Iranian air defence systems, including at Esfejabad airbase.0:45Footage released by the Mossad claims to show Israeli agents in Iran – videoSome of the Mossad claims are likely to be propagandistic but the military reality is that so far there has been no sign of effective Iranian air defence or any reports of Israeli air force casualties. Israel appears to have a near total air superiority, allowing it to continue bombing into Friday with fresh attacks on Tabriz.Iran’s initial response, Israel said, was to launch more than 100 drones at its attacker, all of which were shot down by mid morning. The drones are slow-moving, taking up to seven hours to travel the 700 miles or so between the countries – and it would take a far larger wave before even a handful hit the ground.Tehran does have other military options, however. The most immediately dangerous is a store of up to 3,000 high-speed ballistic missiles, of which it used about 180 in its last attack on Israel in October 2024.Two dozen or sohit the Nevatim and Tel Nof airbases (where nuclear weapons are thought to be stored) in Israel and locations near the Mossad headquarters, but the damage done appears to have been relatively modest.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toGlobal DispatchFree newsletterGet a different world view with a roundup of the best news, features and pictures, curated by our global development teamEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Successfully destroying or disabling underground sites is notoriously difficult, however, and the true impact will emerge only if Iran launches a missile counterattack with whatever is left at its military’s disposal.Alternative possibilities may be cyber or terror attacks, though on a political level neither might feel like an equivalent retaliatory response, even if they are achievable – while strikes on American targets would be very risky for Tehran, bringing with it the possibility that the US, with all its firepower, would join the war.MapBut the option that is not on the table is to rely on traditional regional proxies. On Friday, Lebanon’s Hezbollah, its leadership eliminated during the two-month war with Israel last autumn, said it “will not initiate its own attack on Israel” in support of Iran. Yemen’s Houthis,attacked by Israel on Tuesday, are more than 1,000 miles distant and have only the ability to mount occasional ballistic missile attacks.The complication for Israel is that Iran has had a long time to prepare, and its nuclear facilities are well defended.Until Friday afternoon, Israel did not try to attack a second enrichment facility at Fordow, buried 80-90 metres underground, beyond the capabilities of its most powerful known missiles, the 1.8-tonne Rocks and 1.6-tonne Air Lora.Successfully attacking Natanz,according to an analysisfrom Rusi, “would likely require several impacts into the same crater to ‘burrow’ down to the facility and get a weapon through to explode within it successfully” – while the destruction of Fordow is considered feasible only with the US GBU 57/B “bunker buster” bomb, which, because it weighs nearly 14 tonnes and is 6 metres long,can be launched only from US B-2 bombers.Such hardened targets, combined with Israel’s air dominance and extraordinary confidence, point to an extended military campaign against Iran – two weeks long, according to some reports – as well as a tense and uncertain international period, which, absent an Iranian capitulation, may not have an obvious end point.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelIran's nuclear programmeMiddle East and north AfricaanalysisShareReuse this content"

A huge blast at around 4am had gutted two upper levels, showering debris into the street below.It soon became clear why this particular floor on this particular block had been selected by Israeli military planners. It was the home ofAli Shamkhani, one of the country’s most senior security officials and a close aide of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei.View image in fullscreenAli Shamkhani, pictured in 2018.Photograph: Atta Kenare/AFP/Getty ImagesInitial reports said Shamkhani, who is also a key negotiator in ongoing indirect talks with the US over Iran’s nuclear programme, was injured. But by mid-morning it was announced that the 69 year old had been killed.By then, it was clear thatIsrael’s attack was on a much greater scalethan anyone had previously envisaged. Dozens of other targets in and around Tehran had been hit by warplanes. Across the capital, buildings were burning, with gaping blackened holes where flats had existed hours before.Othertop officialshad been killed in this first wave of strikes, including Mohammad Bagheri, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces, and Maj Gen Hossein Salami, the head of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who died in an attack on the IRGC’s headquarters.Other casualties included officials in charge of Iran’s nuclear programme and its ballistic missile arsenal, including two well-known scientists. There were reports of further deaths and injuries, possibly among members of the dead men’s families, though no confirmed numbers.Golnar, a resident of Saadat Abad, northern Tehran, was asleep when blasts woke her just after 3am.“I woke up to the first explosion and rushed to the windows to check. Then minutes later I heard four explosions back to back … The windows were shaking and people in the building started screaming,” Golnar told the Guardian.“We knew from social media that tensions were heightened between Israel and the regime, but we were not told by the authorities that we must prepare. Everything happened so quickly. We were scrambling for information on whether this was an attack or a natural disaster,” she said.View image in fullscreenA damaged building in Tehran.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesA human rights activist living near Shahr Ara Street in Tehran described “total chaos in the residential areas”.“Traffic jams and clueless crowds are still trying to make sense of what’s happening,” they said. “Smoke is still billowing from residential streets and there’s debris around homes. The sky is red and we fear there will be more attacks,” they said.1:03Iranian TV shows aftermath of Israeli strikes on Tehran – videoElsewhere in Iran, people were also waking up to destruction.Drivers could see plumes of oily black smoke pouring from the major nuclear facility ofNatanz,200 miles (320km) south of Tehran. Residents of the north-western city of Tabriz ran for shelter as several targets were hit. Others cowered as missiles slammed into a suspected nuclear site in the central city of Arak and amid blasts at air defence missile bases in Kermanshah, close to the border with Iraq.There were strikes in Hamadan province, where a long-range radar facility appeared to have been badly damaged; and at Piranshahr, in West Azerbaijan Province, a launch site for ballistic missiles was hit.For many Iranians, often unaware they are living next to critical military or nuclear infrastructure, the attacks prompted great fear.Among those opposed to the regime, the attacks prompted excitement, even jubilation.An emergency unit doctor in Tehran said mid-morning that no civilian casualties had been brought into his hospital so far.“Some of us in the emergency units have to cancel any planned leaves, and hospitals have been put on high alert. My elderly father woke up to loud explosions in western Tehran. He called me with a trembling voice, and for the past six months we have lived in fear that tensions will escalate,” the doctor said.Israel has said the attacks were just the opening salvo of a much broader offensive, which could continues for days, or even weeks.“We are already dealing with a dire economic crisis,” the human rights activist said. “We are stocking up on food and supplies which are already expensive. Where do we even flee to if attacked again today? We don’t have bomb shelters like the Israelis do and we can’t flee to Iraq or Afghanistan. We are stuck.”Azadeh, a resident of Vanak, said everyday Iranians had not asked for this war.“Around 3.40am, the explosion sounds started getting louder and louder. It got very frightening. There were loud screams across the streets. The explosion was near the main square which is scary.“However, [after] the news that IRGC commanders were killed and not civilians, some of us are happy about it. The mullahs are responsible for any civilian deaths that may occur this time,” Azadeh said.Though images of the aftermath of strikes suggested there were at least some casualties among the families and neighbours of targeted individuals, the overall death toll was unclear. Iranian state media were reported to have given an unofficial total of at least 78 people killed and more than 300 injured in Tehran.Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said most of the damage from strikes targeting its Natanz facility was at ground level and there had been “no casualties” there.0:43Footage captures moment Iran's Natanz nuclear site is hit by Israel – videoSome analysts say the attacks will prompt people to rally behind the regime, but others argue that Iran’s inability to either protect its own senior officials and infrastructure or, so far, strike back effectively will damage its credibility among the wider population.None of the 100 armed drones reportedly launched by Iran at Israel on Friday reached their targets, Israeli officials said. Iran’s state news agency denied any such attempted attack.Journalists in Iran told the Guardian they had been instructed not to share any news, images and videos on social media by the authorities, and editors had been warned off reposting phone footage from witnesses to the strikes.“The only videos shared should be [emphasising] how devastating Israel’s attacks were on the innocent people,” said a reporter in Karaj, west of Tehran. “The problem with this is, there are no ground reports for now that civilians were killed or seriously injured. The [authorities] don’t want to look weak in front of radical supporters. Only the state media’s assigned reporters are allowed on the explosion sites.”Israel has said its attack was essentialbecause Iran was on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons capability. Iran has repeatedly denied such intentions, saying it wants nuclear energy only for civilian purposes, and has publicly rejected Washington’s demand to scrap enrichment, describing it as an attack on its national sovereignty.The Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said he hoped the attacks would trigger the downfall of Iran’s theocracy, and that his message to the Iranian people was that Israel’s fight was not with them, but with the “brutal dictatorship that has oppressed you for 46 years”.Khamenei said in a statement after the first strikes that Israel had “unleashed its wicked and bloody” hand in a crime against Iran and thatit would face “a bitter fate”.The human rights activist in Tehran said ordinary people would “bear the consequences of anything that happens in the next hours and days”.Explore more on these topicsIranIsraelMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

He also offered psychic readings and life coaching. Both were alumni of the College of Psychic Studies.The couple were returning home after a 10-day wellness retreat. The couple captured the happy time they had in India in a series of social media posts, including getting henna tattoos, shopping for fine fabrics and other gifts and driving through chaotic traffic in a tuk-tuk.They arrived in Ahmedabad just a day before flying back. Fiongal had posted in a video: “So, it’s our last night in India and we’ve had a magical experience. Some mind-blowing things have happened. We are going to put all this together and create a vlog. It’s my first ever vlog about the whole trip and we want to share it.”In the airport before takeoff, the pair filmed a video of themselves joking before the 10-hour flight back to London. Fiongal said the pair were “going back happily, happily, happily calm”.Adam and Hasina Taju and their son-in-law, Altafhusen PatelAdam Taju, 72, and his 70-year-old wife, Hasina, were flying with their son-in-law, Altafhusen Patel, 51, who lives in London with his wife.The couple’s granddaughter, Ammaarah Taju, spoke of her shock and disbelief at her parents’ home in Blackburn. She said her father, Altaf Taju, had driven to London to be with his sister as they received updates about the crash from Air India and government officials.Javed and Mariam Syed, and their two children, Zayn, five, and Amani, fourJaved Ali Syed, a hotel manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia hotel in London, and his wife, Mariam, were travelling with their children, Zayn, five, and Amani, four. Syed was an award-winning hotelier and had previously worked for the Comfort InnLondon. Mariam worked at Harrods.View image in fullscreenThe Syed family.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersHardik Avaiya and Vibhooti PatelFriends of the couple, who lived in the the Belgrave area of Leicester, told Leicestershire Live of their shock at losing two people they described as “lovely”.Margi, 30, a close friend, said: “It’s devastating. They were very good people. I can’t believe it’s happened.”Margi said she knew Avaiya, 27, and Patel, 28, through her husband, who had been travelling to Gatwick airport to collect the couple when he learned of the crash. She said: “My husband was on his way to pick them up yesterday from Gatwick but halfway he got the news.”Avaiya worked with Margi’s husband, where they had built a close friendship over several years, she said. “The couple were also active members of their local temple community, where they were known for their kindness and generosity,” she added. Avaiya also volunteered at the temple.Raxa Modha, her daughter-in-law, Yasha Kamdar, and her two-year-old grandson, RudraRaxa Modha, 55, from Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, and her two-year-old grandson, Rudra, were believed to have been flying back to England for a cremation and memorial service for Modha’s late husband.Modha had been in India for some time, fulfilling the dying wish of her husband, Kishor, who had wanted to live out his last days in his homeland. He died there in April. They were returning to the UK to organise a prayer meeting later this month at the Highfield community centre in Wellingborough.The couple, who ran an Indian food catering firm called Pooja Caterers, had three children and one grandchild. It thought that Kishan, Modha’s son, was taking another flight home.View image in fullscreenRaxa Modha.Photograph: Social mediaSpeaking to MailOnline, a family friend said: “It’s incredibly sad, the whole family is already grieving Kishor’s death.”Jaya Tailor, who lives in Wellingborough, said she knew Modha personally and that she was “a real people’s person”.“She helped her husband build a business,” she said. “She loved having people around her. She was kind, generous [and] loving.”Dhir and Heer BaxiThe sisters, in their 20s, were on their way back to London after having made a surprise trip to visit their grandmother for her birthday.Dhir was doing a degree in fashion design while Heer worked as a product manager in the investment and renewable energy sector.The Baxis’ elder brother, Ishan, told the Telegraph: “I can’t express what my complete family is going through – shell-shocked … is what I can say right now.“Both had a natural aura of helping and always cared about family values. They both had aspirations to be successful enough to roam around the world, tension-free. Along with their parents, they both had a proclivity towards modernisation without changing traditional values.“Both my sisters know what is right and what is wrong, thus whatever work they carried out, in academics or fashion, they always got success with no conflicts amongst peers or seniors.”Renjitha Gopakumaran NairRenjitha Gopakumaran Nair was returning to the UK after a holiday to see family in her home country. The nurse and mother had just left her job at Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, Hampshire, and is thought to have been in the UK for a year.Her former colleagues at the NHS hospital said she was a “beautiful lady” who showed her patients and co-workers “so much love and care”.Gopakumaran, said to be in her 40s, “had the biggest heart and brightest smile”, one former colleague said.Arjunbhai PatoliyaArjunbhai Patoliya, 37, had travelled to India from London to scatter the ashes of his late wife, Bharatiben Patel, in a river in the village that they both grew up in. She had died just three weeks earlier from cancer.The pair are survived by their two daughters,eight and four years old. The children had been left with Patel’s sister while their father flew to Vadiya in Gujarat. A close friend and neighbour of Patoliya told the Telegraph: “He is just like my son. He was a nice person, a very nice person. It’s an accident. I don’t know what to say, I’m speechless – such a lovely neighbour. He was such a lovely character, he looked after me as well from time to time.”Patoliya was a furniture designer and was described by the neighbour as being a “family” person who was very active in the community.Sayedmiya and Nafisabanu Inayatali, and their son, Waqueeali, 25, and daughter, Taskin, 22Sayedmiya Inayatali, 48, had flown over to India to visit his 90-year-old mother with his wife, Nafisabanu, 46, and their children.Shahid Vhora, 52, a relative, had texted the family before the flight to let them know he would pick them up at Gatwick when they arrived.He told Metro: “I can’t believe this has happened. I was preparing to pick them up. They had been visiting Sayedmiya’s mother.“They took a picture as they were about to board. They were so happy to be coming home … When I received the news of the crash I was devastated. We are a very close family, we all live together. My life has been torn apart.”Sayedmiya was an IT programmer who lived in Wembley with his family. Vhora described the family as “perfect” and very hardworking, adding that Taskin was studying to be a doctor and Waqueeali had been working in IT like his father.He said: “Sayedmiya and myself did everything together. We have had so many happy times. Now I have to go to India to try to sort things out.”Adnan MasterAdnan Master, 30, was visiting relatives in India with his wife and child. It is understood he was travelling back to London by himself; his family live in Forest Hill.A friend of Master told the Telegraph that he was “probably one of the nicest guys you’d ever meet”. They added that he had two jobs, both as a delivery driver and working in a DIY shop in east London.They said: “He was just one of the hardest-working people you’d ever meet. He just didn’t stop, and everything he did was for his family. Everything he spoke about was for his family: ‘I want to make my child have a good life.’”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsianewsShareReuse this content"

CCTV footage appears to show clouds of dust at take-off but no birds.Teams of anti-terror experts were part of the investigation process, they said.US and UK officials were joining the India-led inquiry.While cautioning against jumping to conclusions, aviation analysts have put forward a range of theories of possible causes for the tragedy – the first fatal crash involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.Dr Sonya Brown, a senior lecturer in aerospace design at the University of New South Wales, said the footage suggested the plane had stalled. “It does look to me like a significant loss of thrust. Aircraft lift is proportional to speed squared, so if you don’t have thrust and you lose speed – and radar data suggests after the initial short climb it was losing speed – you can stall,” Brown said.What caused the lack of thrust remained unclear, Brown said.According to some analysts’ interpretation, the video footage shows the plane’s wing flaps were not extended during takeoff. These panels on the wings of a plane can be extended to help generate lift and are key during takeoff and landing – the points in flight when most air accidents occur.However, Brown said that even if the flaps were not deployed, a stall could still be avoided with increased thrust – adding that incorrect thrust settings due to human error could be one cause. She also noted that while the plane was modern, it was 11 years old, so the potential for inadequate maintenance could be investigated.While pilot error is a potential avenue of any crash investigation, the Air India captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Clive Kundar were highly experienced; Sabharwal had clocked up more than 8,000 flying hours in 22 years as a commercial airline pilot.Questions about the plane itself are less immediate than in the aftermath of the Boeing 737 Max crashes of 2018 and 2019, which came soon after that model’s entry into service.Although India’s aviation regulator has directed Air India to carry out safety inspections on its 33 remaining 787 fleet, the model has been flown for more than a decade by the Indian carrier and airlines worldwide, with relatively few problems.Air India has also been ordered to carry out “additional maintenance actions” on the fleet, which is equipped with GE Aerospace engines – not the Rolls-Royce Trent 1,000 engines fitted to many 787s, which were grounded to address defects in recent years.Friday briefing: What ​we ​know ​so far about the Air India ​flight 171 ​crashRead moreNeil Hansford, a former pilot and chair of the Strategic Aviation Solutions consultancy, said other theories the investigators should examine were potential sabotage, noting political tensions in Gujarat state, of which Ahmedabad is the capital.Contaminated fuel was another possibility, he said. The plane’s fuel tank was reportedly near-full, but Hansford said contaminants could lead to clogging. “Blocking fuel could cause an engine problem,” he said.The 787 is a two-engine plane but is able to fly on one engine, one of many layers of redundancy – from backup power sources, computer monitoring systems such as autopilot and the ability for a plane to glide – baked into modern aviation that has made it, despite this latest tragedy, one of the statistically safest forms of transport.But, Brown said: “All of these things are more effective if you have time, but this happened so soon after takeoff. If you had the same issue at 40,000ft, it’s very different to 400ft. There’s just not many layers of redundancy at that altitude.”Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsiaPlane crashesAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

A British man, Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, was thesole survivor. At least five medical students were also killed and about 50 injured, and there are fears the number of people killed on the ground could rise.Chauhan had checked in online and was assigned the economy-class seat 36G. She arrived at the airport at 12.20pm local time, 10 minutes after boarding was scheduled to start.She told the BBC’s Gujarati service: “We got very angry with our driver and left the airport in frustration … I was very disappointed. We left the airport and stood at a place to drink tea and after a while, before leaving … we were talking to the travel agent about how to get a refund for the ticket. There, I got a call that the plane had gone down.”The student said it was a miracle that she had missed her flight, having been caught in traffic in Ahmedabad city centre after travelling from Ankleshwar, about 120 miles south of Ahmedabad.She said: “When I missed the flight, I was dejected. [The] only thing that I had in mind was: if I had started a little early, I would have boarded the plane. I requested airline staff to allow me inside as I am only 10 minutes [late]. I told them that I am the last passenger and so please allow me to board the plane, but they did not allow me.”Investigations are continuing into the cause of the crash, the first involving a Boeing 787 Dreamliner.The Foreign Office said any British nationals requiring consular assistance or who had concerns about family or friends should call 020 7008 5000.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaPlane crashesSouth and central AsiaBristolEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

It was not clear whether this opening was the door or a rupture in the fuselage.“The aircraft was pretty nose up when it hit the buildings,” said Cable, a former senior inspector of air accidents at the UK Air Accidents Investigations Branch. “It has presumably broken open in an area of the fuselage adjacent to this guy and fortuitously he has popped out without major injury.”Ramesh’s seat had space, rather than seats, immediately in front of it, which may have given him more room for escape than many of his fellow passengers. It may also have meant that while the passengers in front of him may have been crushed together on impact, he avoided that fate, Prof John McDermid, Lloyd’s Register chair of safety at the University of York, said.“My suspicion is that because of the nature of the impact, he was in a strong part of the airplane at the front edge of the wing,” he added. “There is not just the fuselage, but the extra structure of the wing to protect from the compression of the fuselage.”“It’s possible that the impact loosened the door and he could kick it out and get out,” McDermid said. “The external door was only just in front of him so he didn’t have far to go.”But before Ramesh could even consider an escape, he had to have the luck to survive the impact of the crash.“If you’ve got an accident like this, where you’ve got an aircraft full of fuel and it’s making a crash landing off the airport into the built environment, that’s unlikely to be a survivable accident,” said Prof Ed Galea, an expert in fire safety and evacuation at the University of Greenwich. “The fact that anyone has survived is miraculous.“He seems to have been lucky in that: a) he survived the trauma of the impact, b) he wasn’t severely injured in that crash, and c) he was sitting right by the No 2 exit. Whether he used that or exited via a rupture that was close by, is not clear. But he was very close to an exit point.”Galea has previously carried out research on plane crashes which found that, in less devastating crashes, people sitting within five rows of a serviceable exit have a greater chance of surviving than dying while those more than five rows away were more likely to perish. He said he always tries to reserve a seat within five rows of an emergency exit.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Passengers who did not adopt the brace position may have struck their heads on the seats in front of them knocking them unconscious, but there were no seats immediately in front of Ramesh.While the structure of the plane may have given him a chance at survival, Ramesh still needed to move fast to take that chance, said McDermid. “If he hadn’t got out in a very few seconds, he would have been unlikely to make it out because of the fireball,” he added.The plane had enough fuel on board to carry it to London Gatwick and this appeared to ignite upon impact.Galea said Ramesh may have found himself exiting in front of the fireball if the aviation fuel had been pouring from the ruptured tanks in a rearward direction.“He was a very, very unlucky man being on that airplane, but he was also a very, very lucky man being able to get out,” McDermid concluded.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaPlane crashesAir transportSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Kinal Mistry, 24, had laughed lovingly at her father as he made her promise that they would meet again soon. “Yes, Daddy, very soon,” she said.Instead, the photo – of Kinal smiling beside her mother and father – would commemorate the last time his family was a whole. In scenes of horror that have since reverberated around the world, just a few minutes after the flight took off from Ahmedabad airport on Thursday morning, it plummeted from the sky, exploding in an inferno of fire and black smoke. Only one of the 242 people onboard survived.Yet even as fragmented bodies and charred limbs continued to be uncovered by rescue teams from the site of the crash, Mistry could not bring himself to accept that Kinal – whom he described as a beautiful dancer “so full of life” – was among the dead. Like so many on board, her body had yet to be identified, let alone given back to the family.‘It’s devastating’ tributes paid to British victims of Air India plane crashRead moreMistry, sitting in the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad, still in the same clothes he wore when he took his daughter to the airport, was among hundreds of families desperately waiting for answers and clinging to diminishing hope.“What can I say about Kinal? She was a wonder,” said Mistry, as he began to cry. “She lit up every room with her smile, she could strike up a friendship with anyone. She was beautiful, inside and out. That’s just who she was.”Her life was only just beginning, he said. She had just got married and moved to London last year where she worked as a choreographer and had also set up a food business out of her own kitchen, as “she loved nothing more than feeding people”.He said: “In just one day, our whole world has fallen apart. I don’t know if it makes me foolish, but I’m still hoping. Hoping for a miracle. Please, just one miracle.”View image in fullscreenStaff escort ambulances transferring bodies of victims of the Air India passenger plane crash to the Civil hospital in Ahmedabad.Photograph: Rajat Gupta/EPAThe true scale of the tragedy was still unfolding on Friday, as images and accounts of those who were onboard AirIndiaflight 171 began to trickle out and the true death toll – officially about 265 – still remained unclear. The government Civil hospital in Ahmedabad appeared overwhelmed with the scale of bodies in the morgue and the task of identifying them, with only about six returned to families by Friday. Amid the suffocating summer heat, the stench of bodies hung heavy in the air.More than 200 relatives flocked to a makeshift centre in the hospital medical college to give DNA samples to help identify the bodies, many of which were brought to the hospital morgue mangled beyond recognition. Officials said some had been reduced almost to ash.View image in fullscreenVijay Rupani, the former chief minister of Gujarat, was among the victims of the Air India plane crash.Photograph: Mint/Hindustan Times/GettyWhat was clear was that the disaster had wrought untold devastation on hundreds of families across India and the UK. Prateek Joshi, a radiologist who worked at a hospital in Derby, had boarded the flight with his wife, Komi Vyas, also a doctor, and their three children, ready for the whole family to start their new life together in the UK.In their excitement, they all crammed into one final photo together before takeoff; mother and father beaming in the foreground, their five-year-old twin sons Nakul and Pradyut and eight-year-old daughter Miraya smiling from the seats in the next aisle. Not long after, the whole family was dead.For another passenger, Sahil Salim Ibrahim Patel, from a small village in Gujarat, this was his first ever international flight, en route to London for a dream scholarship that he believed would change his family’s life forever. Meanwhile, Prakash Lal Minarhia, who had been working as a chef in London for 15 years, had come back to India to perform the rituals for the recent death of his father.View image in fullscreenWreckage of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner lies at the site where it crashed in Ahmedabad, India.Photograph: Amit Dave/ReutersMinarhia’s relatives said they still had not been able to bring themselves to inform his mother and wife, who remained in their village, about the crash. “Until we have his body, nothing is certain,” said Uday Lal Minarhia, 48, a farmer.Rescuers and forensic teams continued to scour the wreckage on Friday amid scorching temperatures. Naresh Soni, an officer from the National Forensic Sciences University, said the teams were “not only racing against time, but also intense heat. With each passing hour in these extreme temperatures, the risk of biological sample degradation and contamination rises sharply – possibly making the identification of bodies difficult and potentially unreliable.”As it crashed to the ground, the plane collided with a residential hostel housing hundreds of medical students who were studying at the nearby medical college. Many were eating lunch when the 227-tonne plane smashed down, obliterating the canteen wall and killing at least five students, with at least 50 more injured.Yet many who had been in the vicinity of the hostel – which stood blackened and ominously empty on Friday – still remained missing, yet to be counted among the official dead. As Anita Ben Thakur arrived at the crash site, which was cordoned off by police, she demanded to be let through the barricades. “Let me through, let me through, my mother is inside,” she pleaded with police, before breaking down in tears.Her mother, Sarla Ben, had been the cook in the hostel canteen for the past 15 years and had been serving food to the student doctors at Thursday lunchtime. She had also brought her two-year-old granddaughter to work with her. Neither have been seen since.“Since yesterday, I’ve been trying to find my mother, but I’ve failed miserably,” she said. “I’ve been running around the entire night, and waiting outside the hospital patiently, hoping for some news – but nothing. And now, they’re not even allowing us near the debris to look for her ourselves.”View image in fullscreenAakash Patni, 15, who was killed when he was working at his mother’s tea stall outside the student’s hostel when the plane crashed. His mother, Sita Devi, survived but with burns over half of her body.Sitting on the pavement outside the hospital morgue, Suresh Bhai Patni, 39, a rickshaw driver, put his head in his hands. On Thursday afternoon, as he did most days, his 15-year-old son Akash Patni had gone to deliver lunch to his mother at the tea stall she ran, situated outside the student hostel. The family would meet at the stall every evening.At the moment his mother, Sita Devi, sat down to eat, and Akash was watching over the tea, the plane hit the hostel and immediately engulfed the stall in flames. Devi ran towards the stall in an attempt to save her son, and was caught up in the fire, but to no avail. Akash’s charred corpse was later recovered by the authorities.Devi survived but is seriously ill with burns over more than half of her body. “She keeps asking me about Akash, but I just tell her he is also being treated,” said Patni. “How do I tell her the truth? I’m afraid she’ll lose the will to survive. And I can’t afford to lose her too. Not now. Not after this.”Yet among the grief, many clung to what they saw as a single miracle to emerge from the tragedy; the sole survivor, 38-year-old British-Indian Vishwash Kumar Ramesh. Still confined to a hospital bed, he had only bruises and scratches to show for the incident.Speaking to the Indian state broadcaster, the only outlet allowed into the hospital ward on Friday, Ramesh still remained hazy about how he had survived, but it appeared he had jumped out of the emergency exit door. “I still can’t believe how I got out alive,” he said.Explore more on these topicsAir India Ahmedabad plane crashIndiaSouth and central AsiaPlane crashesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She died in January of suspected lung cancer.Photograph: Family handout/PANHSSenior health figure accuses NHS of racism over care given to dying motherVictor Adebowale says failure to detect his mother’s cancer was example of ‘black service, not NHS service’Denis CampbellHealth policy editorFri 13 Jun 2025 19.01 EDTShareA senior figure in the health service has criticised it for deep-seated racism after his mother “got a black service, not anNHSservice” before she died.Victor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, claimed his mother Grace’s lung cancer went undiagnosed because black people get “disproportionately poor” health service care.The NHS’s failure to detect her cancer while she was alive shows that patients experience “two different services”, based on the colour of their skin, Adebowale said.His mother, Grace Amoke Owuren Adebowale, a former NHS nurse, died in January aged 92. He highlighted her care and death during his speech this week at the NHS Confederation’s annual conference as an example of “persistent racial inequalities in NHS services”.His remarks prompted fresh concern about the stark differences between the care received by those from black and other ethnic minority backgrounds and white people.“My mum, who worked for many years as a nurse, died earlier this year at the age of 92. It was difficult. It was not the dignified death that we would have wanted for her,” Adebowale told an audience of NHS bosses.“It wasn’t the death she deserved. So it makes me clear about the need to address the inequity. I think she got a black service, not an NHS service.”View image in fullscreenVictor Adebowale, the chair of the NHS Confederation, said black people get ‘disproportionately poor’ health service care at the body’s annual conference.Photograph: NHS ConfedExpo/PAHe castigated the NHS for not having done enough to improve care for black patients, despitemounting evidence of their much higher risk of poorer outcomes, including dying.Referencing “the experiences that people who look like me continue to receive”, he added: “It just hasn’t got any better. It is not acceptable that someone who looks like me on average waits 20 minutes longer in A&E than white patients.”Speaking to journalists afterwards, Adebowale said: “Why did I do it [refer to his mother’s ‘black service’]? Because I’m sick of it not changing, like everybody else. My mum, I think, God bless her, I think she would have wanted me to say it.“[I am sick of] the disproportionately poor services that too many poor people and too many black people experience–that’s what I’m sick of.“You only have to look at the stats. You just see the stats across all the major disease categories we talk about. Black people have a worse experience and worse outcomes. We’ve known that for years. I’m not saying anything new. My mother is an episodic example of a systemic problem.”Adebowale spent six years as a non-executive director on the board of NHSEnglandand is a former chief executive of the addiction and mental health charity Turning Point.He and his family are still trying to find out why their mother’s cancer was only identified by an autopsy after she died after arriving “in a poor condition” at A&E at a hospital in England he did not name. Not knowing at the time why she had died made her death even harder for the family, he said. His mother – who came to work in the NHS from Nigeria – never smoked, he added.“We’ve only recently found out [about the lung cancer]. It made me angry, because how can you live for that long with something that a lot of people [did not spot]?“She died of lung cancer and by definition [a diagnosis being made] anytime earlier than when she died would have been good. She clearly wasn’t picked up by any screening as far as I know. Her medical records I’ve seen show that nothing indicated that she had cancer anywhere. That was poor care, wasn’t it?”Research has found that:Black British mothers are up to four times more likely to die during pregnancy or within six weeks of giving birth than white mothers.Those of black and African or Caribbean origin are twice as likely to have a stroke, and younger, than white counterparts.Black African patients are two and a half times more likely to be detained under the MentalHealthAct than white British patients.Kate Seymour, Macmillan Cancer Support’s head of external affairs, said: “Stories like Grace Amoke Owuren Adebowale’s highlight the heartbreaking reality for some when it comes to accessing cancer care in this country. Research shows that people from ethnically diverse backgrounds in England wait longer on average to be diagnosed for several types of cancer.“It is categorically unacceptable that some people with cancer are having worse experiences simply because of who they are or where they live.”Prof Habib Naqvi, the chief executive of the NHSRaceand Health Observatory, said Adebowale’s remarks about his mother’s death should lead to change.“Sadly, black communities and families continue to experience many shortfalls in care, treatment and outcomes. They often face additional trauma at multiple stages of the life course,” he said.“We thank Victor for the candour in sharing his personal testimony and expect these insights to lead to learning and action from healthcare providers to improve the quality of patient care.”NHS England has been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthRaceEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He added: “It will take a little while for the news to sink in but I’m immensely proud and it’s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family.”He had been on the verge of receiving a knighthood in 2014 but HM Revenue and Customs placed a red flag on his nomination due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme, according to previous reports. In 2021 it was reported that his finances had been cleared and he was now eligible.Daltrey, 81, who launched the Teenage Cancer Trust’s Royal Albert Hall concerts, said he felt “very humbled” to be made a knight for services to charity and music and would be celebrating with “a bottle of plonk”. He said: “It’s a dream come true for me, but it’s especially a dream because the charity means so much.”Oldman, 67, who won an Oscar for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in Darkest Hour, is recognised for services to drama.Barker, 82, said the bedrock of the awards were those who devoted long hours for free to what they believed in for the benefit of others, “and knights and dames are just cherries on the top of that cake. I am happy to be a cherry.”Gormley becomes a Companion of Honour alongside the astrophysicist Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, 81.

The former Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott is awarded a CBE for services to economics journalism.The OlympianAlistair Brownleereceives an OBE for services to triathlon and charity. Other OBEs include the former EastEnders actor Anita Dobson for charitable fundraising, the Bafta award-winning actor Samantha Morton, the television executive Stephen Lambert and the cricketer Devon Malcolm, for services to cricket and diversity in cricket.The top two English darts players, Luke Littler and Luke Humphries, each score an MBE. So doClaudia Winklemanand her Strictly colleague Tess Daly. Winkleman said: “I am ridiculously lucky and will celebrate with Tess by doing a pasodoble.” Daly said: “I didn’t see it coming, and it almost didn’t happen, because the letter went to the wrong address.” Luckily, she said, “it ended well”.Georgia Harrison, 30, who has starred in The Only Way is Essex and Love Island, receives an MBE for hercampaigning on violence against women and girlsafter becoming a victim of “revenge porn”. She said: “It means the world to have this kind of recognition, not just for me but for all the survivors who’ve been through what I have.”Tracy-Ann Oberman, who has also been in EastEnders and played Auntie Val in the Channel 4 sitcom Friday Night Dinner, has been made an MBE for services to Holocaust education and combating antisemitism.View image in fullscreenCaroline, Duncan and Jenna Speirs of Calum’s Cabin.Photograph: James Manning/PAFor the first time, three family members have been named in the same honours list. Jenna Speirs and her parents, Caroline and Duncan Speirs, from the Isle of Bute, each receive a British Empire Medal (BEM) for their charity Calum’s Cabin, started after Jenna’s twin brother Calum died of a brain tumour aged 12. The charity helps thousands of people each year, providing holiday homes and Glasgow flats for families of children facing cancer to spend time together during treatment.Anti-knife crime campaigners recognised include Pooja Kanda, who said she felt “overwhelmed” after being made an OBE forpressing for changes in the lawafter her 16-year-old son Ronan was murdered with a ninja sword near his Wolverhampton home in 2022. Alison Madgin, 60, and her daughter Carly Barrett, 34, are made MBEs for setting up Samantha’s Legacy after their daughter and sister Samantha, 18, was stabbed to death in Wallsend in 2007. Barrett said the award was bittersweet: “We’ve had to lose Samantha to get these honours.”The king has personally recognised the queen’s GP, Dr Nicholas Hugh, who has the title apothecary to the queen, and Ranan Dasgupta, the sergeant-surgeon to the royal medical household, making both lieutenants of the Royal Victorian Order, honours that are in the gift of the sovereign and bestowed independently of Downing Street to people who have served the royal family.Dasgupta, a consultant urologist at King Edward VII’s hospital in London, specialises in a number of areas including treating prostate disease and kidney stones, and was working in the role of sergeant-surgeon when in January 2024 Charles underwent a procedure on an enlarged prostate, during which time his cancer – not affecting his prostate – was discovered.The oldest person on the list is 106-year-old William Irwin, a veteran and founder of Coleraine Winemakers Club, who receives a BEM. Carmela Chillery-Watson, 11, who has LMNA congenital muscular dystrophy, becomes the youngest ever MBE, for her fundraising for Muscular Dystrophy UK.Of the 1,215 people receiving an award, 48% are women and 11% are from minority ethnic backgrounds.Explore more on these topicsKing's birthday honours listGary OldmanRoger DaltreyDavid BeckhamAntony GormleyPat BarkerPenny MordauntnewsShareReuse this content"

The storms could lead to road flooding, difficult driving conditions, power cuts and flooding of homes and businesses.Katharine Smith, the flood duty manager at the Environment Agency, said: “Environment Agency teams have ensured rivers and watercourses are clear ahead of the storms and stand ready to support local authorities in their response to surface water flooding.“We urge people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm of flowing water is enough to move your car.”Yellow thunderstorm warnings are in place for much of southern and south-western England and Wales between Friday afternoon and midnight. Another warning is in place across eastern and southernScotlandfrom midnight to 6pm on Saturday, with northern and south-western England and Wales also affected.Explore more on these topicsUK weatherEnglandWalesScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

Rupa Huq, the Labour MP for Ealing Central, said the cost of living crisis would make assisted dying “quite attractive” to people who were struggling.“We know that BAME communities have lower disposable household income than standard households, and you can just imagine relatives in a housing crisis wanting to speed up grandad’s probate to get a foot on the ladder; or granny or nanny, ma or daddy even convincing themselves that, ‘look, they’d be better off out of the way given the cost of care’,” Huq said.Caroline Voaden, the Liberal Democrat MP for South Devon, recalled the death of her husband, who she said had been “in extreme pain” with terminal oesophageal cancer, and urged her colleagues to “mind our language” after words like “murder” were used.“This is about helping people die in a civilised way and helping their families not go through a horrendous experience of watching a loved one die in agony,” Voaden said.MPs voted in favourof a proposal by Kim Leadbeater, who is sponsoring the bill, to ban advertisements about assisted dying. But they rejected a separate proposal from the Labour MP Paul Waugh for tighter regulations which would have limited any exceptions to this ban. Waugh said he hoped “enough MPs now realise that it is not fit for purpose”.The bill passed its first stage by a majority of 55 in November. Since then more than a dozen MPs arethought to have switched sidesto oppose the bill, though at least three have moved to support it.A number of other amendments were passed on Friday, including a provision for assisted deaths to not automatically be referred to a coroner and an attempt to regulate substances for use in assisted dying.

They split the following year and while they reunited to tour on a couple of occasions, More is their first album since.The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis gave ita four-star review, writing: “A reformed band’s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn’t the case with More.”The band arenow on tour, playing two nights at London’s O2 Arena this weekend before dates in Birmingham and Manchester.Thanks to healthy physical sales, Pulp beat the US pop star Addison Rae to the No 1 spot. She is at No 2 with her debut album Addison – another critically acclaimed release, with theGuardian’s Shaad D’Souza sayingits “casually incisive tone suggests Rae might be a great popflâneusein the vein of Madonna or Janet Jackson”. Lotus, the sixth album from British rapperLittle Simz, is at No 3, a career high for the 31-year-old.Pulp: More review – anthems and rage for the next life stageRead moreAt No 4,Sabrina Carpenter’s album Short n’ Sweet makes her the female artist with the longest running spell in the UK Top 5 – it hasn’t dropped out since its release in August last year. The previous record holder was Shania Twain, whose Come on Over had a 41-week run between 1999 and 2000.Carpenter caused an online stir this week with the announcement of her new album Man’s Best Friend, thanks to a cover image depicting Carpenter on her knees with a man holding her by the hair, which some viewers found degrading.The lead single from it,Manchild, went straight to No 1 in the singles chart. It dethrones Alex Warren’s Ordinary, whose 12-week run at the top was a record for an American artist.Explore more on these topicsPulpUK chartsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockIndienewsShareReuse this content"

This followed Donald Trump’s extraordinary decision to deploy national guard troops to LA last weekend, over the objections of the governor of California, Gavin Newsom. The marines were to take over protecting a federal building, US Army Maj Gen Scott Sherman, who commands the taskforce of marines and national guardsmen, said.The streets had been mostly calm overnight going into Friday morning, marking the seventh day of protests across various areas and the third day of an overnight curfew in a small part of the huge downtown area.The civilian who was detained spoke to reporters after he was released, identifying himself as Marcos Leao, 27, an army veteran who was on his way to the Department of Veterans Affairs when he crossed a taped-off area and was asked to stop.Leao, who gained his US citizenship through military service, said he was treated “very fairly”.“They’re just doing their job,” said Leao, who is of Angolan and Portuguese descent.Sporadic demonstrations have also taken place in cities including New York, Chicago, Seattle and Austin on several days in the last week against Trump’s pushing of his mass deportation agenda, undertaken by targeting undocumented communities in the US interior.And millions more are expected to turn out to protest on Saturday at roughly 2,000 sites nationwide in ademonstration dubbed “No Kings”against what critics see as Trump taking actions on the brink of authoritarianism.The mass protests are timed to coincide with the US president’s controversial military parade in Washington DC to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the formation of the US army, and coincidentally his 79th birthday.The protests inLos Angelesand subsequent deployment of California’s national guard by Trump, over the furious objections of Newsom, is a move that had not happened in the US in at least half a century, sparking a legal battle between the president and Newsom.Late on Thursday, a federal judge ruled that the federal deployment of troops by the president to aid in civilian US law enforcement in LA should be blocked. The administration swiftly appealed and a higher court paused the restraining order until Tuesday, when it will hear the case.Judge Charles Breyer’s ruling in Newsom v Trump stated that Trump had unlawfully bypassed congressionally mandated procedures.Newsom in an interview with the New York Times podcast on Thursdaycalled Trump a “stone cold liar”for claiming he had discussed a federal deployment with the governor by telephone.Democrats and advocacy groups view Trump’s deployment as an abuse of power aimed at suppressing free speech and supporting aggressive anti-immigration policies.Trump’s use of the troops follows earlier, unfulfilled threats during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests in his first administration, when he considered, but ultimately declined, to deploy federal troops and has sinceexpressed regretabout not cracking down more forcefully.The president has defended his decision to send troops to LA claiming without any evidence that the city would have been “obliterated” and “burned to the ground” had he not initiated the deployment.In Washington, Saturday’s parade is billed as a patriotic celebration, while critics argue it is more about Trump’s personal brand and ego than promoting national unity. Organizers of No Kings protests have avoided planning a demonstration in the nation’s capital, in an attempt to draw attention away from tanks, armored vehicles, troops and aircraft on display.“The flag doesn’t belong to President Trump. It belongs to us,” read a statement from the No Kings protest movement.The parade will culminate on Saturday evening with a procession of 6,600 soldiers, dozens of tanks, and a live broadcast message from an astronaut in space. Inspired by a Bastille Day parade Trump witnessed in France in 2017, but with strong echoes of the kind of regular displays under authoritarian regimes such as Russia, North Korea and China, the event is expected to cost up to $45m, sources toldNBC News.Meanwhile, some members of the national guard troops deployed to Los Angeles and some of their family members have expresseddiscomfort with their mission, feeling it drags them into a politically charged domestic power struggle.“The sentiment across the board right now is that deploying military force against our own communities isn’t the kind of national security we signed up for,” said Sarah Streyder of the Secure Families Initiative, which advocates for military families. “Families are scared not just for their loved ones’ safety, although that’s a big concern, but also for what their service is being used to justify.”Chris Purdy of the Chamberlain Network echoed those concerns: “Morale is not great, is the quote I keep hearing,” he said, citing multiple national guard members who contacted his organization.Amid the ongoing legal and political fallout, arrests have continued, although sporadic incidents of early looting have subsided. Jose Manuel Mojica, a 30-year-old father of four, wascharged with assaulting a federal officerduring a protest in Paramount, a community in southern Los Angeles County.And on Thursday, Alex Padilla, a Democratic US senator for California and vocal critic of theTrump administration’s immigration polices, was forcibly removed and handcuffed as he attempted to ask a question at a press conference held byKristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, inLos Angeles.Invideo takenof the incident that has since gone viral on social media, Padilla is seen being restrained and removed from the room by Secret Service and FBI agents. He warned that if this was how he was dealt with it spoke ill for ordinary civilians being summarily arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).Most Republican national lawmakers criticized Padilla, although some Republican senators condemned his treatment, while Democrats overwhelmingly applauded his challenge to the administration and were appalled at his removal.Andrew Gumbel in Los Angeles contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsLos AngelesUS politicsProtestDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

That led to Terrell being put under an “‘unprecedented gag order” by the dean of the university’s law school, she said in aprepared statementissued by a group calling itself the Louisiana Alliance to Defend Democracy.Terrell resigned on Wednesday from the New Orleans-based university, saying she would rather leave her position than have her work used as a pretext “to dismantle” the law clinic.“After being affiliated with Tulane for 25 years and leading groundbreaking research at [the law clinic] for seven years, I cannot remain silent as this university sacrifices academic integrity for political appeasement and pet projects,” Terrell wrote in a letter to her colleagues.On Thursday, a university spokesperson said Tulane was “fully committed to academic freedom” and “the strong pedagogical value of law clinics”. Tulane declined to comment on Terrell’s resignation, calling it a personnel matter.A spokesperson for Louisiana’s governor, Jeff Landry, said in an email that Landry never threatened to withhold state funding for the project. “However,” the spokesperson said, “I applaud Tulane for their actions standing up for ourLouisianabusinesses and jobs.”‘It is going to be terrible’: a senior in Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’ prepares for Trump’s dismantling of hard-won environmental progressRead moreTerrell’s resignation drew outrage from grassroots environmental advocates in the state who credited her with providing data and scientific research substantiating the harm from the petrochemical industry suffered by the predominantly Black communities in south-east Louisiana.“We are frustrated that a person who is just doing their job, and doing it well shouldn’t be punished for it, she would be uplifted,” said Jo Banner, who co-founded a non-profit focused on community activism and cultural preservation in St John the Baptist parish, Louisiana.Her twin sister and co-founder, Joy Banner, added: “This is an attack on her freedom of speech.”A25 April emailprovided to Floodlight from the Tulane Law School dean, Marcilynn Burke, states that “effective immediately all external communications” from the law clinic that were not “client based” would have to be approved by her. That communication included “press releases, interviews, videos, social media postings, etc”.Inanother email, dated 4 May, Burke noted that the job disparity research was impeding the university from gaining political and financial support for its$600m downtown redevelopment project in New Orleans. The email said Tulane University’s president, Michael Fitts, was facing criticism from elected officials and potential donors of the public-private project unless the university’s leadership curtailed the work of its environmental law clinic.“At present, the president is focused upon the role of the staff scientist,” Burke wrote. “He understands her role in supporting the clinic’s representation of the clients. Thus, I need an explanation of how the study about racial disparities relates directly to client representation.”The email goes on to say, “He is concerned, however, that her work may go beyond supporting the clinic’s legal representation and veer into lobbying.”Floodlight reported on the research Terrell led for the university in April 2024 while it was still undergoing peer review. Preliminary data showed that minorities were being “systematically” underrepresented in the US petrochemical workforce – despite promises that nearby communities would benefit from better job opportunities.Terrell said the pollution v jobs narrative was oversimplified because the tradeoff affected different groups unevenly, with petrochemical jobs mostly going to white workers who don’t live in the predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods that suffer most of the health impacts of that industry. That research and Floodlight’s reporting was recently featured in adocumentaryproduced by The Years Project.Nationally, Terrell’s research found that higher-paying jobs in the chemical manufacturing industry disproportionately went to more white people in Texas, Louisiana and Georgia – where minorities represent 59%, 41% and 49% of their respective states’ populations but held 38%, 21% and 28% of the better-paid jobs within the industry.In the petroleum/coal industry, people of color were underrepresented in higher-paying jobs in at least 14 states – including Texas, California, Louisiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Illinois, the research found.Terrell, in her letter to colleagues, said the gag order came after the research had been peer-reviewed and published online on 9 April inEcological Economics.Terrell said the research on job disparities had already been cited in legal arguments for student attorneys in the law clinic on behalf of clients from industrialized communities. And she said her 2022studyhighlighting the health impacts in Cancer Alley ranked in the top 1% for research impact, garnering 28 citations and 87 news mentions to date, according to Almetric, which tracks the reach of research.“Such impact would be celebrated by most institutions,” Terrell wrote. “Scholarly publications, not gag orders, are the currency of academia. There is always room for informed debate. But Tulane leaders have chosen to abandon the principles of knowledge, education, and the greater good in pursuit of their own narrow agenda.”The Banner sisters are concerned Terrell’s departure and the university’s focus on restricting the work of the law clinic will probably make collaborations harder.“They’re following their responsibility, they’re following the mission of the organization, and answering our call for help, and then now they’re getting slammed for it,” Joy Banner said. “No one has questioned her findings. No one has questioned her assumptions. The only thing that they have said is: the truth is creating problems for us.”Floodlightis a non-profit newsroom that investigates the powers stalling climate actionExplore more on these topicsLouisianaFloodlightUS universitiesnewsShareReuse this content"

Her decision to put the museum first is to be applauded and appreciated. I know this was not an easy decision. She put the needs of the Institution above her own, and for that we thank her,” Lonnie Bunch, the Smithsonian secretary, wrote in a Friday internal email that was obtained by multiple outlets.“We are grateful to Kim for leading the National Portrait Gallery with passion and creativity for 12 years. Throughout her tenure, she has reimagined and reshaped the impact and storytelling of portraiture.”The Dutchwoman guiding the gallery of America’s most famous facesRead moreThe announcement comes after the Smithsonian Institution earlier this weekrebuffed Trump’s attempt to fire Sajet,with the museum’s governing board asserting its independence and turning away the president’s claim of authority over the institution’s staffing.Trump announced on 30 May that he had fired Sajet, calling her a “highly partisan person, and a strong supporter of DEI, which is totally inappropriate for her position”.His attack focused, among other reasons, on her Democratic political donations and her rejection of a pro-Trump painting by artist Julian Raven. Sajet reportedly told Raven his artwork was “too pro-Trump” and “too political” for the gallery, the artist toldthe Washingtonianin 2019.In a statement on Monday, the Smithsonian’s board of regents declared that “all personnel decisions are made by and subject to the direction of the secretary, with oversight by the board”. The statement did not name Sajet or mention theTrump administrationdirectly.Following Trump’s announcement, Sajet continued reporting to work throughout early June, creating a direct confrontation between the White House and the Smithsonian Institution – the country’s flagship cultural institution that has a 178-year-old governance structure built against political interference.Appointed in 2013, Sajet became the National Portrait Gallery’s first female director. Kevin Gover, undersecretary for museums and culture, has replaced her as acting director of the museum.In a statement shared by the internal memo on Friday, Sajet said it had been “the honor of a lifetime to lead the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery”.“This was not an easy decision, but I believe it is the right one,” she wrote. “From the very beginning, my guiding principle has been to put the museum first. Today, I believe that stepping aside is the best way to serve the institution I hold so deeply in my heart.“The role of a museum director has never been about one individual – it is a shared mission, driven by the passion, creativity, and dedication of an extraordinary team.”A statement from a White House spokesperson, David Ingle, reads: “On day one,President Trumpmade clear that there is no place for dangerous anti-American ideology in our government and institutions.“In align with this objective, he ordered the termination of Kim Sajet. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring American greatness and celebrating our nation’s proud history.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpDEI policiesUS politicsArtnewsShareReuse this content"

Brent crude surged by more than 7% after news of the attacks broke, briefly moving above $75 (£55) a barrel to its highest level since April.Stocks fell on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones dropping 1.8%, the S&P 500 falling 1.1% and the Nasdaq down 1.3%. Airline stocks, including Delta, United and American declined on fears that fuel costs could climb if there were issues with oil supply.News of the strikes affected the aviation industry as airlines cleared the airspace over the region, while investors turned to safe investment assets such as gold.The British Airways owner, IAG, was the top faller on London’sFTSE100, closing 3.7% down, and shares in the airline easyJet ended the day 2.7% lower.One of the top risers on the UK blue-chip index was the weapons producer BAE Systems, up almost 3%, reflecting concerns that the Israel-Iran conflict could escalate. In the US, the share prices of military suppliers including Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and RTX all rose. The oil companies BP and Shell also gained value, with the former closing nearly 2% up and the latter closing just over 1% higher.The price of gold was trading about 1% higher on Friday afternoon at $3,426 an ounce, close to the record high of $3,500 it hit in April.“The geopolitical escalation adds another layer of uncertainty to already fragile sentiment,” said Charu Chanana, the chief investment strategist at Saxo. Stocks dived in Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei down 1.3%, South Korea’s Kospi falling 1.1% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipping 0.8%.In Europe, major markets across Germany, France, Italy and Spain all closed at least 1% down. In London, the FTSE 100 ended the day down 34 points at 8,850, 0.4% belowThursday’s record closing high.Israel, which said its attack was a “pre-emptive strike” over Iran’s nuclear programme, has declared a state of emergency as its military said Tehranhad launched 100 drones in retaliation.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, called Israel’s strikes againstIrana “unilateral action” and said Washington was not involved.The move to perceived safe haven assets has resulted in the yield on 10-year US Treasury notes falling to a one-month low of 4.31%.Derren Nathan, the head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It’s not just the outlook for Iranian exports that’s a concern but also the potential for disruption to shipping in the Persian Gulf’s strait of Hormuz, a key route for about 20% of global oil flows and an even higher proportion of liquified natural gas haulage.”Much of the world’s oil, as well as key commodities such as grain, passes through busy sea lanes in the Middle East, including the strait of Hormuz.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Greek shipping association has urged shipowners to provide details of vessels sailing through the strait.“Any closure of the strait of Hormuz would see services rerouted, with increased reliance on Indian west coast ports for connecting the far east to the Indian subcontinent,” said Peter Sand of the shipping analytics company Xeneta. “The inevitable disruption and port congestion, as well as the potential for higher oil prices, would cause a spike in ocean freight container shipping rates.”A large-scale return of container ships to the Red Sea now “seems less likely”, according to Sand.Attacks on vessels by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen18 months ago led to many ships being diverted around the Cape of Good Hope, a rocky headland on the Atlantic coast of the Cape peninsula in South Africa, adding thousands of miles to journeys and pushing up shipping rates.Energean, a UK gas producer, said on Friday it had temporarily suspended the production and activities of its facility off the coast of northern Israel.Energean told investors it had received a notice from Israel’s ministry of energy and infrastructure ordering the suspension “following the recent geopolitical escalation in the region”.Explore more on these topicsStock marketsOilGoldEuropeMiddle East and north AfricaCommoditiesIsraelnewsShareReuse this content"

Footage appeared to show the 787’s landing gear apparently unretracted and, according to some accounts, the wing flaps in an unusual position for takeoff.Map of airportIndia’s aviation regulator has directed AirIndiato carry out additional maintenance and safety inspections on its 33-strong remaining Boeing 787 fleet, but not grounded the model.Boeing said it would defer to India’s AAIB in line with the international aviation protocol known as annex 13, which also requires officials from the US to join the investigation due to it being the country of manufacture, and UK investigators due to the number of Britons onboard.Boeing will be joined by a team from GE Aerospace, which supplied the engines powering flight AI171. GE said it had cancelled a planned investor day next week, coinciding with the Paris show, and would send experts to India to help analyse the data from the 787.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They are scapegoating Airbnb.”Protests by residentshave broken out in destinations including Barcelona, Palma de Mallorca,Venice, Amsterdam and the Greek island of Santorini.Authorities have taken action targeting the booming short-term lettings sector – led by services such as Airbnb, Vrbo andBooking.com– in an attempt to alleviate a problem exacerbated by the post-pandemic boom in travel.Alexander Panczuk, group director of policy and reputation at Tui, said: “It is not scapegoating, it is a very neutral analysis of the problem.“The reason protesters hit the streets is because of issues with the cost of living and especially housing. Both are driven by the secondary home market and short-term leases. All the destinations where we have seen the conflict of tourists and living spaces in the last few years are not where [operators like] Tui are active.”Last month, the Spanish government ordered Airbnb to remove nearly 66,000 listings from its platform; in Portugal new short-term rental licences in Lisbon have been suspended, and earlier this year Greece introduced a one-year ban on new short-term rental registrations in Athens.Hotrec, the European hotel industry’s lobby group, said the sector was highly regulated by authorities to fit with tourism capacity, and that services such as Airbnb needed to “play by the same rules”.Hotels accounted for 63% of overnight visitors in Europe last year, while apartments, vacation rentals and other short-term rentals made up 24%, and campsites 13%, according to Eurostat data.While the estimated number of overnight stays in hotels rose by less than 4% year-on-year in 2024, the short let market surged by 8%, an increase of 57m.Yedinsky argued that the targeting of services such as Airbnb by governments has not improved the situation because most of the issues do not stem from short-term rentals.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Rory McIlroy battled Oakmont’s treacherous setup and his own frustrations to survive for the weekend at the 125thUS Open. As McIlroy clung on, high-profile exits from Pennsylvania included the defending championBryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Dustin Johnson, Joaquin Niemann, Justin Thomas and Shane Lowry. In epitomising how Oakmont can mess with the mind, Lowry earned a one-stroke penalty after lifting his ball on the 14thgreen while forgetting to mark it. The Irishman could only laugh and, to be fair, did.McIlroy’s day began with two double bogeys inside three holes. By the 12th, the Masters champion flung his iron 30 yards down the fairway in anger at a loose shot. Five holes later, McIlroy broke a tee marker after cracking it with his three-wood. Yet amongst this was admirable fighting spirit; McIlroy fired an approach shot to within 4ft of the 18thhole, a birdie ensuring a 72 for a six-over aggregate. McIlroy last four, played in two under, were crucial. The madcap nature of thisUS Openis such that McIlroy will believe he has a squeak of winning. Only three players – Sam Burns, JJ Spaun and Viktor Hovland – are under par. Burns leads the other two by one at minus three.View image in fullscreenBryson DeChambeau hits out of the bunker during a round of 77.Photograph: Jared Wickerham/EPAWelcome to Grindsville, Pennsylvania. Any golfer standing still was doing wonderfully well. They assessed four foot putts as if they were instead the Gaokao Exam. Smelling salts might as well have replaced energy drinks in the locker room. George Duangmanee shot 86, 89 on his US Open debut. The poor fella did not birdie a single hole amid a string of unmentionables. If watching elite golfers being reduced to quivering wrecks is your thing, this major constitutes essential viewing.DeChambeau’s departure at 10 over is still a shock. The Californian added a 77 to Thursday’s 73. Thomas four-putted from 22ft, the low point in back-to-back rounds of 76. Johnson, who won here in 2016, continues his slide towards early retirement.Denny McCarthy branded five and a half hour Oakmont rounds as “a punch in the face.” The steam was just about visible from Jon Rahm’s ears as he assessed his 75. “I’m too annoyed and too mad right now to think about any perspective,” said Rahm. “I am very frustrated. Very few rounds of golf I played in my life where I think I hit good putts and they didn’t sniff the hole, so it’s frustrating.” Whether Rahm thought pin placements were unfair was left for others to ponder. At four over, he remains a contender.Scottie Scheffler has matched Rahm’s aggregate. “Gosh, dang it” bawled Scheffler after a wayward drive, which is as close as he will ever come to an expletive-laden tirade. “I battled really hard,” Scheffler said. “It’s challenging out there. I was not getting the ball in the correct spots and paying the price for it. Felt like me getting away with one over today wasn’t all that bad. It could have been a lot worse. Around this golf course I don’t think by any means I’m out of the tournament.” Scheffler was still on the practice range three hours after he walked from the final green.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Burns converted from 20ft at the 9th, his last, for a five under par 65. Three under par claimed the clubhouse lead; Burns could sit back and watch the rest suffer. “The golf course is really too difficult to try to figure out what’s a good score and what’s not,” Burns explained. “You’re really just shot by shot and trying to play each hole the best you can. If you try to be too perfect with putting it can drive you crazy, so I just try to really read it, put a good roll on it, focus on the speed and hope for the best. I have tried to play too perfect and tried to force it a little bit at times. So now I am trying to really be patient and take what the golf course gives me.”Hovland lurks. The Norwegian found himself in precisely the place you would rather not be on this course, 80ft from the hole on the final green. Hovland calmly two-putted, his 68 meaning one under par at halfway. In this Ryder Cup year, Hovland’s return to form is excellent news for Europe and their captain Luke Donald.“I’ve just been in a really nice mental state this week,” said Hovland. “Both of my rounds have been very up and down. I feel like a couple times if it would have happened at another tournament, for example, I could have potentially lost my mind there a little bit. But I felt like I kept things together very well.” Indeed, Hovland played his closing stretch in level after a double bogey on his 11th.Brooks Koepka twice reached three under on the back nine, his front half. Koepka bogeyed three in succession around the turn before dropping further shots at the 4th, 8thand 9thfor a 74. Two over par might frustrate Koepka given his second round start but he is firmly in the mix.Koepka is arguably the most fascinating actor in this show; a one-time major specialist, he has produced inauspicious results since winning the 2023 US PGA Championship. Koepka missed the cut both at that event and the Masters this year. At Quail Hollow last month, Kopeka was heckled over his decision to accept tens of millions to perform on the LIV Tour. Whether it was that viral moment, a heart-to-heart with his straight-talking coach Pete Cowen or simply the ironing out of technical flaws, Koepka suddenly looks a threat once again. Oakmont is unlikely to faze him. It has already done exactly that to countless others.Explore more on these topicsUS OpenRory McIlroyBryson DeChambeauEuropean TourGolfPGA TourUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Rouse the majorettes from their state of indifference. Put out more flags. Put out some flags. Put outa flag. Er … is anyone actually there? IShowSpeed? Can you hear me Pitbull? Welcome to the almost-World Cup, an almost-real almost-event that will perhaps, with a favourable wind, now begin to feel like almost-football.­This week Gianni Infantino described Fifa’s regeared tournament as football’s Big Bang, referencing the moment of ignition from which all the matter in the universe was dispersed out of a previously cold and indifferent void. And to be fair, Infantino was half-right. So far we have the void.David Squires on … Infantino’s Club World Cup buildup in the land of TrumpRead moreAmerica, we have been repeatedly told, is ready for this, primed and hungry for Fifa’s billion-dollar event. The evidence on the ground is: maybe. But not in a way that you’d actually notice. Instead, as theClub World Cupbuilds towards Saturday’s opening night, Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami versus Al Ahly at the Hard Rock Stadium, this is a tournament that exists at the fringe of America’s densely packed attention economy, an ambient drawl of half-heard voices, noises through the wall.The last week has brought almost-news of $4 tickets, star-player platitudes, immigration officials at the opening game. And all of this in a host city where people still look a little blank and say things such as:“TheClubWorld-what?”and: “Actually I like hockey, but my nephew, he loves Cristiano Ronaldo, and let me tell you, what a body that guy has.”This is a place where things keep almost-happening. Come and watch Inter Miami train on plasticised grass next to a private airfield, but no, not with Messi present. Wait! Infantino is giving a public address. Although it turns out he’s sent a video message (“un momento muy importante”) that people can video on their phones, while in turn being videoed by the official video crew, the only revelation from which was that Gianni appears to have acquired an excitingly badger-ish set of eyebrows. So there’s that.Otherwise, at times it has felt as if the only publicity around this thing is occasional in-house footage of Infantino appearing at some sealed indoor hype-event, looking like a fringe member of the intergalactic royal family being held hostage in a luxury basement, forced to stand next to Ronaldinho and the drummer from Spandau Ballet, and talk only about massive stuff, huge things, the biggest.Through all this, Infantino has become a slightly stretched figure. Understandably so. Here is a man charged with calling an imaginary sporting world into being, out there constantly saying things that are untrue about a thing that doesn’t exist to people who don’t care. Three days before the big kick-off it emerged that ChatGPT had simulated the entire tournament. Paris Saint-Germain beat Bayern Munich in the final. Do we actually need to play it?View image in fullscreenThe prospect of watching Lionel Messi may lure fans to the Hard Rock Stadium.Photograph: Hannah McKay/ReutersAnd yet, of course, we do. And with a duty, not to Fifa, or to the revenues of tomorrow, but to the idea this game still belongs even in debased form to the people who care about it.It is traditional at times such as these tohammer out a tournament preview, a distillation of all that stored excitement, the cultural collisions that have led to this place, the hard-edged imponderables of elite sport, the beauty in store. Hmm, yes. About that.This will be difficult on this occasion because this thing is ersatz, a pop-up. Sport is culture, memory and connection. But this is all borrowed culture, a burger made out of Plasticine, the tournament equivalent ofQatar’s desert city of Lusail, with its fake Rimini, its imitation Paris.It will be difficult because there are simply too many games, 63 of them across the next four weeks in 11 host cities, everything suitably maxed out in a country where even the act of buying a packet of crisps involves engaging with a sleeping bag full of violent toxic maize bombs, where there is a fear too many of these will be glazed, empty occasions, Warhol-ish performance pieces staged to capture a moment of perfect corporate emptiness. Next up: Ulsan HD against Mamelodi Sundowns at the Inter&Co Stadium Orlando. We’ll slide down the surface of things.For all that there is a sense this must matter, because the clubs matter, that we can still ingest this thing like a sporting amphetamine, some kind of engagement generated from a standing start. There have been some odd staging decisions, but there are still epic collisions here, A-list teams in great American cities. River Plate versus Inter at the Lumen Field. Bayern and Boca Juniors at the Hard Rock. PSG and Botafogo in Los Angeles. Anything yet? A flicker of the needle?For those who don’t have access to MLS there is a chance to see Messi again, here as a mobile marketing device, but also the most beautifully gifted footballer of the past 50 years. Real Madrid are genuinely interesting, the team of roving stars taking theirfirst steps under a systems manager, crowbarred into new shapes before our eyes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I hope my fight inspires others’Read moreThe continuingrebuild of Manchester Cityis a live event. There are subplots,a Trent at Madrid arc, Simone Inzaghi squiring his new love interest, Al-Hilal, around the place with Inter also in the ballroom. João Cancelo has played for six competing clubs, so is in effect Mr Club World Cup, out there non-celebrating all his as yet nonexistent goals on the almost-biggest stage.Is it good yet? Has it hit the bloodstream? This will be harder because of the unpalatable genesis of this thing, the fact it is in the end the work of a single autocratic leader. This is, of course, the over-empowered president of Fifa, with a sense at the big kick-off that only Infantino will feel any actual sense of ownership, eyes boggling on his executive banquette, legs in the stirrups, brow heaving as he births his personal god-league and holds it slithering to his chest.It will be difficult because this entity is also deeply disruptive, a case of Fifa digging its fingers hungrily into every league and club in the world. For all the blather about inclusion, Europe has 12 teams here. Fifa is pumping most of that $1bn (£739m) prize pot into European club football, in many cases equivalent to a season’s broadcast revenue. What is its mandate for doing this? Fifa is supposed to oversee and regulate, not act as an investor-disruptor, some kind of football-bro overlord.What other organisation allows this level of influence in one person, or lets its supposedly neutral leader cosy up to despots and political leaders, passing it all off, laughably, as Good for Football? So much so that the one element we know will cut Infantino to the quick is the fact Donald Trump will not be present at Saturday night’s opener.View image in fullscreenThere have been reports of tickets as cheap as $4 for some games.Photograph: Mike Blake/ReutersTrump will instead be overseeing a huge march-past in Washington called the Grand Military Parade (a great parade, the very best parade). Gianni, I’m sorry. They always let you down in the end. By an odd coincidence it is also Trump’s birthday, which does at least raise the prospect of a smudged and woozy Infantino performing his own alarmingly sensual rendition of Happy Birthday Mr President on the half-time big screen in Miami.On the day of Fifa’s opener there will also be 1,500 demonstrations across the US, including in Miami, under the banner No Kings, a movement that rejects the notion of Trump as a proto-regent in his wielding of power. Does this feel familiar, as if sport is again trying to tell you something, offering a front-row seat at the circus?It even feels right that this should be happening in Florida, a place built out of tax breaks and real estate finagling, a vast sun-baked fun palace, and now the green sunken hub of the football world. Let the games begin. There is, for all the absence of pre-energy, a lot more at stake here than a Tiffany trophy.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025Club World CupFootball politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The only other competitor to come close was Illinois’ Abria Smith, whose best effort measured 61ft 10¼in. Lesnar also registered the second-best throw of the day (61ft 11in), capping a commanding performance.It marked the second NCAA title for Lesnar, who also won the indoor championship in 2024. The 24-year-old senior is the first Colorado State athlete in 20 years to win an outdoor national title, joining Loree Smith (2005 hammer throw) in school history.

In 2024, she finished sixth at the Paris Olympics and entered this week’s meet as the No 1 seed in the nation. Her personal best of 64-3¾ would have earned an Olympic bronze last summer.“This one means a lot,” Lesnar said. “It’s taken a lot of work to get back to No 1.”Her national title echoes the collegiate success of her father, who won the 2000 NCAA heavyweight wrestling championship while competing for the University of Minnesota. In one of the most dramatic finals in tournament history, Brock Lesnar escaped from the down position in double overtime to secure a 3-2 victory. That win capped a 50-2 record at Minnesota and launched a career that would span the WWE, UFC and a brief NFL stint: auniquely dominant athletic legacynow matched in part by his daughter’s own rise to NCAA stardom.Elsewhere on the first day of women’s finals, Georgia’s Stephanie Ratcliffe defended her NCAA hammer throw crown with a toss of 234ft 2in. Washington’s Hana Moll broke the collegiate pole vault record with a clearance of 15-8½, surpassing the previous mark held by her twin sister Amanda.

Biles later said her frustration was directed at the system that puts athletes in difficult positions and that singling out an underage player crossed a line.“It didn’t help for me to get personal with Riley,” Biles wrote in a follow-up post. “These are sensitive, complicated issues that I truly don’t have the answers or solutions to, but I believe it starts with empathy and respect.”Simone Biles slams ‘sore loser’ Riley Gaines over attacks on trans athleteRead moreThe apology came days after Gaines, a former collegiate swimmer turned anti-trans activist, lashed out at Biles for her comments. The two clashed after Gaines mocked a Minnesota state high school softball championship’s post by pointing out a transgender girl on the winning team, referring to the player as “a boy” and claiming the title was “hijacked”.Biles, who has often advocated for mental health awareness and athlete welfare, responded sharply: “You’re truly sick. All of this campaigning because you lost a race. Straight up sore loser.” She followed with additional posts criticizing Gaines for “bullying” and suggested that sports organizations create a transgender division as an inclusive alternative.Gaines, who tied for fifth place with trans swimmer Lia Thomas at the 2022 NCAA championships and has since become a prominent figure in right-wing media, quickly pushed back. “Men don’t belong in women’s sports and I say that with my full chest,” she wrote, reposting fan responses and accusing Biles of undermining women’s spaces.While Biles has since walked back the personal tone of her remarks, she stood by the broader point. “I believe sports organizations have a responsibility to come up with rules supporting inclusion while maintaining fair competition,” she posted. “We all want a future for sport that is fair, inclusive, and respectful.”Yet the apology did little to defuse the backlash from the American right. Fox News’ website has published no fewer than 17 stories about the dispute since it began on Saturday. On the highly rated Fox panel show The Five on Wednesday, co-host Jesse Watters called Biles “mentally weak” and mocked her decision to apologize.“We have to make sure she medals [at LA 2028], OK? So I’m gonna lay off her,” Watterssaid sarcasticallybefore likening it toElon Musk’s walking back of his feudwith Donald Trump. “But I will say this, she pulled an Elon. ‘Oh, I’m sorry for some of the things I said.’ Come on.”The segment included further ridicule of Biles’s mental health advocacy, with Watters alluding to her high-profile withdrawal from events at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. “This shows the power of Fox,” he said. “This woman, Riley Gaines, did the full Kilmeade: six shows in 48 hours and just put so much pressure on Simone.”The right-leaning sports outlet Outkick, where Gaines is a contributor, also published multiple stories criticizing Biles for “bullying” and accused her of contradicting herself on inclusion and fairness.Despite the pile-on, many of Biles’s supporters praised her for defending a transgender minor against public attacks. A coach from the Minnesota team told local media after the championship game, “She’s a great kid and a great teammate. Her teammates love having her out there.”Biles, for her part, appears ready to move on. “We’re all passionate about sport and the direction it’s going,” she wrote. “But we need to be able to talk about it in ways that don’t tear each other down.”Explore more on these topicsSimone BilesTransgenderUS sportsShareReuse this content"

We are developing a way of playing that is a little bit more pragmatic.” Those are the words ofThomas Frank, speaking at the end of the 2022-23 season, in which his Brentford side finished ninth in the Premier League despite having by far the lowest wage bill in the top flight, at £99m. The pragmatism he spoke of had helped Brentford overachieve for a second successive season after promotion to the top flight two years earlier.There is, in general, a strong correlation between wage bill and league position, butBrentfordconsistently defied their financial disadvantage under Frank to become established members of the top flight, something plenty of other clubs have failed to do in recent years.When Frank led Brentford to that top-half finish, they were one point and one place behind Tottenham, who have just appointed Frank as their head coach. That was despite Spurs having a wage bill of £251m, more than two and a half times that of Brentford. If ever there were an advert for how to make the most of what you have to work with, Frank was it.And as he proudly said, pragmatism was at the heart of what he had done. Brentford had won promotion with a possession-based style, consistently dominating their opponents and playing teams off the park. They ranked in the league’s top five for possession in each of Frank’s two full seasons in charge in the Championship, and scored more goals than every other team in the regular season in those campaigns (80 in 2019-20 and 79 in 2020-21).But Frank recognised things would have to be different in the top flight. “We’ve found a way that is difficult to play against,” he said in 2023. “We know that if we go toe-to-toe with [the best teams], it will definitely minimise our chances to win. Now we go toe-to-toe in a different way that is a bit more defensive but, hey, you’re playing against six of the best teams in the world.” It worked; in Brentford’s second season in the Premier League, they won six, drew three and lost three of their 12 games against the traditional big six.Frank has shown an adaptability that Spurs’ last few managers have lacked. Their recent managers have jumped between the defence-first, win-at-all-costs football of José Mourinho and Antonio Conte (as well as Nuno Espírito Santo briefly), and the adventurous, attacking and sometimes downright reckless game ofAnge Postecoglou. These managers were steadfastly wedded to a way of playing, and that ended up being their downfall.Spurs failed under win-now managers in Mourinho and Conte, and had hoped to build something stronger and more sustainable with the ultra-possession-focused football of Postecoglou. Ultimately, however, his reign ended, ironically, with a Europa League triumph playing a brand of football more akin to that of his predecessors.He had adapted in Europe to do what Mourinho and Conte – and even Mauricio Pochettino and Harry Redknapp before them – could not and won a trophy, but the damage had already been done in the league. He recorded the club’s worst Premier League finish (17th) and the chair, Daniel Levy, pulled the trigger. Now, Spurs are turning to someone who is happier to adapt than any of their recent managers.Frank had to be flexible at Brentford because, as he said last month, they are “a selling club”. They have been a selling club throughout their rise up the divisions under the ownership of Matthew Benham, whose data-driven approach has been key to their success. Part of their philosophy is to cash in players when the right offer arrives.In the past six years, they have consistently sold their highest goalscorer, with Neal Maupay, Ollie Watkins and Ivan Toney moved on for big money and Bryan Mbeumo expected to depart this summer. They have also sold David Raya, Saïd Benrahma and Ezri Konsa, and have adapted every time. Maupay, Watkins, Toney and Mbeumo are different types of forward, but each has succeeded under Frank. He is a master of working with the tools at his disposal.Postecoglou’s predictability at Tottenham was one of his biggest weaknesses. “You can see what their ideas are very clearly,” an unnamed coach at another Premier League club recently told the Athletic. Under Frank, their tactics may even change from week to week. He prioritised possession at Brøndby and in the second tier with the Bees. “I got the label in Denmark of having a tiki-taka and possession-based team,” he once said. Brentford had the sixth-lowest average possession share in the Premier League this season (47.7%), but they also showed they could dominate the ball when they wanted to, beating Ipswich with 64.6% of possession in October, for example.View image in fullscreenFrank wants his teams to play through the opposition’s press if they can, but he is also happy for players to go direct to avoid playing their way into trouble in their own half. Brentford have ranked in the top five for the proportion of passes played long in each of their four seasons in the Premier League, with their rate as high as 16.6% in 2022-23. That rate dropped to 13.1% this past season after the departure of target man Toney, but was still the fifth-highest in the league.These numbers speak to that pragmatism. Brentford aren’t a long-ball team; they have plenty of very capable footballers and keep the ball on the floor as much as possible. But they are also well aware of their limitations and try to play in a way that means those limitations aren’t a problem.Over their time in the Premier League, they have moved further towards the style they used in the Championship as they have grown in confidence and ability. The below graphic charts how their football has developed in six full seasons under Frank.View image in fullscreenPostecoglou’s Tottenham were built to play short passes – only Manchester City (6.0%) played a lower proportion of their passes long in Premier League games this past season than Spurs (7.3%) – but they showed on their Europa League run how effective they can be with a more direct approach.All of this is not to say that Frank will turn Tottenham into as direct a team as Brentford, just that he is likely to encourage his players to play balls into the channels far more than Postecoglou did. And the direct style in the Europa League run shows there is something to work with for him on this front.Despite the fact Brentford don’t have much of the ball and go long more than most, they by no means sit back and soak up pressure. In fact, they ranked sixth in the Premier League this past season for high turnovers (winning the ball within 40 metres of the opposition’s goalline), with 319, one fewer than Tottenham, who were one of the league’s most active pressers.View image in fullscreenThe difference between the teams is that, whereas Spurs pressed at almost every opportunity when playing “Angeball” in its purest form, Brentford pick and choose their moments more wisely. Only Brighton made more pressures in the final third (2,922) than Spurs (2,908), but Brentford were way down in 14th (2,265). And yet Brentford made only one fewer high turnover than Spurs. Perhaps they are just smarter with their pressing?That could be something Spurs need given their players sustained so many injuries last season playing Postecoglou’s relentlessly high-intensity game. Spurs ranked third in the Premier League for distance covered (111.5km per game) and second for off-ball runs (6,043), while Brentford were 10th and 11th respectively. With Champions League football to contend with, perhaps a less taxing style will benefit the players, though Frank has never managed a team in a full European campaign, so it remains to be seen how he fares on that front.Efficiency is the name of the game for Frank, and that could be crucial in a busy season at a club expected to take the cups seriously and facing at least eight Champions League games. Brentford were efficient at both ends of the pitch throughout Frank’s reign. “We’re a big believer in making the chance bigger,” said Frank in 2022. “It’s about creating good opportunities where we increase the opportunity to score.”The numbers show they put this idea into practice extremely well. In the Premier League this past season, the average expected goals value of each Brentford shot (0.14 xG) was higher than any other team in the division. A season before, they had ranked second (0.13 xG/shot), and the season before that they were first (0.14 xG). In their four seasons in the Premier League, they make up three of the top 10 seasonal averages for xG per shot.View image in fullscreenThe highest xG per shot by teams in the Premier League since 2021.It follows that they take most of their shots from inside the area, taking up four of the top 10 seasonal averages for proportion of shots taken within the 18-yard box. Their rate of 77.0% in 2024-25 was the highest by any team in any of the past four seasons.Creating chances close to goal was also important to Postecoglou, and Tottenham’s 2024-25 season is eighth in the above list, so again this could be an area in which the players enjoy a feeling of some continuity when Frank comes in.Frank has his team work hard to keep the quality of their opponents’ chances down, with only Liverpool (63.3%) and Arsenal (63.5%) facing a lower proportion of shots from inside the box in the Premier League this past season than Brentford (64.1%). Brentford also faced the lowest quality chances on average, with the lowest xG per shot conceded in the division (0.09 xG).They do concede a lot of shots, though. Only rock-bottom Southampton (681) conceded more than Brentford’s 647 in the Premier League. But the fact that six sides conceded more xG (56.1) and seven teams conceded more goals (57) shows how efficient they were in defence.Much of Frank’s philosophy is about extracting the maximum from any situation, and he is not ashamed of placing great emphasis on set​ pieces. Only Arsenal (66), Liverpool (61) and City (58) have scored more goals from set​ pieces over the past four Premier League seasons than Brentford (54). Frank’s side lead the way for expected goals from set​ pieces (64.7 xG), and by a long way, with Arsenal (60.5 xG) their nearest challengers. They also have the highest xG per shot from set pieces (0.10 xG).View image in fullscreenWhen it comes to dead balls, Brentford boast a remarkable efficiency, part of which is down to how bold they are in such situations. In a​n interview with the Coaches’ Voice​ in2022, Frank explained how he pushes all his players into the attacking third when they have a chance to launch a long throw into the box. “If you don’t take risks, you also take risks,” he said. Spurs will hope Frank, who has brought his Brentford set-piece coach Andreas Georgson with him, can replicate his set-play success in north London.Clearly, Frank has plenty of strings to his bow. He is open to different things and willing to learn and use new techniques. He embraces data and proudly looks for efficiency at every juncture. Making a change was a big call from Daniel Levy, but Frank looks like a risk worth taking.This is an article byOpta AnalystExplore more on these topicsBrentfordGuardian Sport NetworkTottenham HotspurThomas Frank (Books)Ange PostecoglouThomas Frank (Football)featuresShareReuse this content"

Mbeumo is also wanted by Manchester United, who had an offer worth up to £55m for the Cameroon forward rejected last week and are expected to return with an improved bid.Brentford value the 25-year-old at more than £60m but are not expected to stand in his way if they can agree a deal, with Mbeumo previously thought to favour a move to Old Trafford.But Tottenham, who are also tracking Bournemouth’s Antoine Semenyo, are understood to be hopeful that Frank’s relationship with the player who he signed for £5.8m in August 2019 from French club Troyes can persuade Mbeumo to change his mind.It is also believed that there have been internal discussions about a move for Wissa, who scored 19 league goals last season. Nottingham Forest tried to sign the DR Congo forward in January and remain interested in him, although Brentford are unlikely to sell the 28-year-old for less than £40m given they have an option to extend his contract, which expires next year, by a further 12 months.Frank has said Brentford will always have “a big piece of my heart” following his departure from the club. “The time has come for me to move on. But, even as I leave, I know I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford, not just at the football club but with the community and the incredible and loyal supporters,” the 51-year-old wrote in amessage posted on Brentford’s website. “I want to extend my profound gratitude to the club for giving me the chance to pursue my dreams and for everyone involved who made the journey such a memorable one. For my family and I, it has been a privilege to be allowed to be part of such a special community – it’s an experience and adventure that we will cherish for life. So, thank you.”Brentford are expected to target an external candidate to replace Frank despite holding talks with Keith Andrews about stepping up from his role as set-piece coach. The former Republic of Ireland midfielder has emerged as a potential candidate for the manager’s post. He joined Brentford last summer and is highly regarded at the club but it is understood he is unlikely to be given his first senior role in management there.Brentford’s owner, Matthew Benham, is believed to have considered promoting Justin Cochrane from his role as Frank’s assistant until the 43-year-old former midfielder, who is part of Thomas Tuchel’s England staff, opted to join Tottenham instead. Ipswich’s Kieran McKenna and the former Borussia Dortmund manager Edin Terzic are among those being considered to take over instead.Meanwhile, Tottenham have filed high court proceedings against United co-owner Jim Ratcliffe’s company Ineos over a terminated sponsorship agreement. Spurs filed a commercial claim against Ineos Automotive on Thursday, though no documents are available.The chemicals firm agreed a five-year deal with Spurs in 2022 – before Ratcliffe bought a stake in United – for Ineos Grenadier to become the London team’s official 4x4 vehicle partner.Ineos said in a statement: “Ineos Automotive has been a partner ofTottenham Hotspursince 2022, expanding on a partnership agreement that Ineos Group had in place with the club since 2020. We have a contractual right to terminate our partnership contract and in December 2024 exercised that right.” Spurs declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsTottenham HotspurTransfer windowBrentfordnewsShareReuse this content"

If there are no willing suitors regarding a permanent transfer, City may consider a loan.A temporary move may prove the most practical option for Kyle Walker, who is 35 and has a year on his terms. City’s former captain joined Milan in January on loan for the second half of last season but the Italian club have no wish to re-sign him. Fenerbahce have emerged as possible suitors for the full-back.City may move again to strengthen Guardiola’s squad this summer, though the club do not expect to do any business during the Club World Cup. Depending on how the team perform in the US, Guardiola may consider a new right-back, with the club possibly reviving interest in Juventus’s Andrea Cambiaso. Should there be a considerable offer for Ederson, City may accept this for a goalkeeper who is 32 in August and has a year on his deal.City have invested more than £100m in Tijjani Reijnders, a midfielder, who joined on Wednesday for €55m (£46.6m), the left-backRayan Aït-Nouri, the goalkeeper Marcus Bettinelli and thewinger Rayan Cherki. The quartet took part in their first training session on Friday at Boca Raton’s Lynn University.

The Premier League champions will pay a guaranteed £100m for the coveted Germany international, plus potential add-ons of £16m that would make Wirtz the most expensive British transfer of all time.Richard Hughes, Liverpool’s sporting director, has been engaged in negotiations for the attacking midfielder for several weeks and a deal was finally struck on Friday morning. Leverkusen had wanted €150m (£127.6m) for the 22-year-old, who had also attracted interest from Bayern Munich, Manchester City and Real Madrid, but made it clear to the German club that Anfield was his preferred destination. He will undergo a medical in the coming days and finalise the transfer once the window reopens next week. Personal terms have already been agreed, with Wirtz understood to have rejected more lucrative offers from elsewhere.Liverpool made it clear throughout negotiations that they would not meet Leverkusen’s asking price but, after settling on a guaranteed £100m, the past few days have centred on the extent and the structure of the add-ons. Wirtz will become a British record signing, eclipsingChelsea’s £115m purchase of Moisés Caicedo, if sustained success at the highest level activates the extra £16m.The fee will comfortably be a record investment by the club. ­Liverpool’s previous record transfer wasthe £85m dealthat brought Darwin Núñez to Anfield from Benfica in June 2022. The champions hope to recoup most of that sum this summer by selling the Uruguay international, who has interest from the Saudi Pro League and European clubs.Liverpool’s ability to fund the Wirtz deal has been made possible thanks to frugal spending in the previous three transfer windows. Federico Chiesa, another forward who could leave this summer, was the club’s only incoming before Arne Slot’s debut season as head coachfor £10m plus £2m in add-ons from Juventus. The club’s faith in the squad rebuilt by Jürgen Klopp was vindicated as Slot’s team won arecord-equalling 20th league titlewith four matches to spare.Liverpool consider Wirtz a world-class and potentially transformative talent. His signing is, therefore, in keeping with the approach that saw Alisson Becker and Virgil van Dijk bought for then record transfer fees, and not a departure in transfer strategy by owners Fenway Sports Group.The club had expected Wirtz to join Bayern, or possibly remain with Leverkusen, but the player’s desire for a fresh challenge outside Germany and his talks with Slot tilted the fight in their favour.City claim they pulled out of a deal for Wirtz due to the overall costs involved in signing the attacking ­midfielder, who can play across the front line, on a five-year contract. Reports in Germany, however, have suggested Wirtz was unconvinced about City due to doubts over Pep Guardiola’s long-term future at the club.Hughes also remains in talks with his former club Bournemouth over the signing of left-back Milos Kerkez, who is valued at £45m. Liverpoolhave already signed Jeremie Frimpongfrom Leverkusen for £29.5m while the Georgia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili will complete his move from Valencia following last summer’s £29m deal. Liverpool have so farsold Caoimhín Kelleher to Brentfordfor a fee that could rise to £18m and made £10m from allowing Trent Alexander-Arnold to join Real Madrid 29 daysbefore his contract was due to expire.

I fight back. If they hit me, I hit back – but much harder. The way I hit back is by continuing to work and by showcasing Palmeiras’s work.”Leila Pereira is in full flow as she sits in the Palmeiras president’s office in São Paulo. In the 110-year history of a club founded by Italian working-class immigrants, she is the first woman to hold the post. The male dominance of global football is laid bare once again when you look at the lineup for the revampedClub World Cupin the US: of the 32 participating clubs, representing six continents, Pereira is the only female president.“It brings two emotions,” she says. “On one hand, I’m thrilled. On the other, I wish there were more women in football. My joy and my hope are that by seeing me in this position, other women are inspired to pursue their own space in football. This didn’t fall into my lap. It took years and I had to overcome many challenges to get here. It’s no use calling someone an inspiration if you’re not prepared to roll up your sleeves and fight for what you want.”Since being elected president in December 2021, Pereira has emerged as one of the most influential figures in Brazilian football – a world still fraught with political manoeuvring behind the scenes. Her reach extends well beyond Palmeiras. Last year she became the first woman to lead the Brazil men’s national team delegation, during their European friendlies against Spainand England– a role appointed directly by the Brazilian football confederation’s president. While largely symbolic, the appointment underscored her rising influence within the game and in the notoriously political Brazilian confederation.View image in fullscreenLeila Pereira, pictured at the Maracanã, is the first woman to lead the Brazil men’s national team delegation.Photograph: Wagner Meier/Getty ImagesShe has never been afraid to show a firm hand – even when it involves a Palmeiras hero. In June last year, Dudu, the club’s joint-most decorated player with 12 titles, sought a move to Cruzeiro after struggling for game time following a lengthy recovery from a cruciate ligament injury. Having agreed terms, he then reversed his decision, prompting Pereira to publicly call on him to “honour his commitment” to the Belo Horizonte club. Although Dudu stayed until December, the situation soured. It culminated in what Pereira described as a departure “through the back door”. Dudu responded on Instagram with abuse.Pereira feels he would not have responded in the same way to a man. “Why do you think he acted that way? No doubt, because I’m a woman. He felt free to be rude.” She has filed a lawsuit against him seeking “no less than R$500,000 [£67,000]” in damages. Within five months, Dudu had joined Cruzeiro’s rivals Atlético Mineiro, citing a lack of playing time.A billionaire businesswoman, Pereira was ranked fourth in Forbes’ 2023 list of the richest women in Brazil, with a fortune then estimated at R$8bn. But her wealth wasn’t made in football. Until 2015, her main focus was chairing a financial company specialising in high-interest personal loans to mainly lower-income individuals, founded by her husband, Roberto Lamacchia, and serving as rector of a university centre also owned by the couple.Born in Cambuci, Rio de Janeiro, she was raised in Cabo Frio, another municipality in the same state, by her father, a doctor, and her mother, a housewife. The middle child between two brothers, she had little interest in football, despite growing up in a family of diehard Vasco da Gama fans. While her brothers went for kickabouts, she played with dolls.Palmeiras entered her life at 18, when she met her future husband. At the time, she was studying journalism at a university in Rio de Janeiro. After two years working as a trainee at TV Manchete, she decided to switch paths and study law. “I always had this strong desire to be independent,” she says. “And that’s why everything I do today is rooted in this personal drive. I’ve always had this feminist streak, even before I knew what feminism really meant.”Her rapid rise to the top of Palmeiras’s hierarchy has drawn scrutiny. Her professional relationship with the club began in January 2015, when Palmeiras were short on cash, without a permanent shirt sponsor and having avoided relegation on the final day of the previous season. She suggested her husband’s company should sponsor the club he loves as a way to lift his spirits after a period of ill health. And that is what happened.View image in fullscreenLeila Pereira and Gustavo Gómez, the Palmeiras captain, hold the Paulista championship trophy after beating São Paulo in 2022.Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty ImagesOver a decade-long partnership, Palmeiras rose to the summit of Brazilian football as the dominant team, winning 14 major titles, including back-to-back Copa Libertadores, four league championships and two Brazilian Cups. This golden era spanned three club presidents: Paulo Nobre, Maurício Galiotte and Pereira herself.Her tenure as both club president and principal sponsor between 2021 and 2024, however, was not without controversy, with critics raising concerns over potential conflicts of interest – allegations she firmly denies. Since January, her company has stepped away from its sponsorship role, with the club now backed by a different company.Her current term runs until 2027 and Palmeiras are in far better shape than many of their rivals. Last year, the club posted record revenues of R$1.2bn, over a third of which came from selling academy-developed talent.A decade ago, Palmeiras’s youth system was largely unremarkable. Now it leads the field. Gabriel Jesus paved the way, with a £27m move to Manchester City, followed by Endrick’s £61m transfer to Real Madrid. Danilo joined Nottingham Forest for £18m, Luis Guilherme went to West Ham for £25.5m,Vitor Reis was sold to Citythis January for £29.6m – a record for a Brazilian centre-back – and Estêvão is bound for Chelsea in a deal worth up to £53m.That stream of income has allowed Palmeiras to flex their financial muscle. In February, they signed the striker Vitor Roque – then on loan at Real Betis from Barcelona – for £21.7m, making him the most expensive signing in Brazilian club history.View image in fullscreenChelsea-bound forward Estêvão (centre) poses with Leila Pereira. ‘He’s a phenomenal player,’ the Palmeiras president says.Photograph: Nelson Almeida/AFP/Getty Images“I have no doubt that Palmeiras are the best-run and most credible club in South America,” Pereira says. “But of course, that level of excellence isn’t down to me alone, it’s thanks to the incredible professionals we have. No one achieves anything by themselves.” She adds, with evident pride: “European giants now trust us to do business. Today, we’re a global reference. And it’s a woman at the helm.”She says: “Palmeiras are one of the few clubs in Brazil that meet all their financial obligations on time – staff, players, transfer fees. That’s non-negotiable for me. I come from a business background and football will not tarnish my name. I want to walk into our training ground and hold people accountable without owing them anything. It’s absurd that some [Brazilian] clubs can’t pay wages yet keep signing players. That’s why I advocate for financial fair play in Brazil.”At the Club World Cup, Chelsea supporters will get a closer look at Estêvão. Widely seen as the most electrifying export since Neymar first lit up the late 2000s, it will be the 18-year-old prospect’s last dance in green and white before making the move to Stamford Bridge. “He’s a phenomenal player and I understand why my husband didn’t want to let him go. This boy will one day be the best in the world. He’s that good and will always be one of our academy’s own. Just like Endrick, Vitor Reis, Luis Guilherme … ”While Pereira has maintained the philosophy laid down by her predecessors, it is Abel Ferreira who has shaped the club’s golden era on the pitch. The Portuguese coach is both the most successful and the longest-serving manager in Palmeiras’s history. Appointed by Pereira’s predecessor, he has won 10 trophies in just over four years, an extraordinary feat in a country where managerial turnover is common.A Sporting full-back who began his coaching career in the club’s youth ranks before spells at Braga and Paok, Ferreira will lead Palmeiras into their opening Group A match against Porto at MetLife Stadium in New York on Sunday. They will then face Al Ahly on Thursday, before rounding out the group stage against Inter Miami in Florida on 24 June.View image in fullscreenLeila Pereira with the Club World Cup trophy. ‘Just because some clubs are European giants doesn’t mean we can’t compete,’ she says. ‘After all, it’s our players who get signed by those clubs.’Photograph: Zuma Press, Inc./Alamy“The Club World Cup is a major challenge, and we’re excited about it. Just because some clubs are European giants doesn’t mean we can’t compete. After all, it’s our players who get signed by those clubs.”Whatever the outcome on the pitch, Palmeiras arrive in the US not only as a dominant force in South American football, but as a club reshaped by modern management, and fronted by a woman who has refused to be defined by it. She is outnumbered by men, but not outpowered.Explore more on these topicsClub World Cup 2025PalmeirasClub World CupinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Plans for a franchise league also continue apace amid consultation with Deloitte and Raine Group over further investment.Emboldened as a result, a return to the US is likely. In 2016, Saracens and London Irishlocked horns in New Yorkand a year later Newcastle and Saracenssquared off in Philadelphia. Neither fixture moved the dial – only 6,000 attended the latter – but, with the US hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2031, there is a collective attempt among powerbrokers to capitalise.England are playing a Test against the USA in Washington in July while the All Blacks will meet Ireland in Chicago at Solider Field in the autumn in a rematch of their historic meeting in 2016. It is understood that the British & Irish Lions turned down the chance to play their warm-up match against Argentina next week in Las Vegas but a well-placed source has told the Guardian that playing a fixture in the US on the way to New Zealand in 2029 is likely. PRL’s title sponsor, Gallagher, is based in Chicago and celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2027.Harlequins (Twickenham), Saracens (Tottenham Hotspur Stadium) and Bristol (Principality Stadium) have all staged matches away from their regular homes this season to great success. Asked about taking fixtures abroad, and if a return to the States was a prospect, the Premiership Rugby chief executive, Simon Massie-Taylor, said: “Yeah, but you need to do it strategically. The obvious point is the US and we’ve had US games before and they’ve been flash in the pans, at the wrong time of the season, in the wrong area, in the wrong stadiums with the wrong teams. But there is an opportunity in the buildup to the 2031 World Cup, we’ve also got a US partner who are coming up to their 100th anniversary.View image in fullscreenA packed Tottenham Hotspur Stadium hosts Saracens v Harlequins in 2024.Photograph: Kieran Cleeves/PA“It needs to lead to something. It’s about maxing out what we’ve got domestically first, which is why sell-outs are so important. That needs to continue for these big games to exist, and then you start moving beyond your shores.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It’s got grit, just like our competition. It’s a physical contest that showcases power, pace and incredible skill under pressure, so we are unashamedly going to talk about physicality, intensity, extreme athleticism and the grit of top-flight rugby.“This is about big hits, it’s intense, it’s full contact and it’s unflinching. We know this works as we’ve spoken to the players, and the things they’ve said in the process are ‘promote the players. Show the game, the aggression, the gladiatorial nature of the game, and give the brand the intensity to match’.”PRL chiefs have also confirmed that next season is set to start on a Thursday, two days before the women’s World Cup final, in an effort to avoid a clash with the Twickenham showpiece. It is likely to be a one-off in the short-term but, with next year’s Six Nations also starting on a Thursday at the request of broadcasters, midweek matches could become a more regular feature further down the line. Officials have also revealed that they intend to trial away sections at more matches next season after doing so at Saracens and Leicester in April.Explore more on these topicsPremiershipRugby unionSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

If the decision is confirmed England would continue to host the event until at least 2031. The country is unique in its ability to fill the stands even for neutral matches and in having the ideal climate to host the match in its current and favoured June window. Unless the political situation changes any final in India would probably need to be relocated should Pakistan qualify, with relations between the two countries currently hostile.South Africa look set to become the third winner in the tournament’s short history, after the unexpected outbreak of ideal batting conditions prompted an outstanding and unbeaten partnership of 143 between Aiden Markram – who finished unbeaten on 102 – and his captain, Temba Bavuma, who at stumps stood on 65. Their performance carried the team to the verge of victory over Australia and a desperately-sought first ICC title since the 1998 Champions Trophy: they finished the day on 213 for two, 69 runs away from equalling the second-highest successful chase in Test matches at Lord’s.View image in fullscreenAiden Markram and Temba Bavuma put on an unbeaten stand of 143 on day three at Lord’s.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PA“This would be massive for our country,” said Ashwell Prince, the team’s batting coach. “We’ve fallen short in some white-ball competitions with teams that have had very good chances of getting over the line, possibly favourites at times. But we haven’t done it yet, so we have got to knuckle down.”After 14 wickets fell on each of the first two days only four followed on the third, which started with a 59-run last-wicket partnership between Australia’s Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood that, while making their own task more testing, South Africa saw primarily as encouragement.“There was a little bit of frustration but we try to stick to the positives as much as we can,” Prince said. “Their tailenders were pretty comfortable against a pretty good bowling attack and you can feed off those things – if you reverse that it might happen when we bat. The message has been the same throughout: make them believe they can do it, and then step out of the way and allow them to go and do it.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was an exceptional partnership, they navigated any tricky times and then were able to put pressure on us through their running, through their ability to dissect the field – it was a real clinic from those two. The hope for us is that we can get a wicket or two in the morning and just see what that looks like.”Bavuma spent the last 33 overs of the day labouring with a hamstring injury that nearly forced him out of the game. “At tea we had to make a big call, whether he continues to bat,” Prince said. “Both of them were adamant that Temba’s got to continue. Temba’s had to fight throughout his career and this could be a defining moment for him, on the biggest stage.”Explore more on these topicsWorld Test ChampionshipAustralia cricket teamSouth Africa cricket teamCricketAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The club, relegated to League One, appointed the 35-year-old former Watford manager after being impressed in further talks this week. Cleverley succeeds Miron Muslic, who left for Schalke at the end of last month.Cleverley,sacked by Watfordlast month after finishing 14th in the Championship, had been identified as Plymouth’s number-one target after final interviews with four candidates on Wednesday. Discussions are believed to have been held with Jack Wilshere and Des Buckingham but neither made the final stages. The St Mirren manager, Stephen Robinson, is thought to have made the last round of talks. The recruitment has been led by David Fox, their former player who was recently appointed head of football operations, and the former Norwich sporting director Stuart Webber, a consultant.The Plymouth chairman Simon Hallett told the club website: “Ever since Miron’s departure, and knowing Tom was available, we identified him straight away as the perfect person to be our next head coach and targeted him immediately. When we spoke to him he was completely aligned with the vision and ambitions of the club and it was clear throughout that Tom was the right fit for us.“He is fully invested in our long-term plans and will play a key role in helping us achieve them. He is young, passionate and did a great job at Watford. We are thrilled to bring him to Argyle and look forward to seeing the impact he has on the talented squad at his disposal.”Managerless Cardiff City have held advanced talks with Buckingham about their vacancy but the Leicester coach Brian Barry-Murphy is also thought to be in the frame. Buckingham is out of work after being sacked by Oxford. Barry-Murphy joined Leicester in December after three years coaching in Manchester City’s academy. Barry-Murphy’s only previous management role was at Rochdale.Aaron Ramsey was a candidate for the job on a permanent basis after taking interim charge following Omer Riza’s sacking in April but the Wales midfielder has agreed to prolong his playing career in Mexico with Pumas after his Cardiff contract expired. The 34-year-old is expected to sign a deal until the 2026 World Cup, for which Wales hope to qualify under Craig Bellamy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Although she had fought hard and rallied after conceding a convincing first set against an imperious Zheng Qinwen, in truth she was never in control.Up 4-3 in the second set but down break point, Raducanu double faulted. A few minutes later, the match was over. The tension felt by the British No 1 in those decisive moments was a reflection of the constant pressure imposed on all contenders by the best players in the world, a challenge that she continues to struggle with.Emma Raducanu leapfrogs Katie Boulter to British No 1 after beating Sramkova at Queen’sRead moreHer positive week at Queen’s Club ended at the hands of an impressive Zheng, the top seed and world No 5, who overpowered Raducanu to reach the first grass-court semi-final of her blossoming career with a 6-2, 6-4 win.After two months of trying to adapt her game to suit slow, unfamiliar clay courts, the grass-court season on home soil has provided Raducanu with a helpful boost. She put together straight-sets wins against theSpanish qualifier Cristina BucsaandRebecca Sramkova, the world No 41, and she will regain her status as the British No 1 next week. Still, while she has performed well against players ranked outside of the top 30, her  game has often looked underpowered compared with the best in the world.Zheng and Raducanu are just one month apart in age. They first met at the Orange Bowl under-12s and they sometimes speak with each other in Chinese. While Raducanu broke through at 18, Zheng’s rise has been gradual but much more certain. Over the past year, she has established herself as a top contender, winning the Olympic gold medal in Paris. However, she has had minimal experience on grass. She entered this season 3-8 on the surface.This inexperience is countered by the massive weapons at her ­disposal, which means she is more than capable of being effective on grass. Although it can be inconsistent, Zheng’s first serve is a devastating, precise shot that is complemented by her vicious forehand. The 22-year-old is also one of the better athletes on the tour.Although Raducanu tried to impose her game on Zheng by attacking second serves on the rise and injecting pace into her forehand, she was overwhelmed by the Chinese player, who served brilliantly in the opening set and controlled the baseline with her far heavier weight of shot throughout.View image in fullscreenZheng Qinwen overpowered Emma Raducanu to win 6-2, 6-4 and reach her first grass court semi-final.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPARaducanu entered Queen’s Club still uncertain about her physical condition after a recurrence of her back spasms. Before the start of the second set, she took an off-court medical timeout to address her back.“It’s been lingering for the last few weeks, and I have had back issues before. I think it’s just a vulnerability of mine,” she said afterwards. “I know I need to take good care of it. I’m not overly concerned that it’s something serious, but I know it’s something that’s very annoying and needs proper and careful management.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Her first-serve percentage plummeted and her forehand errors began to pile up. Raducanu suffocated Zheng’s second serve and remained consistent as she twice broke for a 3-0 lead. Yet despite her fast start to the second set, the lead was never convincing.As soon as Zheng regained her rhythm on serve and range on her forehand, she took full control of the baseline again. At 4-3, Raducanu double faulted on break point to relinquish the second break as Zheng rolled through four consecutive games from 4-2 down to close out a strong win.“I think returning is one of my big strengths, and I think Qinwen served really well,” said Raducanu. “I didn’t see many second serves. And she hit her spots really well in some big moments. Credit to her. She kind of took away one of my bigger strengths. I think I have a lot of work to do, to be honest.”It remains to be seen how her back will hold up, but Raducanu will next head to the WTA 500 event in Berlin in search of more matches with the best players in the world.Explore more on these topicsEmma RaducanuTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

The Belgian Remco Evenepoel, who was leading the overall classification, finished fifth at 1min 50sec.Pogacar now has a 43sec lead over Vingegaard, 54sec over Germany’s Florian Lipowitz, and 1min and 22sec over Evenepoel.The Slovenian UAE Team Emirates XRG rider had already worn the yellow jersey before in this 77th edition of the Dauphiné after claiming victory in the first stage last weekend. “I’m super happy to be back in yellow. It was a very good day for us,” said Pogacar. “I’m getting very good answers from this Dauphiné.

The former France international, now LAFC’s goalkeeper, will face Chelsea, a familiar foe from his time at Tottenham Hotspur.The Club World Cup not only represents the highlight of the 38-year-old’s brief career in the United States, which started last year, but also LAFC’s biggest opportunity on the international stage.US-based soccer fans: are you going to a Club World Cup game this summer?Read more“It’s huge, even for me,” said Lloris, who helped France win the 2018 World Cup as the squad’s captain and finished his international career with a team-record 145 appearances. “I used to play against Chelsea so many times in my career. I still have my friends, close friends [in the Premier League]. With the time difference, we go through text messages.”Lloris played a pivotal role in getting LAFC to the tournament by making a big save late in extra time during the play-in match against Club América, one of Mexico’s perennial powers.The score was tied 1-1 in the 109th minute when Club América’s Javairô Dilrosun (who, interestingly, just signed with LAFC ahead of the Club World Cup) fired a blistering shot from eight yards out after a give-and-go with Diego Valdes. But Lloris reacted quickly and pivoted to his left to deflect the ball away from the near post.Six minutes later, Denis Bouanga scored to give LAFC a 2-1 victory.“He knows where shots are going before they’re hit,” LAFC defender Ryan Hollingshead said of Lloris. “He’s got a read on players and their body in the way that they move that is just different.”Hollingshead believes such awareness reflects Lloris’ ability to analyze situations and coordinate defenders quickly.“You hear him all game long, organizing, shifting, moving guys where they need to be,” Hollingshead said. “This guy has a passion for the game that just comes out on the field. You hear all the time that defensive shape starts with the ‘keeper. He’s honestly the best example that I’ve seen of that. He knows the game better than almost anybody I’ve played with.”Fellow defender Aaron Long, LAFC’s captain, praised Lloris’ physical skills. “Everyone talks about what a great shot stopper he is,” Long said. “But I think he’s amazing with his feet building out. I think it’s a really underrated skill of his. He’s got a wicked left foot, and it’s something that we utilize a lot. I also think his ability to hold on to really tough shots in certain moments wows us as players. Sometimes, a really tough shot will deflect and he’ll hold it. I’ll be like, ‘Wow, it’s amazing that he just held on to that instead of parrying it off to the side for a goal kick, a corner kick or something else.’”View image in fullscreenHugo Lloris and LAFC celebrate after their play-in triumph over Club América.Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty ImagesBut Lloris’ temperament most impresses Long. “I think there’s absolutely no ego when it comes to Hugo,” Long said. “He’s one of the nicest players we have. He’s a great veteran with tons of experience but he’s willing to help in any way he can. There’s so much humility in the way that he carries himself, in the way he works, and in how much he cares for this team, even at this stage of his career. It’s amazing how much he cares for this group and how much he still wants to win.”LAFC coach Steve Cherundolo described one way his goalkeeper expresses those feelings. “When nobody in the locker room wants to speak, Hugo speaks at the right moments with the right content,” Cherundolo said. “I think his emotional intelligence in the locker room and off the field has been very important and has been quite impressive. I don’t think we would have achieved our goals that we’ve already achieved in the short time he’s been here without him.”Despite that high praise, Lloris experienced a rough start to his first season in Major League Soccer last year. Despite recording two shutouts, the former international allowed 19 goals in his first 11 league matches, with LAFC winning four and drawing three.But after a 3-1 defeat to the San Jose Earthquakes, Lloris collected five successive clean sheets while compiling a personal streak of 502 consecutive minutes without allowing a goal. With his help, LAFC forged a 10-game unbeaten streak, which included nine wins. Lloris finished the season with 12 shutouts, just one fewer than the league leader, Seattle Sounders FC’s Stefan Frei. That performance enabled LAFC to share first place in the Western Conference with their cross-town rival, the Los Angeles Galaxy, and win the US Open Cup.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

For example, LAFC had to play five of their first 11 matches last year on the road in places as far as Minneapolis, which lies 1,524 miles away by air but is only halfway across the United States. The club also played road matches last year in such cities as Cincinnati, Orlando and Vancouver across four time zones and two countries.“The away game is clearly a difficult task,” Lloris said. “It’s not easy to travel three, four, five hours, sometimes, and manage a good performance. That’s why you saw the inconsistency.”Long-distance travel also intensifies the challenge MLS’s physical, offensive-minded intensity poses.“It’s a little bit different than I used to face in Europe,” Lloris said. “There is a lot of transition. Physically, it’s good. It’s what I used to see in Europe. In some games, there is a lot of inconsistency in terms of focus, in terms of rhythm. But at the same time, it’s the same sport. After a few months, I understood where I was.”While developing that understanding, Lloris learned to enjoy the California lifestyle. “The environment reminds me a little bit of the south of France, you know, mountains, hills, ocean beaches,” said the goalkeeper, who grew up in Nice. “It’s been an amazing experience so far. There’s a lot of positive things: the spirit, the weather, the mentality. My family settled really well. My kids, who are most important, are enjoying life at school.“But at the same time, I feel really far from my friends and family. Of course, we are still in touch, and they came to visit. As soon as we have the time, we will try to go and see them.”Meanwhile, Lloris has enjoyed embedding himself in LAFC’s communal atmosphere. “It’s more a club with a human dimension,” he said. “Tottenham is a great club with great people but [here] there is more proximity between people. It makes relationships easier. They created a club with values. Family is really important. When you see kids celebrating with the players after every win at home, it’s something quite special.”The play-in match against Club América provided an example. After the victory, Lloris was being interviewed while holding his five-year-old son, Leandro.“We had an amazing night,” Lloris said. “From the preparation of the game through the warm up, during the game and after the game, the communion with the fans, with owners, with coaching staff, medical staff, all the club was great.”That kind of camaraderie provides motivation even for someone who reached the heights for club and country. “It reminds me what I’m playing football for, to live those types of moments,” Lloris said. “That’s why you wake up every day, why you’re working every day. It doesn’t matter which level you are at.”Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles FCClub World CupClub World Cup 2025MLSUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

His late-game heroics are the main reason why the Indiana Pacersare just two wins from the NBA title. Time and again during these playoffs Haliburton has snatched the Pacers back from what had looked like certain defeat – and with every M Night Shyamalan twist he orchestrates on court, he shows that no moment is ever too big for him.Where another player might struggle to addoneclutch playoff bucket to his highlight reel, Haliburton has made a game-tying or game-winning shot inevery round of this year’s postseason– a heady accomplishment only Reggie Miller, Haliburton’s Pacers archetype, can match. In the first round against Milwaukee, Haliburton beat Giannis Antetokounmpo for a layup to steal Game 5 in overtime and close the series. Late in Game 2 of the conference semi-finals versus Cleveland, Haliburtonsank a three-pointer off his own missed free-throwto stun the home crowd and take a 2-0 series lead. In the opening game of the conference finals, Haliburton not onlybounced in a buzzer-beater twoto force overtime against New York. He celebrated by grabbing his neck and reprisingMiller’s notorious choking gesturefrom the 1994 conference finals series, triggering Knicks fans all over again as Miller looked on approvingly. Then, in the Game 1 victory over the Thunder in the NBA finals, the Pacers achieved their only lead when Haliburtonhit the game’s last shotwith 0.3 seconds left to cap his team’s fifth comeback while trailing by 15 points or more these playoffs – the most since Miller’s Pacers stormed through the brackets in 1998.The unsinkable Pacers don’t need the lead. They just need the last word | Claire de LuneRead moreCounting the regular season and the playoffs this year, Haliburton is a robust 86.7% onshots taken inside the final two minutes(including overtime) to tie or take the lead. The same fans who once joked about Haliburton’s smiles-per-game at the Olympics have shifted to likening his uncanny talent forupending win-probability trend linesto basketball terrorism. Nicknames for Haliburton on social media include The Haliban and, when he beat Thunder in Game 1 of the finals,Himothy McVeigh, a play onthe Oklahoma City bomber(It should go without saying that such wordplay is in questionable taste.)All of this has put the league, already under fire for itsmuted NBA finals spectacle, in the unfortunate position of having toastroturfanother Haliburton nickname, The Moment, in hopes of stopping the more charged ones from spreading further. (Newsflash: it hasn’t caught on with fans.) That Haliburton has suddenly emerged as the man for the moment is a development few outside Indianapolis saw coming. At the Olympics, Haliburton struggled to break a Team USA point guard rotation that included all-time great shooter Steph Curry and Derrick White, the freshly minted NBA champion from the Boston Celtics.Altogether, Haliburton sat out three of six games and played 26 total minutes in Paris – the fewest of anyone on the team. Speaking to ESPN’s Jamal Collierlast month, he’d call his Olympic experience an “ego check” and said the online jokes hurt. (The smile, it turns out, was just a cover.) “It got to the point where all that conversation was weighing on me in a negative way for the first time in my life, which was weird,” Haliburton said. “Basketball has always made me happy. And for the first time I wasn’t happy.” Adding to the insults: Haliburton was nursing a hamstring injury suffered during a Cinderella run through the 2024 playoffs that was cut short when the top-seeded Celtics swept the sixth-seeded Pacers in the conference finals.The hits didn’t stop there. As the playoffs began in April, The Athletic asked NBA players who they considered the league’s most overrated player. With 158 anonymous replies (or more than a quarter of the locker room population), Haliburtonwon handily– with 14.4% of the vote – over Minnesota big man Rudy Gobert and Atlanta pest Trae Young. But Haliburton, who further confessed to learning a lot from how USA teammates Jayson Tatum (who also went overlooked in the Olympic rotation) and Joel Embiid handled criticism on their respective NBA squads, didn’t let the disrespect get him down this time. “I must be doing something right,” Haliburton said in response to the poll. “My focus is on this locker room and securing victories. I know who I am. I’m confident in myself and not concerned with what others think.”Haliburton has shown as much throughout the season, wearing a goofy smile as he rips hearts out from coast to coast. All the while he has navigated the ancillary controversies around his game – from the NBA banning his father, John, from attending games as punishment fortaunting Antetokounmpo; to Haliburton himselfnearly upstagingPascal Siakam’s acceptance of the conference finals MVP award – with grace and maturity. “When we brought him here, we had a vision,” Haliburton said of Siakam, shrugging off his unwitting echo of a popular meme from apast NBA All-Star celebrity game. “We envisioned doing something like this, doing something special.” It just confirms what teammates already know about Haliburton: he’s not playing for the spotlight.That was obvious again in the Pacers’ 116-107 victory over the Thunder on Wednesday night – a nip-tuck affair in which Haliburton made the difference with his defense and distribution of the ball, and Indiana’s benchcarried the day. In one late-game sequence, he managed to outfox Gilgeous-Alexander – a solid off-ball defender – in a clever half court set piece from the left elbow. Instead of dishing the ball off to a cutting Miles Turner, who only had SGA to beat in the lane, Haliburton fired the ball past Turner to Aaron Nesmith on the opposite wing – who thenburied a three over a wrongfooted Shai Gilgeous-Alexanderto give the Pacers an eight-point lead with three minutes left. No, the play wasn’t as sexy or as seismic as a Haliburton desperation heave. But there’s no doubt it was clutch.“I mean, I was like three months old last time they made the finals,” Haliburton joked to NBA TV while considering the significance of helping the Pacers to their first finals trip first finals trip in 25 years. “As a group, every year we’ve taken a jump. We’re here now, and we don’t want to take this time for granted.” Now two wins from delivering the Pacers’ first ever NBA championship (they had previously won three titles in the defunct ABA), Haliburton is on the brink of turning a series thatbegan with low expectationsinto one that may forever live in NBA lore. It’s quite the turnabout for a player who seemingly couldn’t make the grade.Explore more on these topicsIndiana PacersOklahoma City ThunderNBA finalsBasketballUS sportsNBAfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wilson later said she’d never seen so much of her own blood. It didn’t affect her game too much though: she finished with 24 points and 20 rebounds,telling reportersof the jab, “I think it made me great.”When Caitlin Clark entered the league in the same season and was almost immediately swattedaround like a fruit flyby veterans with years of experience and plenty of size on her, she didn’t complain (though many of her fans sure did). Clark came back this seasonbigger and better, delivering her own message to the veterans who knocked her around as a rookie.WNBA: No 1 pick Paige Bueckers scores career-high 35 on return from injuryRead moreWilson and Clark’s stories came to mind after Kelsey Plumlit into the refsafter the Los Angeles Sparks’ loss to the Golden State Valkyries on Monday night. “I got scratches on my face, I got scratches on my body, and these guards on the other team get these ticky-tack fouls, and I’m sick of it. I get fouled like that on every possession,” she said.Plum likely had a point – the Valkyries had few other ways to slow her – but her frustration tapped into a broader narrative.This season is young and has already been dogged by complaints that the league is too physical (whatever that means), complaints that boggle the mind when one considers the way theWNBAhas always been played.“Physicality hasalwaysbeen a WNBA thing,” says Jordan Robinson, who hosts The Women’s Hoop Show alongside Sheryl Swoopes, and is writing a book on the history of women’s basketball. “It’s a sports thing! It’s been a women’s basketball thing since the beginning.” The first recorded women’s basketball game was in 1892 – and by all accounts, it wastough.People in 1892 were “surprised at women playing basketball in general”, she says, “and later in the 1920s were appalled that women were playing a physical sport – and then! – on top of that, they were aggressive.”At various points in history, women’s courts were divided into sections. The thinking was that it would keep players from sweating too much or using too much energy, Robinson says. The women’s game didn’t even include unlimited dribbling until the 1960s, out of a head-scratching belief that the players would get too tired.The idea that the women’s game isn’t, or shouldn’t be, physical confounds the mind, longtime WNBA reporter and author of Becoming Caitlin Clark,Howard Megdal, says. “This is a league of skill and strength and speed – it’s amazing – and to me, that is a great thing. This is something I enjoy.” In other words, a WNBA without physical confrontation is a WNBA that far fewer fans would actually want to watch.Robinson agrees. “When I watch the WNBA, when I watch professional athletes at the very top of their craft, I see competitors, point blank,period.” To Plum’s point about the fouls called (or not called) during Monday’s game, Robinson says, “What she’s saying is, ‘I’m going to bulldoze through you if I have to, but, hey, there are actually rules in place so I don’t get hurt.’”View image in fullscreenLaeticia Amihere of the Atlanta Dream is tended to by medical staff after a flagrant foul during a 2023 game against the New York Liberty.Photograph: Alex Slitz/Getty ImagesAnyone who believes the WNBA has somehow ramped up the physicality only in recent years needs only look back on the league’s history. South Carolina Gamecocks head coach Dawn Staley is known forher fiery sideline responsesduring crucial games, responses that she certainly displayed when she was in the W. Staley, her former Houston Comets teammate Tina Thompsononce said, “play[ed] with an unbelievable toughness” due to her 5ft 6in size.If anything, the physical nature of the WNBA hasdecreasedin recent years as more player protections and rules have been put into place. In an interview withSports Seriouslythis week, Diana Taurasi attributed the increased attention on physicality to “more eyeballs on the game” but added that players who have been in the league for a decade or more would agree it’s “less physical” than ever before.Swoopes would likely agree. During her 10th season in the league in 2006, the longtime Comets great referenced the very problem that’s still being discussed today. “As far as the physicality of it, I’m glad I’m not a referee because you just never know. Sometimes they’re calling every little bitty thing and you’ve got people complaining about that, ‘Because that’s not what the fans want to see,’”she saidat the time. “Now, it’s very physical and people are complaining about that, ‘It’s too physical. That’s not what the coaches want; that’s not what the players want.’ So you’ve gotta give and take. You’ve got to give a little and take a little.”If hard contact makes some fans uncomfortable, maybe it’s time they found another pastime. Of course, one would be hard-pressed to find a professional women’s sport that isn’t just as physical (or even more physical) than the WNBA; American soccer star Heather O’Reillyonce praisedAbby Wambach as her “dream player” after the latter had her head stapled back togetherwhile still on the pitch. Even a sport that’s often considered “feminine” can demand a perseverance and grid that would test the hardest NFL player (just ask gymnast Kerri Strug).Or maybe it’s time for women’s basketball fans to leap into 2025, a moment in space and time in which we recognize professional female athletes go just as hard as their male counterparts – and we can finally stop wringing our hands and enjoy every aspect of the game, even the hits.Explore more on these topicsWNBABasketballUS sportsCaitlin ClarkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Long before anyone hit send on those inflammatory tweets, or tensions spilled out over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB), Musk’s political downfall was written in the stitching.During his time in the White House, Musk shunned the sartorial rulebook of someone at the shoulder of a president, where suits and ties are the common code. He wore dark Maga baseball caps at the Oval Office and told a rally in New York: “I’m not just Maga, I’m dark gothic Maga.” Then there were the T-shirts with slogans such as “Occupy Mars”, “Tech Support” and “Dogefather”. At campaign rallies, commentatorsnotedhe looked “more like he belonged at a Magic: The Gathering tournament than a political event”, his dress sense the style equivalent of the k-holes that it is claimed Musk frequently disappeared into.The more casual styles of Musk and his Silicon Valley tech bros – where stiff collars are eschewed in favour or crewnecks, tailored jackets softly pushed out the door by padded gilets – are light years away from those of the suited-and-booted US Capitol.But if Musk’s clobber signalled a new DC power shift, it also spoke to different norms. “Disruption might be a badge of honour in the tech space,” says DC-based image coach and style strategistLauren A Rothman, “but in politics, chaos has a much shorter runway. The White House has been around for a long time. We’re not going to stop wearing suits … This is the uniform.”View image in fullscreenDeliberately dishevelled … Dominic Cummings, right, in 2019, with a foldback clip instead of a tie and a gilet.Photograph: Hollie Adams/GettyAll of this dressing down, dressing objectively badly and dressing “inappropriately” has form. Consider, if you can bear to, the case ofDominic Cummings. The former Boris Johnson aide subjected Westminster to dishevelment, Joules gilets, beanies, Billabong T-shirts and tote bags advertising the 1983 gothic-inspired horror novel The Woman in Black. He wasn’t just a Tory, he was a gothic horror Tory.As Jonathan Freedland, the Guardian columnist and host of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly Americapodcast, notes: “Dressing down is usually a power move in politics, just as it is in the boardroom: only the most powerful can get away with it.” That was, he says, the message Cummings sent “when he roamed Number 10 in a gilet: ‘You lot are worker bees who have to wear a uniform, whereas I’m so indispensable to the man at the top, I can wear what I like’.”It was the same with Musk, whose threads were a flipped bird to all those Oval Office stiffs in suits. As Rothman puts it: “His uniform of casual defiance stands in sharp contrast to that traditionally suited corridor of political power.” And that contrast screams out his different, special status.Before him, there was “Sloppy Steve” Bannon, a man never knowinglyunder-shirted. On this side of the Atlantic, Freedland points to former David Cameron adviser Steve Hilton and his penchant for turning up to meetings barefoot: “ditching the shoes was an instant way of signalling his membership of the inner circle”.It’s that age-old question: who has the privilege to be scruffy? As Freedland puts it: “Musk was happy to stand next to the Resolute desk of the president looking like he was dressed for a gamers’ convention. That was his way of reminding everyone of his superior wealth and unique status, outside conventional politics.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Scruffy Icaruses who flew too close to the sun; their clothes a foreshadowing of their fall. Trump might talk about draining the swamp, but his Brioni suits are very much swamp-coded – plus, while Johnson might have had strategically unruly hair and ill-fitting suits as crumpled as a chip wrapper, suits they still were.Ultimately, nobody likes a bragger. Because dressing in a way in which your privilege is omnipresent if not outright stated, is a surefire way to piss people off. Not least Trump, who noted that Musk had “some very brilliant young people working for him that dress much worse than him, actually”, in an interview on Fox in February.“The contrast between Musk’s garb and Trump’s cabinet,” according to Freedland, “made them look and seem inferior: servants of the president rather than his equal.

It’s pretty much a straightcopy of the original: a huge soap bubble, half sunk into the desert floor, with its surface turned into a gigantic TV. Occasionally you’ll pull up near the Sphere while driving an electric vehicle made by Silva, the megacorp that controls this world. You’ll sometimes come to a stop just as an advert for an identical Silva EV plays out on the huge curved screen overhead. The doubling effect can be slightly vertigo-inducing.At these moments, I truly get what MindsEye is trying to do. You’re stuck in the ultimate company town, where oligarchs and other crooks run everything, and there’s no hope of escaping the ecosystem they’ve built. MindsEye gets this all across through a chance encounter, and in a way that’s both light of touch and clever. The rest of the game tends towards the heavy-handed and silly, but it’s nice to glimpse a few instances where everything clicks.With its Spheres and omnipresent EVs, MindsEye looks and sounds like the future. It’s concerned with AI and tech bros and the insidious creep of a corporate dystopia. You play as an amnesiac former-soldier who must work out the precise damage that technology has done to his humanity, while shooting people and robots and drones. And alongside the campaign itself, MindsEye also has a suite of tools for making your own game or levels and publishing them for fellow players. All of this has come from a studio founded by Leslie Benzies, whose production credits include the likes of GTA 5.View image in fullscreenAI overlords … MindsEye.Photograph: IOI PartnersWhat’s weird, then, is that MindsEye generally plays like the past. Put a finger to the air and the wind is blowing from somewhere around 2012. At heart, this is a roughly hewn cover shooter with an open world that you only really experience when you’re driving between missions. Its topical concerns mainly exist to justify double-crosses and car chases and shootouts, and to explain why you head into battle with a personal drone that can open doors for you and stun nearby enemies.It can be an uncanny experience, drifting back through the years to a time when many third-person games still featured unskippable cut-scenes and cover that could be awkward to unstick yourself from. I should add that there are plenty of reports at the moment of crashes and technical glitches and characters turning up without their faces in place. Playing on a relatively old PC, aside from one crash and a few amusing bugs, I’ve been mostly fine. I’ve just been playing a game that feels equally elderly.This is sometimes less of a criticism than it sounds. There is a definite pleasure to be had in simple run-and-gun missions where you shoot very similar looking people over and over again and pick a path between waypoints. The shooting often feels good, and while it’s a bit of a swizz to have to drive to and from each mission, the cars have a nice fishtaily looseness to them that can, at times, invoke the Valium-tinged glory of the Driver games. (The airborne craft are less fun because they have less character.)View image in fullscreenDriving between missions … MindsEye.Photograph: Build A Rocket Boy/IOI PartnersAnd for a game that has thought a lot about the point at which AI takes over, the in-game AI around me wasn’t in danger of taking over anything. When I handed over control of my car to the game while tailing an enemy, having been told I should try not to be spotted, the game made sure our bumpers kissed at every intersection. The streets of this particular open world are filled with amusingly unskilled AI drivers. I’d frequently arrive at traffic lights to be greeted by a recent pile-up, so delighted by the off-screen collisions that had scattered road cones and Dumpsters across my path that I almost always stopped to investigate.I even enjoyed the plot’s hokeyness, which features lines such as: “Your DNA has been altered since we last met!” Has it, though? Even so, I became increasingly aware that clever people had spent a good chunk of their working lives making this game. I don’t think they intended to cast me as what is in essence a Deliveroo bullet courier for an off-brand Elon Musk. Or to drop me into an open world that feels thin not because it lacks mission icons and fishing mini-games, but because it’s devoid of convincing human detail.I suspect the problem may actually be a thematically resonant one: a reckless kind of ambition. When I dropped into the level editor I found a tool that’s astonishingly rich and complex, but which also requires a lot of time and effort if you want to make anything really special in it. This is for the mega-fans, surely, the point-one percent. It must have taken serious time to build, and to do all that alongside a campaign (one that tries, at least, to vary things now and then with stealth, trailing and sniper sections) is the kind of endeavour that requires a real megacorp behind it.MindsEye is an oddity. For all its failings, I rarely disliked playing it, and yet it’s also difficult to sincerely recommend. Its ideas, its moment-to-moment action and narrative are so thinly conceived that it barely exists. And yet: I’m kind of happy that it does.MindsEye is out now; £54.99The subheading and captions on this article were amended on 13 June 2025 to correctly refer to the developer as Build a Rocket Boy and the publisher as IOI Partners, not “Build A Robot Boy” and “IO Interactive” as an earlier version said.Explore more on these topicsGamesShooting gamesRole playing gamesAction gamesVirtual worldsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Down one path lay negotiations that, while difficult, promised benefits to the citizens of both countries. Down the other path, a protracted war that promised little more than destruction.Back in 2018,Donald Trumphad blocked the diplomatic path by tearing up the existing nuclear agreement with Iran – the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. But since beginning his second term in January he has been surprisinglyopen to negotiations with Tehran. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, seemed ready to go along.But theIsraeliprime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, has now decided for them in favor of the path of war, and despite initial hesitation, Trump now appears to be following him. Thoughuniquely positionedto rein in Netanyahu – more than any US president in decades – Trump has jumped on his bandwagon.Benjamin Netanyahu must be stopped | Moustafa BayoumiRead moreAfter entering office, Trump rightly pursued a deal that would offer Iran sanctions relief in return for an end to its nuclear weapons program. This deal would have served the interests of both parties. The risk of an Iranian nuclear breakout would have been greatly reduced, thus reducing pressure on other regional and global powers to pursue nuclear weapons themselves. Global energy markets would have benefited. The United States could have meanwhile pursued the drawdown of its military forces in the region, thus furthering a goal of every US president since Barack Obama. Improved US relations with Iran would also have helped to complicate Iran’sdeepening tiesto Russia and China.But the Israeli government wanted none of this and has therefore spoiled the Trump administration’s negotiations. The Israeli government claims that Iran was days away from a bomb and that it had no choice but to attack. This is hard to believe. For years, experts, including theUS intelligence community, have estimated it would take months if not years for Iran to not only produce enough highly enriched uranium but to also build a bomb with it. If this timeline had changed in recent days, the US would almost certainly have joined Israel in these strikes.The strikes also will not end Iran’s nuclear program. The damage will be real, and military operations are ongoing, but Israel is ultimately only capable of destroying parts of Iran’s program. The destruction of the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz is a setback for Iran, but these facilities can be rebuilt. The assassination of Iran’s nuclear scientists is a blow, but their knowledge can also be replaced over time. History shows that so-calleddecapitation strikescan have a near-term effect, but they rarely work in the long term. Even if the United States now joins Israel in strikes, this will not eliminate Iran’s weapons program entirely without a regime change operation against Tehran. That strategy would repeat the tragic errors of the 2003 Iraq war, but on an even larger scale.Iran’s nuclear weapons program will thus remain in some form. But hope of negotiations to control it is now badly damaged. The result is the worst of both worlds: a vengefulIraneven more determined to get nuclear weapons and no hope of negotiating a way out.Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, has wiselyattempted to distancethe United States from Israel’s attack. Trump, however, whoinitially tried to rein in Israel’s attack, has now tried to use it as leverage to get Tehran to sign up for his deal. Aligning America so closely with Israel at this juncture is only likely to draw the United States more deeply into the conflict and expose it to Iranian reprisals.The Guardian view on Israel’s shock attack on Iran: confusing US signals add to the peril | EditorialRead moreAs a negotiating tactic it is also unlikely to work. The autocrats in Tehran cannot allow themselves to be visibly coerced into a deal lest it damage their domestic legitimacy. Some powerful Iranian officials moreoverbenefit from the status quounder sanctions, which have enriched a powerful few at the cost of the Iranian people.Israel’s audacious move is another example of US partners seizing the strategic initiative from Trump. Israel’s strikes come on the heels of the decision by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, to strike deep intoRussiawith drones at the very moment the US was attempting to negotiate a ceasefire with Moscow.With the US focused on the turmoil theTrump administrationis whipping up domestically, and so much uncertainty about the trajectory of Trump’s global policy goals, other actors are probably going to do the same. Unless the administration can find the discipline and focus to get control over its own foreign policy, the United States risks getting dragged into more conflicts that will not serve the interests of the American people.Chris Chivvis is a senior fellow and director of the American Statecraft Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International PeaceExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationIsraelIranUkraineRussiacommentShareReuse this content"

The Israeli prime minister’s lust for war as a solution to his myriad problems is nothing short of a threat to us all, one that extends far beyond Israel’s neighbors. Netanyahu knows no other way. War is his doctrine. War is his reflex. War is his answer. He believes the power of war will unite Israeli society and will stifle any American criticism of him, necessary since the machinery he needs to make his wars comes mostly from Washington. And, with his aggression against Iran, he seeks to drag the United States further into another endless military quagmire in the region and light the world on fire.Early on Friday morning, Israel launched a series of unprovoked strikes against Iran, targeting Iran’s nuclear energy facilities, its top scientists, its military commanders, and parts of its military and civilian infrastructure. Television imagesshowa residential building in Tehran damaged by what looks like a missile attack. Iran, which has not suffered an assault this severe since its war with Iraq in the 1980s, isreportingat least 70 people killed and 320 injured thus far. Meanwhile, Israel’sgenocidal campaign in Gazacontinues out of the public eye, as aninternet blackouthalted most aid operations.Netanyahu argues that the Israeli attack on Iran was a “pre-emptive strike” against a clandestine nuclear weapons program. But that’s simply a lie. A “pre-emptive” strike requires an imminent threat of invasion or military force. Iran was not imminently about to attack Israel, with or without a nuclear weapon. What Israel engaged in last night was better described by its defense minister as a “preventive” strike against an opponent’s infrastructure.Regardless of what you think about Iran’s nuclear energy program, about the status ofnegotiationswith the United States regarding its nuclear program, or about recentpressurethe International Atomic Energy Agency has brought on Iran, a preventive strike by Israel against a sovereign nation is a blatant act of aggression. It is fundamentally illegal under international law and will further erode the prospect of sovereign states living in peace and security with each other.Iran has long claimed that it is only pursuing a civilian nuclear energy program and has no ambition to make a nuclear weapon. That might also be a lie, but who would blame them for wanting such a deterrent now? It’s widelyunderstoodthat North Korea’s nuclear arsenal effectively functions as a deterrent against an American attack, after all.Israel, which isbelievedto have about 90 nuclear warheads and enough plutonium for many more,refusesto sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the only country in the region to do so. That refusal has also made thelong desired goalof a nuclear-free Middle East impossible.And anyway, there’s always been something deeply racist about which country is or is not permitted to develop nuclear weapons. In a briefingpaper, the Nobel prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons states that “racism is ingrained in nuclear weapons history and doctrine”, and that non-western states are regarded “as ‘irrational’, ‘emotional’ and somehow ‘less capable’ of negotiating a Treaty than Western governments”. Let’s remember that the United States is the only country to use a nuclear weapon. Twice. As the briefing paperpointsout, the US “public widely supported the bombing partly due to anti-Japanese racism, depicting Japanese people in subhuman terms, in some cases fit for extermination”.Netanyahu needs his external enemies to survive his internal divisions. A day before launching this aggression on Iran, his coalition barely survived a vote to dissolve parliament. (The issue driving the vote was the compulsory military service of ultra-Orthodox men.) As war with Iran has now become a very real possibility, talks about his fragile coalition will recede. This is the same Netanyahu whopropped up Hamas for yearsto thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state. This is the same Netanyahu whobroke the ceasefirein Gaza in March of this year. This is the same Netanyahu who, in the latest negotiations about a ceasefire in Gaza, reportedlywon’t even agree to Hamas relinquishing power in Gaza, so dependent is he on creating and maintaining external enemies for his own survival.Is Donald Trump getting dragged into a war of Netanyahu’s making or is he willingly joining a partnership of aggressors? Netanyahu hassaidthe US knew about the attack in advance, but even if the US is sleepwalking its way into war, the prospect of another US-sponsored conflagration is a terrible one (and certainly won’t get Trump his much-desired Nobel peace prize). If there is one thing the people of this region do not need, it is more war, the effects of which could also reverberate terribly around Europe and the rest of the world.Where are the European leaders now? Will Keir Starmer, Emmanuel Macron, and Friedrich Merz stand up to Netanyahu and Trump? Will they use some real power to reject Netanyahu’s warmaking barbarism, based as it is on naked domination, supremacy, violence and conquest, or will we hear only vague and useless platitudes about “restraint” after the fact? Western European leaders constantly talk about how much they value peace, justice, equality and the rule of law. Now is the time to put those words into practice.Moustafa Bayoumi is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsBenjamin NetanyahuOpinionIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaIrancommentShareReuse this content"

The state departmentquickly declaredthat thedevastating overnight Israeli attack on Iran– which killedkey military commanders and nuclear scientistsas well as striking its missile capacity and a nuclear enrichment site – was unilateral. Mr Trump had reportedly urged Mr Netanyahu to hold off in a call on Monday, pending US talks with Iran over its nuclear programmedue this weekend. The suspicion is that Israel feared that a deal might be reached and wanted to strike first. But Israeli officials havebriefedthat they had a secret green light from the US, with Mr Trump only claiming to oppose it.Iran, reeling from the attack but afraid of looking too weak to retaliate, isunlikely to believethat the US did not acquiesce to the offensive, if unenthusiastically. It might suit it better to pretend otherwise – in the short term, it is not clear what ability it has to hit back at Israel, never mind taking on the US. But Mr Trump has made that hard bythreatening“even more brutal attacks” ahead, urging Iran to “make a deal, before there’s nothing left” and claiming that “we knew everything”. Whether Israel really convinced Mr Trump that this was the way to cut a deal, or he is offering a post-hoc justification after being outflanked by Mr Netanyahu, may no longer matter.Israel has become increasingly and dangerously confident of its ability to reshape the Middle East without pushing it over the brink. It believes that its previous pummellings of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran’s air defences have created a brief opportunity to destroy the existential threat posed by the Iranian nuclear programme before it is too late. Russia is not about to ride to Tehran’s rescue, and whileGulf states don’t want instability, they are not distraught to see an old rival weakened.But not least in the reckoning is surely that Mr Netanyahu, who survives politically through military action, onlynarrowly survived a Knesset votethis week. The government also faces mounting international condemnation over its war crimes in Gaza – though the US and others allow those crimes to continue. It is destroying the nation’s international reputation, yet may bolster domestic support through this campaign.The obvious question is the future of a key Iranian enrichment site deep underground at Fordo, which many believe Israel could not destroy without US “bunker busters”. If Israel believes that taking out personnel and some infrastructure is sufficient to preclude Iran’s nuclear threat, that is a huge and perilous gamble. This attack may well trigger a rush to full nuclear-armed status by Tehran – and ultimately others – and risks spurringmore desperate measuresin the meantime. Surely more likely is that Israel hopes to draw in Washington, by persuading it that Iran is a paper tiger or baiting Tehran into attacking US targets.“My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier,” Mr Trump claimed in his inaugural speech. Yet on Friday he said was not concerned about a regional war breaking out due to Israel’s strikes. Few will feel so sanguine. The current incoherence and incomprehensibility ofUS foreign policyfuels instability and risks drawing adversaries towards fateful miscalculations.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The justification given by the regime is that universities are run by leftist ideologues, who have indoctrinated students to adopt supposedly leftist ideological orientations, as well as hostility to Israel, anti-whiteness andtrans inclusivity. Donald Trump and his allies believe the election gave them the mandate to crush America’s system of higher education. But what may be less clear is that it is the mainstream media’s obsession with leftists on campus that has led to the current moment.The US mainstream media has waged a decade-long propaganda campaign against American universities, culminating in the systematic misrepresentation of last year’s campus anti-war protests. This campaign has been the normalizing force behind the Trump administration’s attack on universities, as well as a primary cause of his multiple electoral successes. Unless the media recognizes the central role it has played, we cannot expect the attack to relent.It is easy to pinpoint the time that US confidence in higher education started to drastically plummet –the year was 2015. For those of us who have followed this attack throughout the last decade, there is no surprise about this date. It was the year that a spate of political attacks against universities started to emerge, resurrecting the 1980s and 90s conservative panic about “political correctness on campus”, except this time in mainstream media outlets.In 2016, the media scholar Moira Weigel,in an article in the Guardianentitled “Political correctness: how the right invented a phantom enemy”, laid out in detail how this attack,suddenly legitimizedby mainstream media outlets, led to Trump’s 2016 victory. Weigel singles out an enormously influential piece in the Atlantic by Jonathan Haidt and Greg Lukianoff, “The coddling of the American mind”. In it, Haidt and Lukianoff decried the supposed trend of shielding students from “words, ideas, and people that might cause them emotional discomfort”. Haidt and Lukianoff’s goal was to suggest that younger generations were “coddled” and protected from emotional harm by college campuses, beginning a trend of infantilizing college students.From 2015 on, much of the mainstream media went on a crusade to vilify universities for political correctness. The Trump regime’s vicious targeting of US universities was justified and normalized by adecadeofpanickedop-edsabout leftists oncampusinthe New York Times, which includedlaying the basisfor the administration’s cynical attack on DEI (to understand thestaggeringnumber of concern-trolling op-eds about leftists on campus the New York Times has published over the last decade, consider thisarticle in Slate, by Ben Mathis-Lilly, about this exact topic; it was published in 2018.)There have always been excesses of what wascalled “political correctness” and now is called “wokeness”. During times of moral panic, excesses are held up as paradigms. One might single out attempts to de-platform speakers as one such excess. To judge by the mainstream media, there have been a wave of such attempts. The organization that counts them, the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (Fire), has recorded 1,740 attempts to de-platform speakers at colleges and universities over the last two decades or so. That sounds like a lot. However,the methodologyfor counting a “de-platforming attempt” includes petitions calling for the speaker’s invitation to be canceled or withdrawn – so if a dozen people sign a petition to revoke a speaker’s invitation, it counts as an “de-platforming attempt”, even when (as is often the case) nothing comes of it. Even in the case of successful de-platforming attempts, a speaker whose talk is postponed or who is reinvited counts as a case, as is when a venue has to be switched from one on-campus auditorium to another (say, for safety concerns). This methodology blatantly inflates the prevalence of problematic cancellations of speakers (given that de-platforming attempts count towards evaluating a university’s position on Fire’s influential “Campus Free Speech Rankings”, this methodology also distorts public conversation about the topic). Fire unquestionably does good things. But its very existence depends on fanning the flames of moral panic about universities.More generally, in manycasesof university actions that can legitimately be regarded as problematic, the fault was not “political correctness” or “wokeness”, but a corporate and legalistic environment at universities that requires the investigation of every complaint, no matter how overblown. We college professors are fairly uniformly opposed to this culture. But it is hardly the fault of leftists.Finally, no one should mistake anepidemicof faculty membersperformatively quittingtheir jobs with an epidemic of firings. When a university fires an academic for their speech, that is a crisis. When a faculty member chooses to resign rather than face student opprobrium, that is just life.It may surprise the reader to learn that during the last decade, the main “chill” at universities has not been “leftists on campus”. It has instead been a relentless attack on college professors and students by rightwing outlets. In 2016, Turning Point USA introduced its “Professor Watchlist”, targeting supposedly radical professors on campus.Campus Reformis an outlet devoted to reporting on liberal professors for their speech – for example, by student reports, social media usage or academic publications. For around a decade, Rod Dreher used his position as a senior editor at the American Conservative to target leftist academics, often todevastating effect. AndCanary Missionhas steadily and for many years targeted professors for their advocacy for the Palestinian cause. These are hardly the only, or even the most powerful, outlets involved in this long assault (I have not even mentioned Fox News). University professors are terrified of being targeted by these organizations.Major mainstream media outlets have consistently failed to report on the rightwing media assault on college professors over the last two decades. This exacerbated the effects of these attacks. In 2016, when Drehertargetedmein several posts for an offhand comment I made on a private Facebook post, I was inundated by hate mail and phone calls to my office. This was my first experience with such an attack; it deeply destabilized me. In the meantime, my colleagues assured me that Dreher was simply a worried liberal with the sorts of concerns about free speech on campus they had been reading about in the liberal media they consumed (Dreher has since moved to Budapest, Hungary, where he is a fellow at the Danube Institute, a thinktank funded by Viktor Orbán autocratic government).Finally, last year, the media committed its worst error yet, for months erasing the participation of sizable numbers of Jewish students in the protests on college campuses in support of divesting from US military support for Israel, including as movement leaders. In truth, there is a generational conflict about Israel among American Jews. As many American Jews under 40believethat Israel is committing genocide in Gaza as believe this claim to be antisemitic (about one-third). The media’s complete erasure of the large group of American Jews, especially younger American Jews, critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza, has allowed the Trump regime to conduct its dismantling of the US higher education system under the pretext of fighting antisemitism.None of this is to deny the obvious fact that college professors skew heavily Democratic. In some disciplines, there are clear reasons for this. Sociology has few Republican voters, because rightwing ideology since the 1980s has generally rejected its metaphysical presuppositions – such as theexistence and importance of societies. Women and gender studies, Middle Eastern studies, and African American studies are disciplines whose very existence is directly and regularly attacked by Republican politicians. But the fact is that the partisan tilt of universities has basically nothing to do with these departments.A study of my universityby a conservative campus group found that out of 23 professors in the chemistry department whose political affiliation could be identified, 19 were Democrats and one was a Republican. Astronomy, Earth and planetary sciences, economics, molecular biophysics and biochemistry were all departments with zero professors with Republican affiliations. According to this study, biology and biomedical sciences at Yale had 229 professors with Democratic party affiliations, and eight with Republican party affiliations. None of these are areas in which it makes sense to speak of political bias. As the “asymmetric polarization” of the Republican party has accelerated over the last decade, is it any wonder that there are fewer and fewer professors who vote for Trump’s Republican party? Why would academics vote for a party that is now bent on dismantling the US system of higher education?Unfortunately, instead of debunking the media-driven moral panic about leftists on campus, universities have largely accepted the premises of the drivers of this panic – that there is a problem on campus exemplified by the fact that few professors support Trump (“intellectual diversity”), and that protests against Israel’s actions in Gaza (with large representations of Jewish students) were antisemitic. Even universities that are challenging the Trump regime’s assault seem to accept its nonsensical premises that college students have been overly protected from controversial speech, and, simultaneously, that Jewish students must be shielded to the maximum extent of the law from criticism of Israel’s actions.In the meantime, the media has elevated some of the very academics most responsible for the moral panic, such as Steven Pinker, who hasdescribed universitiesas having a “suffocating leftwing monoculture”, intospokespersonsfor universities, and continues to trumpet the propaganda that led to this moment. For example, the New York Times columnist Thomas Edsall, who haslongpromotedthe moral panic about “wokeness” that fuels the Maga movement, stillsimply pre-supposesthat “ideological conformity and past failures to restrain antisemitism” are “vulnerabilities” of the current US higher education system.According to the agents of the moral panic, the blame for Trump’s all-out assault on the American system of higher education falls squarely on supposed “leftists on campus” whose actions supposedly undermined trust in these institutions. But the fault, instead, lies squarely with those responsible fordrivingthis moral panic. The mainstream media has delivered the Republicans a win in a multidecade long propaganda war against academia, one that began with William F Buckley in the 1950s. Within the university, powerful actors are superficially standing against the Trump regime’s attack, whileimplementing its agenda themselves(giving the lie to the absurd pre-supposition that universities are run by gender studies departments).The “war on woke” is the calling card of the global fascist right. Orbán’s attack on Central European University for “gender ideology” began his destruction of Hungarian democracy. Putin justified his full-scale invasion of Ukraine by appealing to the supposed dangers Ukraine’s liberal democracy poses for traditional gender roles. Americans should hold mainstream media’s Trump enablers responsible for Trump and his actions, and not let them pretend otherwise. As we witness the entire research apparatus of the US being taken down in the name of attacking DEI, trans rights and antisemitism, the mainstream media must halt its absurd fantasy that leftists control universities, and focus instead on the problem it has spent the last decade enabling – namely, fascism.Jason Stanley is Jacob Urowsky professor of philosophy at Yale University.

I imagine that Thursday’s events inLos Angelesmight be spoken of like this:A prominent opposition leader was attacked by regime security forces on Thursday in the presence of the national security tsar, as he voiced opposition to the federal military occupation of the US’s second-largest city following street demonstrations against the regime’s mass deportation efforts.Alex Padilla, a senator from California, was pushed against a wall,removed from the room, and then tackled to the ground and handcuffed, reportedly by Secret Service and FBI agents, at a press conference in LA byDonald Trump’s homeland security secretary,Kristi Noem. He was trying to ask a question about the deployment of marines and national guard forces to LA in his capacity as Angelenos’ elected representative. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants, was later released; Noem, speaking to reporters after the incident, said both that she knew the senator and that agents tackled and detained him because neither she nor they knew who he was. In a video of the attack, Padilla can be heard identifying himself as a senator as Noem’s security forces begin to grab and shove him.Trump’s insurrection routine: fuel violence, spawn chaos, shrug off the law | Sidney BlumenthalRead moreSeconds later, after he has been pushed out of the room, Padilla can be heard yelling to the men attacking him: “Hands off!” The video cuts out after a man steps in front of the camera to block the shot, and tells the person filming, “there is no recording allowed here, per FBI rights,” something of an odd statement to make at a press conference. Several federal court decisions have upheld the right to record law enforcement.The violence toward a sitting senator is yet another escalation of the administration’s dramatic assertions of extra-constitutional authority, and another item in their ongoing assertion of the illegitimacy of dissent, even from elected leaders. In responding with violence toward the senator’s question, Noem, her security forces and by extension theTrump administrationmore broadly, are signaling that they will treat opposition, even from elected officials, as insubordination.They do not see senators as equals to be negotiated with or spoken to in good faith, because they do not believe that any of the people’s representatives – and certainly not a Democrat – has any authority that they need to respect. Padilla, like the people of Los Angeles and the people of the United States, was not treated by theTrump administrationas a citizen, but as a subject.The attack on Padilla by security forces, and the viralvideoof him being tackled to the ground and handcuffed by armed men, has threatened to overshadow the content of Noem’s press conference, which underscored in rhetoric this same sense of absolute authority and contempt for dissent that the attack on the senator demonstrated with action.Noem was inLos Angelesto tout the administration’s military escalation against citizens there, who have taken to the streets as part of a growing protest movement against Trump’s mass deportation scheme, which has led to Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) kidnapping of many Angelenos and left families, colleagues, neighbors and friends bereft of their beloved community members.The protests have been largely peaceful – Ice and police have initiated violence against some demonstrators – but the Trump administration has taken them as an opportunity to crush dissent with force. The deployment of the California national guard – in violation of a law that requires the administration to secure cooperation from the governor – and the transfer of 700 marines to the city has marked a new willingness of the Trump administration to use military force against citizens who oppose its policies.But to the Trump administration, the Americans who have taken to the streets to voice their opposition to Trump policies are no Americans at all. “We are not going away,” Noem said of the military occupation of Los Angeles. “We are staying here to liberate the city from the socialists.” By this, she meant the Los Angeles mayor, Karen Bass, and California governor, Gavin Newsom, who are not socialists but Democrats.The term – “liberate” – evokes the US’s imperialist adventures abroad, in which such rhetoric was used to provide rhetorical cover for the toppling of foreign regimes, many of them democratically elected. The people’s elected representatives – be it Newsom or Bass or Padilla – are not figures they need to be “liberated” from. That is, not unless you consider the only legitimate “people” to be Trump supporters, and the only legitimate governance to be Republican governance.Why are people so triggered by the Mexican flag at the LA protests? | Daniel PeñaRead moreTrump, as he expands his authoritarian ambitions and uses more and more violence to pursue them, has made his own will into the sum total of “the will of the people”. All those other people – the ones marching in the streets, and trying to stop the kidnappings of their neighbors – don’t count.A few hours after Noem’s goons attacked Padilla, a federal district court judge ordered the Trump administration to relinquish control over the California national guard, agreeing with California that the guard had been illegally seized when Trump assumed control of the armed units without Newsom’s consent. “That’s the difference between a constitutional government and King George,” said district judge Charles Breyer in a hearing on the case earlier that day. “It’s not that the leader can simply say something and then it becomes it.”The judge was pointing to the constitutional order, to the rule of law, to the guarantees, once taken for granted, that the president has limits on his power. He gave the Trump administration about 18 hours to hand control of the national guard back to the state of California. It was not immediately clear whether they would comply. Hours later, an appeals courtplaced a temporary blockon Breyer’s order, returning control of the California national guard to Trump. So much for us having a “law and order” president.Moira Donegan is a Guardian US columnistExplore more on these topicsLos Angeles Ice protestsOpinionUS politicsLos AngelesUS SenateTrump administrationDonald TrumpKristi NoemcommentShareReuse this content"

The threat of fascism is backOpen letterAs in 1925, when Mussolini was in power, we must openly defy the brutal imposition of the fascist ideologyFri 13 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareOn 1 May 1925, with Benito Mussolini already in power, a group of Italian intellectuals publicly denounced his fascist regime in an open letter. The signatories – scientists, philosophers, writers and artists – took a stand in support of the essential tenets of a free society: the rule of law, personal liberty and independent thinking, culture, art and science. Their open defiance against the brutal imposition of the fascist ideology – at great personal risk – proved that opposition was not only possible, but necessary. Today, 100 years later, the threat of fascism is back – and so we must summon that courage and defy it again.Fascism emerged in Italy a century ago, marking the advent of modern dictatorship. Within a few years, it spread across Europe and the world, taking different names but maintaining similar forms. Wherever it seized power, it undermined the separation of powers in the service of autocracy, silenced opposition through violence, took control of the press, halted the advancement of women’s rights and crushed workers’ struggles for economic justice. Inevitably, it permeated and distorted all institutions devoted to scientific, academic and cultural activities. Its cult of death exalted imperial aggression and genocidal racism, triggering the second world war, the Holocaust, the death of tens of millions of people and crimes against humanity.At the same time, the resistance to fascism and the many other fascist ideologies became a fertile ground for imagining alternative ways of organising societies and international relations. The world that emerged from the second world war – with the charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the theoretical foundations of the EU and the legal arguments against colonialism – remained marked by deep inequalities. Yet, it represented a decisive attempt to establish an international legal order: an aspiration toward global democracy and peace, grounded in the protection of universal human rights, including not only civil and political, but also economic, social and cultural rights.Fascism never vanished, but for a time it was held at bay. However, in the past two decades, we have witnessed a renewed wave of far-right movements, often bearing unmistakably fascist traits: attacks on democratic norms and institutions, a reinvigorated nationalism laced with racist rhetoric, authoritarian impulses and systematic assaults on the rights of those who do not fit a manufactured traditional authority, rooted in religious, sexual and gender normativity. These movements have re-emerged across the globe, including in long-standing democracies, where widespread dissatisfaction with political failure to address mounting inequalities and social exclusion has once again been exploited by new authoritarian figures. True to the old fascist script, under the guise of an unlimited popular mandate, these figures undermine national and international rule of law, targeting the independence of the judiciary, the press, institutions of culture, higher education and science, even attempting to destroy essential data and scientific information. They fabricate “alternative facts” and invent “enemies within”; they weaponise security concerns to entrench their authority and that of the ultra-wealthy 1%, offering privileges in exchange for loyalty.This process is now accelerating, as dissent is increasingly suppressed through arbitrary detentions, threats of violence, deportations and an unrelenting campaign of disinformation and propaganda, operated with the support of traditional and social media barons – some merely complacent, others openly techno-fascist enthusiasts.Democracies are not flawless: they are vulnerable to misinformation and they are not yet sufficiently inclusive. However, democracies by their nature provide fertile ground for intellectual and cultural progress and therefore always have the potential to improve. In democratic societies, human rights and freedoms can expand, the arts flourish, scientific discoveries thrive and knowledge grow. They grant the freedom to challenge ideas and question power structures, propose new theories even when culturally uncomfortable, which is essential to human advancement. Democratic institutions offer the best framework for addressing social injustices, and the best hope to fulfil the post-war promises of the rights to work, education, health, social security, participation in cultural and scientific life, and the collective right of peoples to development, self-determination and peace. Without this, humanity faces stagnation, growing inequality, injustice and catastrophe, not least from the existential threat caused by the climate emergency that the new fascist wave negates.In our hyper-connected world, democracy cannot exist in isolation. As national democracies require strong institutions, international cooperation relies on the effective implementation of democratic principles and multilateralism to regulate relations among nations, and on multistakeholder processes to engage a healthy society. The rule of law must extend beyond borders, ensuring that international treaties, human rights conventions and peace agreements are respected. While existing global governance and international institutions require improvement, their erosion in favor of a world governed by raw power, transactional logic and military might is a regression to an era of colonialism, suffering and destruction.As in 1925, we scientists, philosophers, writers, artists and citizens of the world have a responsibility to denounce and resist the resurgence of fascism in all its forms. We call on all those who value democracy to act:Defend democratic, cultural and educational institutions. Call out abuses of democratic principles and human rights. Refuse pre-emptive compliance.Join collective actions, locally and internationally. Boycott and strike when possible. Make resistance impossible to ignore and costly to repress.Uphold facts and evidence. Foster critical thinking and engage with your communities on these grounds.This is an ongoing struggle. Let our voices, our work and our principles be a bulwark against authoritarianism. Let this message be a renewed declaration of defiance.Nobel laureates: Eric Maskin, Roger B Myerson, Alvin E Roth, Lars Peter Hansen, Oliver Hart, Daron Acemoglu, Wolfgang Ketterle, John C Mather, Brian P Schmidt, Michel Mayor, Takaaki Kajita, Giorgio Parisi, Pierre Agostini, Joachim Frank, Richard J Roberts, Leland Hartwell, Paul Nurse, Jack W Szostak, Edvard I Moser, May-Britt Moser, Harvey James Alter, Victor Ambros, Gary Ruvkun, Barry James Marshall, Craig Mello, Charles RiceLeading scholars on fascism and democracy: Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Timothy Snyder, Jason Stanley, Claudia Koonz, Mia Fuller, Giovanni De Luna and Andrea MammoneThe full list of signatories can be foundhereExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinioncommentShareReuse this content"

Like me, you will be so embarrassed for Earth’s primo edgelord that he feels pressed into doing something so excruciatingly conventional. This is worse than when Kate Moss wasscapegoated into rehab.Imagine owning the world’s premier shitposting platform – in fact, havingspent $44bn(£32bn) on it, specifically so that your magic mirror would tell you each day that you were the fairest shitposter of all – and then shuffling sheepishly on to your own pixels to mumble something about having gone “too far” with your hurty words. Buck up, sadsack – honestly.We’ll come in a minute to how this hilariously preposterous spectacle should surely mark the absurdist endpoint of humankind’s intensely brief, intensely passionate, and intensely destructive relationship with social media. But first, a recap. Elon’s apology, of course, related to last week’sspectacular online beefthat he’d started with US president Donald Trump over the latter’s OBBB. (Sounds like a specialist Pornhub search term; actually stands for One Big Beautiful Bill.) Amusingly, the two men were not able to directly confront each other, each feeling that they could only engage on their own platforms – X in Musk’s case, Truth Social in Trump’s. Going forward, we surely need some proxy platforms these two superpowers can fight on, like the proxy war countries of the cold war. Maybe Threads and Bluesky could play the role of Vietnam and Nicaragua?So long, Elon: the cuts didn’t go to plan, but you completely shredded your reputation | Marina HydeRead moreAfter all, I’m sure these two will do battle – covert or otherwise – once more. The path to war had been set the second they became buddies, despite the Maga crowd’s comic refusal to see the inevitable. It was only a few months ago that Fox News bobblehead Sean Hannity did afawning joint chat with the pair, telling them and his viewers: “I feel like I’m interviewing two brothers here.” Yep. Caned and unstAbel. (Completely unrelated, but in 2019,polling foundthat 13% of Americans still believe that men are “better suited emotionally for politics than most women”. Could the poll be rerun in light of new information?) And it was only a few months earlier that Musk wasexplaining to a rally crowd: “I’m not just Maga, I’m dark gothic Maga.” Mm-hm.Anyway, in this battle, Elon ended up getting resoundingly beaten by the final boss of posting. As we know from the fact that Musk turned up to his first day at Twittercarrying a sinkand honking “let that sink in”, this is a guy who just loves a crashingly literal joke. So it’s a shame the president was too busy playing golf to turn up at Elon’s Texas babymother compound with some latex buttocks, an elated wink to camera, and the words: “I handed him his ass!” Maybe next time.This week was all about the apology, which should be a defining moment in man’s – and woman’s – understanding of precisely the pitfalls of being extremely online. It’s extraordinary to think that social media didn’t meaningfully exist 20 years ago, but has – in that very short span – now hurtled toward the spectacle of the world’s richest man functioning as a warning about what can happen to anyone if they spend way too much time on it. The man who literally owns X has been hoist by his own platform. Guys, no one is safe! How much more wake-up do we want our calls to be?For a long while back there, it was fashionable to refer to the particular disorder engendered by excessive Twitter use as brainworms.Elon Muskis surely riddled with them. Intriguingly, despite essentially running the free world from the platform during his first term in office, Trump himself has remained weirdly resistant to the brainworms. If anything, his particular arrangement reminds one of that old Private Eye headline when Rupert Murdoch had some prostate bother a few decades ago: “Cancer has Murdoch”. And so with Trump and the brainworms. Brainworms have Trump. Maybe Trump IS the brainworms?Sadly for Musk, he didn’t have the same mysteriously resistant gene. He loved Twitter so much he bought the company – for a price that was the sort of joke someone might make on Twitter – and it actually seemed to get him what he wanted for a time: a president who was buddies with him, a more-than-fair wind for all his government contracts, and every one of his posts liked by bazillions of followers who absolutely weren’t mostly bots. It might have lost money in and of itself, but seemed like a super-successful and lucrative political project when considered in the round, given his other business interests.But this is what spending too much time on social media does to you! It makes you feel like you’re being productive, and important, and “not complicit” in whatever you’ve just farted out a couple of hundred characters on. But – and spoiler alert for anyone still unaware of the import of watching Musk deliver his equivalent of the Notes app apology meme –this is all an illusion. Spending lots of time and energy on social media platforms simply means you work for the guys who own them. For free.Whether this week’s cautionary tale starring one of those very guys will shake humanity out of its potentially fatal attention spiral is, regrettably, doubtful in the extreme. But after watching Musk act like someone tearfully trying to de-cancel themself, no one can say the message of the spectacle was anything less than sledgehammer: delete your account, sir.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationSocial mediaUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

But the media are barely paying attentionFri 13 Jun 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 11.40 EDTShareWhen hundreds of thousands of Americans gathered across the US on 5 April for the“Hands Off” eventsprotesting Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s governmental wrecking ball, much of the news media seemed to yawn.The next day, the New York Times put a photograph, but no story, on its print front page. The Wall Street Journal’s digital homepage had it as only the 20th-most-prominent story when I checked. Fox News was dismissive; I stopped counting after I scanned 40 articles on its homepage, though there was a video with this dismissive headline: “Liberals rally against President Trump.”The Guardian, CNN and some local news outlets paid more heed. The cable network offered live video from many American cities and a banner headline: “Millions of people protest against Trump & Musk.”But overall, there was something of a shrug about the media coverage. It got much more attention from global news outlets than in the US.The US media will get a chance to atone for these sins of omission this coming weekend when Americans once again get together, this time for Saturday’s “No Kings” day, which organizers describe as “a nationwide day of defiance”.“From city blocks to small towns, from courthouse steps to community parks, we’re taking action to reject authoritarianism,” they say. More than 100 pro-democracy groups are involved, according toAxios.It’s expected to be the largest anti-Trump protest since the start of his second term, according to organizers who are planning rallies in 1,500 cities in all 50 states. It’s happening, in part, as a reaction to the military parade in Washington DC that Trump has planned on his 79th birthday and the US army’s 250th anniversary.Of course, the citizen protests in Los Angeles against federal Ice agentshavereceived a great deal of attention, although the media focus has largely been on the conflict between law enforcement and protesters. Those protests, and the deep concern over the Trump administration’s action, with its authoritarian overtones, are likely to bring even more people out to rallies across the country on Saturday.I don’t know how many people will show up, but I do believe it matters.And I have good reason to think so.A study from a Harvard University political scientist presents a statistic worth remembering: that, around the world,once 3.5%of the population became engaged in sustained and non-violent campaigns of resistance, change has always happened.Erica Chenoweth, the academic researcher who conducted the study, was surprised by what her team found.“I was really motivated by some skepticism that non-violent resistance could be an effective method for achieving major transformations in society,” Chenowethsaidin a 2019 BBC interview.But her skepticism was overcome as the study turned up clear results. As one example of many she cites: in 1986, the Marcos regime folded after the fourth day of millions of Filipino citizens taking the streets of Manila.Non-violent protests, she found, are much more effective – and bring about more lasting change – than armed conflict.In the US, that 3.5% of the adult population is roughly 9 million people – about the population of New York City. That’s a high bar, many more people than showed up on 5 April.The encouraging thing is that real change is possible.However, if journalists consistently look the other way, the power of peaceful citizen protests can fade.In myAmerican Crisis newslettertwo days after the 5 April protests, I offered a few theories for why the media may seem so blasé.Trump’s war on Harvard was decades in the making. This letter proves it | Bernard HarcourtRead moreFirst, I posited, much of the mainstream media tend to view this much as Fox News does. The protesters are just the usual suspects – “liberals” – doing the predictable thing.Second, many large media companies are afraid that prominent protest coverage will be criticized by the political right as partisan, and they can’t bear that label.Third, corporate media decision-makers, always focused the bottom line, are fearful of losing right-leaning readers and viewers; yes, we’ll cover this, they seem to say, butquietly, since we don’t want to antagonize anyone. In an era in which Trump has attempted to bully the press into submission, through denying access and throughlawsuits, cowardice and capitulation are all too common.In the end, it’s up to the American people. Do enough of them care enough about democracy, decency and the rule of law to leave their easy chairs, barbecues and sports-gambling apps to get out in the streets and make their voices heard?If the protests grow large enough, and sustained enough, even the most reluctant media will have little choice but to pay attention.Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationOpinionProtestActivismDonald TrumpUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

In every case, whether he inflates himself into the strongman putting down an insurrection or acts as the instigator-in-chief, his routine has been to foster violence, spawn chaos and show contempt for the law.In his first term, Trumpreportedly askedthe chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Mark Milley, “Can’t you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?” Trump was agitated about protesters in Lafayette Park, across from the White House, after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. On 1 June, Trump ordered the US Park police to clear the park. Some charged on horses into the crowd. Trump emerged after the teargas wafted away to walk through the park, ordering Milley to accompany him, and stood in front of St John’s church on the other side to display a Bible upside down.The Guardian view on Trump and deportation protests: the king of confected emergencies | EditorialRead moreMilley felt he had been badly used and exercised poor judgment in marching with Trump. “I should not have been there,” he said. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.” A day later, the secretary of defense, Mark Esper, held a news conference to oppose publicly the use of the military for law enforcement and any invocation of the Insurrection Act. Trump was furious with Milley and Esper. He was determined to have a pliable military, generals and a secretary of defense to do his bidding, whatever it might be.Then, Trump staged an insurrection in a vain last attempt to prevent the ballots of the electoral college from being counted that would make Joe Biden the elected president. While Trump’s mob on 6 January chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!” the vice-president hunkered down in the basement garage of the besieged Capitol, where hemade the call for the national guardthat Trump refused to give as he gleefully watched for hours on TV the followers he had organized and incited batter police and threaten the lives of members of the Congress.On the day of his inauguration to his second term, Trumpgranted clemencyto nearly 1,600 insurrectionists convicted or charged in the 6 January attack. At least 600 were charged with assaulting or obstructing the police, at least 170 were charged with using a deadly weapon, and about 150 were charged with theft or destruction of government property. Trumpgranted commutations to 14 membersof extremist militia groups convicted of or charged with seditious conspiracy to overthrow the US government.Now, Trump is toying with invoking the Insurrection Act to put down a supposed rebellion inLos Angeles. But his application of the act would be a belated attempt to cover his unlawful nationalization of the California national guard and deployment of marines to Los Angeles in response to a conflict that his administration has itself provoked.In late May, Stephen Miller, Trump’s fanatical deputy chief of staff in charge of his immigration policy, called a meeting of leaders of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) to berate them for failing to pile up the statistics he demanded of deported immigrants. Restraint and the law were to be cast aside in their new wave of raids, which hit a flashpoint in LA.“Federal agents make warrantless arrests,” reported theWall Street Journal. “Masked agents take people into custody without identifying themselves. Plainclothes agents in at least a dozen cities have arrested migrants who showed up to their court hearings. And across the US, people suspected of being in the country illegally are disappearing into the federal detention system without notice to families or lawyers, according to attorneys, witnesses and officials.”Miller ordered Ice agents to target Home Depot, where construction workers, many of them immigrants, go to purchase materials. On 6 June, masked Ice agents swooped down on a store in LA,arresting more than 40 people. Meanwhile, Ice agents raided a garment factory of a company called Ambience Apparel andplaced at least a dozen people in vans.Soon, there was a demonstration at the downtown federal building where they were detained. Several Waymo robotaxis were burned within a four-block area near the relatively sparsely populated downtown. But the LAPD appeared to have the situation quickly under control, until Trump unilaterally federalized the national guard, whose presence prompted further demonstrations. One contingent of soldiers was sent to guard the federal building miles away in Westwood, an upscale neighborhood by the UCLA campus, where they were nuisances to people going shopping and to restaurants. Trump declared he would send in 700 marines.On 10 June, the California attorney general, Rob Bonta, filed acomplainton behalf of the state seeking a restraining order in federal court against Trump and the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth. “To put it bluntly,” it stated, “there is no invasion or rebellion in Los Angeles; there is civil unrest that is no different from episodes that regularly occur in communities throughout the country, and that is capable of being contained by state and local authorities working together.”“All of this was unlawful,” wrote Bonta of the administration’s actions. Trump’s use of the guard was in violation of the law that requires an order to be issued through the governor. Trump’s deployment of marines was “likewise unlawful”, in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the use of the US armed forces for civilian law enforcement. “These unlawful deployments have already proven to be a deeply inflammatory and unnecessary provocation, anathema to our laws limiting the use federal forces for law enforcement, rather than a means of restoring calm.”Ironically, the Posse Comitatus Act was instrumental in the demise of Reconstruction. US troops stationed in the south after the civil war were forbidden from enforcing the law to protect Black civil rights. The Ku Klux Klan and other white terrorist organizations seized control of state governments, disenfranchised Black people and imposed Jim Crow segregation. In 1957, Dwight Eisenhower, then president, circumvented the Posse Comitatus Act by invoking the Insurrection Act; he used federal forces to implement the supreme court’s desegregation ruling in Brown v Board of Education to integrate Little Rock Central high school.As a further irony,Trump had been indictedby the special prosecutor Jack Smith under the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 for his actions leading to the January 6 insurrection. Count four read: “From on or about November 14, 2020, through on or about January 20, 2021, in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, the Defendant, DONALD J. TRUMP, did knowingly combine, conspire, confederate, and agree with co-conspirators, known and unknown to the Grand Jury, to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right and privilege secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States – that is, the right to vote, and to have one’s vote counted.”Trump evaded justice through a series of delaying actions by the conservative majority of the supreme court that culminated in its ruling for “absolute” presidential immunity for “official acts”. He was allowed to run out the clock and never held to account. If Trump’s trial had proceeded on the original charges as scheduled on 6 March 2024, he would have undoubtedly found guilty and eliminated as a presidential candidate.On 10 June, Trump appeared before soldiers at Fort Liberty in North Carolina in anticipation of the Washington military parade he ordered for 14 June, opportunistically using the 250th anniversary of the US army (really the continental army) to celebrate his 79th birthday, “a big day,” he said. “We want to show off a bit.”Soldiers of the 82nd airborne division were screened for attendance at Trump’s rally based on their political support and physical appearance. “If soldiers have political views that are in opposition to the current administration and they don’t want to be in the audience then they need to speak with their leadership and get swapped out,” read a note sent by the command, according toMilitary.com. “No fat soldiers,” said one message.A pop-up store for365 Campaignof Tulsa, Oklahoma, which sells Trump merchandise, was set up on the base for the Trump visit. Aside from the usual Maga gear, it sells T-shirts reading: “When I Die Don’t Let Me Vote Democrat”, “I’m Voting for the Convicted Felon”, and afalse credit card that reads, “White Privilege Card: Trumps Everything”. Send in the marines, but first send them to the Maga merch store.In violation of longstanding military policy on discipline, the selected troops cheered Trump’s sneers and jeers. He announced he had renamed the fort to Fort Bragg, in honor of Braxton Bragg, a Confederate general and large slaveowner notable for his defeats and bad temper and disliked by his officers. “Can you believe they changed that name in the last administration for a little bit?” he said.He told the troops that they were to fight a war within the US against “a foreign enemy”, “defending our republic itself”, in California, where there was “a full-blown assault on peace, on public order and on national sovereignty carried out by rioters bearing foreign flags with the aim of continuing a foreign invasion of our country”.Trump spontaneously invented a conspiracy theory on the spot. “The best money can buy, somebody is financing it,” he claimed, “and we’re going to find out through Pam Bondi and Department of Justice, who it is.”He complained to the soldiers that the election of 2020 was “rigged and stolen”. Then, he swiveled to talk about George Washington: “Has anybody heard of him?” Then, he attacked Biden, “never the sharpest bulb”, or perhaps the brightest knife. Twice, Trump said he would “liberate” Los Angeles, and promised that after that the Republican Congress would pass his “big, beautiful bill”, his budget stalled in the Senate. “They call it one big, beautiful bill. So, that’s good and that’s what it is.” And then he rambled about the JD Vance-Tim Walz vice-presidential debate, and how some “ladies”, “beautiful, wonderful women”, followed him to “138 rallies”, and on. Along the way, he praised his new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, General Daniel Caine, who Trump insists on calling “Razin Caine”.The next day, 11 June, Caine appeared before the Senate appropriations committee, and was questioned by Hawaii’s Democratic senator Brian Schatz whether the events in LA show the US is “being invaded by a foreign nation”. “At this point in time,” replied the general, “I don’t see any foreign, state-sponsored folks invading.”As Caine was testifying, the Department of Homeland Security posted a cartoon of Uncle Sam hammering up a sign: “Help Your Country … And Yourself …” Then, in capital letters: “REPORT ALL FOREIGN INVADERS.” Which was followed by the telephone number for Ice.Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, has published three books of a projected five-volume political life of Abraham Lincoln:A Self-Made Man,Wrestling With His AngelandAll the Powers of Earth.

But don’t expect the regime to back downFri 13 Jun 2025 12.06 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 13.59 EDTShareThis is a war 30 years in the making.Benjamin Netanyahuwas talking about the threat of an Iranian nuclear bomb back in the 1990s and he has scarcely let up since. For decades he has believed that a nuclear Iran would represent the one truly existential threat to Israel and that military force is the only sure way to prevent it. Several times during the many years in which Netanyahu has sat in the prime minister’s chair, an all-out strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities has been weighed up, debated and planned for. In the early hours of this morning, it finally happened.Netanyahu will be pleased with the early results, including theelimination of key Iranian military commanders and nuclear scientists. But the ultimate consequences could look very different. By his actions, he may only have accelerated the very danger he has feared for so long.It’s not hard to see why Israel’s PM struck and struck now. The motive remains the same as it ever was, with Netanyahu’s statement overnight invoking the darkest chapter in Jewish history to insist thatIsraelwould never allow itself to be vulnerable to a “nuclear holocaust”. But the timing was down, in part, to the fact that the Iranian regime is in a state of strategic weakness.Its power in the region long rested on the allies and proxies it could call on, forming a “ring of fire” around the Israeli enemy: the Assad regime in Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthis in Yemen, to say nothing of pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. Now Assad is gone and Syria’s new leader, embraced by Donald Trump, is looking to Washington rather than Tehran. As for the three Hs, the Houthis have reached anagreement with the US; Hezbollah is leaderless and still reeling fromlast year’s Israeli onslaught, leaving the Iraqi militias who once co-ordinated with it weakened in turn; and Hamas has seen Israel wipe out its leadership and all but destroy Gaza. More directly, Israel’s response to Iran’s missile and drone strikes on the country in April and October of 2024 left Iran’s air defence system crippled. If the best time to kick a man is when he’s down, now, concluded Israel’s war planners, was the time to move.As for this specific moment, there was a helpful bit of context, if not exactly a pretext, provided by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). On Thursday the nuclear watchdog found Iran inviolation of its non-proliferation obligationsfor the first time in almost 20 years.And, as always with Netanyahu, domestic politics played a part: on Wednesday he warded off a threat to his coalition by warning one unhappy smaller party that the Iranian threat meant thatnow was not the timefor a dissolution and early elections.What may have loomed especially large in Netanyahu’s calculations was the meeting scheduled for Sunday in Oman between Trump’s personal envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his Iranian counterpart, their sixth such encounter. Did the Israeli PM fear a breakthrough in those talks that would have seen Trump agree a deal much like the one signed by the Obama administration a decade ago, an arrangement that would have allowed Iran to keep enriching uranium in a way acceptable to the US but unacceptable to Israel? Netanyahumanaged to persuade Trumpin 2018 to break from the Obama-era agreement, helped by the fact Trump likes nothing more thanto dismantle the legacy of a predecessor. But a revived deal with Trump’s signature on it? That had to be prevented by whatever means necessary.On this reading, Netanyahu has just defied the will of his biggest patron, the US, and done it brazenly. Supporting that view is the pointed statement by the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, that Israel’s action was“unilateral”and that “We are not involved in strikes against Iran.” That would certainly fit with Trump’s own words just a few hours before Israel’s assault had begun. “I’d love to avoid a conflict,” the president said, explaining that the US and Iran were “fairly close” to making a deal. “As long as I think there is an agreement I don’t want [the Israelis] going in because I think that would blow it.”And yet, look at what Trump said next. “It might help it actually,” he mused, hinting that an Israeli attack could concentrate the Iranians’ minds in negotiations, nudging them towards saying yes rather than no. And note how Trump has reacted to the Israeli assault once it got under way.“I think it’s been excellent,”he told ABC News on Friday morning. “We gave [the Iranians] a chance and they didn’t take it. They got hit hard, very hard … And there’s more to come. A lot more.”Perhaps that’s all front, Trump preferring to save face – and claim credit – than to admit Israel defied his wishes. But we know how Trump talks when he thinks he’s been disrespected. And so far there’s been no sign of that. Coupled with Trump’s promise to defend Israel from Iranian retaliation, it adds to the possibility that the Oman talks may even have been a pre-agreed ruse to hoodwink Tehran, that theUS is no mere observer of this war and that it could get drawn further into it.Which brings us to the question that matters more than either the motive or timing of this Israeli action: is it wise? Some will look at the region and think Israel has miscalculated, that some of the Arab states which quietly came to its aid against Iran a year ago will be reluctant to do that now. That may be to mistake public anger for private satisfaction. As the Economist’s Middle East correspondentputs it, “plenty of people in the Middle East are happy to see Iran hit … Lebanese, Syrians, Yemenis who suffered for years because of the Islamic republic are glad to see it bloodied.”Others will note that the attack may have been spectacular, especially in its elimination of several key individuals, but that, if its ultimate aim is the prevention of an Iranian bomb, it is still bound to fail. The IAEAg has confirmed that the Natanz site was hit, but analysts explain that the business end of that installation is so deep in the ground, it is beyond the reach of conventional Israeli firepower. The same goes for the site atFordow, concealed inside a mountain. It would require US “bunker-buster” bombs to hit those, and even they might not be able to do it.But there is a less concrete reason why Operation Rising Lion might ultimately prove futile. Surely Iran’s hardliners will now become more, not less, determined to acquire a nuclear weapon. They will have learned what might be called the North Korea lesson. After the Iraq war, Libya opted to abandon its nuclear programme. Not many years later, the Libyan dictator, Muammar Gaddafi, was dead in a ditch. Ukraine too gave up its nuclear bombs, only to be invaded by its neighbour.Meanwhile, the dictator dynasty in Pyongyang made the opposite move: they held on to their nukes, and no one has ever laid a finger on them.That logic is bleak but compelling and seems to be hardening in Tehran. Witness today’sstatement from the Iranian governmentthat “The world now better understands Iran’s insistence on the right to enrichment, nuclear technology and missile power.” That sounds like doubling down.Even if the Iranians are somehow thwarted, the lesson will not be lost on the neighbourhood. Saudi Arabia and Turkey will not want to place themselves in Israel’s crosshairs by pursuing a nuclear programme, but nor will they want to be Libya or Ukraine. Despite the risks, they might conclude that it’s better to be North Korea. A nuclear weapon will only become more desirable. And a tinderbox region that is already the most unstable in the world will become more dangerous still.So yes, Netanyahu can look forward to fighting the next Israeli election as the man who humbled Israel’s archenemy. It will play well. But with this move he may well have brought the nightmare prospect of a nuclear Middle East one step closer. That’s a peril for his country – and the world.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It received not a mention in the spending review. In among the hospitals and schools, the highways and the prisons, the great beast wandered, a ghostly presence cursing all from whom it stole.I found it in a Whitehall handout, sandwiched somewhere between Leeds station and a Welsh level crossing. The transport department did not even include it in its railway plans for the parliament. It was relegated, as if an extinct species, to just one short sentence. It said it would spend£25.3bn “to address longstanding delivery challenges”for HS2. Is it a train or not a train?This means that over the remainder of this parliament, Rachel Reeves’s Treasury intends for HS2 to consume between a fifth and a quarter of the government’sentire investment budget of £113bn. Yet this staggering fact was not so much as murmured in the Commons or in any subsequent media comment.There was certainly no mention of the project’s constantlysoaring coston completion in the mid-2030s. According to the lastpublic accounts committee report, even the slimmed down railway has raced to more than £80bn and is usually said to be approaching £100bn. Reeves’s extravagant nuclear reactors will cost farless than thatand she was happy to boast of them.Because few can easily distinguish billions from millions, let us look at the comparisons. Reeves now wants to build a railway from Birmingham to Euston at a price that is more than doublethe £39bn that she wants to spendover the same decade, 2025-2035, on social housing. Over the course of this parliament, the £25.3bn extra that Reeves will spend on HS2 is significantly more than the outlay on prisons and new classrooms.So by the next election,HS2will have received £25.3bn, while two east-west railways, in the Midlands and the north, will have received £6bn between them and poor Wales just £300m. These projects got a mention, but why not HS2? Is it perhaps because Reeves is ashamed? She knows that HS2 will principally benefit commuters into London. London always wins the vanity projects.At first HS2 was built to be high-speed – requiring wide tunnels and pathways – and then reduced in speed but not in cost. Then it was said to be about capacity not speed, but this did not appear to lessen the cost. Then it was cut from 11 platforms to seven at Euston. This was a really stupid train.The project soon lost any serious supporters outside railway addicts and political cheerleaders. In 2021, after Rishi Sunak as chancellorcancelled the Leeds extension, the government’s infrastructure projects authority gave HS2 a“red rating”, which bluntly meant “delivery of the project appears unachievable”. The Commons public account committee said that “value for money was at risk”. Then in 2023, Sunak as prime ministercancelled the second northern leg, to Manchester. This stripped the project of all “levelling up” value.The most hair-raising Common minutes I know are those of thepublic account committee’s inquiryinto HS2 last December. They read like a banana republic at work. The company’s umpteenth chief executive, Mark Wild, was just 17 days into his job, presumably on something likehis predecessor’s £650,000. Forty-three HS2 staff were identified asearning more than £150,000a year. Meanwhile, whistleblowers alleged that costs forecasts were being manipulated to secure funding. One of them was last weekpaid more than £300,000compensation after being excluded from two roles as a result of his whistleblowing.The PAC chair, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown,said that HS2is “a cautionary tale ... in how not to run a major project” and that Department for Transport mismanagement is “likely to have wasted billions of pounds of taxpayers money in delay and overspends.” Yet with 33,000 staff employed and 2,000 sub-contractors and consultants having already worked their way through tens of billions at current prices, HS2 clearly knew how to relieve the taxpayers of cash. It tried to claim that, unlike schools or hospitals, it was due its money “under contract”. The PAC caved in. It merely suggested the HS2 team perform a “reset”. This week the reset took the predictable form of a demand for more money. The Treasury caved in too.The final fiasco surrounds the funding of HS2’s destination. This is planned to be Old Oak Common in Acton, due to be completed between 2029 and 2033. The supposed extension to Euston is now not envisageduntil 2038, which in public investment is close to never. Work at Euston has stopped, leaving a reported400 families evictedfrom their homes and 25 hectares of dirt. This is in Starmer’s constituency.Sunak said Euston would one day be rebuilt “by the private sector”, possibly implying a Canary Wharf style cluster of skyscrapers overlooking Regent’s Park. Even that outrage would not realise the necessary£6bn – if not £10bn. The new Euston would merely send a handful of trains an hour to a less convenient Birmingham station than the old one. With rail travel still not back at pre-pandemic levels, Euston needs not another train but a politician with guts.The whole of Whitehall now knows HS2 makes no sense. At times like this, parliament is hopeless. Most MPs, at some time in the past, voted for its various mistakes and hate changing their minds. HS2 is the Iraq war of Treasury spending. Starmer should surely know that, on the day he took office, he should have done what Chris Christie of New Jersey did. The governor simply told the contractors of two massive Hudson River tunnels topack up and go home.Starmer could still kill it, recouping some billions from selling HS2 land. At the same time, Reeves could have gone wild. She could have doubled the number of projects she listed this week. Hospitals could have soared in number, schools multiplied, prisons renewed. I cannot believe Reeves really thinks Britain needs them less than it needs a new railway to Birmingham. As it was, she flunked it. She took a weak decision, and could not even bring herself to mention it.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsHS2OpinionRail transportSpending review 2025TransportcommentShareReuse this content"

So why does the industry still hold governments to ransom?Fri 13 Jun 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 12.44 EDTShareIhave been saying this a lot recently: “At last!” At last, a mainstream film bluntly revealing the plunder of our seas. At last, a proposed ban on bottom trawling in so-called “marine protected areas” (MPAs). At last, some solid research on seabed carbon and the vast releases caused by the trawlers ploughing it up. But still I feel that almost everyone is missing the point.David Attenborough’sOceanfilm, made for National Geographic, is the one I’ve been waiting for all my working life. An epoch ago, when I worked in the BBC’s Natural History Unit in the mid-1980s, some of us lobbied repeatedly for films like this, without success. Since then, even programmes that purport to discuss marine destruction have carefully avoided the principal cause: the fishing industry. The BBC’sBlue Planet IIandBlue Planet Liveseries exemplified the organisation’s perennial failure of courage.You can see the results in public beliefs. While assessments have long shown that the primary reason for thedestruction of marine lifeis overfishing, in a poll last year, people in the UKplaced it fourth. Eating our fish dinners while shaking our heads at the state of the oceans, we have been systematically misled by those whose job is to inform us.Maybe Ocean will change that. The great public enthusiasm for the film shows, yet again, thatthe mantra endlessly recitedby broadcasters – environmental issues turn away viewers – is false. You just have to do it, as this film does, powerfully and well.Thegovernment’s announcementthat trawling and scallop dredging will be banned from half of England’s MPAs is welcome. But this should be seen as the very least it could do. Conservationists have beencalling for yearsfor these protected areas to be, well, protected from the major cause of destruction. While heralded as a great step forward, the new policy is actually a step back from the Tory position:the Conservatives planned“to protect all 54 English offshore MPAs from fishing activity by the end of 2024”.It also falls far short ofthe call last weekby the House of Commons environmental audit committee for full protection of MPAs, and the achievement of “good environmental status” for our seas. The statutory deadline for reaching this status was 2020, but we are still nowhere near. Nor does the new policy take us anywhere close to the promise of “30x30”: the protection of 30% of our land and sea by 2030. How will the government close this gap?Labour keeps slicing and dicing the problem. The new measures are intended to protect particular seabed features and particular species. But the fishing industry trashes everything. A government spokesperson told me “a full ban across MPAs is not needed as some MPAs are designated solely for highly mobile species such as birds”. But what about mobile species such as fish? In fact, almost all marine animals, at some point in their life cycles, are highly mobile.The spokesperson said protection was needed only where particular features occurred. Why might large areas of seabed possess no valuable features? Because they have been ploughed out by trawlers. Much of the bed of the North Sea, for example, wasonce covered with a biotic crustof oysters and beautiful sessile animals. Now it’s mostly bare mud, sand and gravel, and deemed unworthy of protection. But if boats stopped ploughing it, the crust would recover. Good environmental status requires very large areas closed to destructive fishing techniques, regardless of what currently survives there.Some of us had long speculated that trawling and dredging must release large amounts of carbon from the seabed. But data on the issue was remarkably slow in coming. Now, at last,solid researchhas begun, and we find that it is indeed a major problem, adding even more to the costs that the fishing industry imposes on society and the living planet.But in almost all public discussion of these issues, including Ocean, I feel the problem has been framed the wrong way round. Nearly everyone seems to agree that we should carve out some areas of sea from the fishing industry and other destructive forces. The implication is that the default state of the seas is exploitation, from which we should make exceptions.But as the marine campaigner Deborah Rowan Wrighthas long argued, it makes more sense to reverse this presumption. The default position should be protection, from which we might exclude some places (the least fragile) where some fishing activities (the least damaging) are permitted. Such residual fishing should be concentrated in the hands of local coastal communities, rather thancaptured by the huge industrial combinesthat, as Ocean showed, are snatching food from the people who need it most.This would cause the mother of all “spillover effects”. Spillover is what happens when fish and shellfish are allowed to breed and grow undisturbed in protected places: in many cases, as their offspring spread into surrounding waters, total fish catches increase, even though the area in which fishing is permitted has shrunk. If killing were allowed in only a minority of places, far less fishing effort would be required to catch more and bigger fish.Even then, we should remember that fish are wildlife, not “seafood”. They are not put on Earth for our consumption. They do not exist in “stocks”, but in populations and ecosystems. There is no such thing as “underexploited” or “underfished”, though these terms have long featured in the lexicon of official bodies and compliant scientists.The extraordinary thing isjust how tinythis industry is, yet it seems to hold the world’s governments to ransom. Last month, the British government announced that it was giving£360m to the fishing industry“to drive growth and boost the sector”. Why? The government’s own figures show that fishing costs us far more than it makes: it estimates that the proposed ban on trawling in half of England’s MPAs willcost UK businesses and public bodies £7.8m, while delivering “benefits from enhanced environmental protection” of approximately £3.1bn. Why the hell should public money, withheld from public services in desperate need, be spent on fishing, the most destructive of all private industries?I’ve watched for 40 years as governments, protected by timid broadcasters, have wasted every opportunity to prevent ecological collapse. As they assemble in France forthe UN Ocean Conference, they should pledge not to waste another day.George Monbiot is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsFishingOpinionOceansEnglandMarine lifeConservationWildlifeAnimalscommentShareReuse this content"

We avoided electing an outright Trump sympathiser, but we still elected a prime minister who will align our policies with the United States. Despite all the anti-Trump rhetoric and celebration of the idea thatCanadawas independent and had no desire to be like the US, we are now passing Maga-inspired legislation.The newly electedMark Carneygovernment tabled a border bill that will give law enforcement sweeping powers in obtaining citizen’s data, and will align Canada with the US’s refugee policies. Bill C-2, or the Strong Borders Act, is presented as a border security bill. However, its reach extends beyond border applications to nearly all legislation.In alignment with the attack on immigrant communities in the US, this bill is anti-immigrant, and in particular anti-refugee. The legislation changes the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act to grant the minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship extensive powers to cancel immigration documents, and to suspend or cancel intake in any immigration stream if a high number of applications are pending.This isn’t streamlining the immigration system; this is mass deportation by administrative means, rather than law enforcement. In addition, there is no appeal process for these measures. A significant number of refugees will not be granted a hearing since the legislation “proposes to prevent claims from even reaching the Immigration and Refugee Board”, according to theOntario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants. TheMigrant Rights Networkcalls the changes an infringement on the right to due process, “including revoking permanent residency applications already submitted”.Other elements of US-style refugee policy in the Canadian border bill actually make the US look more welcoming.As explainedby the Canadian Council for Refugees, the bill introduces stricter rules than the US on how soon a refugee claim must be made.The changes will disproportionately affect women and girls, whose immigration status is largely tied to their husbands and fathers, respectively; racialised claimants, as most refugees who claim asylum through alternative points of entry are racialised; and LGBTQ claimants, who risk higher incidences of assault and discrimination in their home countries.The other frightening half of the legislation upends privacy laws through enhanced powers for law enforcement. It will amend Canada’s Criminal Code to include greater access to data and other electronic information from citizens. Police have been clamouring for lawful access for years, giving them the power to intercept, search and seize telecommunications information. The Strong Borders Act will make it easier for police to access subscriber information and metadata, and puts the onus on electronic service providers to modify their systems for authorities to access.In other words, the police can collect subscriber information without a warrant in “exigent circumstances” – wording that makes wider allowance for those circumstances without defining them. This extends to an offence that,as the bill states, “has been or will be committed under this act or any other act of parliament”, which amounts to any legislation passed by parliament. What does that have to do, specifically, with border security? It’s a backdoor to accessing protected data despite the Privacy Act, which governs privacy rights in any interaction with the federal government.We are witnessing the construction of a surveillance state in which Canada Post will be able to intercept and open mail.The Charter of Rights and Freedoms protects Canadians from unlawful search and seizure. However, under this new legislation, police can obtain a warrant “on the lower standard of reasonable suspicion of a crime, instead of probable cause,”reports the Conversation. “This can also apply to foreign entities like Google or Meta.” In layperson’s terms, Apple or Google or Meta will be forced to serve as state agents.Carney’s administration is feeding into Trump’s delusions about marauding criminal gangs trafficking fentanyl into the US from Canada. The Canadian minister of public safety and emergency preparedness included provisions to combat transnational organised crime and illegal fentanyl, supposed crises that Trump used to justify his 25% levy on goods from Canada. However, Canada only accounts for0.2% of fentanylseized at US borders. In 2024, of the 9,929kg confiscated by US authorities, only 20kg originated from Canada. In addressing Trump’s mathematical illusions, the Carney government validated the US president’s exaggerations about drug cartels attacking Americans from the north.“Elbows up” turned into stares of disbelief at the measures posited by Carney’s Liberal government. It’s one of the most profound political reverses on the Canadian public, proving that while Carney charms us in the front, he is stripping our rights behind our backs.Erica Ifill is an economist and award-winning political columnistExplore more on these topicsCanadaOpinionMark CarneyAmericasCommonwealth immigrationUS immigrationcommentShareReuse this content"

Not Reform. Sitting back from the fray, it sets the agendaFri 13 Jun 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 09.46 EDTShareIn today’s rundown, discontented Britain, politics is supposed to be hard. Deep national problems need to be solved, but voters are impatient and often contemptuous of politicians. Past mistakes are rarely forgiven. Promises are treated with scepticism. The costs of policies are scrutinised and often resented. Attempts to set out priorities, such as the government’s spending review this week, face endless questioning.Disagreements inside political parties, meanwhile, are seen as signs of weakness and division. MPs with outside interests are seen as greedy and uncommitted. As for the minority who survive these pressures long enough to have a significant career – the electorate usually grows bored with them. Few retain its interest beyond a dozen or so years.Nigel Farage first became an elected politician in 1999. Since then, disillusionment with his profession has intensified to probably unprecedented levels. Yet few, if any, of the unforgiving rules of British politics seem to apply to him, or to his latest vehicle, Reform UK. They appear to be playing politics on easy mode.His Commons appearances are infrequent, hisextracurricular activities prolific, his party’s internal culture chaotic and its plans to “fix” Britain largely theoretical and uncosted. His one concrete policy achievement is Brexit, now widely considered disastrous or disappointing.In a country often said to have had enough of metropolitan privilege, he is a wealthy, privately educated southern Englishman who used to work in the City of London. In a country supposedly sick of political rancour, he consistently falls out with colleagues. In a country that supposedly wants politicians to be more modest and better at apologies, his public manner is self-satisfied and unrepentant.Yet since winning only five seats at last year’s election,Reform UKhas increasingly dominated the political conversation. Farage’s constant speeches and press conferences, complete with self-congratulatory smiles and jokes, receive huge coverage for a tiny Westminster party. Few Labour or Tory policies feel designed without actual or potential Reform voters in mind. And as the traditional main parties have fallen back in the polls, Reform has overtaken them. Winning power has become a possibility.No new British party has ever done this. EvenLabour, with the trade union movement behind it, took a quarter of a century from its foundation to reach government. Why is Reform seemingly finding politics so easy?The usual way of explaining its rise is through the troubled state of the country, the main parties’ inadequacies and Farage’s talent for exploiting political and social crises. These have all played a big part, but so have less examined factors.The design of our political system is one of them. Supposedly hostile to new parties, it can, in fact, be too hospitable to them if their popularity is not yet reflected in parliament, and they can, therefore, avoid taking on tricky Commons roles. Because Reform is not the official opposition, Farage doesn’t have to ask regular prime minister’s questions, and doesn’t have to build a coherent critique of the government – and thus also expose himself to its potentially damaging counterattacks. While Kemi Badenoch struggles to rubbish Keir Starmer’s government, and Starmer rubbishes past Tory governments in reply, Farage can sit back, seemingly above the Westminster squabbles many voters dislike.An MP for just a year, he barely has a Commons or constituency record that opponents can attack. He and Reform can act as the opposition in an amorphous and potent rather than narrowly parliamentary sense: as a repository for the hopes and fantasies of a wide range of voters that the country can be rescued – “reformed” – by a radically different government.Something a little like this has happened before, with the creation and brief ascendancy of the Social Democratic party (SDP) in the early 1980s. Allied with the Liberals, the SDP won byelections andsurged ahead of Labour and the Tories in the polls. Some predicted the SDP would replace Labour, as some predict Reform will replace the Tories now. Yet unlike Reform, the SDP had been founded by familiar Commons figures, all former Labour ministers, and this connection to the mainstream meant that its fresh, insurgent feel could not be sustained. Its popularity faded.Less associated with Westminster, Reform may prove harder for the established parties to suppress or co-opt. Farage also enjoys an advantage not available to the SDP: strong rightwing media support. In order to get the politics it wants, or to obstruct the politics it doesn’t want, this historically dominant part of the media almost always backs a rightwing party. With the Tories’ deep unpopularity, poor current leadership and terrible recent record in government, Reform seems a better prospect. While it presents itself as a revolt against the established order, in reality its anti-immigration and anti-diversity policies seek to protect or restore traditional social structures. It’s an easy cause for conservative journalists to support.What might make Reform’s life harder? Possibly,having to run the councils it wonin May’s local elections, during a period of tight public spending. Yet given Reform’s ability to evade responsibility, it’s also possible that problems at its councils will be blamed on the government instead.Farage may finally start to age, politically speaking, as he becomes more of a Westminster fixture, and also engages with – or ignores – the problems of his deprived constituency, Clacton in Essex. His 21 years as a member of the European parliament to an extent preserved his novelty – like his movement’s metamorphosis from the UK Independence party to the Brexit party to Reform UK – since few Britons followed its proceedings. Now, as a purely domestic politician, he gets more constant publicity. Although he seems to relish it, it could bring overexposure. In the most recent polls,Reform’s popularity had stopped rising.But waiting for him and his party to lose their novelty is a risky and passive strategy for Reform’s opponents, with the next election at most four years away. Anxious Labour activists and election strategists increasingly talk about promoting a “stop Reform” message. Yet with Labour having weakened its anti-Reform credentials by sometimesechoing its language and policies, that message might only resonate with enough voters if Labour forms some kind of electoral alliance with more consistently anti-Reform forces: the Greens and Liberal Democrats, perhaps even Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party and leftwing independents. That would be uncharted territory for the tribal Labour party. But with Reform enjoying an ascendancy that our political and electoral systems never anticipated, we are in uncharted territory already.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsReform UKOpinionNigel FarageLabourConservativescommentShareReuse this content"

How they denied Palestinians our inalienable right to self-determination and return, and chose to support occupation over freedom, apartheid over equality. Today, after decades of appeasement and impunity, Israel has entrenched one of the longest military occupations in modern history, one that seeks not only to control Palestinian life but to extinguish it.As the Palestinian ambassador to the UK, I call on the British government to end this vicious path, right its historic wrongs andofficially recognise the state of Palestine while the conditions are uniquely ripe to do so. TheUN conference on the two-state solutionnext week presentsan immediate opportunityfor the UK to join the rest of the world to recognise the state of Palestine. This means the recognition of the independence of our people and sovereignty of our land as defined by international resolutions, full membership at the UN and diplomatic relations as accorded to all member states.Recognition is neither a reward for one party nor a punishment for another; it is a long-overdue affirmation of the Palestinian people’s unconditional right to exist and live freely in our homeland. It is a central foundation on which a peaceful future can be built.The two-state solution is a delusion | Rabea EghbariahRead moreTo those who say now is not the right time, I ask: If not now, when? The genocide in Gaza – where entire neighbourhoods lie in rubble, tens of thousands are dead or missing, and starvation is being usedas a weapon of war– has exposed Israel’s intent to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from their land and galvanised global support. In the occupied West Bank, thousands of families are being forced from their homes, their villages razed and replaced with illegal settlements, under the orders of openly racist ministers who reject the very idea of a Palestinian state.In Britain, the Labour party has the necessary mandate, having run on a party platform ofrecognising a Palestinian state, as well as having the overwhelming support of the British parliament and public; the UK wouldjoin 147 UN member states, including Spain, Ireland, Norway and Slovenia, in doing so. And across the Atlantic, with the Trump administration consumed by domestic turmoil, the UK can lead diplomatically, as it did when it gathered Europe’s leaders in an attempt toend the war in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the UK’s closest partners in the region are clear in their calls for the establishment of the state of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and are urging the UK, France and other remaining countries to get on board.Recognition is not a symbolic gesture, nor is it the end of the road. It is an irreversible first step. Neither should recognition be subject to ever more conditions on the Palestinian side. Delaying recognition simply reinforces the deadly status quo, denying Palestinians political agency or equal rights until Israel consents, thus granting our occupier a permanent veto over our future.The Israeli government, for its part, has made its position unmistakably clear; its policies are a blueprint for permanent occupation. Therecent announcementof 22 new illegal settlements and the Israeli Knesset last yearvoting overwhelminglyto “oppose the establishment of a Palestinian state west of Jordan” leaves no room for ambiguity about the Israeli plan to ethnically cleanse us from our land. At this stage, non-recognition is not neutrality, it is a political decision, to side with apartheid, occupation and the continued erasure of the Palestinian people. Recognition is not only a moral imperative – it is a legal one,laid outby the international court of justice.The announcement by the UK government tosanction two Israeli ministerswas a welcome step, but it does not confront the heart of the issue. The core of the problem is not the actions of a few extremists, but a longstanding, deeply entrenched Israeli doctrine aimed at displacing and replacing the Palestinian people in their own homeland. That is why we have called on the UK to hold the entire ecosystem accountable: to sanction the Israeli government, impose a full arms embargo and hold those complicit in war crimes accountable. These actions must go hand in hand with an immediate recognition of the state of Palestine; one cannot be a substitute for the other.Boris Johnson once wrote that the Balfour declarationleft the UK with “unfinished business”: a promise of Palestinian rights and statehood that was never fulfilled. More than a century later, that failure has brought us to the brink, threatening not only the Palestinian people but the prospects for peace and stability in the entire region. The time for the UK to finish that business is now.As Palestinians, and alongside a growing global movement for peace and justice, we continue to struggle for a future where our children can enjoy the same freedom, dignity and opportunity as children everywhere. That future remains impossible under occupation. Peace is not made between occupier and occupied; it can only exist between equals.This is a moment of historic consequence.

Residents of the Irish capital won’t be holding their breath, however. Since it wasfirst proposed25 years ago, MetroLink has been cancelled, revived and rebranded. The latest version of the plan, which involves just 18.8km of track, has beensubject to delays, costs thathave spiralledto five times the original estimate, and fierce opposition from homeowners, heritage bodies and businesses.A wide-awake city of tech firms, theatres and tourist attractions, Dublin is one of the EU’s richest metropolitan areas; it is also the only large western European capital without a metro. No Dubliner would have been more frustrated with the situation’s absurdities, andMetroLink’s slow progress, than Leopold Bloom, the protagonist of James Joyce’s Ulysses.Transport is never far from Bloom’s thoughts as he traverses the city on 16 June 1904. His wife Molly’s infidelity, the death of his friend Paddy Dignam,and fatherhood are uppermostin the advertising canvasser’s mind, but he also repeatedly ruminates on a plan to build “a tramline along the North Circular from the cattle market to the quays”. What begins as a passing observation about the scheme’s likely impact on property prices near his home on Eccles Street becomes a fully fledged policy proposal by the day’s end.View image in fullscreenBuses on a crowded Dublin street.Photograph: Design Pics Inc/REX/ShutterstockUlysses is a peripatetic story. For 17 or so hours, Bloom walks across Dublin, encountering friends, acquaintances and foes. From his “sober” morning stroll down Westland Row, where he meets the disreputable CP M’Coy, to the “parallel courses” that he and the inebriated poet Stephen Dedalus follow from Beresford Place to Eccles Street, Bloom coversnearly nine mileson foot. It is little wonder how tired he is by the time he climbs into bed next to Molly.Afirst-rate flâneur, Bloom is also a keen student of Dublin transport, which continually vexes him. On Westland Row, he is distracted from M’Coy’s tedious talk by a white-stockinged woman leaving the Grosvenor hotel. When a “heavy tramcar honking its gong” obscures his line of sight, Bloom curses the driver’s “noisy pugnose”. Later that evening, the adman witnesses a drunken altercation between Dedalus and his disloyal companion, Buck Mulligan, at Westland Row station. Concerned for Dedalus’s safety, Bloom follows the young man to Nighttown, but the good samaritan misses his stop. By the time Bloom reaches Dublin’s red-light district, Dedalus is about to have his jaw bashed in by two British soldiers.These are not the only instances in Ulysses in which the city’s transport system is uncooperative. At Nelson’s pillar, a hoarse-voiced timekeeper dispatches trams with great energy for Rathgar and Terenure, Sandymount Green and Palmerston Park. However, the trams soon stand motionless after a power cut. As “Hackney cars, cabs, delivery waggons, mailvans, private broughams” and “aerated mineral water floats” rattle by, the traffic that Bloom seeks to alleviate with his plan worsens.“I can’t make out why the corporation doesn’t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays. All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats,” suggests Bloom to his fellow mourners, as Dignam’s funeral cortege crawls to Glasnevin cemetery. The tramline should be extended there, Bloom adds, to run “municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan”.Bloom’s passion for public works is longstanding and not surprising for a character who in his youth had considered standing for parliament and who in Joyce’s imagination subscribed to “the collective and national economic programmes” of radical Irish nationalists. Although Bloom’s political fervour has waned, he remains a nationalist. To him, nationalism is not about the Irish language, which he doesn’t speak, or political violence, which he abhors. It is about the opportunity to governIrelandfor the better, starting with infrastructure.View image in fullscreenA tram in Dublin, circa 1906.Photograph: Past Pix/SSPL/Getty ImagesIn pre-independence Ireland, British power is ever present in Dublin on 16 June 1904. It is also palpably decaying. The viceregal cavalcade carrying the king’s representative in Ireland through the city goes “unsaluted” by a resident pondering whether it is quicker to get to Phibsborough “by a triple change of tram or by hailing a car or on foot”. Here again, Dublin’s system of public transport is found wanting, but the viceroy is neither interested norempowered to act.In Nighttown, Bloom experiences a frightening phantasmagoria in which he is suddenly appointed lord mayor of Dublin. His immediate suggestion that the city builds a tramline “from the cattlemarket to the river” provokes vigorous nods from the assembled aldermen, but the crowd soon threaten Bloom with boiling oil.Back home in Eccles Street, Bloom gives free rein to his political imagination as part of a bedtime ritual which produces “sound repose and renovated vitality”. However, his train of thought soon circles back to what has by now become a detailed policy prospectus for the new tramline. The scheme will be funded, he suggests, by “graziers’ fees” and guaranteed by “eminent financiers”.Ulysses’s fixation with transport minutiae doesn’t just provide colour and comic relief. It carries Joyce’s own hopes for a new Ireland that realises its potential. Through his increasingly intricate tram scheme, Bloom symbolises the sort of progressive reformer that the writer believes can cure the country’s political paralysis. Molly Bloom, in contrast, embodies Joyce’s simultaneous fear that Irish politics will forever be all talk. Her husband’s sermons about Sinn Féin are no more than “trash and nonsense”, she suggests.Public investment and technology have transformed Dublin for the better since 1904, but Leopold Bloomwould still recognise its transport system’s many deficiencies. Its cost. Its patchy coverage. Itsoccasional power cuts. Recent studies suggest that the Irish capital isone of the most congestedcities in the world and that its public transport is among theleast affordablein Europe. FromLondon’s Crossrailto theGrand Paris Express, European cities are upgrading their public transport systems, but Ireland’s notoriously centralised governing structures have left its capital with limited say over its own development. An elected mayor would help, but this idea is no closer to reality than during Bloom’s fevered visit to Nighttown.After 25 years of talk, MetroLink needs to seelight at the end of the tunnel soon. However frustrated Bloom would have been over the project’s delays, he would have nodded vigorously at its proposed route, especially the section from Glasnevin to Mater station on his own Eccles Street. Now, if only the planners insisted on livestock wagons and funeral cars, Dublin would have a scheme worthy of its most famous fictional resident and the “world’s greatest reformer”.Dermot Hodson is professor of political economy at Loughborough University and the author ofCircle of Stars: A History of the EU – and the People Who Made ItExplore more on these topicsRail transportOpinionJames JoyceIrelandEuropeCity transportDublin holidayscommentShareReuse this content"

For the second time in less than two years the Liberal premier, Jeremy Rockliff, has called an early poll after his breakdown in relations with the independents who supported his minority government.In early 2024 he called for an election a year before it was due after two ex-Liberal party independents, John Tucker and Lara Alexander, refused his draconian terms of not voting on Labor or Green bills, motions or amendments without discussing them with the government.The premier saw parliament as unworkable if they challenged government policy. But they would not agree to be silenced, for example, about the lack of transparency surrounding the AFL stadium proposed for Hobart’s waterfront.The 2024 election did not return the Liberals to majority government. It delivered them 14 seats in an expanded parliament of 35 members of the House of Assembly. Labor won 10 seats, the Greens five, the Jacqui Lambie Network three and three independents were elected.The Liberals claimed victory. Labor refused suggestions that it could form a minority or coalition government with the Greens, and potentially with independents. On election night the party’s then leader, Rebecca White, seemed interested but that faded in the light of day.Labor had governed in majority from 1998 until 2010, when it formed a quasi-coalition with the Greens, who sat within cabinet as ministers but with the ability to oppose government policy and legislation.Tasmanians face a fourth election in seven years – but here are two alternatives to fix the political impasseRead moreThis arrangement provided stable government for four years, with the Greens ministers Nick McKim and Cassie O’Connor well regarded as hard-working and effective. But Labor still blamed the Greens for its 2014 loss of government after 16 long years in power.The Liberals have governed since 2014, in majority until 2018. Their majority was regained in 2021 but subsequently lost. Their vote has gradually eroded to its low point today.Labor’s vote has been stuck in the doldrums post-2014, with White taking the party to three consecutive election losses and blaming the Greens for destroying the party – rather than Labor’s failure to differentiate itself from the Liberals.Polling inTasmaniamirrors this year’s federal election result. The Liberal and Labor votes are hovering around 30%, eclipsed by the combined Greens, Lambie Network and independents at about 40%. If accurate this will surely deliver another minority government.But those results still might deliver more seats to the Liberals than Labor, despite parliament’s no-confidence motion in Rockliff, his refusal to step down, and the fact that his government has become embattled, tired and ineffective.Labor’s leader, Dean Winter, brought the no-confidence motion, setting in train the events that have led to the early election. This will win his party no fans. Labor has also backed the Liberals on the stadium proposal, now opposed by 59% of Tasmanians.The Greens stepped up and offered to work with Labor so an election could be avoided. But Winter travelled to Government House to assure the governor, Barbara Baker, that he and his party would not countenance working with the Greens.He will be hoping that Tasmanian voters cannot discern between state and federal politics, that they equate Tasmanian Labor with all its woes with the Albanese government, and that the 9% swing to Labor at the federal election is replicated.A millstone for the major parties is Tasmania’s debt crisis, with net debt forecast to reach $10.9bn by 2029. Neither party has offered credible remedies and both will surely be constrained for once from electoral pork-barrelling.So the crossbench is likely to expand at the 2025 poll and, with it, the available talent for supporting minority government and playing a role in a quasi-coalition government. Indeed the Greens and the crossbench have the numbers to form their own minority government.But neither the Liberals nor Labor seem to comprehend the reality of minority government. Neither party seems to have learned from previous experiences of it. And neither has grasped that a Labor-Greens quasi-coalition offers a solid and workable arrangement.In Tasmania, the major parties simply have to come to terms with the fact that the days of majority government are done and will be until they significantly rebuild faith with the electorate. Until then, they need to deal cooperatively with the Greens and the crossbench.Kate Crowley, an adjunct associate professor at the University of Tasmania, is an expert on minority government and the editor ofMinority Government: The Liberal-Green Experience in TasmaniaExplore more on these topicsTasmanian politicsOpinionTasmaniaLiberal partyLabor partyAustralian GreensIndependentscommentShareReuse this content"

It had the hits, of course, but also a few of the deeper cuts from Pet Sounds and onwards. To say this changed my life is an understatement – Brian’s music, harmonies and subject matters struck an incredible chord in me. It did exactly what he existed for, bringing comfort to a heart and soul that needs it. I’ve been a fan ever since – I saw him at the Royal Festival Hall on his first Pet Sounds tour, watched him perform Smile in utter disbelief and wonder in Liverpool, while finally introducing his amazing show to my beautiful wife at the Summer Pops in Liverpool. Quite simply the greatest musician to ever live, in my opinion.Stephen Woodward, 50, Liverpool‘He was a musical genius’I first heard California Girls when I was 10 years old. I yearned to be that tanned girl with the bleached blond hair. However, I lived in Burnley, a northern mill town with grey skies and a surfeit of rain! Nonetheless, the Beach Boys’ music transported me to those white sandy beaches, fringed with palm trees and lapped by the Pacific waves. As I got older, the music ofBrian Wilsonevolved, too. Those exquisite harmonies and lyrics continued to move and enthral me. He was a musical genius and his music still manages to evoke in me every human emotion possible.Catherine, Leeds‘I met him in 1988 and he was gentle and respectful’View image in fullscreenThe portrait Gavin took of Brian Wilson during the photoshoot in 1988.Photograph: Gavin EvansIt was 1988 at the Savoy Hotel, London, when I had my brief but indelible encounter with the Beach Boy myth and legend. I was in my formative years as a portrait photographer, and Brian Wilson was being revealed to the press by his doctor and manager,Eugene Landy.Stepping out of the lift on to the top floor, I was greeted by the ethereal melodies of a piano drifting through the corridor – Brian was composing in his penthouse suite. His two assistants greeted me with smiles. I set up my lighting and asked Brian to sit – he looked deeply into the lens and froze. After just three frames, the assistants intervened, politely informing me the session was over.View image in fullscreenGavin’s polaroid photo with Brian in 1988, London.Photograph: Gavin EvansBefore I left, the assistants insisted on photographing me alongside him. Two polaroids were required – one for litigation purposes and another as a personal keepsake. For the first one, I played my best poker face. For the second, the memento, I decided to playfully raise an eyebrow. I snatched the Polaroid before the ink was dry, bid them all adieu and beat a hasty exit. As the image developed, two figures surfaced from the darkness – Brian and me, shoulder-to-shoulder, both with raised eyebrows! To me, in that moment of lucidity, Brian was gentle and respectful. That’s how I remember my encounter with the legend.Gavin Evans, photographer, Berlin‘I grew up in Corby and the Beach Boys’ music felt transportive’I grew up in Corby in the 90s and felt about as far away as possible from the Beach Boys’ music. I think that’s precisely why I fell in love with it. It felt transportive. I had the chance to see Brian Wilson perform Pet Sounds in Barcelona in 2016, which felt close to a perfect moment, the kind of thing I’d dreamed of as a child. When my first child was born 18 months ago, Pet Sounds was the first music I ever played for her.Jack Roe, writer and photographer, Liverpool‘In spite of all plaudits he remains vastly underrated’I cannot help agreeing that Brian was the Mozart of the US and in spite of all plaudits he remains vastly underrated. If I play At My Piano for Swiss friends who are probably far less aware of the Beach Boys, they all love the beautiful melodies even without the affectionate and tender lyrics. The man was gentleness and love personified. Most people seem unaware of his later work, some of which definitely rivals his finest Pet Sounds moments for its amazing harmonies, arrangements, tender poetic lyrics and haunting melody. He was courageous over a testing lifetime and leaves a wonderful musical legacy.Kingsley Flint, 76, retired, Cossonay, Switzerland‘He invited us to grow up with him’Musical composition isn’t an exact science: most of us could shove a few chords together to make verses and a chorus, put it in a 4/4 time signature and voila! There’s the basis of a pop song. But carrying that series of chord progressions to a higher form, and communicating feeling that touches almost all human souls who hear it, is what Brian Wilson did. Through his music, Brian invited us to grow up with him, and we did.Eamon McCrisken, 58, languagecoach, Spain‘He called me and I got to tell him how much his music meant to me’I never met him but he did phone me up in 2005 after I donated to a charity appeal for the tsunami where he promised to ring everyone who donated a certain amount. One day, my wife and I were eating and let the phone go to the answering machine when it rang. I’ve never moved as quick as when I heard his unmistakable voice saying: “Hi James, this is Brian Wilson calling from California.” Luckily I caught him before he hung up and got to tell him how much his music meant to me. I’ll treasure that call forever.James Ellaby, 44, senior content writer, Manchester‘The world has lost a musical oracle’As a teen, I thought the Beach Boys were a bit naff. Later in life, having grown up a fair bit, I bought Pet Sounds and a greatest hits compilation on a whim, and was floored on first listen by how Brian captured and blended the essential dichotomy of life: beauty and ugliness, happiness and sadness, optimism and pessimism, ennui and joy. His music made me smile and cry, sometimes simultaneously, in a way that no music had before. Now, I feel a hole in my heart knowing that Brian is gone and that the world has lost a musical oracle, and I wonder: can anyone ever make us feel these things again?Lachlan Walter, 46, writer, Melbourne, Australia‘I sang God Only Knows to my daughter when she was a baby – it’s our song’Since I was about 10, I have loved the music of the Beach Boys. By the time I was starting to date, finding and losing love, Brian’s songs were there soundtracking my life like he knew me and I felt I knew him. I think all his fans felt a profoundly deep affection for him, an empathy for his suffering and a desire to make him feel as happy and loved as he made us feel. One memory about him particularly stands out for me. A few months after I first saw Pet Sounds live, my daughter was born. She was crying in my arms and I sang God Only Knows to her and she stopped crying straight away – it’s our song now.Oliver Learmonth, 55, creative artist, Brighton‘I saw Brian in 2002 – at 50, I was as excited as a kid at Christmas’In January 2002, I was at home in Holland when I found out Brian would be playing the whole of Pet Sounds in London the following week. How had I missed this news? As I quickly found out, the gigs were all sold out. No matter, I had to go. I invented a spurious excuse to visit my company’s office in London, and the following Monday I was at the Royal Festival Hall box office at 10am, to be told: “We occasionally get returns from ticket agencies. You could try coming back at 5pm.” I was there at 3pm, ferreting among early arrivals in the hope of a spare. No luck. But at 5pm, the box office had a couple of returns. Pricey, but what the hell: side stalls ticket W24 was mine, and canyoueffin’believeit, this turned out to be the front row on the right side of the stage, only a few feet from guitarist Jeffrey Foskett’s head. At 50, I was as excited as a kid at Christmas.Andy, 74, retired administration manager, PrestonExplore more on these topicsBrian WilsonBeach BoysPop and rockfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There is a feeling of global disorder and growing chaos. The threat of war edges ever closer. Some people are even predicting revolution in the UK. Two weeks ago,Dominic Cummingsgave an interview to Sky News prophesying violent uprising, then wrote on his blog that there is “Whitehall terror of widespread white-English mobs turning political … Parts of the system increasingly fear this could spin out of control into their worst nightmare.”I think something much deeper is going on beneath the surface of Britain today. Two years ago, a historian called Christopher Clark wrote a book that makes you look at your own time in a completely different way. Called Revolutionary Spring, it tells the story of the unrest that swept Europe in 1848. In a few weeks, uprisings spread like ferocious brushfire – from Paris to Berlin to Vienna, Prague and Milan. Thousands of demonstrators stormed national assemblies and kings fled their countries, caught up in a wave of violent upheaval never seen before. Clark’s book inspired me to make Shifty, my new series of films, because the world he describes feels so similar to today. One in which “the political horizon was dark. Neither nations nor governments knew where they were going.“Everyone had surrendered to doubt and anxiety. All forms of belief were enfeebled, all forms of authority shaken, social bonds had reached breaking point. The political horizon was dark. Neither nations nor governments knew where they were going. There was a sense of being ‘on the eve of bloody wars and internal strife’.”View image in fullscreen‘Power was shifting.’Photograph: Adam CurtisAll the revolutions failed in their original aim. But out of them came the bourgeois class that was going to run society in the future. Fascinatingly, Clark showed how from that came all the ways of ordering the world that we today accept as eternal – not just the political structures of left and right but fundamental ideas of our time, like social class. But he is clear that they may be temporary. “They belonged to the world that had not yet encountered the great disciplining identities of modern politics. We belong to one in which those identities are swiftly dissolving.”I wanted to make a series set in Britain over the past 45 years that shows how all our political certainties dissolved. It is built of hundreds of moments that try to evoke what it has felt like to live through this age. The mood is that strange twilight zone between history and memory; fragments that have not yet been fixed into a formal version of the past. From intersex dogs and fat-shaming ventriloquists to avant-garde hair. Leeks by moonlight. Ken Dodd’s suitcase. Nuns playing ping pong. Margaret Thatcher’s handbag. A scanner from Maplin. Netto. And dark moments – racist attacks, suspicion of others and modern paranoia about conspiracies in Britain’s past.Above all, I wanted to trace the rise of the thing that has destroyed the confidence of our age: distrust – not just of those in power, and of “truth”, but of everything and everyone around us and, ultimately, of ourselves.How everyone became badView image in fullscreen‘An extraordinary collapse in trust in politicians.’Photograph: Adam CurtisIt didn’t start like that. Thatcher believed that if you liberated people from state control they would become better and more confident. But to do this, she turned to radical rightwing economic thinkers – some of whom were very odd. About 15 years ago, I went to see a US economist called James Buchanan. I had to drive for hours deep into the mountains of Virginia to his farm. He told me that you couldn’t trust anyone in any position of power. Everyone, he insisted, is driven by self-interest.We sat in a darkened room, with a thunderstorm raging outside, as he told me firmly that human beings didn’t just follow their own self-interest when they were buying and selling stuff; they were driven by it all the time. So when people in power talked of being motivated by “public duty”, they were lying.He called this “public choice theory”, and it had an enormous effect on the advisers around Thatcher. It explained to them why all the bureaucrats that ran Britain were so useless. The economists invented a system called New Public Management (NPM) to control them. NPM said it was dangerous to leave people to motivate themselves through fuzzy notions such as “doing good”. Instead, you created systems that monitored everyone through targets and incentives. Constantly watching and rewarding or punishing. It was the birth of modern HR. Anyone who has ever dealt with HR and their monitoring systems knows instinctively that they don’t trust you. There is a very good moment that was captured on adocumentary about London Zoo in 1993made by Molly Dineen. The zoo had brought in a new HR expert who explains to the mild-mannered zookeepers how incentives and targets work. “Once you do that,” he says, “you’ve got them in the Grinder.”View image in fullscreenAn elephant at a celebration.Photograph: Adam CurtisThat’s Buchanan’s theories at work. And it was a terrible virus that was going to spread.But the roots of distrust didn’t just come from the right. The patrician liberals in Britain were completely shocked that large sections of the working class voted for Thatcher. They had always drawn their influenceand prestige from the idea that they cared for the “little people” and the “less well-off”. Now they turned on them in fury. I found a clip of the novelist Martin Amis promoting his book Money. Dripping with disdain, he says the working class have been seduced by the vulgar allure of money. They are, he said, stupid.It was at that moment the influence of liberal intellectuals began to slip. Power was shifting.17 years a Russian spyView image in fullscreenA police officer at a riot.Photograph: Adam CurtisThere was one institution Thatcher still trusted, though: the security services. Even that crumbled with the case ofGeoffrey Primewho worked at GCHQ. It started when Prime’s wife came home to find him being questioned about the assault of a local girl. After the police left, he told her that he was the man they were looking for. She asked him if there was anything else she should know. He said yes: he’d also been spying for the Russians for the past 17 years.Thatcher was stunned. MI5 had vetted Prime five times and hadn’t noticed anything. Even the Russians knew he was a paedophile. It became clear MI5 was hopeless. And when it failed to prevent the siege of the Libyan embassy in 1984, she ordered the home secretary, Leon Brittan, to reform it. MI5 fought back – spreading rumours through journalists that Brittan was a predatory paedophile, part of a secret ring of paedophile MPs in Westminster. Thirty years later, those rumours would burst to the surface as part of Operation Midland. None of it was true.By the end of the 80s the belief that you couldn’t trust anyone in public life, which Buchanan started, finally came round to the politicians themselves. It was basic logic. If you believed public duty was a fiction, and all public servants were lying when they spoke of public duty, weren’t the politicians also public servants? Which meant they must also be lying when they proclaimed they were working for the public good.To the MaxView image in fullscreen‘It is impossible to have coherent dreams of the future.’Photograph: Adam CurtisOne of the key figures in this process was the infamous publicistMax Clifford. He had picked up on the groundswell of distrust and found a way to monetise it. Clifford specialised in putting two or three of his clients together and cooking up stories from which they all benefited.He started in the late 80s with a famous radical leftwinger called Derek Hatton. He took him to a nightclub – which Clifford also represented. He photographed Hatton next to an heiress of the Baring bank family – whom he also represented – and cooked up a passionate romance between them. Then he turned to the Tories. When a government minister called David Mellor was revealed to be having an affair, his mistress – Antonia de Sancha – came to Clifford. He took her to meet the press in restaurants he represented, then told them stories about Mellor making love in a Chelsea shirt while toe-sucking and spanking.

In the early 90s, MP after MP was revealed to be a sleazy hypocrite who seemed far more concerned with his own weird sex life than governing the country and serving the people. The one I love is the story of David Ashby MP. He sued the Sunday Times in 1995 when they accused him of being a homosexual. He admitted he hadshared a bedwith another man, but said it was purely to save money on holiday. He admitted that his wife did call him “Queenie” and “Poofter”, but said that was only because she was lonely in the marriage. He had bought her a dog to make her feel better. But it didn’t work. Ashby told the court she threw plates and kitchen knives at him. She threatened to “kick him in the bollocks to stop him having sex with anyone”, and broke his glasses. Ashby lost the case, which put paid to his career. Soon, he was deselected by his local Tories as their parliamentary candidate. He later said of his ex-colleagues, on live radio: “They’re a bunch of shits, aren’t they, and we know they are.”The early 90s saw an extraordinary collapse in trust in politicians. Created not just by Clifford, but also by Mohamed Al-Fayed, who said that heregularly paid MPswithcash in brown paper envelopesto ask questions for him in the Commons. It seemed to prove everything Buchanan had been saying: you couldn’t trust anyone in public service.After I interviewed Buchanan in the Virginia mountains, I asked him about his life. He told me about how when he was training as an officer in the US Navy, he was constantly patronised by pompous officers from posh Ivy League universities. He was still angry about it – he knew they were all phoneys, he said, you could feel it. As I drove back I wondered if that was his real motivation. Dressed up in academic language, but beneath it was simply revenge. He was going to destroy that smug patrician class. And he succeeded. Big time.View image in fullscreenAvant-garde hair.Photograph: Adam CurtisBy the second half of the 90s, even the politicians came to believe they were bad. And they did the most extraordinary thing: they gave away power. They did it partly because they knew they couldn’t fight against the rising tide of public doubt. But they were also persuaded by another force they felt they could no longer fight against: the markets. The first to go was Bill Clinton. His secretary of the treasury, Robert Rubin, persuaded him to pull back from public spending. Instead, he should cut the deficit and allow the markets to create a financial boom. Clinton agreed – and the US boomed throughout the 90s. But it also led directly to the global crash of 2008.And behind the markets was a whole academic industry that had taken Buchanan’s ideas and run with them. They wrote articles that bluntly said the role of politicians in society should be marginalised because so much of what they did was “sub-optimal”. Journalists picked up these ideas and put them in simpler terms. Fareed Zakaria, editor of Newsweek Internationalwrote: “What we need in politics today is not more democracy – but less”.Things can only get worse?View image in fullscreen‘We are not trusted!’ Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.Photograph: Adam CurtisIn the face of this undermining of politics, New Labour also gave in. The day after their victory in 1997, the new chancellor, Gordon Brown, dramatically announced that he wasgiving power overthe setting of interest rates to the Bank of England. It was an extraordinary move. Labour MPs were aghast. Bryan Gould, once a candidate for the party’s leadership, exclaimed: “What then is the role of the chancellor? Or more simply, what is the role of democracy?”Brown later admitted the truth: that it was because politicians were now seen as dangerous. We did it, he said, “not for any fundamental economic reasons”, but because we weren’t trusted. Born out of a weird self-hate, that single act was largely responsible for the present powerlessness of politicians. It was also helped on by a new phenomenon – because liberal culture too caught the disease.The Thick of Itwas a comedy series based around a government minister and their advisers. They live in a constant state of self-interested hysteria. Reacting to events and having no control over the real world outside. It was seen as liberal satire – but it can also be seen as a very powerful expression of Buchanan’s idea that all politicians are completely venal, driven only by dark emotions.Rise of the panto villainsView image in fullscreenAn over-the-top baddy – who isn’t Boris Johnson.Photograph: Adam CurtisBut that wasn’t the end of it. Because a new kind of politician rose up, bred in the swamp of distrust. They saw that playing bad in an over-the-top way would give you a great deal of power. Because in a world of disenchantment, where no one believed that politicians could be good, being bad meant you must be authentic. I give you Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump: pantomime villains who are locked together with us in a feedback loop of shock-outrage-badness repeating endlessly.Outside this theatre, really bad people do really bad things – but we are distracted by the pantomime. Meanwhile, the classes that once made up society fractured. The liberals turned on those who voted for Brexit, using with one voice the word Amis had spat out 30 years before: “stupid”.It may be that Britain – and much of Europe – is in a similar moment to that described by Clark just before 1848: on the edge of a new kind of society we don’t yet have the language to describe. It feels frightening because without that language it is impossible to have coherent dreams of the future. To build a better world, you need an idea of what should change and how.And one of the things preventing that may be our obsession with constantly replaying the past. In the present age, the fog of experience has been thickened by the mass of recorded data that allows the recent past to be endlessly replayed, refusing to fade away. A constant loop of nostalgia – music, images, films and dreams from the past. It is another block to the future. And it is also the way this series is made.

Now, he’s back writing, performing – and rediscovering his political rageFri 13 Jun 2025 08.00 EDTShareIn the mid-90s, Omaha made a pretty decent tour stop for up-and-coming bands. Nebraska sits near-plum in the US’s middle, and in its most populous city, once famed for its fur trade, stockyards and railroads, there had grown a thriving subculture that centred largely on a book and record store named the Antiquarium and a small venue named the Cog Factory.Conor Oberst spent much of his early teens puttering between these locations, filling his young brain with music and literature. By 12, he had begun writing his own songs, and by 13 he had recorded his first album, releasing it on his older brother’s label and selling it in the record store. Sometimes he would take to the stage at the Cog Factory, a small, pale boy with an acoustic guitar and a lot of words.He had already begun recording asBright Eyesby the time the Texas band Spoon came through town. Oberst and his friends were huge fans, and turned up to the venue early to see the band arrive. “We loved Spoon,” he says. “But we didn’t know what anyone in the bands looked like, never seen their pictures. These vans pull up outside the club and you’re like: ‘I wonder which one’s the singer?’ There was a lot more mystery and fun to it then.”It would be another five years or so by the time Bright Eyes found success – by now a band rather than a solo project, they were widely feted for their fourth album, 2002’s Lifted Or the Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground, followed by their twin 2005 records I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. By that time, the world was a very different place. Music and media were growing increasingly digitised, and the US was grappling with the presidency of George W Bush and the controversies of the Iraq war.Oberst, whose songs were heartfelt and literate and politically engaged, carrying titles such as When the President Talks to God, became the poster boy of a new generation. His face was everywhere. When Bright Eyes’ tour bus pulled up at the venue,everyoneknew he was the singer. “What happened to me wasn’t at all overnight because I had been touring since I was 15 years old, and at this point I’m 25,” he says. “But still, I think when that big push of fame or public persona, identity thing happened to me, it definitely affected me. I definitely felt the insanity of it.”In many ways, the last 20 years of Oberst’s career have been an attempt to shake off that intensity and find the mystery and the fun of music again. “It is a hard thing to hold on to, that innocence, and what you loved about music sometimes,” he says.Nevertheless, he has tried to grip tightly to that feeling; to remember what music is to him beyond a career. He learned the hard way, he says, that there is not much music in the music business. “But what I will say is music is consistently something that gives my life meaning, and is a source of solace and happiness – not just making it, but listening to it, and seeing people I love doing it,” he says. “Besides family and friends and loved ones, I would say it’s the most consistent thing in my life. There’s nothing else. I’m not religious, I’m not really a member of too many clubs or anything, it’s kind of just music that’s gotten me through it.”The past few years have not always been easy for Oberst – there has been a divorce, the sudden loss of one of his brothers and, in late 2013, an allegation of sexual assault by a female fan. By the following summer,the allegations had been dropped, and the accuser had apologised both to Oberst and to “actual sexual assault victims”. It is not a time the singer is keen to revisit.He speaks steadily, carefully, and gently declines to go on the record about the specificities of what happened. But one gathers that it led to the period he refers to now as “a time when I wished I never had made music, and wished no one had ever heard it. And that’s about the saddest feeling in the world when that’s your whole life, just wanting to not exist.”View image in fullscreen‘I lost interest in kind of everything’ … Oberst on stage in Los Angeles, 2003.Photograph: Scott Gries/Getty ImagesWhat he will also say is that music played an integral part in helping him back out into the world again. “I go into music as a place to understand what’s going on. That’s a place that I know I can go that’s just for myself,” he says. “But it’s all in your mind, so it’s up to you to take care of it and tend the garden. And sometimes if you’re not feeling well physically or otherwise, or the world’s got you down, you stop weeding the garden and the next thing you know your mind’s just overrun and snarled. The forest takes over the grounds, and it’s pretty dark.”Across the screen, Oberst looks small and bleary and slightly disoriented in his hoodie. “But you know, things tend to come back around and get better, and worse, and better again,” he says. “So it’s just trying to stay alive through those parts that seem insurmountable. And next thing you know I’m out here with some of my oldest, best friends in the world and everyone’s having fun,” he says, with a nod to the room behind him, a grey backstage space at the MegaCorp Pavilion in Newport, Kentucky, where Bright Eyes are on tour with fellow Omaha natives, Cursive. “This particular leg of this tour is probably the most old-school touring situation I’ve had for decades. It has been a relief of sorts to be travelling on tour buses again, hanging out till 4am, just fucking smoking weed in parking lots. Playing music. It’s great. It’s like nothing changed.”Last autumn, Bright Eyes released their 11th album, Five Dice, All Threes. It is their most limber record in some while, capturing a kind of musical camaraderie between Oberst and his longstanding bandmates Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott. For Oberst, the record “definitely captures that sort of youthful punk rock spirit that maybe I’d forgotten about”.He credits this rekindling in part to his friend Alex Levine, who helped in the writing of the songs at a point where the singer had “definitely lost interest in kind of everything”. “He was working at other studios with other people, and he’d come back and I’d still be sitting there on the porch, and he’d be like: ‘Why don’t we work on something?’ The first few times I was like: ‘Oh I’m good, man, let’s just sit around, I don’t care.’ And then he wore me down, and next thing we know we’re making demos. I think I really do have him to thank for lighting the fire.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Oberst today seems once again politically ignited, railing against Elon Musk, the anti-immigrant crackdown, the dismantling of academic centres and legal processes, the attack on trans rights and the funnelling of public money into private contracts, against an administration he describes as “the greatest grift of all time”. It is a return of sorts to his earlier self: “I feel there might have been a period in maybe my early 30s where I was like: ‘I should, like, grow up. You shouldn’t be angsty towards the world. You should turn into this real acceptable thing that a lot of people can get behind,’” he says. “Because people like the idea of anger more than they like anger. They like the performative aspect. But the thing is, I really feel it. I really fucking hate these things and I always have, and it’s hard because I can’t not show it.”Lately, at the band’s live shows, he has been encouraging his audiences to speak up. “The world is more fucked up and keeps getting more fucked up so I don’t think it’s time to act measured,” he says. “What I’ve been saying to the kids at the shows every night is you can’t wait. By the time you realise how bad it is, it’s too late, and that’s just something we know from history. Don’t wait till it’s cool to go down to the park and protest. There’s an alarm bell going off above our heads right now and we should all be screaming at the top of our fucking lungs.”He thinks back sometimes to those teenage years in Omaha, when Rage Against the Machine were pretty much the only common musical ground he could find with the high-school jocks, and wonders whether any of them were aware that they were essentially listening to the communist manifesto. “But it slipped into suburban houses, and it did a public service ’cos it influenced all these people. It turned a bunch of them into political activists,” he says.Each night, Oberst looks out from the stage into the crowd and sees a whole new audience before him, from little kids to an eightysomething woman there with her grandson, via people his own age, and “straight-up teenagers that could’ve been at a Bright Eyes show in 1999”. Somehow, amid all the darkness, he finds a hope in this crowd – perhaps even evidence of the role that music has to play in resistance. “I think music is magical,” he says, “I think it can cross all political lines.”Bright Eyes tour the UK and Ireland from16to 25 June; tour starts Nottingham.Explore more on these topicsBright EyesPop and rockinterviewsShareReuse this content"

At night, it beams like a Tracey Emin installation, presiding over Fort Worth’s downtown district. At the intersection leading to Bass Performance Hall the crosswalk has been replaced with an oversized keyboard, and, inside the cavernous venue, sartorial style favours black and white stripes. A pop-up gift shop in the lobby boasts an array of musical-themed memorabilia; there’s the line drawing on a bubble-gum pink T-shirt, an enormous travel mug, a steak-branding fork. The theme-park feel is confirmed by a white Steinway emblazoned with Mickey Mouse – a limited hand-painted Disney edition (price on request). Welcome to piano city, smiles the sign.Every four years, piano lovers from across the world gather in this Texas enclave for the Van Cliburn international piano competition – the instrument’s Olympics.It’s not just about the financial reward (the gold medallist receives $100,000 (£74,000); silver $50,000; bronze $25,000, plus there’s other discretionary awards): participation potentially catapults an early-career pianist into the industry’s orbit. In 2022, at the postponed 2021 instalment, a then unknownYunchan Limtook gold. Earlier this year I witnessed crowds of fans waiting to present the now 21-year-old with stuffed animals after a spectacular concert in Lucerne, where he played alongside Martha Argerich. Lim’s Van Cliburn performance ofRachmaninov’s third piano concertois now the most-watched version of that concerto online, with more than 17m views.View image in fullscreenYunchan Lim performs in the June 2022 finals of the Van Cliburn competition.Photograph: Ralph Lauer/The CliburnIf Bass Performance Hall’s painted skylight and elaborate candelabras recall a European opera house, the dazzling white balconies are all-American. Conductor Marin Alsop pulls the reins on the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra, the Cliburn’s house band. It’s finals week: six pianists (from the28 chosento compete in the competition) perform over four nights. Every performance is livestreamed – this year’s simulcast had 20m views across 145 countries – and, for the first time, is available via Apple Music Classical, along with curated playlists. A new Cliburn Keys View offers the option to watch a hands-only perspective, where disembodied lower arms deploy impeccable technique. While instructive, to do so misses the interplay between soloist and ensemble.Most major international piano competitions require their finalists to perform one concerto. There’s usually a standard list of repertoire – inevitably Tchaikovsky 1 – and the concert is make or break. The Cliburn finalists (an all-male group; only four women competed in Fort Worth, two of whom made it as far as the semi-finals) play two concertos, one from a designated selection, the other can be anything. Alsop deserves her own gold medal for her openness to the challenge, which this year included the quirky choice of Bartok 2. After one concerto I stepped into a lift alongside Alsop who looked thoughtful and exhausted. Most orchestral seasons feature Rachmaninov 3, Beethoven 4 and Prokofiev 2 over the course of a few months. Alsop had done them all in one evening.The Cliburn judges heard 55 hours of music over the course of the event, as 28 pianists became 12, and then six. British pianist Paul Lewis, head of the jury, described the process as “overwhelmingly intense”. From 2015-18 Lewis was chair of the Leeds international piano competition, the UK counterpart that feels positively quaint in comparison.Keir Starmer publicly wished participants luckahead of last year’s Leeds competition; Trump is unlikely to congratulate this year’sCliburn laureateswho include competitors from Russia, Hong Kong, the US, Israel and combinations thereof. He’s missing a trick: the Cliburn has always had political clout. Founder and Texan native Harvey Lavan “Van” Cliburn charmed audiences at the 1958 inaugural International Tchaikovsky competition in Moscow, winning gold at the height of the cold war and returning to that most hallowed of US celebrations, a ticker-tape parade. While some of his recordings are historic gems (his 1958 recording with the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra and Kiril Kondrashin was broadcast with choreographed fireworks at the city’s afterparty), Cliburn’s main legacy is the quadrennial contest that takes his name. Set up in 1962, its importance for cultural unification was immediately confirmed.View image in fullscreenIntense … from left: Evren Ozel (US, 29), Vitaly Starikov (Israel/Russia, 30) and Aristo Sham, (Hong Kong, 29).Photograph: Brandon WadeThere are no public guidelines on judging, what one judge wants from their Brahms 2, say, might vary wildly from another.Aristo Sham’s Mendelssohn 1frothed;Philipp Lynov’s Liszt 2bubbled. “Why aren’t you standing up?” one lady scolded the press line, as each participant received rapturous applause and we struggled to scribble. “Y’all have a favourite?” one Texan asked me in the loos, where I photographed the doors decorated with a stave. I did, but mine was different to hers. Carter Johnson, the 28-year-old Canadian-American threw a curveball with theRavel left-hand concerto, a work composed for Paul Wittgenstein, who lost his right arm in the first world war. It’s a brooding piece demanding technical wizardry (British left-hand pianist Nicholas McCarthy plays it at this year’sProms opening weekend); Johnson danced and pedalled with elegance.Vitaly Starikovemployed some quirky tempi in the Schumann;Evren Ozel’s Tchaikovsky 1was almost as muscular and thrilling as Cliburn’s own historic performance. At this level, differentiation is down to matters of taste.View image in fullscreenUnassuming polymath … Aristo Sham, 29, performs in the Van Cliburn finals with Marin Alsop conducting.Photograph: Ralph LauerUnusually – judging at this level can require UN levels of diplomatic negotiation to reach a consensus, depending on individual rules – the announcement came on time, with all finalists and jury members present. (There are sometimes resignations: in 1980 Argerich left the International Chopin piano competition in protest at the elimination ofIvo Pogorelićin the third round; and there are sometimes huffs: one young pianist refused to participate in the celebratory performance at the conclusion of last year’s Hamamatsu international piano competition in Japan.) And, all prizes were awarded (theTchaikovsky competitionregularly withholds gold if a clear hierarchy of winners cannot be agreed, with joint silver given instead). Sham took the top spot, becoming the first pianist from Hong Kong to win in the Cliburn’s history. The unassuming polymath – Sham is a former child star (featured on Channel 4’s 2009 documentary The World’s Greatest Musical Prodigies) who studied economics at Harvard and music at Juilliard – was a surprise choice to the press, but not to Cliburn viewers – he won theAudience awardby more than 9,000 votes.Starikov won silver and Ozel placed third, also winning the Mozart Concerto award. I was disappointed not to seeLynov’s talents recognised – he was too; it was some time before he appeared at the reception, but crucially, he attended. Talk was all about the verdicts; everyone had a different top three. After the huge success of Lim, the pressure to find the Next Big Pianist was palpable. But Lim is exceptional; competitions spit up dozens of superb musicians and only one in a generation will have his distinctive touch.The latest clutch of piano olympians gathered at a small table, looking as if they wished it was a piano stool. Journalists asked the necessary inane questions and received the necessary inane answers (Q: how does it feel? A: good). At one point Starikov, fatigued or bored, passed on the microphone to Ozel. All three wore shiny medals and consulted unseen bank accounts, blinking into bright futures.Listen to live performances from this year’s Cliburn competition on Apple Music Classical:https://apple.co/2025Cliburn; watch all the finals round concerto performances atwww.youtube.com/thecliburnExplore more on these topicsClassical musicFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

If it all seems like a distant memory, Crowell’s meticulous narration of the events bring the frenzy and confusion of it all right back. From the underreported fatalities to the police’s painstaking investigation and the question of whether a government scientist could have been behind it, Crowell doesn’t skip over any of the details in a heavily researched series notable for its lack of sensationalism.Dancing With ShadowsFor many of the dancers who made it into the New York City Ballet, performing with the elite company was the pinnacle of their achievements.

Anecdotes about crying during orgasms, jokes about vaginas that smell like roses, Aisling Bea’s tragic tale of striking up an unexpected friendship with an elderly neighbour during the pandemic, only for him to die – it’s never less than eventful.Scam FactoryScam podcasts – the kinds of stories that hinge on criminals gaining trust via calls, texts or emails, then emptying their victims’ bank accounts – are nothing new. But what if we could hear from the scammers themselves? Denise Chan’s series for Wondery does just that, zooming in on the horrifying story of Max, who was put to work on a brutal compound in Myanmar, where he extorted money from unwitting jobseekers.StalkedView image in fullscreenReveals a chilling campaign of stalking … Carole Cadwalladr.Photograph: James Veysey/REX/ShutterstockBest known for reporting on political corruption and the burgeoning “broligarchy” of tech moguls, Carole Cadwalladr ploughs a very different furrow in this absorbing, and terrifying, BBC series.Teaming up with “ex-stepdaughter” Hannah Mossman Moore, Cadwalladr unpicks a chilling campaign of stalking that ruined Hannah’s life … then realises there is something of a Venn diagram between Hannah’s experiences and the abuse she has herself suffered as a dogged reporter.SuaveHow to follow up a Pulitzer-winning podcast about the state of incarceration in the US, and a man who spent 31 years in prison? Simple – you follow him now that he’s out. The second run of this Futuro Studios/PRX pod isn’t here to offer a fairytale ending, though. Rather, Julieta Martinelli and Maria Hinojosa sensitively (and at times exasperatedly) show that even though David Luis “Suave” Gonzalez is free, the physical restrictions of his parole and the mental toll of spending three decades behind bars still dominate his existence.What’s My Age Again? With Katherine RyanView image in fullscreenAs always, she makes people open up … Katherine Ryan.Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images for SXSW LondonTaking a sideways route into the celebrity interview podcast, What’s My Age Again? has seen the likes of Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Romesh Ranganathan find out how old theyactuallyare, thanks to a nifty test that sees how well your all-important organs and tissues are faring for someone of your age. It feels low-stakes enough for casual listening, but – like most things Ryan is involved with – that initial breeziness belies its frankness, as guests open up about topics including adoption, addiction, and – in Ranganathan’s case – the health conditions he might be more susceptible to as a person of South Asian descent.What We SpendA perfect pod for the curious (read: nosy), What We Spend offers a peek into the bank accounts of others – their outgoings, sure, but also what they’ve been gifted by their parents, the debts they’re struggling to pay off, and the often exorbitant amounts they’re shelling out just to stay afloat. The Audacy series – hosted by Courtney Harrell – has also provided a vital, unvarnished look at the struggles facing Americans in 2025. Not least in its episode about Maxine – a trucker forced to eat, sleep and work in her vehicle to make ends meet – and a follow-up instalment titled America’s Working Homeless.The World of WodehouseView image in fullscreenA ray of sunshine … PG Wodehouse in 1968.Photograph: F Roy Kemp/Getty ImagesMuch like the work of probably the greatest comic writer ever to have lived, this homage is a ray of sunshine. Hosted by Alexander Armstrong, president of the PG Wodehouse Society UK, it marks 50 years since the novelist’s death by inviting celeb fans such as Stephen Fry, Lynne Truss and Ben Elton to enthuse about the joy the author has brought to their lives – followed by laugh-out-loud readings of his sparkling prose.

His trip took him from bustling Ghana to the tranquility of Tanzania – and sparked the idea for a playFemi Elufowoju JrFri 13 Jun 2025 06.15 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 06.21 EDTShareAt 53, I made myself a promise. Having built a reputation as the go-to authority on African culture in UK theatre, I realised with uncomfortable clarity that my knowledge barely scratched the surface of the continent’s vast complexity. What followed was an extraordinary seven-year quest to visit all 54 African nations before my 60th birthday – a journey that would ultimately transform into my ambitious new theatrical project, 54.60Africa.The catalyst came during a 2015 world tour with theatre company Complicité that took me to Cape Town. Standing in the shadow of Table Mountain, I confronted a paradox that had long troubled me: despite my Nigerian ancestry and theatrical expertise, my understanding of Africa remained frustratingly limited. Cape Town offered me an opportunity to begin addressing that knowledge gap, and one I was determined to seize.The journey that followed defied every preconception I held. In a hotel lodge in Mbabane in what was then Swaziland, a receptionist’s eyes widened with incredulity at my arrival – a reaction that spoke volumes about the rarity of Black guests. Yet it was the gardener the next morning who provided the trip’s emotional core, abandoning his work to sit beside me, explaining how long it had been since he’d conversed with another “brother” on the premises beyond his own visiting family.View image in fullscreenHe bangs the drums … Usifu Jalloh in rehearsals for 54.60 Africa.Photograph: Alex BrennerThese encounters multiplied across 54 nations, each challenging global narratives of crime, instability and economic hardship that I had unconsciously accepted. Instead, I found peace in Ghana’s bustling districts, tranquility along Tanzania’s roads and avant garde modernity in airports across the continent; I was blown away by Mali’s Modibo Keita International. Even in Khartoum, months before civil war erupted, I stood on Mac Nimir Bridge absorbing the capital’s calm while admiring the translucent Blue Nile – a moment that would later haunt me as I processed how quickly human-made turbulence could create mass displacement.The process of transforming my personal odyssey into a theatrical production began with a conversation. In 2007, I accompanied my friend Ivan Cutting on a research trip to Kenya for a production that never materialised. A decade later, when I mentioned writing a book about my travels, Ivan immediately suggested a play should follow.What emerged at Omnibus theatre in south London, and later at the NationalTheatreStudio, was something far more complex than I had expected. Early workshops revealed a troubling tendency: the story centred on me rather than Africa. 54.60 Africa was completed on my 60th birthday – 31 October 2022 – in Bangui, Central African Republic – exhausted, but ecstatic and proud of the feat. This milestone intervened to shift the focus, transforming my production into an exploration of how Africa interrogated the African I claimed to be.This realisation led to a crucial creative decision: representing my journey through 11 fictional characters rather than direct autobiography. Africa is more than one person, and I should never be bigger than our mighty continent. The fictional ensemble allowed me to convey collective experiences while platforming Africa as a source of progress, inspiration and immense dignity.View image in fullscreen‘Progress, inspiration and immense dignity’ … Femi Elufowoju Jr with the play’s cast.Photograph: Alex BrennerThe production reunited me with performers from my previous collaborations, who brought not just talent but vast repositories of knowledge drawn from oral storytelling traditions. Ayo-Dele Edwards, the first Nigerian-descent female performer to infuse UK theatre with authentic Yoruba songs, joined Sierra Leonean animateurs Patrice Naiambana and Usifu Jalloh, whose contributions to UK arts education stretch back to the mid-90s.For the music I turned to the Ganda Boys, Denis Mugagga and Daniel Sewagudde, who I discovered were instrumental in shaping London’s east African cultural movement. Their infectious compositions and melodious voices provided my production’s sonic backbone while their advocacy for social justice aligned perfectly with my mission.54.60 Africa arrives at a crucial moment for African representation in British theatre. Despite nearly three decades passing since I established Tiata Fahodzi in 1997, authentic African voices remain marginalised on major commercial stages. While regional theatres increasingly listen to their communities, the West End continues to shy away from genuine African stories, preferring sanitised interpretations such as The Lion King over authentic narratives.My central mission remains unchanged: debunking tropes associated with my continent. Through lighthearted dramatic construction accessible to all ages, 54.60 Africa offers audiences a fresh perspective on Africa’s true standards and incredible human endeavours, far removed from problematic western media narratives. In doing so, it challenges not just theatrical conventions but fundamental assumptions about a continent too often reduced to simplistic stereotypes.54:60 Africa is at the Arcola theatre, London, to 12 July.Journey of discovery: Femi Elufowoju Jr’s fondest memories from his trip through 54 countriesThe Bee Keeper Women ofKitui, Kenya,2007 (main picture, above)Meeting a bee-keeping group in a nearby village in the Kitui district of Nairobi.

The premise is essentially the same – you hop from venue to venue – but instead of drinking beers you browse books. Having begun as a trend among TikTok users, mainly in the US, the idea has begun to be adopted across the globe.There are a few “official” ways to try it out for your yourself:Bookshop Crawl UKorganises the London Bookshop Crawl, as well as crawls across the country,Bristol Walkfesthas organised a walking tour of the city’s numerous indies, and in April, theChicagoland Bookstore Crawlran an event for Independent Bookstore Day which rewarded participants who visited 10 shops on the day with 10% discount on books for the rest of the year. And theGlobal Book Crawlruns an annual event with 17 participating countries, from Ireland to Fiji.But mostly, bookshop crawls are much more casual affairs, with groups of friends or individuals using them as a way to explore a city and find their new favourite bookish spot. In this spirit, on a recent trip to London, I decided to take myself on a solo crawl. First, I checked out New Beacon Books in Finsbury Park, which is the longest running Black-owned bookstore in the UK, then went to Camden Town Bookshop and Primrose Hill Books. I loved exploring different parts of London and was able to pick up not only newer books that were on my to-read list but also older editions of childhood favourites – such as Jacqueline Wilson’s The Illustrated Mum, which I picked up in an Oxfam in Bloomsbury for about £2. It felt like a real treat to spend a full day drinking iced coffee and browsing bookshops – and definitely something I’ll be doing in future when I visit a new city.It was also helpful to have the specific goal of seeking out independent bookshops – so often when I’m looking to buy a book I just head to Waterstones or Foyles on autopilot. But indies can offer a sense of community and individuality that many of the big chains can’t, and are often beautiful, relaxing spaces to be in.American TikTok influencerEden Yonassays she has had “the best time” doing bookshop crawls when visiting new places. They are “an amazing way to prioritise indie bookstores that you may not visit in your day-to-day life,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We have the autonomy to have the books that we want to have, to celebrate what we want to celebrate and I hope that young people really love them and enjoy celebrating that individuality with all these book crawls,” she added.The only drawback of doing a book crawl is that, tempted by so many amazing books on sale, “you can very quickly end up with more books than bookshelf space,” Bex Hughes, founder and executive director of Bookshop Crawl UK says. “Other than that, there are no downsides!”“Oftentimes, the bookstores we go to are based solely on convenience,” Yonas says. “Putting aside the time on a weekend or a day off work to just say ‘here’s a list of places I’m going to check out, no matter how far or close’ is the best way to discover those hidden bookshop gems and give them the support that they deserve.”Independent Bookshop Weekis run by the Booksellers Association and will take place from 14-21 JuneExplore more on these topicsBooksBooksellersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Co-written byBrian Wilson, the tune describes a halcyon place where there’s always a party brewing and the romantic odds are in the narrator’s favor – two girls for every boy!In this rock’n’roll era just before the Beatles shook up the US, surf culture had gone mainstream via films (the Annette Funicello-Frankie Avalon vehicle Beach Party) and music (the ferocious guitarist Dick Dale, quirky hits like the Surfaris’ Wipe Out). Wilson’s ownBeach Boyswere arguably the driving force behind this movement, having debuted in late 1961 with Surfin’, a single that doubled as an early mission statement: “Surfin’ is the only life, the only way for me.” The fresh-faced band members struck wholesome poses in magazine ads, wearing matching plaid shirts while standing in a line clutching a surfboard, as they sang pristine, intricate harmonies that radiated warmth.By summer 1963, the Beach Boys’ second album, Surfin’ USA, was perched at number four on the album charts. The title track had been a top five hit several months before, thanks to hip-swiveling riffs, references to hip fashion and shout-outs to variousCalifornialocales (eg, Redondo Beach, La Jolla). For Wilson and the Beach Boys, the Golden state wastheplace to be for anyone who wanted to be cool. But California wasn’t exclusionary: in Surfin’ USA, the lyrics note thateverybody’s there in the water, meaning if you show up, you belong too.Whether wistful or euphoric, Brian Wilson made pop’s most overwhelmingly beautiful musicRead moreThe Beach Boys favored bucolic imagery in many of their songs, imagining California as a mythical place full of fancy cars (Little Deuce Coupe; the drag race chronicle Shut Down) with the best-looking women (California Girls) and tastiest surf reports (Catch a Wave). These lyrics captured charming – and innocent – scenes that resembled colorful postcards mailed to the rest of the world: joyriding to the beach, spending the day surfing and dreaming of romance. Wilson brought sophistication to these sun-kissed pop songs, elevating the music with virtuosic insights; for example, he later demonstrated to a journalist how Bach inspired California Girls. But the Beach Boys’ songs also positioned California as a place of its consistency; the state represented a respite from turbulent politics and shifting cultural norms.That’s not to say Wilson ignored the outside world. But The Warmth of the Sun, which was written and recorded in the wake of the 1963 assassination of John F Kennedy, doesn’t touch on the tragedy; instead, it’s a breakup song where the heartbroken protagonist finds a silver lining by turning to sunshine. In dark times, the sun is never far away; it’s always guaranteed to rise again or provide comfort.In ways big and small, Wilson established California as a place of possibility, where songs often possessed twinges of melancholy, but never lost their optimism. Surfer Girl nodded to When You Wish Upon a Star from Disney’s Pinocchio – a fitting reference for lyrics that wonder wistfully if the titular character will reciprocate a crush – while Wilson associated In My Room with teaching his brothers Carl and Dennis how to harmonize growing up. The title character of Noble Surfer survives oceanic uncertainty and triumphs over nature, a resilient and heroic figure on the water.Perhaps even more, Wilson viewed California as a place of sonic possibility. He produced the Beach Boys’ third album, 1963’s Surfer Girl, incorporating instrumentation from session icons the Wrecking Crew or flourishes like a trilling harp on Catch a Wave. And his magnum opus, Pet Sounds, while not explicitly about California, built on Phil Spector’s lush, Los Angeles-recorded creations and created a blueprint for the kaleidoscopic pop productions, including the Beach Boys’ own 1968 LP Friends.Yet the beachy early days remained a touchstone, a nostalgic place to revisit in song. The dewy California Feelin’, written in the early 1970s, notes: “Sunlight chased my cares away / The sun dances through the morning sky.” Decades later, Wilson released the solo album That Lucky Old Sun, a “concept album” that’s “about LA, and life in LA and the different kind of moods of LA. Call it the heartbeat of LA,”Wilson said.One of the most poignant songs on the album was Southern California, with a chorus that stresses that anything is possible: “In Southern California / Dreams wake up for you / And when you wake up here / You wake up everywhere.” Fittingly, the lyrics describe an idyllic day: a lazy, sunny day by the ocean capped by a cinematic night that resembles a romantic movie. But in the first verse, Wilson reminisces about something far more personal: hearing Surfin’ on the radio, and how that reminded him of singing with his brothers, his dream coming true.View image in fullscreenA sunflower lies on the Beach Boys’ star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.Photograph: Chris Pizzello/APWilson last toured with the Beach Boys in 2012 and retired from the road as a solo act in 2022. And while his musical influence is heard on a global scale – among other things, the Elephant 6 collective from Athens, Georgia, and the New York City punks the Ramones cite the band as an influence – the Beach Boys’ sound had an enormous impact closer to home. Think the gauzy California love letters of Best Coast; ambitious pop of Fleetwood Mac; surf-rock of Wavves; and the melodic chamber-pop of the Wondermints, the group that backed Wilson for years. Countless hip-hop artists have sampled the Beach Boys, while Beyoncé interpolated Good Vibrations on Cowboy Carter’s Ya Ya, and the French duo Air sampled Do It Again for Remember on Moon Safari.Twelve of Brian Wilson’s greatest songs – from surf to psychedelia and beyondRead moreOn a broader scale, Wilson’s songs have permeated pop culture in comedy and drama films (Happy Feet, Good Morning, Vietnam, The Big Chill) and TV shows (The Bear, WandaVision, Ted Lasso). On a TV show like Full House, Wilson and the Beach Boys became synonymous with an idealized version of sunny California.Fittingly, the Surf City Wilson once wrote about in 1963 now literally exists – Huntington Beach, California,officiallybecame known as Surf City USA in 2006 – and the Beach Boys still tour consistently, keeping Wilson’s California chronicles alive. “Together, we gave the world the American dream of optimism, joy, and a sense of freedom,” the band wrote on Facebook upon Wilson’s death. “Music that made people feel good, made them believe in summer and endless possibilities.”This article was amended on 13 June 2025 to reflect the fact that Brian Wilson was a co-writer, not sole writer, of the songs cited.Explore more on these topicsBrian WilsonCaliforniaBeach BoysLos AngelesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Asked how his grandfather might have reacted to the pass being reinstated, he said: “He’d probably say ‘about time too’.”The decision to revoke the pass is recorded in board minutes in 1895, when homosexuality was illegal: “The Trustees directed that Mr Oscar Wilde, admitted as a reader in 1879 and sentenced at the Central Criminal Court on 25th May to two years’ imprisonment with hard labour, be excluded from future use of the Museum’s Reading Room.”View image in fullscreenOscar Wilde in 1882.Photograph: Bettmann/Bettmann ArchiveWilde’s downfall followed his decision to sue Lord Queensberry, who had accused him of being a “sodomite” after discovering that his son, Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas, was Wilde’s lover. It led to Wilde being sentenced to two years of hard labour.Having been the toast of London society, Wilde died in abject poverty in Paris in 1900, aged 46. After his disgrace and imprisonment, his wife, Constance, fled to Europe with their two sons, Cyril and Vyvyan, and changed their surname to Holland, an ancestral family name.Holland said: “Oscar had been in Pentonville prison for three weeks when his [pass] to theBritish MuseumReading Room [now the British Library] was cancelled, so he wouldn’t have known about it, which was probably as well … It would have just added to his misery to feel that one of the world’s great libraries had banned him from books just as the law had banned him from daily life. But the restitution of his ticket is a lovely gesture of forgiveness and I’m sure his spirit will be touched.”In 2017, Wilde was assumed to be among more than 50,000 gay and bisexual men who were posthumously pardoned, although the Ministry of Justice said no individuals would be named.Holland said: “Oscar didn’t think there was anything wrong in same-sex love … I’m not absolutely certain he has been pardoned … If I had to ask for a pardon, I wouldn’t, because all it would do is make the British establishment feel better about itself … History’s history, and you can’t start rewriting it.”The British Library boasts arguably the world’s most significant collection of Wilde manuscripts, including drafts of his major plays, Lady Windermere’s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest.Laura Walker, the British Library’s lead curator of modern archives and manuscripts, said this extraordinary collection makes Wilde’s pass all the more meaningful: “We really want to honour Wilde now and acknowledge what happened to him. Section 11 of the law, which related to the criminalisation of homosexuality, was unjust.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

But he was not afraid to criticise the institution. When he published his long poem The Sphinx, he was asked why he had printed only a few copies. He replied: “My first idea was to print only three copies: one for myself, one for the British Museum, and one for Heaven. I had some doubt about the British Museum.”Holland joked that Wilde was “setting heaven and himself above the British Museum in a teasingly arrogant way” – a “slightly naughty throwaway remark about a very august institute, exactly the sort of thing that he would have regarded as being slightly stuffy and conventional”.He added: “He probably would [be] obliged now to make an apology … on … his rude remark … once they’d given him his pass back.”The British Library event – on 16 October, Wilde’s birthday – will include a public talk by Everett and Holland, launching the latter’s new book,After Oscar: The Legacy of a Scandal, an account of Wilde’s posthumous life.Explore more on these topicsOscar WildeBritish LibraryBritish MuseumLibrariesShareReuse this content"

They split the following year and while they reunited to tour on a couple of occasions, More is their first album since.The Guardian’s Alexis Petridis gave ita four-star review, writing: “A reformed band’s new album might be a placeholder, filled with songs that pad out the hits live, but provoke a rush on the bars and loos in the process. That definitely isn’t the case with More.”The band arenow on tour, playing two nights at London’s O2 Arena this weekend before dates in Birmingham and Manchester.Thanks to healthy physical sales, Pulp beat the US pop star Addison Rae to the No 1 spot. She is at No 2 with her debut album Addison – another critically acclaimed release, with theGuardian’s Shaad D’Souza sayingits “casually incisive tone suggests Rae might be a great popflâneusein the vein of Madonna or Janet Jackson”. Lotus, the sixth album from British rapperLittle Simz, is at No 3, a career high for the 31-year-old.Pulp: More review – anthems and rage for the next life stageRead moreAt No 4,Sabrina Carpenter’s album Short n’ Sweet makes her the female artist with the longest running spell in the UK Top 5 – it hasn’t dropped out since its release in August last year. The previous record holder was Shania Twain, whose Come on Over had a 41-week run between 1999 and 2000.Carpenter caused an online stir this week with the announcement of her new album Man’s Best Friend, thanks to a cover image depicting Carpenter on her knees with a man holding her by the hair, which some viewers found degrading.The lead single from it,Manchild, went straight to No 1 in the singles chart. It dethrones Alex Warren’s Ordinary, whose 12-week run at the top was a record for an American artist.Explore more on these topicsPulpUK chartsSabrina CarpenterPop and rockIndienewsShareReuse this content"

The video ends with a message from the ACLU that “all fathers deserve to be with their children on Father’s Day”, as well as a link to an ACLUpetitionto free Khalil.Khalil, a former graduate student atColumbia Universitywho helped organize pro-Palestinian protests at the school, was arrested by plainclothes immigration officials on 8 March, while walking home from dinner in New York City with his wife, Noor Abdalla. A green card holder with a student visa, Khalil has never been charged with a crime. The Trump administration seeks to deport him on the grounds that his beliefs constitute a threat to national security. Since March, he has been held in a Louisiana detention center 1,500 miles away from his family and the site of his arrest.The video begins with Khalil’s voice, speaking to his son over the phone from the detention center: “Yaba Deen, these are my first words to you,” he says over a clip of Deen in yellow pyjamas.To my newborn son: I am absent not out of apathy, but conviction | Mahmoud KhalilRead moreThe eight fathers then recite Khalil’s words, explaining how, as he wrote, “I am absent not out of apathy, but conviction.“How is it that the same politicians who preach ‘family values’ are the ones tearing families apart?” says Ali.“Loving you is not separate from the struggle for liberation,” says an emotional Amer, a Palestinian American comedian, in Khalil’s words. “It is liberation itself. I fight for you, and for every Palestinian child whose life deserves safety, tenderness and freedom.”“I am a Palestinian refugee, came to America, became a citizen in 2009, and in 2023 I had a son,” Amer said in a statement explaining his participation. “Mahmoud’s letter is like a dagger to the heart, and that’s why I’m doing this.”Added Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure star Winter: “I’m recording this as a father and a great believer in due process and the rule of law.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I can’t imagine being taken away from my child for speaking up for Iranian rights. I can’t imagine being taken away from my child for speaking up for veterans’ rights. All of which I have done in the past. And now I’m saying the same thing.“No human being deserves to be taken away from their child because of what they believe in,” he added. “That’s not what this country is made for.”Khalil’s arrest, the first in awave of detentionsof pro-Palestinian protesters in the US, ignited nationwide outcry in March. In April, an immigration judgeruledthat the Trump administration could deport him for his beliefs, siding with an administration memo that Khalil’s “current or expected beliefs, statements or associations” were counter to US foreign policy interests.But on Wednesday, a federal judgeruledthat the administration could no longer detain Khalil on that basis, but put his order on hold until Friday morning to allow the government to appeal.In hisruling, Judge Michael E Farbiarz wrote: “The petitioner’s career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled – and this adds up to irreparable harm.”Explore more on these topicsMahmoud KhalilMark RuffaloMahershala AliUS immigrationUS campus protestsColumbia UniversitynewsShareReuse this content"

In another, he begs for a letter to put him out of his misery: “I suffered you, I clawed my veins/Tiger and dove over your waist/In a duel of bites and lilies/So fill my madness with words/Or let me live in my calm/Forever dark night of the soul.”In an apparent attempt to force the family’s hand and bring about the sonnets’ publication in their original language, a group of intellectuals – whose names remain unknown – got hold of the poems. They had them printed and sent to 250 Lorca experts, cultural figures and journalists – and their plan worked.A year after that clandestine publication, the poet’s family consented to the publication of all the sonnets – although their decision to share them with the rightwing ABC newspaper raised some eyebrows, as did the paper’s refusal to use the word “homosexual” in any of its accompanying coverage.“What we’re talking about here is the last poems written by Lorca that appeared in a book that came out 50 years later,” said the writer Henrique Alvarellos, who oversaw the reproduced edition for his family’s eponymous publishing business.“We don’t want to enter into the minds of other people, but what we think happened is that there was a fear among Lorca’s closest circle and his family that publishing these poems would resuscitate some of the ghosts that weighed so heavily on the life and work ofFederico García Lorca.”While the post-FrancoSpainof the early 1980s was undergoing huge changes, he added: “There were still old, atavistic taboos and old habits that sprang from the worst of the Spanish spirit, so you can imagine that the publication of this edition – initially clandestinely – had an enormous impact on the country back then.”The idea for the new edition came after Alvarellos received a copy, via a third party, of one of the 250 booklets in the original print run. They now change hands for about €5,000 each. After blanking out the number​ lest the book be traced back to its owner, the publisher produced what he calls “a really rigorous and faithful reproduction of that original book, copying its paper and its texture. It’s a 100% faithful facsimile edition of the original”.Like the 1983 edition, the facsimile contains quotes from two of the fellow poets with whom Lorca had shared the sonnets.“The last time I saw him, he took me off to a corner and, almost in secret, he recited six or seven sonnets from memory that I can still remember because of their incredible beauty,” wrote the Chilean poetPablo Neruda.His fellow Nobel literature prize winner, the Spanish poetVicente Aleixandre, was equally moved when he heard them from Lorca’s lips: “All I could do was stare at him and say: ‘What a heart. So much love and so much suffering!’ He looked at me and smiled like a little boy.’”The Lorca biographer Ian Gibson, who was one of the original 250 recipients, swears he still does not know who was behind the little red book. Shortly after the sonnets were published by ABC, he visited Aleixandre to get his thoughts on the matter.“Aleixandre was also homosexual,” said Gibson. “And he said to me: ‘I can’t believe that I’ve read every single word in that supplement and the word homosexual doesn’t appear!’ It was incredible.”And yet, added Gibson, “the grammar – the adjectives and so on – make it explicit that he’s talking about homosexual love”.For the Irish hispanist, there are obvious comparisons between Lorca’s sonnets and the life and work of one of Gibson’s compatriots, Oscar Wilde.“It was the love that dared not speak its name,” he said. “That was the situation and these sonnets are very, very intimate. They are quite explicitly about homosexual love and the anguish involved. It’s there in the title of Amor Oscuro; this is difficult love; it’s an effort to illuminate the other side that could not be shown. And they’re very beautiful.”Explore more on these topicsFederico García LorcaSpainLGBTQ+ rightsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s hard to think of a more fitting pair to embody the disappointments of Britain in the late 20th century. Curtis’s signature style – a mix of archive deep dives and uncanny juxtapositions – still startles. Loss is the theme of Shifty: it’s a story of Britain losing industry, community and empire, and struggling to come to terms with the individualistic complexity that replaced these certainties. It takes a while for the narrative to sharpen, but Curtis’s films are often best understood as impressionistic art installations so maybe abstraction is their natural final destination.BBC iPlayer, from Saturday 14 JuneThe WaterfrontView image in fullscreenLine of succession … Holt McCallany as Harlan Buckley and Maria Bello as Belle Buckley in The Waterfront.Photograph: Dana Hawley/NetflixA wealthy businessman with a recent health scare reasserting himself as his adult children jostle for inheritance? This drama from Dawson’s Creek creator Kevin Williamson has echoes of Succession, albeit without that show’s razor-sharp wit or psychological acuity. It centres on the Buckley family, whose fishing dynasty is threatened by environmental regulations and corner-cutting competitors.

However, as this documentary shows, Ford, who became mayor in 2010, pushed this trend to extremes. It explores his unlikely appeal to voters as well as his chaotic lifestyle, which included allegations of sexual harassment and culminated in revelations about crack cocaine use in 2013.Netflix, from Tuesday 17 JuneSomebody Feed PhilView image in fullscreenMore please … Somebody Feed Phil.Photograph: NetflixThe indefatigable Philip Rosenthal has,for eight seasonsnow, occupied one of the most desirable niches on television: he gets to travel the world, eating the best every country has to offer.

We open our eyes and light floods in; the world is just there, waiting to be seen. But in reality there is an active element that we don’t notice. Our brains are always “filling in” our perceptual experience, supplementing incoming information with existing knowledge. For example, each of us has a spot at the back of our eye where there are no light receptors. We don’t see the resulting hole in our field of vision because our brains ignore it. The phenomenon we call “seeing” is the result of a continuously updated model in your mind, made up partly of incoming sensory information, but partly of pre-existing expectations. This is what is meant by the counter­intuitive slogan of contemporary cognitive science: “perception is a controlled hallucination”.A century ago, someone with an interest in psychology might have turned to the work of Freud for an overarching vision of how the mind works. To the extent there is a psychological theory even remotely as significant today, it is the “predictive processing” hypothesis. The brain is a prediction machine and our perceptual experiences consist of our prior experiences as well as new data. Daniel Yon’s A Trick of the Mind is just the latest popularisation of these ideas, but he makes an excellent guide, both as a scientist working at the leading edge of this field and as a writer of great clarity. Your brain is a “skull bound scientist”, he proposes, forming hypotheses about the world and collecting data to test them.The fascinating, often ingenious research reviewed here is sorely in need of an audience beyond dusty scientific journals. In 2017 a Yale lab recruited voice-hearing psychics and people with psychosis to take part in an experiment alongside non-voice-hearing controls. Participants were trained to experience auditory hallucinations when they saw a simple visual pattern (an unnervingly easy thing for psychologists to do). The team was able to demonstrate that the voice-hearers in their sample relied more heavily on prior experience than the non-voice-hearers. In other words, we can all cultivate the ability to conjure illusory sound based on our expectations, but some people already have that propensity, and it can have a dramatic effect on their lives.To illustrate how expectations seep into visual experience, Yon’s PhD student Helen Olawole-Scott managed to manipulate people’s ratings of the clarity of moving images they had seen. The key detail is that when participants had been led toexpectless clarity in their perception, that is exactly what they reported. But the clarity of the image on the screen wasn’t really any poorer.It’s sometimes a shame that Yon’s book doesn’t delve deeper. In Olawole-Scott’s experiments, for example, does Yon believe that it was participants’ visual experience itself that became less clear, or just their judgments about the experience? Is there a meaningful difference? He also avoids engaging with some of the limitations of the predictive processing approach, including how it accounts for abstract thought. Challenges to a hypothesis are interesting, and help illuminate its details. In an otherwise theoretically sophisticated discussion this feels like an oversight.One of the most enjoyable things popular science can do is surprise us with a new angle on how the world operates. Yon’s book does this often as he draws out the implications of the predictive brain. Our introspection is unreliable (“we see ourselves dimly, through a cloud of noise”); the boundary between belief and perception is vaguer than it seems (“your brain begins to perceive what it expects”); and conspiracy theories are probably an adaptive result of a mind more open to unusual explanations during periods of greater uncertainty. This is a complex area of psychology, with a huge amount of new work being published all the time. To fold it into such a lively read is an admirable feat.A Trick of the Mind: How the Brain Invents Your Reality by Daniel Yon is published by Cornerstone (£22).

But otherwise this is a richly sympathetic and thoroughly enjoyable portrait of an authentic queen of American musical theatre and movies; there is some wonderful modern-day interview footage of Minnelli, talking with waspish candour about herself, and apart from a slight vocal tremor, very robust. There is a great moment when, after having a FaceTime conversation with Mia Farrow, Minnelli is shown looking sharply at her own face in the little box in a corner of the screen: she instinctively frowns, pouts, assessing herself.That voice, with its unmistakable little gulp, or chuckle or suppressed sob that surfaces in the middle of an extended musical line, emerges as an extension of the way she talks with the media and – as far it’s possible to see this – in private. She got this weaponised vulnerability and superpower-fragility, you must assume, from her troubled mother, Judy Garland. We see the famous (or notorious) moment when they appeared together at the London Palladium and Judy started grabbing Liza’s microphone, pushing it closer to her mouth, suddenly aware of competition, wanting to school her on stage – or embarrass her. The imperious and shrewd sense of how things are going to play on camera no doubt comes from her late father Vincente Minnelli, who also showed her Louise Brooks’s hairstyle just before she did Cabaret, a look that Liza adopted for the rest of her life.From her unofficial godmother, the writer and dancer Kay Thompson, Minnelli learned the never-say-die ethos of the show going on, from Charles Aznavour she learned to dramatise the grit, the sorrow, the interior melancholy of a song. From designer Roy Halston she got the clothes. Then Broadway legend Bob Fosse and composer and lyricist John Kander and Fred Ebb gave her the role of a lifetime in Cabaret’s brilliant, sexy and thrillingly damaged survivor Sally Bowles, a persona which she was able to modify and reproduce in various forms for the rest of her career.And what of the un-hilarious tragicomedy of Minnelli’s marriages? The star herself gets this film’s biggest laugh with her wearied response: “Give me a gay break …” Her first husband was singer-songwriter Peter Allen (“She was devastated when she found Peter in a compromising situation with another man”); her second was producer Jack Haley Jr, son of Jack Haley from The Wizard of Oz (“Dorothy’s daughter marries the Tin Man’s son!”); her third was a carpenter and sculptor Mark Gero, about whom we learn nothing other than his civilian status, and the fourth was the manipulative David Gest, who was not candid about his gay existence. (Someone has to write a musical about these four men: The Four Husbands ofLiza Minnelli.) There is an awful poignancy in Minnelli’s attempts to have a baby, which were heartbreakingly unsuccessful.Like Garland, Minnelli has a gay fanbase which is passionate in its emotional connection and connoisseurship – and perhaps coming to terms with this, and compartmentalising it alongside her own heterosexual identity, is something which Garland actually managed rather better than her daughter. Otherwise she had doomed relationships with Desi Arnaz Jr, in the face of opposition from his mother, Lucille Ball, and with Peter Sellers – all amazingly unworkable situations, like the six impossible things that the White Queen could believe before breakfast. Perhaps, in the end, Liza Minnelli’s authentic relationship was with the audience.Liza: A Truly Terrific Absolutely True Story is on digital platforms from 16 June.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsLiza MinnelliMusicals (Film)Musicals (Stage)TheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

A Rodgers and Hammerstein triple bill at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre reawakens the traditionLyndsey WinshipFri 13 Jun 2025 03.26 EDTLast modified on Fri 13 Jun 2025 12.29 EDTShare‘They’re annoying and stupid and slow everything down. Nobody likes a dream ballet!” That’s a quote from Apple TV+’sSchmigadoon!, the musical theatre parody that could only have been made by people who absolutely love (almost) all things musicals. Drew McOnie is having none of it. “Maybe we should put that on the poster,” he jokes, since he has commissioned a triple bill of dream ballets for hisinaugural seasonas artistic director at Regent’s Park Open Air theatre.What’s a dream ballet anyway, you may ask. It’s the bit in a musical where the dialogue and songs stop and dance takes over, often to delve into the psyche of a character at a crossroads. Agnes de Mille’s original dream ballet for 1943’s Oklahoma! was called Laurey Makes Up Her Mind – she had to decide between two suitors – and it was a major moment for dance on Broadway. Other famous dream ballets include in the 1951 film An American in Paris, where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron spend 17 minutesdancing through elaborate painted stage-sets of Paris, or Singin’ in the Rain’s Broadway Melody, a film within a film.View image in fullscreenRehearsals for Carousel, choreographed by Kate Prince.Photograph: Johan PerssonSome musical theatre fans may think all that dancing interrupts the action, but McOnie couldn’t agree less. “I’ve been completely captivated by them since I was a kid. I was obsessed with them,” he says. In fact, he had the idea for this triple bill when he was 16. “I embarrassed myself by pulling out some original artwork that I’d made for it, begging someone to let me do it,” he laughs at his precociousness. Rather than reproduce the originals, McOnie’s idea was to reinterpret three classic De Mille dream ballets, from Oklahoma!, Carousel and Allegro (“Which I think nobody’s seen”). Luckily, in the intervening 23 years, McOnie has gone from ambitious dance student to award-winning choreographer (In the Heights, Jesus Christ Superstar, Hairspray), West End andBroadwaydirector (Strictly Ballroom, King Kong) and now the top job at Regent’s Park, so he doesn’t have to beg to realise his ideas any more, and this one was straight on the list for his first season.Choreographer Kate Prince: ‘Hip-hop is like a massive jar of honey’Read moreMcOnie explains that the power of the dream ballet lies in “being able to express something that words aren’t able to, the inner psychology of a character like Laurey”. De Mille’s work on Oklahoma! was, he says, “completely gamechanging”. “It liberated our form of storytelling and offered something really human and deeply revealing about the characters. I’ve always been fascinated by the idea of giving choreographers the pen for a moment to write the story.”Back in the day, McOnie imagined himself making the ballets, but now he’s commissioned three very different choreographers to do it instead. There’sShelley Maxwell, who works mostly as a movement director in theatre and film (from plays at the National Theatre to superhero film The Marvels);Kate Prince, best known for hip-hop company ZooNation and Message in a Bottle set to Sting songs, as well as the musical Everyone’s Talking About Jamie; andJulia Cheng, who started out in hip-hop and waacking but has gone on to choreograph for award-winning musical revivals of Cabaret and Fiddler on the Roof. McOnie admits Cheng first came on to his radar because he desperately wanted the choreography job on Cabaret himself. “And when I went to see the show, I said, this is just brilliant, and so, so different to what I would have done.”View image in fullscreenRehearsals for Oklahoma! choreographed by Shelley Maxwell.Photograph: Johan PerssonThat’s exactly the idea here, to do something McOnie wouldn’t have thought of, something “untraditional”, he says. The choreographers are not confined by the stories of the original musicals, but have been asked to take the music as inspiration to do something they wouldn’t normally do, dancing to the rich, orchestral scores ofRodgers and Hammerstein.When I meet Prince a couple of days into rehearsal, that rich, orchestral sound from Carousel has got her flummoxed. Unlike the usual hip-hop and R&B soundtracks she uses, “There’s not a beat in sight!” she says. “I am well out of my comfort zone!” When she first listened to the music, “all I could envisage was people in sailor suits skipping around playing the flute”. Prince has been working with orchestratorSimon Haleto strip back the music in places, “and not have to have the whole shebang. The shebang’s amazing,” she adds, “but all the way through it feels a bit much.”Shelley Maxwell: the soul-stirring master mover who makes superheroes danceRead moreIn the studio, there are no sailor suits and no skipping. Instead her dancers – including Tommy Franzen, winner of best male dancer at the recent NationalDanceawards – are working on locking and lyrical breaking and other hip-hop styles. “I find the fast, staccato string sections are really fun to do isolations to,” says Prince. The dancers are tethered to bungee cords, representing the things in their pasts that are holding them back, with Franzen as the villain at the centre pulling the strings. “He never plays the villain, he’s always the goodie!” she adds, delightedly.A couple of miles down the road in east London, the waltzing, swirling strains of Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’ from Oklahoma! emerge from a different dance studio, instantly conjuring up images of prairies, cowboys and wholesome farm girls. For Maxwell, it took a while to get her head out of the MGM musicals she grew up with and find a different approach. In the end she’s using the music’s familiarity to her advantage. It’s an orchestral version of the song, but as soon as you hear it, you can’t help think of the words, “Oh what a beautiful morning ...” and Maxwell’s dance is like a sarcastic take on that: Is it a beautiful morning? Really? Her piece sees characters morphing into clowns and is a comment on the current political landscape, which “feels slightly like a circus”.Dance isn’t just showgirls – it can tell the stories of everybodyDrew McOnieMaxwell loves the possibilities of the dream ballet as a form, “when the character needs to express themselves in a way that goes beyond words”, but it has to be said they’re not very common in contemporary musicals. Perhaps because dance is integrated much more into shows than it was. “It used to be you’d have your opera chorus and a ballet chorus and your actors,” says McOnie. “Now companies are expected to be able to do everything.”View image in fullscreenSwept away … Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan in Maestro.Photograph: TCD/Prod DB/AlamyAlong with De Mille, Jerome Robbins was another great choreographer of dream ballets – although the film version of West Side Story cut its dream ballet from the number Somewhere after Robbins was sacked halfway through filming (it still has the dance at the gym, where Tony and Maria first meet and the rest of the world falls away).Bradley Cooperpaid homage to Robbins in his Leonard Bernstein biopic, Maestro, when he and Carey Mulligan get swept into a dance scene based on the ballet Fancy Free and On the Town, the musical it spawned (the scene was choreographed by New York City Ballet’s Justin Peck). It captures their love affair, and was an alternative, Cooper has said, to doing a predictable montage of their relationship. Cooper trained hard, apparently, to be able to do all the dancing himself.Dream ballets have popped up in other films, too. The Coen Brothers are fans, having Tim Robbins dance to Carmen in the The Hudsucker Proxy, and the surreal dancing girls with bowling-pin headdresses in The Big Lebowski. Even I’m Just Ken from the Barbie movie has been called a dream ballet, although it’s a song rather than an instrumental, but it’s an extended dance scene that gives an insight into a character’s psychology, so why not.View image in fullscreenRehearsals for Allegro, choreographed by Julia Cheng.Photograph: Johan PerssonBack at Regent’s Park, Cheng is busy at work on a scene that wouldn’t look out of place in some of the early musicals. One of her inspirations was Looney Tunes cartoons of the 1930s and 40s, because that’s what the music from Allegro reminded her of, and the dance has a bouncy, jazzy feel with sharp comic timing and lots of props to play with – umbrella, newspaper, police officer’s helmet.Fishnets out, waacking in! Julia Cheng on how she has transformed CabaretRead more“I was thinking about how heavy the world is right now,” she tells me, “and I didn’t want to do anything like that. I wanted to do a humorous, light piece, a comedy, but it’s got a harder context underneath.” Her piece is set around a park bench where a dreamer/nomad character pushes his belongings in a shopping trolley, and there’s a moral about appreciating the simple things in life (you’ll have to go and see it to find out more).For all the challenges of making a dream ballet, Prince tells me how excited she is about what McOnie is doing at Regent’s Park. “I don’t know of any other organisations that have appointed someone who is predominantly a choreographer as artistic director. That’s a breath of fresh air, as well as the fact that the first thing he does is programme something like this and promote three female choreographers.”McOnie is a great advocate for dance, just as De Mille was in her day. “It’s basically the belief that there is a value in this tool of storytelling, that dance isn’t just showgirls, that it can tell the stories of everybody,” he says. “So that’s why I love dream ballets, and, you know, I’d love to put them back into musicals wherever possible!”Dream Ballets: A Triple Bill is atRegent’s Park Open Air theatre, London, 19-22 JuneExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreDanceBalletRodgers and HammersteinCoen brothersBradley CooperfeaturesShareReuse this content"

On Sunday, the Succession actor Sarah Snookwon the Tonyfor best actress in a play for her 26 roles inThe Picture of Dorian Gray; two years earlier, Jodie Comer won for her equally kinetic solo performance inPrima Facieand just this week, John Krasinski’s (mostly) solo showAngry Alanopened off-Broadway. The appeal is clear: the one-man show is a flex, a feat of performance under a significant amount of pressure. It takes a village, always, but it all comes down to the person on stage.Luckily for Call Me Izzy, writer and journalist Jamie Wax’s debut play onBroadway, that person is Jean Smart. The 73-year-old actor, most famous, at least at the moment, for her starring turn on the Max comedy Hacks, possesses the kind of seasoned verve and magnetic presence that is never less than fun to watch, even if the material can’t match her. Like her Emmy-winning Hacks character Deborah Vance, Smart is making the most of a late-career renaissance, surfing a wave of goodwill to the bright lights at Studio 54 for her first Broadway role in a quarter century, where she plays a woman with starkly different means – though no less resilience.Those means are strikingly – one might say a little too strikingly – sparse. We first meet Isabelle Scutley, neé Fontenot, in the fall of 1989, cleaning the toilet in her trailer’s bathroom – her home’s one source of privacy and the stage’s one consistent set (stocked with period-specific cleaning supplies by scenic designer Mikiko Suzuki MacAdams). Her vocabulary and bank of literary references, recited from memory in reveries shaded, in this staging by Sarna Lapine, by elegiac blue light (lighting design Donald Holder) are expansive; her words, in Smart’s convivial, conspiratorial delivery, are truncated, as is her life in the small town of Mansfield, Louisiana, where she was born and where she has always remained.Angry Alan review – John Krasinski gets red-pilled in a tense, timely playRead moreOnce a promising student with a preternatural gift for language, Izzy was whisked to the trailer park by a marriage at 17 – such was “the natural order of things”, she tells us – and has been beaten down ever since. Her husband Ferd, which in Izzy’s thick Louisiana drawl mutates to Irv, Erd or Thurd with each mention, is an alcoholic pipe fitter with a vicious mean streak. (Smart, who grew up in Seattle, worked with a dialect coach; as a midwesterner, I am simply unfit to judge the accuracy of the results.) He hates when she reads, spits on her dreams, rages when she has a personality and refuses to call her by her desired name, Izzy. Smart plays him, via Izzy’s inner monologue, with a skin-crawling sneer.For an unspecified number of years, Izzy has turned inward, writing poems on toilet paper in the bathroom with her eyebrow pencil and hiding them in her Tampax box – the one place Ferd would never look – the Tampax box then concealed by a piece of fabric, as they are too poor even for cabinets. (In the way of Hollywood these days, Smart’s character is a vague age somewhere between 40 and her own.) Stalled out in survival mode, an escape hatch emerges via a new friend named Rosalie and a library card, her “secret ticket to anywhere”. Reading gives way to a romance with Shakespeare’s sonnets (and more recitation), to validation, recognition, acclaim and a collision course with Ferd’s willingness to physically beat any self-worth out of her.There’s an inherent charge to seeing Izzy, as imbued with Smart’s natural charisma, break free; the script is peppered with wizened, self-deprecating cracks that Smart relishes: “I can fake an orgasm but I can’t fake a hug worth shit,” she quips. But there’s also an inescapable discomfort to milking such abject need, to hearing such graphic descriptions of physical abuse, for the sympathy of Broadway audiences at hundreds of dollars a pop. Smart is, obviously, a gifted comic actor and extremely compelling storyteller, but her gravity cannot overcome the nagging sense that this story – an indisputably genius writer overcomes indisputably dire circumstances via grit and the power of education – is the theatrical equivalent of the poverty porn that has baited Oscar voters for years.Smart, as ever, imbues her characters with rough edges and idiosyncrasies, world-weariness coupled with an endearing naivety; her plaintive, rueful delivery of a brief description of reconciliation after a beating, how his regret provoked a feeling of closeness akin to a drug, hints at a more complicated version of the woman than on the page. It’s easy to cheer for Smart, and as evidenced by rounds of pitying applause at Studio 54, a little too easy for this show.Explore more on these topicsBroadwayUS theaterTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

They found common ground over their shared love of psychedelic music and spent long, woozy nights jamming together. But while one wanted to focus on live electronics, the other secretly wanted to start a band. The outcome was Dâdalus & Bikarus, a project which sits somewhere between these two worlds, welding elements of krautrock, punk and big beat into tripped-out dancefloor rhythms.View image in fullscreenCover art for Off the ShelfTheir second album, Off the Shelf, captures the obsessive energy of those early nocturnal experiments, which they’ve since built a reputation for in their live shows. Anchored by drawn-out loops, each track slowly builds tension to dizzying, near-erotic heights. On Erebros, this takes place across a hefty 11 minutes: led by propulsive drums and a scuttling bass riff, the track pushes and pulls, eventually developing into an angular acid-punk workout. In Kill Your Feed, another standout, a simple drum sequence gradually kicks into a shuffling Madchester-esque groove, with plenty of feedback along the way. For all their repetition, the instrumentals are moreish and never dull, thanks also to the ominous sirens and metallic clangs scattered throughout. Merz’s vocals are similarly enticing, channelling Peter Murphy’s moody drawl at points, and gruff EBM-style yelpsat others.The less club-minded tracks are just as compelling. Kuhlio, about halfway through, sounds like it was snatched from the score of an 80s horror flick: weightysynths hang over it like a grey cloud. There are moments throughout the record when the storm clears: a dreamy arpeggiated synth line drifting over a swampy rhythm, or the sounds of tropical birds and trickling water that linger between songs. But even these intermissions are disquieting, only amping the intensity in this whirlwind of an album.Also out this monthThe latest from the brilliant DIY Basque label Hegoa iss/t, a small-batch tape release from a little-known artist calledJmur. It’s a lovely, cosy listen, full of rudimentary folk-pop jams and modular excursions from across his life. Highlights include a take on When You Sleep by My Bloody Valentine, with a granular quality that only adds to its melancholy feeling.Another charming collection of songs comes viaA Profound Non-Event, the debut album by Sydney-based groupDaily Toll(released by Tough Love). Think folky guitars, homespun production and unfussy lyrics with vocals so unaffected they recall the intimacy of K Records indie pop.One for the later hours isThe Art of Memoryby Salon des Amateurs affiliatesSequence of Events(Subject to Restrictions Discs).

Its intricate, creeping webs provided a kind of map for Hymnal’s unusual perspective on “devotional” music, which moves beyond earthly religions to celebrate the beauty and terror of the universe. Rummaging through folk, gospel, dance and Pramuk’s classical training, Hymnal sounds like everything, all at once – a primordial soup of styles, genres and textures that is dazzling and plainly difficult to bend your ears around.View image in fullscreenLyra Pramuk: HymnalThe American artist’s astonishing 2020 album Fountain was made only with digital manipulations of her voice, and a continuing interest in the non- (or nearly) verbal runs through Hymnal: breathy, wheezing vocal samples scratch against heavily processed strings, harvested through collaborative sessions with Berlin’s Sonar Quartett. On early track Unchosen, a looping bow-stroke chimes alongside burbling vocalisations to mesmeric effect, and it is startling to hear fully articulated words finally emerge on single Meridian, as if Pramuk’s mass of sound has organically mastered speech.Complicated and dense, Hymnal demands deep listening – no bad thing – but its repetitive, jerking movements and myriad layers often become samey and numbing, with Pramuk’s fascinating ideas buried in the murk. It’s a hard-earned treat when penultimate (and aptly named) Solace offers a sweet, clear melody that flows uninterrupted, before rushing towards a frantic, polyphonic climax. Here, Pramuk’s post-classical techniques sound both timeless and prescient, and her vision for the universe feels truly welcoming, rather than alienating.Explore more on these topicsMusicElectronic musicExperimental musicalbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Almost all video game characters were hypermasculine military men, unrealistically curvaceous fantasy women wearing barely enough armour to cover their nipples, or cartoon animals. Most of these characters catered exclusively to straight teenage boys (or, I guess, furries); overt queer representation in games was pretty much nonexistent until the mid 2010s. Before that, we had to take what we could get. And what I had was Link, fromThe Legend of Zelda.View image in fullscreenLink.Composite: Guardian Design;  Zuma Press/AlamyLink is a boy, but he didn’t really look like one. He wore a green tunic and a serious expression under a mop of blond hair. He is the adventurous, mostly silent hero of the Zelda games, unassuming and often vulnerable, but also resourceful, daring and handy with a sword. In most of the early Zelda games, he is a kid of about 10, but even when he grew into a teenager in 1998’s Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64, he didn’t become a furious lump of muscle. He stayed androgynous, in his tunic and tights. As a kid, I would dress up like him for Halloween, carefully centre-parting my blond fringe. Link may officially be a boy, but for me he has always been a non-binary icon.As time has gone on and game graphics have evolved, Link has stayed somewhat gender-ambiguous. Gay guys and gender-fluid types alike appreciate his ageless twink energy. And given the total lack of thought that most game developers gave to players who weren’t straight and male, I felt vindicated when I found out that this was intentional. In 2016, the Zelda series’ producer Eiji Aonuma toldTime magazinethat the development team had experimented a little with Link’s gender presentation over the years, but that he felt that the character’s androgyny was part of who he was.“[Even] back during the Ocarina of Time days, I wanted Link to be gender neutral,” he said. “I wanted the player to think: ‘Maybe Link is a boy or a girl.’ If you saw Link as a guy, he’d have more of a feminine touch. Or vice versa … I’ve always thought that for either female or male players, I wanted them to be able to relate to Link.”Meet the gaymers: why queer representation is exploding in video gamesRead moreAs it turns out, Link appeals perhaps most of all to those of us somewhere in between. In 2023, the tech blog io9spoke to many transgenderand non-binary people who saw something of themselves in Link: he has acquired a reputation as an egg-cracker, a fictional character who prompts a realisation about your own gender identity.Despite their outdated reputation as a pursuit for adolescent boys, video games have always been playgrounds for gender experimentation and expression. There are legions of trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming people who first started exploring their identity with customisable game characters in World of Warcraft, or gender-swapping themselves in The Sims – the digital equivalent of dressing up. Video games are the closest you can come to stepping into a new body for a bit and seeing how it feels.It is no surprise to me thata lot of queer peopleare drawn to video games. A 2024 survey by GLAAD found that 17% of gamers identify as LGBTQ+, a huge number compared with the general population. It may be because people who play games skew younger – 40 and below – but I also think it’s because gender is all about play. What fun it is to mess with the rules, subvert people’s expectations and create your own character. It is as empowering as any world-saving quest."

I grow my hair and beard to look like him, while immersing myself in his work.On 24 March – his birthday – I dress as Morris and finish the quarter with some kind of absurd performance to highlight pressing social issues that he was concerned about, and that I want more people to focus on today.I first came up with the idea in 2020, but I had been reading and thinking about Morris for nearly a decade.Like Morris, I’m a middle-class artist and designer. And, also like him, I’m a compromised socialist. In 2020, after taking a five-year career break to look after my kids while my wife went back to work, I was 37 and feeling conflicted about returning to the art world. Throughout my life, I have wanted to create work with a social purpose. Yet the only way to make a decent living out of art is by operating in the high-end market.Researching Morris inspired me. He dedicated most of his life to creating a socialist movement in the UK – but he also said he felt conflicted about“ministering to the swinish luxury of the rich”. He made objects using natural materials and gave craftspeople some autonomy, so his products always ended up too expensive for most people.I was worried I would have the same experience when it came to making my own socially conscious art. But Morris gave me comfort. He was privileged like me, and yet he dedicated himself to the arts and to social purposes such as socialism. He provided a guide for me to get back into my artistic practice.Each 1 January, I begin my Morris quarter by rereading his 1890 novelNews from Nowhere. I read his other works, too, and try to build skill sets he had. I’ve had singing lessons to sing his socialist chants, made prints on his letter press in his house in Hammersmith, west London, and designed wallpaper based on the River Lea. Morris knew the river well and named one of his patterns after it. I’ve also made socialist flags in Leyton, east London, where his mum lived while Morris was at Oxford.I get some funny comments when I drop my kids off at school dressed as MorrisI’ve even attempted to write poetry. He was most famous in his lifetime for being a poet – he turned down the poet laureateship. I have also learned embroidery from my mother and taught it to my children. Morris taught his daughter, May, to embroider, and she became one of the greatest craftspeople in Britain.I get some funny comments when I drop my kids off at school dressed as Morris. Otherwise, no one where I live – in Hackney, eastLondon– ever gives me a second glance, as big beards and hair, and Victorian suits are trendy here.My children think what I do is very funny, while my wife hates my beard and can’t wait for me to shave it off. But I intend to keep my Morris quarter going for ever.Each year, my finale performance is different. This year, Icreated a digital plum orchardin Trafalgar Square, because Morris envisaged an actual orchard there in News from Nowhere. The novel is set in the year 2102, where everyone lives in an eco-utopia.Another time, I went fishing for salmon in the Thames, dressed in a Victorian workwear suit like Morris, because there is a famous sketch of him fishing in the Thames byDante Gabriel Rossetti. In News from Nowhere, the river is healthy enough for salmon to live in, but there’s no chance of finding salmon there today. Last year, I gave one of his speeches and flew a red handmade socialist flag at theWilliam Morris Gallery in Walthamstowfor his birthday.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

And I do it because we live in ridiculous times: it’s a ridiculous thing to do.Becoming Morris has made me feel more confident about my position in the world – that it’s OK to be an artist with a social purpose, and in fact it’s more needed than ever. It gives me a feeling of solace and validity. It helps me carry on.As told to Donna FergusonDo you have an experience to share?

Farmers turned hay in some of Europe’s highest alpine meadows, framed by jagged Dolomite peaks glowing in soft evening light. We can recommend staying at theHotel Schmung, a family-run gem with delicious northern Italian food and direct access to scenic hikes. Rifugios provide great lunch stops along the trails.

Most Brits seem to keep to the valleys and the beautiful villages and towns but among my highlights of the area is the opportunity to compare the fare at the variousfermes aubergesthat are scattered over the hills.

It can be approached from the dramatic Asco Gorge. For hikers, a network of donkey trails reveals arresting views, river pools and lost worlds, such as the abandoned village of Sepula. There are a couple of remote campsites off the gorge. There’s a ski resort halfway up Mount Cinto where the more challenging cross-islandGR20 mountain hiking pathcan be joined. Late spring is the most enchanting time to visit.DidierA perfect chalet in heavenly MontenegroView image in fullscreenA mountainside path in Durmitor national park.Photograph: Ljubomir Stalevic/Getty ImagesWe spent a heavenly week in Gornja Brezna, Montenegro, a peaceful village 1,000 metres above sea level, surrounded by mountains and with a turquoise river canyon (the Piva) to explore. Days were warm and nights cool. We pootled about on rusty bikes, got coffee at the Etno village restaurant, befriended local dogs, went on herb walks and ran about naked in the birch woods, as well as making bigger excursions toDurmitor national park. We stayed at Nikola’s beautifulBrezan Lug chalet, in its own private woodland, with hot tub, barbecue, fire pit and all mod cons.BethHigh campiing in northern AlbaniaView image in fullscreenOur tipster Alex took a ferry on Lake Koman.Photograph: Hugh Mitton/AlamyMy partner and I had a magical time in the northern Albanian mountains. From Shkodër, we made our way to the Valbona valley national park via a two-night stay on (and boat across) Lake Koman. Once in Valbona, we camped with permission on the grounds ofHotel Rilindja, where the owner offered a wealth of hiking tips. From our base, we embarked on a series of spectacular hikes, including a three-day circular toÇerem. The first two days we saw no one apart from shepherds (and a few vipers, which were given a wide berth) before hitting a slightly more travelled section, where we encountered a handful of fellow hikers. The views were breathtaking; the hospitality, affordable and welcoming; and the experience, incomparable.AlexMountain cabins on Sweden’s King’s trailView image in fullscreenThe mountains of Nallo.Photograph: Alena Vishina/AlamyThe mountains and glaciers surrounding the mountain hut at Nallo in north-west Sweden were so spectacular last year that I’m returning to stay for longer in July. It’s roughly seven miles off the popularKungsleden trail(King’s trail) that winds its way through Lapland. There’s no mobile phone reception, or food, so bring your own supplies. These can be bought at the trailheads, three days’ walk away, or at other mountain huts along the way. What you find at Nallo is awelcoming cabin with a host(£32 for a bunk bed), cozy bunk beds and peace.Catherineskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As you walk away from the sundial, the planets are revealed sequentially in large metal sculptures, informative panels and a hand-cranked audio track. Each one appears at its proportionate distance and size from the sun, so Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars and Jupiter are soon ticked off on a shallow climb. Twenty minutes later, a striking silver-ringed Saturn overlooks magnificent views of the valley and down to the Rhône a kilometre below. Uranus presages a refreshing paddle in a mountain stream, good preparation for a steeper, but manageable, 30-minute scramble to Neptune and lunch at 2,300 metres, distracted by panoramic views of the Swiss Alps from the deck of the 19th-centuryHotel Weisshorn.Bryan ConwayRare flowers high in Italy’s ApenninesView image in fullscreenAlpine asters in Abruzzo.Photograph: Nature Picture Library/AlamyI hiked through the Maiella national park in Abruzzo, just two hours east of Rome, where marsican brown bears,Abruzzo chamoisand wolves roam while griffon vultures soar above. The drought-tolerant vegetation and steep-sided valleys conceal caves that were once inhabited by hermits – it was amazing to imagine what it must have been like living there. Flowering plants galore, with rarities such as the Apennine edelweiss, Apennine gentian, Alpine aster and dryas (a glacial relic) on the high peaks. Exploring ancient pathways and clambering up rocky slopes rewarded me with far-reaching views over the Adriatic Sea.Monique GadellaRisqué mountain, GermanyView image in fullscreenA viewing platform on Mount Wank.Photograph: myLAM/AlamyRather than ascend the expensive and crowded Zugspitze (Germany’s highest mountain at 2,962 metres), during a summer visit to Garmisch-Partenkirchen we instead opted for a cable car up the magnificently namedMount Wank(1,780 metres). We were rewarded with lush mountain meadows, superb views of the valley below and peace and quiet. A cold beer on the sun terrace at theSonnenalm restaurantis a must. If you have the energy, you can walk the well-marked trail back to the town or head down on theWankbahn.Travis RobertsWinning tip: Going with the flow in Spain’s Sierra NevadaView image in fullscreenTheacequia(irrigation channels) of the Alpujarras in Andalucía make for great walking routes.Photograph: geogphotos/AlamyWalking theacequiasof the Alpujarras in the southern Sierra Nevada, following 1,200-year-old irrigation systems built by the Moors while the snow-capped peaks above soar to almost 3,500 metres.

The quantities make more honeycomb than you need here, but extra snacking is inevitable.

Put the sugar and golden syrup in a deep saucepan and heat gently until the sugar melts. Turn up the heat, let the mixture come to a boil, and heat to 150C on a sugar thermometer.Take off the heat, tip in the bicarb, then stir quickly and thoroughly with a rubber spatula or whisk until well incorporated (be very careful, because the boiling-hot mixture will bubble up). Carefully pour the hot honeycomb into the lined tin, leave it to sit for an hour or so to firm up, then break into rough chunks.Put the cherries, sugar and lemon juice in a small saucepan, heat gently until it comes to a boil, then turn down to a simmer and cook for three to five minutes, until the mix turns syrupy. Take off the heat and leave to cool completely.To make the cheesecakes, blitz the biscuits and a quarter of the honeycomb in a food processor, then stir in themelted butter. Divide the mixture evenly between six ramekins, lightly press it down, then chill in the fridge while you make the filling.Whisk the yoghurt, cream cheese, vanilla and icing sugar in a bowl until smooth. In a second bowl, lightly whip the double cream to soft peaks. Fold this into the yoghurt mixture, then spoon on top of the biscuit base in the ramekins.To serve, top with some cherries, decorate with more honeycomb shards (they’ll start to soften over time) and take to the table immediately.Explore more on these topicsFoodThe sweet spotBakingDessertCheeseCakeFruitBiscuitsrecipesShareReuse this content"
