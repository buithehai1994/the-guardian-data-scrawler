And honestly, thank God for Rachel – the terrifyingly ruthless saviour of this seriesStuart HeritageFri 23 Jan 2026 17.33 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 19.03 ESTShareBit of a damp squib, this year’s Traitors. At its best, it was still able to skim the preposterously giddy heights of previous series, but I spent a lot of the run living with the growing realisation that the cracks in the format are starting to show.One major culprit, as always, has been the mid-episode challenge; a slab of filler designed to kill any trace of intrigue, like a version of 12 Angry Men where the jurors get up halfway through to spend 20 minutes swanning around in a park. Nor did the new raft of tweaks amount to much, with the reveal of the Secret Traitor coming far too early, and the secret connections (Judy and Roxy, Ellie and Ross) fizzling out without resolution.However, the biggest accusation to level atThe Traitorsis that it is a show designed to reward the dull. There have been some spectacular participants this year – James was baffling, Harriet was explosive, Fiona somehow managed to be both at once – but they all got banished the instant they demonstrated any tangible signs of personality. Instead, the final five contestants were two traitors and a handful of people who couldn’t have said more than 500 words between them all series. It didn’t look great.After James was banished by chance in a cliffhanger from the previous episode, we were left with Jade (whose default characteristic was defensive), Faraaz (who was mute, then tantalisingly perceptive, then mute again), Jack (who suddenly made himself known three episodes ago, like a Star Trek redshirt) and the two remaining traitors.They were Stephen, who was passive and fond of big collars, and Rachel. And, honestly, thank God for Rachel. She was, of course, the figure who managed to bend the show’s entire gravity field around her. This was the woman responsible for turning The Traitors into – if you’ll allow me to quote Logan Roy – a fight for a knife in the mud.For better or worse, Rachel’s machinations meant that this year’s entire series was cast in her image. It, and she, was ruthless to a terrifying extent. Even in the final her plotting remained in overdrive, as she worked overtime to convince anyone who would listen that Jade was a bad egg.View image in fullscreenThe final five: Faraaz, Rachel, Stephen, Jade and Jack on The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Paul ChappellsAnd while this is a terrible trait for a human being, it’s a great one for a reality TV contestant. Rachel’s innate untrustworthiness meant that we were kept on the hook right to the very end. All along she had promised Stephen that they would operate as a team, but who in their right mind would believe anything she said?Luckily, for her at least, she was murderously effective at dispatching the competition. Poor Jade – unfairly vilified since episode one – was banished and fled the room in tears. Poor Faraaz followed, only realising what had happened in the post-banishment interview. And then the traitors ganged up on Jack, at which point it was game over.The traitors had won, and Rachel and Stephen split the £95,750 loot. Tellingly, the other finalists didn’t join them at the end. This was possibly because they felt too betrayed by the people they thought were their friends. The moral of the story? It’s easy to cheat your way to the top. What a very 2026 lesson to learn.View image in fullscreenThe moral of the story? It’s easy to cheat your way to the top. Claudia with Stephen and Rachel.Photograph: Paul Chappells/Studio Lambert/BBC/PAFor all the show’s flaws, the endgame is still quite effectively stressful. Objectively none of the finalists deserved the money – they were either too useless or too duplicitous – but the final 15 minutes made for a properly sweaty watch. I once watched a man put his head inside a crocodile’s mouth, and watching Stephen fret over how much trust he could put in Rachel in those final seconds was a roughly equivalent spectacle.Hopefully we’ll see some of the other contestants again. James seemed to treat the show as an audition for a bizarre unmade CBeebies show about a vomiting gardener, so hopefully he’ll get his shot. I’ll be interested to see what Jade is like when she isn’t being crushed by ennui. And Stephen, I’m sure, will soon be available to hire for parties as a sort of walking reaction gif.More than anything, though, this year’s Traitors made me nostalgic for the more innocent celebrity version, where everyone was too worried about their reputations to become as debilitatingly bloodthirsty as this lot. An uneven series saved (but only just) by an excellent finale.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

If this creates a new western alliance against him, all to the goodFri 23 Jan 2026 11.28 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTShareThe temptation is strong to hope that the storm has passed. To believe that a week that began with a US threat to seize a European territory, whether by force or extortion, has ended with thepromise of negotiationand therefore a return to normality. But that is a dangerous delusion. There can be no return to normality. The world we thought we knew has gone. The only question now is what takes its place – a question that will affect us all, that is full of danger and that, perhaps unexpectedly, also carries a whisper of hope.Forget thatDonald Trumpeventually backed down from his threats to conquer Greenland, re-holstering the economic gun he had put to the head of all those countries who stood in his way, the UK among them. The fact that he made the threat at all confirmed what should have been obvious since he returned to office a year ago: that, under him, the US has become an unreliable ally, if not an actual foe of its one-time friends.That much was spelled out in ways both gross and insulting. In the second category comes his latest remark that Nato allies were “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan, a despicable affront to the families of the 457 British service personnel and their comrades from across the alliance who gave their lives in that conflict.In the first category was the unveiling of his latest venture: having earlier told the Norwegian prime minister, who hefalsely accusedof denying him a Nobel medal, that he was becoming bored of peace, he came to Davos to launch his “board of peace”. Trump is the one book you can judge by its cover, and so the new body’s logo said it all: asone wit observed, it was basically the UN badge “except dipped in gold and edited so the world only includes America”.That captured the essential points: that the “board of peace” is an attempt to supplant and monetise the post-1945 international architecture, replacing the UN with a Mar-a-Lago-style members’ club wherea permanent seat costs $1bnand decision-making power lies in the hands of Trump himself, even after his presidential term expires. That Vladimir Putin has been invited, andMark Carney shut out, tells you all you need to know.For a while, the US’s allies comforted themselves with the belief that Trump was an aberration who would one day be gone, allowing the old ways to resume. That delusion has also been shattered. When Trump still seemed determined to make good on hisGreenlandthreats, there was no sign of anyone or anything inside the US that would stop him. Over these last 12 months, Trump has demonstrated that the formal restraints designed to hold a US president in check are easily swept away. And if it can happen once, it can happen again. Which means it is not just Trump who is an unreliable ally. Sadly, it is the US itself.There are some immediate lessons to learn from all this. The first is that Trump keeps going unless and until he meets resistance. His former adviser Steve Bannon told the Atlantic this week that Team Trump’s strategy in all areas is “maximalist”, to go as far as they can until someone stops them. Trump’s Greenland moves prompted a stock market plunge and domestic disapproval –86% of Americans opposedan armed conquest of the island – but it also brought a united front and serious economic counter-threats from Europe. Europeans stood up and Trump backed down.That points to a more enduring and essential lesson for longtime friends of the US. They cannot be in a position of such dependency on the US – whether economic or military – that they have to give in to its demands. For explaining that simple point so starkly, Carney was rewarded witha standing ovationin Davos followinga speechthat may come to stand as the defining text of this period. “The old order is not coming back,” the Canadian prime minister said. “We shouldn’t mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy.”What Carney called for, and what the moment demands, is a new arrangement, a new formation. The “middle powers”, the nations of the democratic west outside the US, do not have passively to accept that the old world of “institutions and rules” has been replaced by a new world of “strongmen and deals”,as the former head of MI6 phrases it. Instead of competing with each other to be the most accommodating of the US hegemon, flattering the Oval Office emperor in the hope of being spared his wrath, they can, says Carney, “combine to create a third path”.What would that look like? The obvious shape is a new constellation of the European Union plus the UK plus Canada, both an economic bloc with heft and a security alliance with muscle. Ultimately, it would aim to provide a positive answer to the question that has loomed this last year especially: could Europe defend Ukraine, and itself, without the US? At present, the cold, hard answer to that question is no. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not wrong to say that today’s Europe “remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers,” one that “looks lost, trying to convince the US president to change [when] he will not change”.So the goal is nothing less than a new alliance of western democracies no longer dependent on the US for their own defence. It cannot happen overnight; it might take a decade or more to achieve. But, as the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told me this week, it would be “a major dereliction of duty if we don’t do the work now” to reach that goal.Because it will take time, it means there can be no sudden breaks from the US. As long as allies remain reliant on US protection, the likes of Keir Starmer will have to keep smiling as he shakes Trump’s hand. The Nato vehicle will have to stay on the road, even as its most powerful member keeps slashing the tyres. But all the while, a newly conceived grouping, perhaps presented innocuously as a mere “European arm of Nato”, will be consolidating and gaining strength.The unavoidable key to this plan is vastly increased defence spending. That will remould the politics of all those countries who have enjoyed a peace dividend since the end of the cold war, one that freed them to spend less on guns and more on schools and hospitals. And it will reshape the decades-old debate over Britain’s relationship with Europe. Both parties will surely have to move, as Britain ditches its Brexit delusions and the EU grants Britain something closer to frictionless trade in return for the serious contribution the UK will be making to Europe’s defence.There are opportunities here, including for Starmer. He can present manifesto-breaking tax rises as a matter of national security. He can present closer ties to Europe the same way. He can leave Nigel Farage marooned on the wrong side of public opinion, fanboy to the man who insulted Britain’s war dead. Starmer can cast Reform as the party in thrall to Trump, and Reform’s opponents as the true defenders of Britain’s sovereignty and independence.The world we knew is dying, slain by the would-be emperor on the Potomac. But something else became visible this week: a new world waiting to be born.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpGreenlandEuropeNatocommentShareReuse this content"

These tips should get you on the road to recoveryHannah CoatesFri 23 Jan 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 12.26 ESTShareThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.There’s nothing quite like a persistent ache or pain to ruin your mood. Whether it’s a recurring twinge in your lower back or an acute injury from an accident, most issues stem from imbalance – when one area of the body compensates for weakness elsewhere.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.“Our bodies are inherently asymmetrical – no one’s left and right sides are exactly the same,” says personal trainerLuke Worthington. “Problems arise when we inadvertently force symmetry, trying to make both sides move identically. It disrupts our natural equilibrium and leads to overuse, strain or injury.”An injury we suffer is often more complex than the immediate event that caused it, says physiotherapistFlorence Penny.“The visible injury is just the tip of the iceberg. Behind it are often muscle imbalances, poor joint stability, fatigue, improper movement patterns or insufficient conditioning.” These underlying factors reduce the body’s resilience, making it more prone to injury under stress, whether that’s from playing with your kids or training for a marathon.It’s easy to believe that staying still will help you recover faster, but the secret is targeted movement, performed consistently and built up over timeProper diagnosis is key to successful recovery. “Identify how the injury happened – was it a sudden force or gradual overload from poor movement or planning?” says Worthington. “Understanding the underlying cause is essential for lasting recovery.” A physiotherapist, doctor, osteopath or other trained practitioner can help uncover those root issues.Prevention is better than cure. Respect rest days – “they’re part of training, not a break from it”, says pro marathon runner and Lululemon ambassador,Anya Culling– and give your body time to absorb the effects of your workouts. Recovery begins with the basics: quality sleep, good nutrition and hydration. “It’s easy to believe that staying still will help you recover faster, but the real secret is targeted movement, performed consistently and built up over time,” adds Worthington. “The goal is to restore confidence, control and capacity – not just wait for pain to fade.”Ankle sprainMostly caused by rolling or twisting on uneven ground, ankle sprains are just as common on the morning commute as in a game of sport. If you’re dealing with pain, swelling or bruising, or finding it hard to bear weight, start by elevating the ankle above heart level and apply ice to reduce swelling.After that, Worthington advises rebuilding strength gradually. Start with balance work – holding one leg off the floor, then progressing to standing on tiptoe – before adding calf-strengthening exercises (such as calf raises) and, eventually, low-level jumping drills.“Everything should be done progressively,” he says. “Once you can balance on one leg and then on tiptoe, repeat the exercises on an unstable surface such as a balance dome. Then try catching and throwing a weighted ball while standing on one leg, and again on tiptoe.” When balance control feels solid, move to two-legged jumps, then single-leg hops, keeping landings soft and stable.Train both your injured and healthy sides to avoid making that “good” ankle the next injury.Achilles tendinitisNamed after the mythical Greek hero, the term “achilles heel” has long symbolised weakness – and the body’s largest and strongest tendon is also one of the most injury-prone. Achilles tendinitis, a painful inflammation marked by heat, swelling and stiffness, often strikes when people suddenly ramp up their training or lifting load.The hardest part was accepting that rest was part of the work. I took six weeks off running to give my body the time it needed to heal“Tendons love consistency, so don’t alternate between inactivity and intense exercise,” says Penny. “The goal isn’t rest but smart load-management. Gradual, slow, heavy loading helps the tendon remodel and rebuild strength and resilience.”Begin by applying light tension: stand facing a wall with feet hip-width apart, lean forward slightly and press your toes into the floor as if to lift your heels – but keep them grounded. Hold this contraction for 10 seconds, then release, repeating several times. As strength returns, progress to standing and seated heel raises, taking three seconds up and three down. Aim for three sets of 12–15 reps every other day.Lower back painOften associated with being of a “certain age”, lower back pain can be incredibly debilitating and occur at any point in life. “It’s usually caused by too much sitting followed by sudden lifting or exercise, poor movement techniques and weakness in the deep stabilising muscles – the core and glutes – combined with tight hip flexors,” says Penny. The result is a stiffness befitting of the Tin Man, and recovery that can sometimes feel like a never-ending pursuit.While you might feel tempted to rest and avoid moving, experts agree that the right exercises are essential to get you on the road to recovery. Since tight hip flexors are often to blame, osteopathOlivia de Maigretrecommends improving mobility with simple movements. “Try drawing a figure of eight with your hips several times while standing,” she says.View image in fullscreenModel: Kenny E at Nevs. Lighting assistant: Patrick Spilsbury. Grooming: Sarah Cherry.A kneeling hip-flexor stretch also helps, and should be a staple if you sit for long periods. Kneel on one knee, with the other leg bent at 90 degrees, torso upright. Gently tilt your pelvis backwards until you feel a stretch at the front of the hip on the kneeling side. Hold for 20-30 seconds and repeat two or three times on each side. “Pelvic tilts, bridges and gentle cat-cows are brilliant for strengthening the core and glutes, which protect and stabilise the spine,” adds Lotti Benardout, founder of pilates and strength centreStudio Anatomy.Before strengthening, focus on activating your deep core – your natural back brace – with diaphragmatic breathing: inhale, expanding the belly, then tighten the abs on exhalation. Once mastered, progress to stability exercises such as dead bugs (lie on your back with your arms and legs raised towards the ceiling, then alternate lowering one arm towards the floor behind your head while simultaneously extending the opposite leg straight out, hovering just above the ground), side planks and bird-dogs, where you extend one arm and the opposite leg in a table-top position. “The goal,” says Worthington, “is to keep the lumbar spine – the section without ribs – still, stable and neutral.”Plantar fasciitisHaving recently battled a foot tendon injury, Culling knows just how testing recovery can be. “It felt like one step forward, two steps back,” she admits. “The hardest part was accepting that rest was part of the work. I took six weeks off running and focused on low-impact cycling and strength training to stay active while giving my body the time it needed to heal.”Warm-ups, rest and knowing when to stop are just as vital as the workout itself – especially for runners, whose joints absorb repeated force. It’s far easier to prevent injury than to recover from one, and strength training is crucial for an injury-free running routine.Anya Culling swears by ice baths to reduce inflammation, but if they don’t appeal, applying an ice pack for 10 minutes works, tooOne of the most common running‑related issues is plantar fasciitis – inflammation of the thick band of tissue that supports the arch of the foot. Those who spend long hours standing, wear unsupportive shoes or ramp up training too quickly are also at risk. Alongside switching to low-impact exercise such as cycling or swimming, De Maigret recommends loosening the tight connective tissue by rolling the arch of the foot over a tennis ball for two or three minutes a day.Culling also swears by ice baths to reduce inflammation, but if they don’t appeal, applying an ice pack for 10 minutes works, too. Finally, choose shoes with solid arch support and cushioning, and avoid barefoot walking while recovering – arch supports (such asScholl’s Plantar Fasciitis Pain Relief Insoles) can help reduce strain and speed up healing.Shoulder pain or impingementIf you feel a pinch or pain in your shoulder when lifting or rotating your arm, overuse or poor posture could be to blame. Nearly 41% of women report persistent shoulder tension, according torecent research. Alongside strength work – think push‑ups, reverse-flies and resistance band pull‑aparts – improving mobility in the thoracic spine (upper back) and strengthening the scapular stabilisers (which control the shoulder blades) is essential, says Penny.For thoracic mobility, try a cat-cow stretch. To strengthen the scapular stabilisers, perform a serratus punch: lie on your back with knees bent, feet flat and a light dumbbell held straight up toward the ceiling. Keeping your elbow locked, reach your hand upward by lifting your shoulder blade slightly off the floor – as if throwing a small punch – pause for a couple of seconds, then lower slowly. Aim for two to three sets of 10 reps on each side.Knee injuriesWhether it’s patellar tendinitis or a tear to the meniscus or anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), knee injuries are prevalent, particularly in those doing contact sports or movements that require a lot of pivoting. According to Worthington, knee pain is often “a hip or ankle issue in disguise”, since both joints influence how much force the knee absorbs. Strengthening and improving control through the hips and ankles can therefore help ease strain and prevent injury.View image in fullscreen“For hip stability, try a single-leg glute bridge,” he recommends. “Lie on your back with one knee bent and the other extended at a 45-degree angle. Press through the heel of the bent leg to lift your hips, keeping them level at the top, then slowly lower. Do three sets of eight per side.”He also recommends an ankle mobility drill: stand facing a wall, with your feet in a staggered stance and your front foot a few inches from the wall. Keeping your heel grounded, bend your front knee towards the wall until it just touches. Perform three sets of eight reps per leg.Poor alignment and weak hips also contribute to ACL tears – an injury that often requires surgery and physiotherapy. “Single-leg control work – such as that aforementioned glute bridge, pistol (or single-leg) squats and reverse lunges – along with exercises that strengthen the hamstrings and glutes, are key to protecting the knees,” adds Penny.Hamstring strains“The hamstring works as part of a chain of muscles, and if other links are underperforming, it ends up doing double duty and becomes more vulnerable,” says Worthington, who advises working with a physiotherapist to assess any alignment issues.The best remedy is more movement, just at a lower intensity. Gentle stretching, walking or even time in an infrared sauna can work wonders“Once alignment is restored, perform 10 repetitions of 100 metres at a gradually increasing pace, using the walk back as recovery,” he recommends. “Initially all 10 repetitions may be at a slow walk; then progress to a fast walk, a slow jog and eventually a sprint.” When you can complete all 10 repetitions at a sprint without pain (usually in about six weeks), the hamstring can be generally considered recovered.Benardout also emphasises the value of eccentric exercises, such as slow bridge lowers or hamstring sliders (using an exercise ball or gliding discs), which strengthen the muscle as it lengthens. “Hip hinges and single-leg work then help keep them strong and stable in the long-term.”Delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms)While not technically an injury, anyone who’s pushed themselves in a workout will know the tell‑tale ache of delayed onset muscle soreness (Doms) – that stiff, tender feeling that hits a day or two after exercise, especially when walking downstairs or stretching. It occurs when intense or unfamiliar activity causes microscopic tears in the muscle fibres, which then repair and rebuild stronger – so it’s actually a sign of progress.“The best remedy is more movement, just at a lower intensity,” says Benardout. “Gentle stretching, walking or even time in an infrared sauna can work wonders – the heat boosts circulation, eases stiffness and speeds up recovery.”Explore more on these topicsLife and styleFitnessPhysiotherapyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They should be careful what they wish for – as should heFri 23 Jan 2026 08.29 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 13.01 ESTShareSince Andy Burnham’s will-he-won’t-he return to Westminster is back in the news, permit me to advance a theory.Andy Burnhamis Johnny Depp. Stay with me! We somehow have to make this more fun than immersing ourselves in the remorselessly petty mathematical dynamics of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC).So here goes: movie-wise, before Pirates of the Caribbean, Johnny Depp used to embody a desirable scarcity model. As a cultural asset he was high-prestige, low-supply, and every rudderless director thought that if only the mysterious Johnny was at the helm of their project, then everything would be rosy. He was different, he was cool, he was hyper-selective, he withheld himself, he didn’t dress like the others, he wasn’t your multiplex guy. And he was, crucially,not available. But Pirates of the Caribbean changed all that and it changed Johnny Depp. After the unexpected mega-success of that film, the actor made himself available, and his aura evaporated. He made the conscious leap to middle-of-the-road A-listery and his cultural premium collapsed. Johnny Depp and his basic eyeliner were in everything, from franchises to mass-market fantasies to a couple of grim court cases with his ex-wife (obviously, Andy hasn’t been involved in even the metaphorical version of the last one, though Burnham v Starmer could be quite the rubbernecking spectacle). And honestly, most of it was highly indifferent. There was suddenly a lot less to him than had met the eye. Availability torched his cachet.It’s an old cycle. Scarcity gives you an aura, which gives you cultural leverage, but once the leverage has been deployed, you are no longer scarce and you lose the aura. These days, Johnny Depp has been cast out of the multiplex. Riyadh might be the only place he can open a movie, given he’s been reduced to alucrative bromancewith Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. As Vanity Fair hilariously had it: “Both men knew how it felt to suddenly go from golden boy to outcast.”Sticking with this metaphor, mainly to avoid talking about Labour’s endlessly excruciating internal politics for another paragraph, if Andy Burnham does contrive a return to Westminster to challenge Keir Starmer, he’ll flop harder than Depp’s outing inThe Lone Ranger. And that thing really bombed. The whole point of Andy Burnham, the memoji-headed king over the water, is that he’s over the water. Labour members want him but they can’t have him. He’s like an illicit desire, a thing they yearn for because they can’t possess it, that’s going to instantly seem less appealing the second they land him. Then, once again, the eyes will wander.But will they land him? That’s the other part of the drama currently gripping Labour, because there’s nothing else to think about in this quiet and settled world. By way of a recap, the Gorton and Denton MPAndrew Gwynne is stepping down. You know when someone literally puts bits of doctor’s notes in his resignation letter that there’s going to be some other stuff you’ve forgotten about the story, so I thank Andrew for the inadvertent reminder that he was actually sacked as a minister and suspended after having been found to have sent various dodgy WhatsApp messages about constituents and other voters. Anyway, medically, he can’t carry on … which might open up a seat for Burnham, who might ride south from Manchester to Westminster on a criminally overpriced train ticket, and challenge Keir Starmer for Labour’s leadership. It is ON!But is it actually? It all depends on Labour’s ruling body, the NEC. Over the years, many of you might have felt simply unable to face trying to understand how this impenetrable politburo works. So to summarise: the NEC is a thing that anyLabourleader who wants to do anything has to have “sewn up”, even though that leader will then be stopped from doing the things they want to do by the parliamentary Labour party, currently a 148-seat majority brute force of myopic self-interest, even though most of them are going to lose their seats in the next election so might actually deign to think about big-picture national interest and growth rather than themselves for two fricking minutes.I hope that covers any gaps. The NEC is the entity that must give Burnham permission to resign as mayor of Greater Manchester and subsequently to stand as an MP, and current indications are thatKeir Starmerhas it sufficiently sewn up that it’ll block this one way or another. Even if it doesn’t, alternative branches of future history are available. For instance: Burnham resigns as mayor of Greater Manchester, fights seat, loses to Reform. Or fights seat, while the mayoralty is expensively lost to Reform. Or even, fights seat but gets Boaty McBoatfaced by the Greens. Meanwhile, in most of the scenarios, the bond markets – which you’ll remember Andy is not keen on us being “in hock to” – have a little wobble every time his name is mentioned. In the circuitously reached event he wins the top job, they have a mega-wobble.Perennially frustrated by his name being linked with a leadership tilt, Burnham spent the hours after Gwynne’s resignation defusing this latest blow-up … no, hang on. Yesterday he could be found in the Guardian, convenientlyexpanding on his political philosophy. It’s no longer just a little bit of nationalisation and a little bit of wealth taxes. It’s also something called “Manchesterism” – which, spoiler alert, is also not going to even touch the sides of the UK’s deep problems.As for how this plays out … For now, Burnham is able to bask in the happy worldview of every metro mayor: that everything good that happens is because of them, and everything bad that happens is because of Westminster. Is this the moment for our self-styled indie star to go mainstream? Never underestimate the Labour party’s ability to make a spectacular flop, of course – but I can’t help feeling that Andy would be better off watching this movie rather than starring in it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

While doffing their cap to the teenager, sources in Reform insist no conversation was taking place between Farage and Rosindell, who is understood to have been out canvassing with Tory activists in Essex when the tweet appeared.Rather, it is claimed information was fed to Charlie to act as a catalyst for the defection in the knowledge that the Conservative leadership – already on alert afterRobert Jenrick’s defectiondays earlier – would zero in on Rosindell, a known ally of the former Tory frontbencher. Charlie rejects this characterisation.View image in fullscreenCharlie Simpson says he aims to ‘give an alternative to the mainstream media’ with an agenda to ‘push out rightwing news’.Photograph: Charlie SimpsonWhatever the truth, the events have massively boosted the profile of Charlie, part of a new generation of self-styled “independent journalists” with links to the far right.“We have a clear agenda. It’s to give an alternative to the mainstream media, which is to push out rightwing news,” he told the Guardian.Charlie has on at least one occasion been a speaker at a rally organised by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson. A former member of the UK Youth Parliament for Ashfield, he was embroiled in controversy in 2024 at his previous school in Nottinghamshire when he claimed to have been called a Nazi by a staff member, prompting the academyto launch an investigation. The school told GB News the incident was resolved in line with its policies.In the same year, Charlie resigned from the youth parliament and set up @GBpolitcs. The X account has 76,000 followers and bills itself as the “True Home of UK Political News”. It provides a mixture of posts about UK and international developments, sometimes crediting established journalists and others. Its profile has been boosted by retweets from figures including Elon Musk. A separate “personal account” in Charlie’s name is a mix of his “exclusives”, commentary, and sometimes just far-right slogans such as “mass deportations now”.“I start work the second I get up at 6am,” Charlie said, adding that he begins reading the news and assigning tasks to a team of others who work with him on GB Politics. He goes to school, works again on his return, and finishes at 1am.“The team will do the tweets, or get them ready, and I will have meetings with people. On my own personal account I do my own exclusives and we have launched a TikTok account, because people like it so much, but with the actual tweets we have a more ‘behind the scenes’ approach,” he said.View image in fullscreenCharlie Simpson promises ‘a scoop in about two weeks’ over more Tory defections to Reform.Photograph: Charlie SimpsonCharlie says he regularly communicates with councillors and MPs, including members of the Labour party. From his own analytics, members of his readership are either very young or middle aged. About 40% are over 50 while 30% are under 18, he says.Many are on the right, although Charlie’s relationship with Reform members is more complicated. “Going back to my personal account, I am blocked by many of Reform’s online base, who despise me but after the exclusive there have been people who apologised to me. I obviously have sources in the party,” he said.While once a supporter of Farage, Charlie now describes him as a “fraud” who will never again get his support, and he has harsh words too for Lee Anderson, another of Reform’s MPs. He admires Rupert Lowe, viewing him as the potential saviour of the UK.“Lee Anderson was my mentor and introduced me into politics but the second I was no longer needed he threw me under the bus,” Charlie said.He names two other prominent Tory MPs – one of them Suella Braverman, who has previously refused to rule out joining Reform – who he says are in ongoing discussions about defecting to Reform, with three other backbenchers also involved.“There will be a scoop in about two weeks,” Charlie said.Explore more on these topicsReform UKFar rightConservativesSocial mediaEssexYorkshireXnewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday night, the government was forced to delay its bill on the Chagos Islands in the House of Lords.Labour sources insisted it was a temporary pause because Tories had tried to wreck the bill but it comes after Trump said it was a great act of stupidity, with suggestions the US may be able to block the transfer due to a 1961 treaty.Starmer’s decision to call the president’s Afghanistan remarks “appalling” risks a further diplomatic rupture with the White House, but No 10 made the decision to speak out amid fury among veterans groups and the families of soldiers who lost their lives.After a day of mounting outrage around the world over the US president’s claim that British andNatotroops who fought in Afghanistan avoided the frontlines, he paid tribute to the 457 members of the armed services who lost their lives during the conflict.“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice that they made for their country,” the prime minister said on Friday. “There are many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries.“And so I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I’m not surprised they caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.”1:15Starmer calls Trump's comments on Nato and Afghanistan ‘insulting’ – videoAsked if he would call for an apology from the president, Starmer said: “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise.”But the prime minister stressed the importance of the “very close” relationship with the US for Britain’s security, adding: “It is because of that relationship that we fought alongside the Americans for our values in Afghanistan. And it was in that context that people lost their lives or suffered terrible injuries, fighting for freedom, fighting with our allies for what we believe in.”Trump’s suggestion in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that Nato troops hadstayed “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistanprompted widespread condemnation across the political spectrum and resurfaced questions about his own avoidance of military servicein Vietnam.The president has previously been criticised for avoiding being conscripted to fight in Vietnam after being diagnosed withbone spurs in his heels– a medical claim that has been subject to significant doubt.View image in fullscreenPeople have pointed to Donald Trump’s medical exemption from fighting in the Vietnam war after his recent comments.Photograph: Francis Chung/EPAIn the interview, Trump said: “[Nato will] say they sent some troops to Afghanistan … and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.”Speaking in Davos on Wednesday, he made similar claims against the 32-member military alliance, saying: “I know them all very well. I’m not sure that they’d be there. I know we’d be there for them. I don’t know that they would be there for us.”A total of 3,486 Nato troops died in the 20-year Afghanistan conflict, of whom 2,461 were US service personnel. Canada recorded 165 deaths, including civilians.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, accused Trump of “denigrating” British troops and said his comments were “flat-out nonsense”. Posting on X shortly before Starmer’s afternoon broadcast, the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said: “Donald Trump is wrong. For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America’s in Afghanistan.”The Liberal Democrats urged Starmer to summon the US ambassador “over this insult to our brave troops”, with the Lib Dem leader,Ed Davey, accusing Trump of avoiding military service. “How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed,” he said. It is understood there has not been any call between No 10 and Trump and the UK is not considering admonishing the US ambassador.The defence secretary, John Healey, said the UK and Nato allies had “answered the US call”, and the war dead should “be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation”.10:09Is this the week Trump went too far? | The LatestWithout referring to Trump by name, the armed forces minister, Al Carns, a former marine who served and led during four tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the military cross in 2011, said the claims were “utterly ridiculous”, and invited anyone believing the remarks to meet him and some of the bereaved families.The Duke of Sussex, who undertook two frontline tours to Afghanistan, said the “sacrifices” of British soldiers “deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect”.“I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,” said Prince Harry. “Thousands of lives were changed for ever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.”Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson sustained horrific injuries when an army Land Rover hit a mine near Musa Qala in 2006, said the president’s comments were “beyond belief” and urged Starmer to “call him out”.View image in fullscreenL/Bdr Ben Parkinson with his mother, Diane Dernie, and stepfather, Andrew.Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PAShe said: “Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation.“To hear this man say: ‘Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the frontlines’ … It’s the ultimate insult.”Trump’s remarks also drew international criticism. The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, said: “No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers.”Writingin the Guardian, Adam Price, the Danish writer who created the TV series Borgen, said: “How utterly insulting for the families, still mourning their dead, to hear the ingratitude of a US president so ignorant of their loss.” Denmark, which has been at loggerheads with the US overTrump’s designs on Greenland, had 44 combat deaths in Afghanistan, the most per capita outside the US.Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and former RAF officer who served alongside US special operations units in Afghanistan, said Trump’s claim “bears no resemblance to the reality experienced by those of us who served there”.View image in fullscreenLabour MP Calvin Bailey is a former RAF officer who served in Afghanistan.Photograph: Mrs Sharron Floyd/Sharron Floyd/MODThe Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States”.The former head of the British army Lord Dannatt condemned the comments on TalkTV, saying: “He has got the disrespect and outrageous choice of words to say that we hung back from the frontline. My God, we were certainly on the frontline, as 457 young people died.”Stephen Stewart, a former soldier and an author and journalist, said Trump’s comments were “as offensive as they are inaccurate”, while Richard Streatfeild, a former army major in Afghanistan and now a Liberal Democrat councillor, said: “To be told that your service is not as demanding or as difficult as the Americans’ is untrue and deeply insulting.”The US remains the only country to have invoked article 5 of Nato’s collective security provision, activated after the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001.Trump has also faced criticism in the US. The former Nato supreme allied commander James Stavridis said hundreds of allied troops had died under his command on the frontlines in Afghanistan. “I honour their memory every single day,” said the retired US Navy admiral.Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to China, described Trump’s remarks as “shameful”, adding: “We need our allies but are driving them away.”Sami Sadat, the former commanding general of Afghan Special Operation Corps, said Trump was wrong, adding that he was “grateful to each and every one of the Nato countries who helped us”.Late on Friday the White House rejected the UK’s criticism. “President Trump is absolutely right – the United States of America has done more for Nato than any other country in the alliance has done combined,” said spokesperson Taylor Rogers.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNatoMilitaryAfghanistanForeign policyKeir StarmerKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

I’d like to pay tribute to Jo for her incredible bravery throughout this process. She continues to be supported by specially trained officers.“I’d also like to commend the investigation team for their relentless hard work in getting the case to this stage and thank the Crown Prosecution Service for their support in ensuring Young faces justice for his abhorrent actions.“The wider case is now continuing through the courts and we have no further comment to make.”Young, born in Enfield in June 1976, graduated from the University of Westminster in 1998. He was a Conservative councillor on Swindon borough council from 2007 to 2010.He resigned as the cabinet member for culture, regeneration and economic development on 6 May 2010 to devote more time to his family and run his own business, according to the Swindon Advertiser. “Trying to juggle all of that, family and work, I don’t think it is fair on my family to put them bottom of that priority list,” he told the newspaper at the time.He had also featured in the publication in September 2009 after delivering his son when his wife went into labour at the family home.Since 2010, Young has been the director of several companies.

A candidate will be chosen within a week.Burnham has not confirmed he intends to run for the seat but he made no secret of his ambitions. In the runup to the party’s conference last year he said many MPs hadurged him to run for Labour leader, prompting outrage within No 10 and among cabinet ministers.He would have to stand down as mayor of Greater Manchester if he were to run. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester city council, is another possible Labour contender, believed to be favoured by allies of Starmer.Reports on Friday suggested Burnham could try to line up a high-profile figure to run as Labour candidate for Greater Manchester mayor, such as the footballer Gary Neville, if he were to resign to seek a Westminster seat.The byelection is shaping up to be a hotly contested race, with Zack Polanski, the Green party leader, not ruling himself out, and George Galloway, the independent former MP and Workers party leader also hinting he could stand. Reform UK could also stand a chance, with possible contenders including the policy chief, Zia Yusuf, or a former Tory MP such as Jonathan Gullis.The contest was triggered by the resignation of the independent MP Andrew Gwynne on medical grounds, immediately sparking speculation that Burnham could be in parliament in time for any potential leadership challenge to Starmer if May’s local elections are disastrous for Labour.The Guardianreported on Thursdaythat allies of Starmer were trying to prevent Burnham’s return. Members of the party’s ruling national executive committeepredictedit would be impossible for Burnham to make it through the selection process given the number of Starmer loyalists on the body.But Andrea Egan, the new general secretary of Unison, warned against “control-freakery” in the party. “I’m sure all trade unionists expect a democratic process for Gorton & Denton in which local party members decide who they want to represent them,” she said on X.“We’ve seen enough control-freakery in the Labour party and it has done our movement nothing but harm.”Jo White, a leading MP who runs Labour’s so-called red wall group of MPs, said: “Let the north decide who their Labour candidate should be for the Gorton and Denton byelection. A London stitch-up will be a disaster for Labour.”One northern backbencher said it wasn’t just a leftwing caucus of MPs who were hoping Burnham would make a return to Westminster. “There’s a few of us thinking it would be a sign of weakness for the PM to block him via the NEC.”They added that if speculation that Yusuf and Polanski could stand materialised, then Burnham would be the centrist candidate. “I wouldn’t want to see him challenge for leader this year, but I think we need stronger northern representation in government.”Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, insisted the process would be the same as any other candidate selection, despite rumours it could be limited to an all-women or all black, Asian and minority ethnic shortlist. He said Burnham was “doing a great job in the role that he currently has” and was an “incredibly talented and effective leader as the mayor of Greater Manchester”.Allies of Burnham suggested there would be significant disquiet among MPs, unions and party members should the leadership try to block him from returning to parliament, where he served as the MP for Leigh from 2001 to 2017.He has long been believed to be seeking a return to parliament tostand for the leadershipif there was a challenge to Starmer, but was thought to have limited options for a byelection in the north-west of England.Labour won the seat under Gwynne, who was later suspended from the party, with a 13,413 majority in 2024. Reform and the Greens were in second and third place and almost neck and neck, with 14% and 13% of the vote respectively.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLabourAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

He was 67.His remains were cremated and fired from a cannon at his request during a private ceremony in Colorado. Among the celebrities who attended was the actorJohnny Depp, who played the lead role in the 1998 film adaptation of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.The sheriff for the Aspen area, Michael Buglione, said he believed the original investigation into Thompson’s death was conducted properly but investigators recognized the importance of an independent review.The “CBI’s conclusions reaffirm the original findings and, we hope, provide reassurance and clarity,” he said.Explore more on these topicsHunter S ThompsonColoradonewsShareReuse this content"

A video accompanying the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.The US military has carried out more than 30 strikes against boats that it alleges were smuggling drugs off South American waters since early September. Those strikes have killed more than 100 people, according to the Associated Press, citing information from theTrump administration.The US military has more recently been focused on seizing sanctioned oil tankers with connections to Venezuela, in the wake of the surprise raid to capture Maduro and bring him to New York to face drug trafficking charges. Last week, US forces in the Caribbean Seaseized an oil tankerthat Trump said had ties to Venezuela.The Trump administration has moved to control the distribution of Venezuela’s oil products globally after ousting Maduro. Since then, Trump has announced an agreement with Venezuela’s interim leaders that he said would provide up to50m barrels of crude oilto the US. He also signed an executive order to “safeguard” Venezuelan oil revenues in US-controlled accounts.The last boat strikes occurred in late December, when the military said it struck five alleged drug-smuggling boats over two days, killing a total of eight people while others jumped overboard. Days later, the US Coast Guard suspended its search.Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUS militaryTrump administrationDrugsnewsShareReuse this content"

A London-based art collector, he is the representative ofa firm suing Christie’s auction houseover the provenance of a Picasso painting previously owned by someone convicted of a drugs offence.‘At the table or on the menu’: a turbulent Davos week with Trump’s circus in townRead moreReform UK said Farage did not work for HP Trust and any declarations about who had paid for the trip would be registered in due course.Farage’s Davos connection to HP Trust is not Reform’s only link to the Ghandehari family. Earlier this year,it emerged thata small design firm called Interior Architecture Landscape had given £200,000 to Reform in two tranches, according toElectoral Commission data. The company has a low profile, but in planning documents from 2015 it was listed as the representative for a property linked to the Ghandehari family.Interior Architecture Landscape confirmed to the Guardian on Friday that the Ghandehari family are its clients. A spokesperson said its decision to donate £200,000 was made independently by the company’s management, and not the Ghandehari family.The spokesperson for Ghandehari also said the family was a client of Interior Architecture Landscape, but was not responsible for the donations.The Interior Architecture Landscape spokesperson added: “We confirm that the company has, in aggregate, approximately £15m in active contracts, including maintenance, refurbishment, and fit-out works, in relation to several properties across the United Kingdom.“We further confirm that members of the Ghandehari family are clients of the company. We can also confirm that all members of the company’s management, its decision-makers and its clients are British citizens, and that the company conducts legitimate business activities within the United Kingdom.

Kyiv’s delegation “knows what to do,” he said in a voice note to journalists. Russia sent a delegation led by the GRU military intelligence chief, Adm Igor Kostyukov, indicating a focus on military rather than political negotiations.The talks come after a seventh meeting between Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, andVladimir Putinin Moscow, where the main topics of discussion were Russia’s demands for territory and Ukraine’s security guarantees, which Zelenskyy has said were agreed with Trump at this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos.A map shows Russian-controlled territory and recent advances in UkraineWitkoff was accompanied in Moscow by Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushner. They were joined by Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). He was recently appointed as a senior adviser on Trump’s international “board of peace” for Gaza.The Kremlin’s diplomatic adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters the talks had been “useful in every respect” and that it was “agreed that the first meeting of a trilateral working group on security issues will take place today in Abu Dhabi”.As the talks were about to begin on Friday, the Kremlin repeated its demand that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the eastern Donbas region for the war to end.Other senior Russian officials have gone on record demanding Ukraine adopt other measures that have been left out of a “20-point peace plan”, in what they indicated were plans to pursue regime change in Kyiv.“Any settlement proposal founded on the primary goal of preserving the current Nazi regime in what remains of the Ukrainian state is, naturally, completely unacceptable to us,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday.2:16Trump suggests he will settle Ukraine-Russia war 'pretty soon' at 'board of peace' launch – videoBefore the talks, a German government spokesperson questioned whether Moscow would be willing to concede on any of its demands, which include taking over territory currently not under its military control.“There are still major questions about the extent to which Russia is really willing to move away from its maximalist demands,” Steffen Meyer said.“Nothing would be gained if a peace agreement ultimately only gave Russia some breathing space and allowed it to launch new attacks at a later date. That is why we have focused very strongly on the issue of security guarantees.”The full details of the UAE talks had not been released at the time of writing, and it was not clear whether Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet face to face. Zelenskyy said the meetings would last for two days.1:44Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Europe needs to know how to defend itself – videoThe Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, the Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas. They must be withdrawn from there … This is a very important condition.”The Trump administration has beenpushing for a peace settlement, with representatives of the US president shuttling between Kyiv and Moscow in a flurry of negotiations that some worry couldforce Ukraine into an unfavourable deal. Trump said on Wednesday that Putin and Zelenskyy would be “stupid” if they failed to come together and get a deal done.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Witkoff said one key issue remained to be resolved, without giving further details.Zelenskyy said the future status of land occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine was unresolved, but that peace proposals were “nearly ready”. Both sides have previously highlighted the issue of territory as crucial.Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine surrender the 20% of the eastern region of Donetsk it still holds. Zelenskyy has refused to give up land that Ukraine has successfully defended since 2022 through grinding and costly attritional warfare.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/UPI/ShutterstockRussia also demands Ukraine renounce its ambition to join Nato and rejects any presence of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a peace deal.Trump claims Nato troops ‘stayed a little off the frontlines’ in AfghanistanRead moreZelenskyy said from Davos: “The Russians have to be ready for compromises because, you know, everybody has to be ready, not only Ukraine, and this is important for us.” He said postwar security guarantees between Washington and Kyiv were ready, should a deal be reached, although they would require each country’s ratification.Zelenskyy was speaking after a closed-door meeting with Trump and a blistering Davos speech in which heaccused European leaders of being in “Greenland mode”as they waited for US leadership rather than taking action themselves.Despite Trump’slimited and scattergun support for Ukrainesince taking office a year ago, Zelenskyy focused on Europe’s role in the conflict, accusing the continent’s leaders of complacency and inaction.“Just last year, here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words: ‘Europe needs to know how to defend itself,’” he said. “A year has passed, and nothing has changed.”Speaking to reporters as he flew back to Washington, Trump said his meeting with Zelenskyy had gone well,and that the Ukrainian president had told him he wanted to make a deal to end the war.“I had a good meeting, but I’ve had numerous good meetings with President Zelenskyy and it doesn’t seem to happen,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeUS foreign policyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

(Her first effort without the Spice Girls, 2000’s Out of Your Mind, was a collaboration with Dane Bowers of Another Level.)The song has made No 1 on two fringe charts, the Official Singles Sales chart and the Official Download chart, but has not cracked the primary Top 100, which combines streams and sales to determine chart placings.At No 100 on that chart is Myles Smith with 5,258 combined units for his 2024 single Stargazing; exact numbers for Beckham’s song were not made available by the Official Charts Company, though it said sales and streams of the song had risen 19,615% since last week.Victoria Beckham: Not Such an Innocent Girl – videoThe sales and download chart placings in effect give Beckham her first No 1 chart positions since the Spice Girls’ Holler/Let Love Lead the Way in 2000. The five-piece had nine UK No 1 singles, the highest of any girl group, but Beckham never achieved a No 1 as a solo artist: Out of Your Mind was beaten by Spiller and Sophie Ellis-Bextor’s Groovejet (If This Ain’t Love).Not Such an Innocent Girl was hyped up as part of a chart battle with Kylie Minogue’s Can’t Get You Out of My Head, both released, somewhat mind-bogglingly, just a week after 9/11. Beckham lost quite magnificently. Minogue’s song hit No 1 and became a generation-defining smash with first-week sales of 306,000, and Beckham’s effort limped to No 6 with just over one tenth of that figure, at 35,000 sales.Even Beckham seemed to want to quickly forget the whole affair, and so may not welcome this resurgence. Her self-titled debut album flopped, spending just four weeks on the chart. She is the only Spice Girl to have released just one solo album, having left music behind to pursue fashion.It’s a Brooklyn v Beckham Inc disaster: what happens when the elephant in the room goes rogue | Marina HydeRead moreThat said, two rumoured Beckham solo albums never saw the light of day. One recorded around 2002 eventually leaked in 2006, and is known by fans as Open Your Eyes. In 2003, she recorded a hip-hop album with the US producer Damon Dash called Come Together. Despite featuring a collaboration with Ol’ Dirty Bastard, it was scrapped, perhaps wisely. It leaked in 2016 after a demo CD was sold on eBay.Despite demands from social media users to “release the tape”, the same leaky fate has not yet met the footage of Beckham allegedly dancing so “inappropriately” on her eldest son at his wedding that the young couple renewed their vows a year later in order to “create new memories”.“First impressions can be wrong / So let me clear what’s going on,” Beckham sang 25 years ago – but as of yet, neither she nor husband, David, have sought to clarify the allegations.Explore more on these topicsVictoria BeckhamSpice GirlsBrooklyn BeckhamCelebrityUK chartsPop and rockDavid BeckhamnewsShareReuse this content"

But other parties are savouring a chance to give Labour a bloody nose.“Without Burnham on the ballot, my standing expectation would be thatLabourwould lose – but I wouldn’t be at all sure who they would lose to,” said Prof Robert Ford, of the University of Manchester.Its 119,000 constituents span the left-leaning young professionals of Levenshulme, the white working-class Reform-leaning voters of Denton, and a significant Muslim population – 28% of the seat – around Rusholme and Gorton.Ford believes the race could be a three- or even four-way split between Labour, Reform UK, a pro-Gaza candidate and the Green party.“If [Burnham] isn’t the candidate then it’s a much more interesting race than if he is,” he said. “He’s such a high-profile candidate up here inGreater Manchesterthat he’ll probably be able to make the weather enough [to win].”View image in fullscreenThe circus will return to this diverse Manchester constituency after Gwynne’s resignation triggered a byelection.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianLabour figures in Greater Manchester expect the shortlist to include everyone from the Green party leader, Zack Polanski, to the rabble-rousing ex-Labour MP George Galloway.Galloway, who lost his Rochdale seatafter four monthsin 2024, teased his potential return to Westminster on Friday,sayingon X: “Labour has ZERO chance of winning Gorton if I stand.”He is well known in these parts, having run unsuccessfully in 2017. Another return to parliament, however unlikely, would represent his fifth constituency in 39 years.Labour insiders expect the party to throw its weight behind Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester city council, who represents a ward in the constituency. Craig is liked by No 10 – she was phoned by Starmer personally to tell her she was being awarded an OBE in the recent new year honours list.But a neighbouring Labour MP said its candidate, whether Burnham or someone else, would struggle to combat the anger and widespread disillusionment among voters. “I’ve never seen anything like it – it’s not a good time,” they said.The MP said the Gaza issue was not as febrile as it was before the ceasefire in October but that it would still harm Labour – and could prove to be one of the causes of Starmer’s downfall.“Labour has done good stuff [on Gaza] but the truth is the fire is not out and it could flare up again,” they said. “Worst case scenario, we lose Gorton and Denton and get hammered at the local elections – there are enough people who would like to take Keir’s position.”At Longsight market, in a largely Muslim part of south-east Manchester, a van festooned with Palestine flags broadcasts songs in Urdu. Shops nearby are also draped in Palestine’s black, red, white and green.“I’ve always been Labour, the whole of my family and friends have been Labour,” said stallholder Mohammed Uddin. “But now it will 100% not be Labour. They’re not recognising the genocide. It’s even more of an issue now. My blood starts boiling talking about it.”Uddin, 60, said everyone he knows will vote for a pro-Gaza candidate: “I don’t think there’s a single one of my mates that will vote Labour.”View image in fullscreenMohammed Uddin: ‘I don’t think there’s a single one of my mates that will vote Labour’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianJohn Jones, 62, who has worked on Rusholme markets since he was a child helping his parents, said he wanted Burnham to stay in Greater Manchester: “If Burnham ended up as [Labour] leader we could stand a chance but I’d rather he stayed up here and fired bullets at them.”Four miles east in Denton, retired carpenter Brian Huckle said he would only consider voting for Labour if Burnham was the candidate. “For many years I voted Labour but after all the upsets and cutbacks and bloody increases, we’re all definitely against them.”View image in fullscreenBrian Huckle said he ‘kind of likes’ Reform UK, which came second in this constituency in 2024.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianHuckle, 66, said he “kind of likes” Reform UK, which came a distant second in this constituency in 2024, but added: “Whether I vote for them is another thing. I need to look at their policies in depth.”There was no such uncertainty for Beard, who runs Denton’s Stuart Carpets. “Definitely Reform, irrespective of who Labour put up,” he said. “It’s time for a change from the two-party state.”Reform UK has been planning for a byelection for months, said Allan Hopwood, the party’s only councillor on Labour-run Tameside council. Activists will start blitzing the area with leaflets in the coming weeks, hoping to get their eighth MP. “We’re going to give it everything we’ve got,” he said. “IfAndy Burnhamdoesn’t think he’s got a fight he would be very wrong.”Explore more on these topicsLocal politicsLocal governmentAndy BurnhamLabourGreater ManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

Many wore Maga-style red hats bearing slogans including “Nu det NUUK!”, a play on the Danish phrasenu det nok, meaning “now it’s enough”, to incorporate the name of the Greenlandic capital.Julie Rademacher, a member of Uagut, the national organisation for Greenlandic people in Denmark and one of the protest organisers, was overwhelmed by the support the protesters had received – from Greenlanders, Danes, Americans and people around the world. “The first half-hour in front of City Hall when this ocean of people just showed up, every time they cheered because of the speeches I couldn’t stop crying,” she said, her eyes welling up at the memory.Like many in Denmark and Greenland, Rademacher has a family member who fought alongside US soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq. “It’s been unbelievable to experience one of our closest allies threatening to annex our country,” she said. “But it is happening and we need to fight.”Rademacher believes Trump has achieved the opposite of what he was seeking to do, in that Greenlanders have been pushed away from him, while relations between Greenlanders and Danes, while having a long way to go, are “under reparation”.She cited a recent encounter on the streets between another member of Uagut and a Danish stranger who wanted to apologise for Denmark’s colonial abuses of Greenlanders. “One Greenlander, one Dane,” she said.“Our Greenlandic member was so touched by it, because it shows so much respect and trust.”Caps and ‘Canados’Jesper Rabe Tonnesen, 58, a vintage shop owner and creator of the Nu det NUUK! hats, said Denmark had gone on a journey from disagreement to unity.“We feel threatened like the people from Greenland,” he said. “Of course, we are a little country – one of the best countries in the world, but a small economy. We can’t do anything about this without France and the greater nations.”View image in fullscreenJesper Rabe Tonnesen.Photograph: Donald Chambers/The GuardianThere was, he said, a feeling like wartime solidarity between Denmark and Greenland and with the EU.Tonnesen said the cap had been “my little protest” eight months ago when people kept telling him that they had stopped paying attention to the news because it made them depressed. He had 80 made and nobody bought them, but after going viral a couple of weeks ago, supplies sold out in two hours. Hundreds more were made to distribute at the protest, with thousands more on the way. In another small act of defiance, the cafe at his creative workshop now calls Americanos “Canados”, in reference to another country in the crosshairs of Trump’s aggressive and erratic foreign policy whims.The US, he said, had meant everything to Denmark in terms of defence but had also influenced culture. “In the fashion, the way of thinking, the American dream to become something, and especially maybe to take care of democracy to keep a free world,” he said. “And what we see now is not a free world any more in America. All the values in Denmark and almost all ofEuropeare changing now.”View image in fullscreenTina Henriksen.Photograph: Donald Chambers/The GuardianOutside the US embassy, Tina Henriksen, 58, a nurse, who is half Greenlandic and half Danish, said Greenland and Denmark now “have to stand together”, adding that Danish people were “opening their minds to Greenland” in a new way.Boycotting BjörkDespite the signs of a newfound unity between Danes and Greenlanders, the colonial wounds run deep. As recently as December, victims of a historical IUD scandal, in which thousands of Greenlandic women and girls were forcibly fitted with contraceptive coils without their knowledge or consent,claimed victoryin their legal fight with the Danish government after it was confirmed they would be eligible for compensation.It was not until last year that “parenting competence” tests werebanned on people with Greenlandic backgroundsafter years of criticism by campaigners and human rights bodies, who argued successfully that the tests were racist because they were culturally unsuitable for people from Inuit backgrounds.At the beginning of January, Björkdrew attention to the scandals on social mediaand urged Greenlanders to declare independence. “I burst for sympathy for Greenlanders,” wrote the singer, who comes from Iceland, itself a former Danish dependency.The post divided people in Denmark. One record store, RecordPusher in the city of Odense, responded by boycotting the star’s music entirely. Its chief executive, Bo Ellegaard Pedersen, said at the time that the statement had “in no way done anything good for the current situation of the Danish commonwealth” and accused her of “creating her own reality like Trump”. He added: “This post divides friends and only helps the idiot on the other side of the Atlantic.”Speaking this week, Ellegaard said he had felt compelled to act because Björk’s comments felt like a “stab in the back”. He said he had been inundated with messages in the aftermath, including some calling him a racist and a colonialist, but he says many were positive.When Jakob Hejnfelt Thoren, 37, the owner of Rekords, a hip-hop record store in Copenhagen’s Nørrebro district, saw the boycott post, he decided to do the opposite and started stocking Björk records.While he does not necessarily agree entirely with what Björk wrote, he wanted to support the right to freedom of speech. “Being a part of hip-hop culture it comes very natural to be on the oppressed side,” he said in his store, its racks filled with hip-hop classics by artists including The Notorious BIG and 2Pac.View image in fullscreenJakob Hejnfelt Thoren.Photograph: Donald Chambers/The GuardianGreenland is “trapped between these two colonisers, so of course we are on their side”, he added.A father of two small children, he wakes up every morning checking the news and is worried about what might happen with Trump’s politics suddenly feeling so close to home. “You never know what Trump is going to say, what he is going to do.”‘The shock has turned into clarity’Danish students Emily Jensen, 26, and Rikke Nielsen, 26, said the current crisis had been dominating conversations at home. “It’s impossible to understand what he is going to do actually so it’s really frustrating and scary,” said Jensen.They have been trying to learn more about Greenlandic people. Nielsen said she had become more aware of Denmark’s colonial history with Greenland when the prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, last yearapologised to victims of the IUD scandal.View image in fullscreenEmily Jensen and Rikke Nielsen.Photograph: Donald Chambers/The GuardianOthers have been showing their outrage with the US by boycotting US products. Usage of Made O’Meter,an app that helps people to identify US products in Danish supermarkets, rose by 1,400% in the days after Trump started threatening tariffs against Denmark and other allies that opposed his plans to invade or buy Greenland.Ian Rosenfeldt, who created the app last March when the US president first hit Europe with tariffs, said this time the reaction was different. “The shock has turned into clarity,” he said. “An ally became someone we cannot trust and one we’re far too dependent on.” People in Denmark and across Europe were realising they needed to reduce their reliance on US technology, products and platforms, he added.Not everybody thinks the US president has permanently damaged US-Danish relations.In a coffee shop on Wednesday afternoon, as Trump finished his Davos speech, 76-year-old Mette Jensen said of the relationship: “Of course they can be repaired. But not with Trump.”Explore more on these topicsDenmarkGreenlandEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

(Taylor Swift’sThe Official Release Party of a Showgirlgrossed considerably more, with $34m, but as an album-promoting clipshow it is evidently in a different category.)Despite breaking up in 1980 after the death of drummer John Bonham, Led Zeppelin remain one of the world’s bestselling music acts, withestimated sales of over 200m records and 14.9bn streams. The band were famously press-shy in their prime, but agreed to take part in Becoming Led Zeppelin, which focuses on their early years up to the release of groundbreaking second album, Led Zeppelin II, in 1969. And contemporary audiences have responded – especially to the film’s presentation on the giant Imax screens, where it recorded Imax’sbest ever opening weekend for a music documentaryand became the format’s highest-grossing documentary of 2025.The film’s director, Bernard MacMahon, says that its success is down to more than simply the right band at the right time. “It’s a story about how four boys that come from nowhere with no access can get to a position where they can communicate with the world – through really, really, really hard work.” MacMahon says he interviewed more than 170 people associated withLed Zeppelinfor research purposes – though only the surviving members, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Robert Plant, speak on screen.MacMahon says it was vital to find a way to get through the musicians’ carapace so they “are not just telling stories that they’ve told a thousand times”; he did this, he says, by “inundating” them, on camera, with material designed to trigger emotional responses, including audio interviews with Bonham, snippets of which are included in the film.The originality of MacMahon’s approach is, says Screen International contributing editor Wendy Mitchell, a key reason the film made such an impact. “It’s not just a cookie-cutter VH1 Behind the Music-type thing. It’s trying to tell the story of early Led Zeppelin, how they became what they were. Nobody’s ever really done it quite that way before. And it looks good and sounds good, which is very important in a cinema.”Mitchell adds: “There’s obviously a built-in audience with Led Zeppelin fans, but you will also be getting teenagers and more casual viewers who are interested in the story – and who feel the cinema is the one place they can turn off their phones.”View image in fullscreenKaleidoscopic … David Bowie doc Moonage Daydream grossed well in 2022.Photograph: AlamyThe classic rock era of the 1960s and 70s has in recent years been a particularly rich vein for film-makers, who have found more and more unusual ways into their stories.The Beatles’ Get Back, which premiered in 2021, sourced dozens of hours of archived footage from the band’s recording sessions in 1969, while Nick Broomfield concentrated on the relationship between Leonard Cohen and his “muse” Marianne Ihlen inthe 2019 film Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love. Oscar-winning director Kevin Macdonald focused on John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s little-covered early-70s period in New York which culminated in a benefit concert in 1972 in the2024 film One to One: John & Yoko. Baby Driver director Edgar Wright offered an exhaustive, album-by-album profile of eccentric glam rockers Sparks inthe 2021 film The Sparks Brothers.We are shortly to get Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis Presley performance documentary EPiC, a Fleetwood Mac film byThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heartdirector Frank Marshall is in production, and Paul McCartney is about to release Man on the Run, an account of his immediate post-Beatles years as a solo artist and with Wings in the early 1970s. And prior to Becoming Led Zeppelin, arguably the most successful of this mini-wave wasMoonage Daydream, the kaleidoscopic tribute to David Bowie that wasNorth America’s highest-grossing documentary of 2022.View image in fullscreenCinema-first … director Bernard MacMahon and producer Allison McGourty at the Los Angeles premiere of Becoming Led Zeppelin last January.MacMahon, who previously made thesuccessful American Epic TV seriesabout early recording artists with his producing partner Allison McGourty, says the Led Zeppelin film’s cinema-first strategy was inspired by Moonage Daydream’s success. It was partly an artistic choice, in keeping with MacMahon’s enthusiasm for and commitment to the cinema experience, but also because, as Mitchell says, cinemas could “eventise” screenings. “It’s almost like going to a gig. People would shell out to go and see the band, and they might just go and see the film the same way – wear their T-shirt and take their buddies.”For MacMahon and McGourty, who had worked for years developing and researching the project – includinga triumphant “work in progress” screeningat the Venice film festival in 2021 – the success justified the effort involved. McGourty says: “One mustn’t underestimate the audience. This is who we’re thinking of every minute in the edit room. We’re aiming for a multi-layered experience that they get more out of each time they watch it.”MacMahon adds: “The whole team worked so hard. Every single frame of that film was sweated over. I mean, every single thing. There’s not a single thing that wasn’t thought about, worked on, reworked and polished and polished and polished. And that audience got that and they could see what it was.”Explore more on these topicsFilmMusic documentaryLed ZeppelinThe BeatlesDavid BowieDocumentary filmsPop and rocknewsShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIn an exclusive interview at his base, athletics’ ‘iron man’ reveals why his career feels like ‘99% losses’ but he plans to retire as the greatest distance runner in historyBySean Inglein Sandnes, NorwayFri 23 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 17.15 ESTShareOn a bone-cold new year’s morning, the world’s most compelling athlete is sweating so much that tiny puddles are starting to ooze across his treadmill.For 40 minutes Jakob Ingebrigtsen makes 6min 40sec mile pace look like a Sunday stroll, breezily chatting away even as the heatbox in his home gym pushes the temperature inside to more than 32.4C (90F). Only when I ask the double Olympic champion what his super-strength is does he pause to take a proper breath. “In Norwegian we have a word for it,” he eventually replies. “Ingen kompromiss. No compromise.”For the final 20 minutes of his run, Ingebrigtsen starts to push it. The music goes on. The treadmill is cranked up to 5:13 minute-per-mile pace. His pulse steadily climbs from 130 to 172 beats per minute. Sweat starts to flow. And, as he finishes, it seems apposite that Black Sabbath are pounding away on the stereo. “Running as fast as they can, Iron Man lives again!”Because after a year from hell in 2025, during which the Norwegian injured his achilles and was involved in ahighly public court case against his fatherand former coach, Gjert, track and field’s iron man is ready to run fast again.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in his garden gym. He ran twice on Christmas Day.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenEvery morning he does a 40-45 minute run on a treadmill.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenHe can turn up the temperature to mimic hot climates.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIngebrigtsen is often mischaracterised as arrogant, when really he is just forthright. He is also unusually welcoming, inviting us into his home in Sandnes, near Stavanger in south-west Norway, where we spend the best part of a day with him, his wife, Elisabeth, and his two golden retrievers, Maximus and Jupiter.At one point Elisabeth pops down to the local bakery to buy us lunch, while later Jakob drives me to his farm in one of his sports cars. There is no PR person acting as a buffer either. All of this, to put it mildly, is highly unusual.And Ingebrigtsen’s lack of filter, which can rub his rivals up the wrong way, also means he is blunt and honest about his own scar tissue.Early in our conversation, I ask Ingebrigtsen whether the wins or the losses linger more in his head, and I am taken aback by the reply. “I want to say that I almost don’t remember the wins,” he replies. “Almost.”But you remember the defeats? A nod. “Right now I feel like it’s 99% losses to wins.”Shortly afterwards a noise distracts Ingebrigtsen and he goes off to investigate. When he comes back I start to ask: “Do you think you’re slightly …” when he interjects. “Autistic, yes?” he says, laughing. “With this obsession, this dedication, this level of intensity, of course there has to be something …“For me, this is not only a job. I’ve had this life for as long as I can remember. So in reality it’s not only: ‘I lost, let’s go on.’ It’s bigger than that for me, because it’s such a big part of my life. Everything that I do, and I’ve always done as long as I can remember, has always been performance-oriented.”Can you blame Ingebrigtsen for such an approach? His upbringing, which was part science experiment, part Truman Show, made him that way almost from the crib.He started training professionally from the age of four or five, and by 12 he was running upwards of 100km a week. At 16 he became the youngest person to break the four-minute mile.At 17 he was the European 1500mand 5,000m champion. And by 20he was the Olympic 1500m champion. Much of this was captured on Team Ingebrigtsen, a docu‑series featuring Gjert and Jakob’s brothers, Henrik and Filip, that became Norway’s most successful ever TV show.Since then his CV has expanded to include two Olympic gold medals, four world titles, indoor and out, five world records, and 22 European titles over track and cross-country. But it is the ones that got away – such asthe 1500m in the Olympic Games in Paris– that continue to linger and sting.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen likes to keep his home life private, but says he can be ‘an extrovert’ in the right company.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen with his dogs Maximus and Jupiter.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIn that final he went out in a suicidal 54 seconds for the first lap and paid the price as he ran out of gas in the final 100m and finished fourth. Regrets? He certainly has a few, even 18 months on.“Considering how good shape I was in at that Olympics, I think nine out of 10 times I would have won the 1500m,” he says. “And this was the 10th. If I had just done anything differently, I think I would’ve had a better outcome.”Still, at least he had redemption by destroying the field to win 5,000m gold a few days later, I tell him. He looks at me like I am mad. “No, no,” he interjects. “It definitely wasn’t a redemption, no. There’s really nothing that can outweigh the disappointment of the 1500m.”Has winning become an obsession, I ask. “Yes, definitely. It’s an obsession. But I’ve been able to feed that obsession my whole life.”Given Ingebrigtsen’s uncompromising attitude, the fact he showed up to compete at September’s world championships in Tokyo spoke volumes. He knew he was not fit, having just recovered from his achilles injury. And, he says, there were no stipulations in his Nike contract that meant he would lose money if he didn’t turn up. He just felt it was the right thing to do.“That is just how I am, and how my life has been,” he says. “I’m always competing, even if the odds are against me. Even when I was 12 years old and competing against seniors at national level, I still wanted to win, but I knew it was unrealistic.”Ingebrigtsen, who was knocked out of the heats in the 1500m and could finish only 10th in the 5,000m, knew what was coming. But still he pressed on. “I’m not a dreamer,” he says. “I am analytic and realistic. But there’s always a chance of anything. And that chance is taken away if you don’t show up.”So how is his body now, four months on from his last race? “The achilles is very good,” Ingebrigtsen says. “But because of the last couple of years, I am a little bit more cautious. So I am prioritising my fitness towards the outdoor season. I will probably start at the Bislett Games in June. But my goals are to get double gold at the European championships, a Diamond League final victory, and to make one good world record attempt in the 1500m, the mile and also the 5,000m.”The 25-year-old will also get to renew his testy relationship with Josh Kerr,who beat him to 2023 world championships gold. Not that the Norwegian sees the Briton as a rival.“I have never considered anyone to be my rival,” he says. “Because I’m always competing against myself. And I usually don’t look at the start list. Because it’s always going to be people that can threaten or can compromise my race, whatever.”But does it annoy him when some people suggest he doesn’t have a finishing kick in the 1500m? He takes a deep breath. “No, I think it’s just ignorance,” he says, before making an analogy worthy of Eric Cantona. “If you look out of the window, it’s white. You can see it snowing. But if you dive deeper, under the snow it’s grass. That’s how it is with performance. People draw conclusions on the factors that are actually visible.”At the 2023 WorldAthleticsChampionships he had a virus, he points out. While in Paris, he went off too fast and paid the price. The whole point of a race, he stresses, is to use your best strengths to win.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen is still disappointed to have finished fourth in the 1500m final behind Yared Nuguse, Josh Kerr and Cole Hocker at the Paris Olympics in 2024.Photograph: Paweł Kopczyński/Reuters“I just think it’s funny,” he says. “My worst fear is to start sprinting when people are already finished. I can’t imagine how stupid you must feel as an athlete if you’re actually starting to sprint when the race is over. You have to play your cards right, so that you can time your effort so that you are the first to the finish.”He points to the French athlete Jimmy Gressier, whowon the world 10,000m titlein Tokyo last year. “He is a good runner. But because he’s a strength-endurance runner, he’s not very fast. Yet the whole point, especially in a championships, is about who can reach 400m to go with the most energy left. And in the 10k in Tokyo that was Jimmy.“You can argue that there was someone in that field who was faster than Jimmy. But they were struggling, because they didn’t have the same amount of energy left. And that’s the whole point.”Ingebrigtsen is just as outspoken when it comes to the state of his sport. He praises the Athletics Integrity Unit, calling it a “very good organisation”, but he wants far more funding made available to catch dopers. And, as someone who watches Formula One, he also wonders why track and field cannot do more to tap into its potential given he believes that it is far more exciting than F1.“The paradox is indescribable, because how can a sport that is so boring in reality be so entertaining for so many people?” he asks, “99.9% of people watching F1 don’t even know what the cars are. They probably don’t even know that there’s a battery inside the engines as well.”Ingebrigtsen certainly knows his way around a car. In his garage he has all sorts of vehicles, from sports cars to vintage motors. How many does he have? “That is a good question,” he replies. “I think if you start counting, that’s when you have an issue. So that’s why I don’t count.”View image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen’s other passion is cars, and he gathers with his friends once a week to talk and tinker with his large collection.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen doesn’t count how many cars he has. ‘I think if you start counting, that’s when you have an issue.’Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBut Ingebrigtsen doesn’t just buy cars. He loves working on them. Every Wednesday he and his friends, some of whom are mechanics, get together. “We try to have a little bit of fun with it,” he says. “I’m 100% a petrolhead. And you see a lot of new people from a completely different side of society.”Is it also true that he spent $300,000 (£220,000) on Pokémon cards? “It’s been rounded up,” he says. “But I think I have a collecting gene. I tend to collect a lot of different things, which is not always good.”At this point Elisabeth, who is working on her laptop on the sofa, starts to smile. “No, it is not!”After our interview, Ingebrigtsen drives us to the farm about 10 minutes from his home that he reportedly bought for 12m Norwegian kroner (£900,000). For now it grows potatoes but, one day, Ingebrigtsen says he might rear Wagyu cows on his land.“There’s actually a guy close by who has done that,” he says. “But what’s so exciting about it is that you can grow whatever. You can have grapes, apple cider, vegetables, or animals. And Elisabeth, she’s grown up on a small farm with horses.”His mood is certainly lighter than this time last year, whenhe faced a court case against his father and former coach. It ended with Gjert being given a 15-day suspended sentence after being found guilty of hitting Jakob’s younger sister in the face with a wet towel. However, Gjert was acquitted of other charges, including those relating to physical and verbal abuse against Jakob, after the judge found there was reasonable doubt.Understandably, Ingebrigtsen doesn’t want to trawl over painful memories. Instead he is far happier talking about another family member, his 18-month‑old daughter, Filippa, marvelling at how quickly she is learning and growing.Has parenthood changed him? “No,” he says. “I think I’ve always had the capability of being a caring person, but not when I don’t want to be. As an athlete, it’s completely the opposite. I don’t allow myself to have those feelings and thoughts.”He accepts he is a loner, except when it comes to a small band of friends. “I am very much an introvert in general, but I am also very much an extrovert in an environment where I feel safe,” he says.Elisabeth concurs. “You do care about people, just a very small group of people,” she says. “That’s the difference.”View image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen says: ‘I know I can beat most of the world records from 1500m to the marathon.’Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBut one thing is clear over the course of an interview that goes deep into a second hour: despite last year’s bump in the road, Ingebrigtsen’s ambitions haven’t changed. He wants to retire as the greatest distance runner in history. He says he is back running about 175-180km a week (108‑111 miles), far higher than most 1500m specialists, as he gears up for the summer.Does he ever take days off? “No, because if you have a day off, you lose 20-25km of running,” he replies. Of course he trained on Christmas Day. Twice, in fact.“I know I can beat most of the world records from 1500m to the marathon,” he says. “But it’s not easy. You really have to prioritise it, and you also have to find the right place and right time.“My 2025 season was a great setback in terms of my career. But I’m still highly motivated. Let’s say I can have 10 more years from now. If I can do that, then I think I have a good chance of reaching my ultimate goal.”And with that it is back to the treadmill for a second session of the day. Another hour of sweating and suffering. Another chance to fuel his burning obsession again.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Primely positioned on the banks of the Grand Canal inVenice, just steps away from the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, the storied Ca’ Dario has shimmered on the water since the late 15th century, its elegant early Venetian Renaissance facade among the city’s most distinctive.Named after its first owner, Giovanni Dario, a diplomat hailed a hero after securing a peace treaty with the Ottoman empire, over the centuries the palazzo has been home to nobles, merchants and even British rock music royalty. In 1908, it waspainted by Claude Monetduring his trip to Venice and one year later was cited by Henry James in his travelogue Italian Hours.View image in fullscreenCa’ Dario, 1908, by Claude Monet.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesBut the sprawling building, which comes with nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms and grand reception rooms filled with frescoes, has proved stubbornly difficult to sell – and not necessarily because buyers have been spooked by its price tag, reportedly €20m (£17.4m).Estate agents have struggled to overcome its reputation as “Venice’s cursed palace” owing to a string of owners and guests who met untimely, and in some cases violent, deaths.View image in fullscreenThe Ca’ Dario (right) lies on the right bank at the end of the Grand Canal, next to the Palazzo Barbaro Wolkoff.Photograph: Giorgio Morara/AlamyNow freshly renovated, the sale of Ca’ Dario has been given another push, the challenge entrusted to the Venice unit of Christie’s International Real Estate and Engel & Völkers. Christie’sdescribes the buildingas an “architectural gem” boasting gothic arches, antique Murano chandeliers and a loggia terrace, while noting its location in a “peaceful” Venetian neighbourhood tucked away from the crowds.What the marketing spiel doesn’t mention are the tragic tales that have embellished the local legends of it being jinxed.As the story goes, the palazzo is associated with at least seven deaths, the most gruesome in 1970 when its then owner, Count Filippo Giordano delle Lanze, was murdered within its walls by his boyfriend, a sailor who fled to London and was himself later murdered.View image in fullscreenAn interior image of the palazzo.Photograph: Christies Real EstateView image in fullscreenKit Lambert, manager of the Who.Photograph: Chris Morphet/RedfernsChristopher “Kit” Lambert, at the time the manager of the Who, bought the property the following year. Although he claimed to have been unbothered by the supposed curse, he is said to have told friends that he slept elsewhere in order to escape the ghosts. Still, local people have blamed the curse for his descent into drugs, subsequent financial crisis and death in London in 1981 after falling down a flight of stairs.In the 1980s, the palace was bought by the Italian financier Raul Gardini, who became embroiled in a high-profile corruption scandal and killed himself in Milan in 1993.The legends also allude to the palazzo casting misfortune on those who simply came within striking distance or holidayed there. Mario Del Monaco, an operatic tenor, was planning to buy the property in 1964, but changed his mind after being involved in a serious car accident on his way to view it;John Entwistle, the Who’s bass player, died in the US in 2002 a week after renting it.View image in fullscreenCa’ Dario is in the sestiere of Dorsoduro, said to be a ‘peaceful’ Venetian neighbourhood.Photograph: Simona Abbondio/AlamyCa’ Dario was mostly derelict after that, and although it attracted interest from some prospective buyers enamoured of its architecture – rumoured to include Woody Allen – it is claimed they were put off by its ghostly undertones.In 2006, the building was bought by an American firm on behalf of its current owner, whose identity has not been made public. The fact that the property has been empty ever since has only enhanced the tales.Arnaldo Fusello, a general manager at Christie’s in Venice, said Venetians liked to tell a good yarn, especially to tourists. “For example, the gondolier who rows past the building, it’s a little bit like that,” he said.He also pointed to the “hundreds” of inhabitants over the centuries who had lived to a ripe old age at the palazzo, including Dario, who died of natural causes at 80 years old.Davide Busato, a historian in Venice, said the rumours had begun in the 1970s but got into full swing after the suicide of Gardini, generating a journalistic field day.“The Venetians lapped it up,” he said. “They love telling a story and it’s quite normal for them to exaggerate, like they did with Poveglia island.” Poveglia is an abandoned and reputedly haunted island within the Venetian lagoon.Venetians were an otherwise pragmatic bunch, and usually unswayed by superstition, Busato said, “but they do like to amaze people, especially those who come from the outside”.View image in fullscreenAnother interior image from the property.Photograph: Christies Real EstateBusato said Venice was full of historic buildings where murders and suicides had taken place and which today hosted luxury hotels. “As with all legends, the ones surrounding Ca’ Dario get a little bit mixed up – the storytellers take a few concrete facts and magnify them.”Fusello is confident the building will overcome its eerie reputation and now sell. He said it had so far attracted “a lot” of interest, from a mix of Italians and foreigners. “This is a place where history lives,” he said. “And if you want to live history, then this is the perfect home, although it’s important that whoever buys it dedicates themselves to keeping this property alive.”Explore more on these topicsVeniceItalyEuropeHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

Here are my favourites, including one I loved so much I bought it.At a glanceBest duvet overall:Panda the CloudDouble, £129.95 at PandaBest budget duvet:Slumberland All SeasonsDouble, £59.99 at Bensons for BedsBest luxury duvet:Woolroom Deluxe Washable 3-in-1Double, £258 at Heal’sBest down duvet:Scooms Hungarian goose downDouble, £280 at ScoomsBest down-like duvet:Soak &SleepSoft as DownDouble, £52 at Soak & SleepWhy you should trust meI’ve spent decades reviewing products, from smartphones tohay fever remedies, so I’m professionally sceptical of manufacturers’ claims to magically improve our lives by buying their stuff. I also have a solid background in napping, insomnia and swearing at alarm clocks, so I welcome the chance to sleep on the job for the Filter.Ageing has slowly robbed me of my ability to sleep like a baby – or, indeed, like my pre-menopause self. On the upside, it’s given me a helpfully rigorous perspective when testingmattresses,sleep aidsand other things that promise to fix my slumbers.How I testedView image in fullscreenOur writer snoozing on the job … again.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianTesting duvets, liketesting mattresses, is not just about sleeping. That’s a key part of it, but only as a reward after the graft of sourcing, measuring and assessing my experimental subjects.Most of the duvets turned up in October. My husband and testing partner, Alan, helped me gather initial impressions, including the casing, stitching and distribution of filling. Then we dived into the duvet pile and wrapped ourselves in each one to assess weight, loft and overall comfort.Then came the sleeping, which lasted from late October to Christmas, albeit not 24/7. Alan and I shared each duvet for three nights, then slept separately under it for at least a further night to check it was warm enough for a solo sleeper.Temperatures were helpfully chaotic, with November alone ranging from 4C to 12C at night outdoors. Our bedroom is obviously more temperate than that, at about 15C overnight, but the skittish weather still provided a useful context for testing duvets of different togs.View image in fullscreenWeigh to go: a double duvet tipping the scales before unboxing and testing.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianWe also created a hot-room nap test for the summer duvets. This involved heating up our bedroom to 24C by augmenting the radiator with a halogenheater, then having a nap. Not exactly a scientific recreation of summer, but it did give us a rough idea of warm-weather performance.We used a cotton duvet cover in all our sleep tests, which showed how well cooling, breathability and other factors worked from inside a cover because, of course, that’s how you’ll be using them. Each morning, we made a note of factors such as how comfortable we’d felt when getting into bed, how warm the duvet had made us, and how quickly we fell asleep. We also noted whether we were sweating or felt too cold, if either of us woke in the night.I washed the duvets that were machine washable, then dried them on myheated clothes airer. This process took a whole day per duvet, but it was reassuring to find that many could be laundered indoors even in the dreck of November.At the end of testing, I donated all washed duvets to the Southampton hardship charityScratch, which collects homewares for families in need. Volunteer Paul made me smile (“Oh, you’re famous at Scratch, you’re the reviews lady!”) but also gave me pause by revealing that many of the people they help would have no winter bedding without the Filter’s donations.The best duvets you can buy in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Love at first touch’: Panda’s the Cloud duvet.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianBest duvet overall:Panda the CloudPandaThe Cloudfrom£129.95£129.95 at Panda£129.95 at AmazonWhat we loveKeeps you warm but dissipates heat to feel cool on your skinWhat we don’t loveIts 10.5 togs will be too much when the nights warm upPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £129.95 at PandaDouble, £129.95 at AmazonPanda’s duvet was love at first touch for me. Its bright-white casing, made from100% bamboo viscose, felt silky and cool against my skin, while the bamboo-infused microfibre filling added up to a cosy 10.5 togs for all the warmth we needed in November’s cold snap.Why we love itThis huggable duvet didn’t let me down after those ecstatic first impressions. Its lofty cosiness helped me drift off faster than normal and kept me warm all night, even when I slept alone. Its breathable bamboo-infused material never left me feeling clammy, and adding a cotton duvet cover didn’t seem to diminish this. I was delighted to find that a slight shift of the duvet during the night felt like flipping a pillow over to the cool side.At 3.75kg (my measure) for the double I tested, the Panda is one of the heavier duvets in my test, but it didn’t ever feel like it was weighing me down. This was important for me, and even more so for my feet, which get cold but hate being crushed by heavy bedding. It draped around my body just enough to make me feel hugged, but never so much that I felt airless.This duvet makes barely a sound, so there was no annoying rustling whenever Alan or I turned over in bed. Its filling is generously and evenly distributed between its pillowy stitched squares, and fills right up to the piped edges. It even fared well in my washing machine, and dried in a reasonable seven hours (with a turn in the middle) on my heated clothes airer.The Panda is not a budget duvet, but I’d rate it as a superb buy, especially given that it comes with a five-year guarantee and 30-night trial. Such a good buy, in fact, that I’ve snapped up one for myself.It’s a shame that …I’d classify this as an all-season duvet, with the best balance of cosiness and breathability I experienced in this test. However, it doesn’t come in any tog rating other than 10.5, and that would be too warm during a heatwave.Tog rating:10.5Other togs available:noneSizes available:single, double,king,super kingCasing:100% bamboo viscoseFilling:50% bamboo, 50% microfibre made from recycled water bottlesWashing:machine wash at 30CPandaThe Cloudfrom£129.95£129.95 at Panda£129.95 at AmazonWhat we loveKeeps you warm but dissipates heat to feel cool on your skinWhat we don’t loveIts 10.5 togs will be too much when the nights warm upBest budget duvet:Slumberland All SeasonsSlumberlandAll Seasons£59.99£59.99 at Bensons for BedsWhat we loveThree duvets in one, covering all weathers for a brilliant priceWhat we don’t loveIts 100% polyester composition means it tends to trap heatPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £59.99 at Bensons for BedsAt this price, this lightweight polyester duvet would already be a decent buy if it were just one duvet. But it’s two – a 4.5 toganda 9 tog – that fasten together to create a “three-in-one” with a total tog rating of 13.5.Why we love itYou wouldn’t find this duvet in a five-star hotel, but its price, ease of washing and multi-tog versatility add up to full marks for convenience. It was also the firm favourite of my new rescue cat Lumen, who so loved disappearing into its folds that we had to be careful not to disturb her accidentally – or, indeed, sit on her.The Slumberland’s polyester filling is well distributed in both sections, and remained so after five nights of acceptably cosy sleep, plus a wash and spin in my machine. Its full 13.5-tog iteration weighed 2.3kg by my measure, making it the lightest winter duvet in my test. It doesn’t scrimp on the warmth, though: I actually found it too warm when I spent a night alone with it, and preferred the 9-tog section on its own.Neither section is particularly lofty, but this slimness has practical benefits. Each section dried after just a few hours on my heated airer, and I found the whole duvet easy to get into a cover by myself. It also packed neatly into its zippable storage bag for collection by my local hardship charity,Scratch.It’s a shame that …details such as frayed stitching and straggly corner threads betray the budget nature of this duvet. I also woke up feeling sweaty a couple of times; a clammy reminder that polyester is no friend to those who tend to overheat at night, even in winter.Tog rating:4.5+9 (13.5 total)Other togs available:noneSizes available:single, double, king, super kingCasing:polyester fabricFilling:polyester fibreWashing:machine wash at 40CSlumberlandAll Seasons£59.99£59.99 at Bensons for BedsWhat we loveThree duvets in one, covering all weathers for a brilliant priceWhat we don’t loveIts 100% polyester composition means it tends to trap heatBest luxury duvet:Woolroom Deluxe Washable 3-in-1WoolroomDeluxe Washable 3-in-1from£258£258 at Heal’s£272.99 at WoolroomWhat we loveVersatile three-in-one made of sustainable, breathable fibresWhat we don’t loveExpensive, and takes a long time to dry after washingPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £258 at Heal’sDouble, £272.99 at WoolroomThe Woolroom Deluxe is another three-in-one duvet, with its summer section and medium section fastening together to create a winter warmer. Its percale cotton cover has a deliciously premium feel, and its traceable British wool filling is naturally hypoallergenic, temperature-regulating and sustainable.Why we love itThe Woolroom was a contender for best duvet overall. It feels less cuddly than the Panda and costs a lot more (double the price), but it’s exceptionally well made and can be used year-round because of its detachable sections. It also looks beautiful, and its smooth casing feels lovely against your skin.Alan and I began the sleep tests by sharing the full double-section duvet, which has a “tog range” (common with wool duvets) of 9-15. We found the two-part duvet too warm for autumn and a little too heavy for comfort, at 4.5kg by my measure. Its weight also made it difficult to get into a duvet cover, even with its mitten-like corner handles designed for the purpose. Fans ofweighted blanketswill love it, though, and it will come into its own on the coldest nights of winter.We ran our nap test with the lightest section (2-5-tog range), which proved ideal for sleeping under in a warm room. But for our proper night-time test, the middle section (7-10 togs) on its own was Goldilocks-perfect. It draped around us to create a satisfying hug that kept us warm enough for comfortable sleep, but never felt heavy or hot.Woolroom treats its filling to remove the barbs that make wool shrink during washing, resulting in a “truly machine-washable” duvet. I tested this claim with the medium section, and it survived a 40C cycle with no shrinking or warping.It’s a shame that …the newly washed duvet took more than a day to dry, not least because I couldn’t spin it at more than 800rpm. It’s also not suitable for tumble drying. So while it is genuinely washable, I’d wait until the weather is warm enough to dry it outdoors.Tog rating:2-5+7-10 (9-15 when combined)Other togs available:2-5,7-10,11-14Sizes available:single, double,king,super king,emperorCasing:100% unbleached organic percale cotton coverFilling:100% traceable British woolWashing:machine wash at max 40C, spin at max 800rpmWoolroomDeluxe Washable 3-in-1from£258£258 at Heal’s£272.99 at WoolroomWhat we loveVersatile three-in-one made of sustainable, breathable fibresWhat we don’t loveExpensive, and takes a long time to dry after washingBest down duvet:Scooms Hungarian goose downScoomsHungarian Goose Down£280£280 at ScoomsWhat we loveLuxuriously warm without feeling heavyWhat we don’t loveDown is not cheap, easy to clean – or veganPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £280 at ScoomsGoose down is the pinnacle of bedding luxury, evoking five-star hotels and weightless warmth. The down used by Scooms is traceably sourced and sustainably processed, and it’s encased in sateen cotton that feels gorgeous and works well with the filling to regulate your temperature.Why we love itAs a down sceptic, my expectations were limited. I feared a smelly, overly lofty duvet covered with spiky bits of half-escaped feather that should have stayed on the bird. But I stand corrected, because this 9-tog duvet is a delight to lie under. When you rub the silky casing, you don’t feel feathers underneath – just soft, silent down.In our sleep test, the Scooms had a lovely balance of lightness and insulation. It’s not weightless, of course (the double size weighed 2.5kg in my test), but it kept us warmer than its modest mass had led us to expect. It needed a good shake to puff it up after delivery, but it never looked or felt as voluminous as anticipated. This lack of bounce meant it draped evenly around our bodies, cloaking us rather than sitting on top like a cloud.I was initially hesitant to test a down duvet because of ethical concerns. If you feel the same, you may be reassured to know that Scooms is certified by theResponsible Down Standard, which guarantees the down is a byproduct of the food industry. It’s not vegan, but its origins should give you no more sleepless nights than a roast dinner.Scooms also keeps things as sustainable as possible, using no plastic in its packaging and even cleaning its down with spring water. Its other certifications include Oeko-Tex 100 (no harmful chemicals) and the Nomite anti-allergen standard. It also has the best guarantee of all the duvets I tested, at 10 years, and – unusually for down – can be machine washed.It’s a shame that …it’s pricey, with thedouble I tested costing £280. And no matter how ethically sourced this down is, it’s still down, and it has a slight earthy smell that not everyone will like.Tog rating tested:9Other togs available:2.5,4.5,2.5+9,2.5+4.5,4.5+9Sizes available:single, double,king,super king,emperorCasing:100% sateen cottonFilling:90% Hungarian goose down; 10% selected small white Hungarian goose featherWashing:machine wash at 40C every 6-12 monthsScoomsHungarian Goose Down£280£280 at ScoomsWhat we loveLuxuriously warm without feeling heavyWhat we don’t loveDown is not cheap, easy to clean – or veganBest down-like duvet:Soak & Sleep Soft as DownSoak & SleepSoft as Downfrom£52£52 at Soak & Sleep£52 at DebenhamsWhat we loveGreat value without feeling cheap; cotton helps breathabilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit noisy, and the polyester filling can trap heatPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £52 at Soak & SleepDouble, £52 at DebenhamsDuvets marketed “… as down” aim for the warmth and softness of down without the use of animal products or indeed the price. This Soak & Sleep silky white 9-tog duvet isn’t as light or warm on a chilly night as the Scooms, but it’s more lofty and significantly cheaper.Why we love itAt £65 RRP for a double, this cotton-encased duvet is a fantastic buy. It’s not quite as great value as the Slumberland because it’s not three duvets in one, but it does have button holes for attaching it to other Soak & Sleep duvets if you need to upgrade the tog count. Our 9-tog test sample was warm enough on its own in October. Alan was a big fan of this duvet, and said it would “work well all year round, except on unusually cold or warm nights”.The filling is polyester that’s been carded to a super-fine fibre, then stitched into squares to keep it evenly distributed, even after a machine wash. It kept us cosy without feeling heavy, and while it draped well over our bodies, it allowed plenty of room for the air to circulate.The use of polyester for the filling helps to keep the weight and price of this duvet down, but polyester has a tendency to trap heat. The breathable 100% cotton cover helped to keep overheating to a minimum, but I did wake up sweating one night. If you’re a fellow night-sweater, you’ll be glad to hear that this duvet’s light fill fibres made for easy washing and relatively quick drying, and you can tumble-dry it, if needed.It’s a shame that …I wasn’t immune to night sweats when testing this duvet on mild nights. The fabric also makes a crinkly sound, which isn’t uncommon in duvets, but can be distracting when you’re turning in bed as you try to get to sleep.Tog rating:9Other togs available:3,4.5,7.5,10.5,13.5,4.5+9,4.5+10.5,4.5+13.5Sizes available:single, double,king,super king,emperorCasing:100% cottonFilling:100% fine denier polyesterWashing:machine wash at 30C; tumble dry on low heatSoak & SleepSoft as Downfrom£52£52 at Soak & Sleep£52 at DebenhamsWhat we loveGreat value without feeling cheap; cotton helps breathabilityWhat we don’t loveIt’s a bit noisy, and the polyester filling can trap heatThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A good all-season choice’: the Emma Spring and Autumn duvet.Photograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianEmma Spring and Autumn duvetEmmaSpring and Autumn duvetfrom£69£69 at Emma£69 at ArgosWhat we loveWarm enough for spring/autumn, but light and washes easilyWhat we don’t loveToo cool for winter, and too slim to cuddlePhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The Guardian.Double, £69 at EmmaDouble, £69 at ArgosBest for:anyone who prefers a slimline duvet all year roundEmma’s lovely looking 6.7-tog duvet, which it calls Spring and Autumn on its website and Lean on the box (it’s the same in every other way), was by far the thinnest in my test, and this helped to make it particularly easy to wash and dry. It happily endures 60C in the machine, and mine dried in just three hours on a heated airer. Its size also makes it easy to store in a drawer.Despite its slimness, it’s not the lowest tog duvet I tested. Its 6.7 rating is significantly warmer than the 4.5-tog summer section of the Slumberland, and also weighs more (2.45kg – more than both sections of the Slumberland fastened together). This makes it a good all-season choice, especially for anyone who dislikes a chunky duvet and is happy to layer their bedding until it feels just right. If you want to give it a go, you get a 14-night trial.It didn’t make the final cut because …it wasn’t warm enough to soothe me to sleep in November, and its lack of loft makes it feel less huggable than you’d hope a duvet would.Tog rating:6.7;other togs available:none;sizes available:single, double, king, super king;casing:microfibre;filling:polyester microfibre;washing:machine wash at max 60C; tumble dry on low heatEmmaSpring and Autumn duvetfrom£69£69 at Emma£69 at ArgosWhat we loveWarm enough for spring/autumn, but light and washes easilyWhat we don’t loveToo cool for winter, and too slim to cuddleFloks Wool Winter PlusFloksWool Winter Plus£355£355 at FloksWhat we loveIts sustainable wool filling is exceptionally warmWhat we don’t loveIts lack of pliability makes it feel less cosyPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £355 at FloksBest for:freezing nights, especially if you can’t use an electric blanketAs with the Woolroom, the Floks duvet contains traceable British wool and has a tog range rather than a single rating (it’s 15-16 togs, which translates as “very warm to very, very warm”). It’s not particularly pliable and made us feel slightly like we were sleeping under amattress topper– but my goodness, it’s warm.We tested it during November’s freezing snap, when even a hot bedtime bath couldn’t keep me warm long enough to fall asleep comfortably under most of the duvets in this test (other than all of them in one go). It created a kind of insulating shell – which, after we’d been in bed for half an hour, seemed to generate almost as much warmth as anelectric blanket.It didn’t make the final cut because …it’s pricey, heavy and dry-clean only.Tog rating:15-16;other togs available:4-5,8-10,12-14;sizes available:single, double,king,super king,emperor;casing:organic cotton;filling:100% British Cheviot wool sourced from sustainably farmed sheep;washing:dry clean or hang out to airFloksWool Winter Plus£355£355 at FloksWhat we loveIts sustainable wool filling is exceptionally warmWhat we don’t loveIts lack of pliability makes it feel less cosySimba HybridSimbaHybridfrom£199£199 at Simba£199 at Barker and StonehouseWhat we loveWarm enough for winter but light and cool against your skinWhat we don’t loveNoisy and feels slightly plasticky, albeit the recycled kindPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £199 at SimbaDouble, £199 at Barker and StonehouseBest for:year-round use, without having to switch duvets or add sectionsThis 10.5-tog duvet has two sides, including one infused with Simba’s Stratos cooling material that helps to dissipate heat while you sleep.

I mostly tested it on my own (in a moment, you’ll see why) across several nights, some mild and some cold, and it kept me warm without triggering any sweats or clamminess. I also like the sustainability credentials of Simba, which is B Corp certified.It’s a shame that …Alan thoroughly disliked this duvet. “It feels like a big sheet of plastic,” he said, pointing out that it’s also the noisiest duvet in our test.Tog rating:10.5;other togs available:4.5,3.5+7;sizes available:single, double, king, super king;casing:cotton with cooling Stratos finish;filling:Renew Bio fibre made from recycled PET bottles;washing:machine wash at 40C; tumble dry on low heatSimbaHybridfrom£199£199 at Simba£199 at Barker and StonehouseWhat we loveWarm enough for winter but light and cool against your skinWhat we don’t loveNoisy and feels slightly plasticky, albeit the recycled kindFogarty Cool SleepDunelm FogartyCool Sleep£72£72 at DunelmWhat we loveCooling cotton cover helps prevent overheatingWhat we don’t lovePolyester filling is less good at dissipating heatPhotograph: Jane Hoskyn/The GuardianDouble, £72 at DunelmBest for:anyone who tends to overheat at night, even in winterThe Fogarty is a quieter, more affordable alternative to the sophisticated Simba.

The lightest and most breathable duvets are 1-tog, while the warmest can go beyond 16-tog. You don’t have to look far to find a 1-tog (such asthis one from Dunelm) or a 16.5 (such asthis from Amazon), but most UK duvets are between 4.5 and 13.5 togs.Tog ratings are measured in a lab by applying heat to one side of the duvet, usually by laying it (flat) on a hot plate. The testers then measure how much heat has transferred through the duvet by recording the temperature difference between the two sides. They do this several times from different parts of the surface, and then an average score is used to give the duvet’s overall tog rating.You can’t usually tell the tog of a duvet by looking at it or feeling it, or by reading its list of ingredients. The microfibre Emma Spring and Autumn duvet was the slimmest duvet in my test and one of the lightest, but it was warmer than expected, with a tog rating of 6.7. Wool duvets don’t quite fit the pattern, either. Wool is an adaptive insulator that doesn’t retain heat in the same way as synthetic fillings or down, so wool duvet togs are expressed as a range rather than a rating.Are down duvets cruel?Down duvets, particularly those filled with lightweight goose down, are legendarily luxurious and beloved of brands includingSoho House’s Soho HomeandSofitel. As mentioned above, I was reluctant to test a down duvet: I don’t eat meat, and I’ve long regarded down to be as troubling as fur. As do companies including H&M,which no longer uses new down or feathersin its products.However, there are ways you can ensure the down in products you buy is traceable throughout the supply chain. Companies includingScooms, Marks & Spencer andUniqloare certified by theResponsible Down Standard, which strictly prohibits cruel sourcing methods such as live plucking and force-feeding.Down will never be vegan, but it’s clear that the industry has made progress. Just be sure to research a manufacturer’s ethical credentials before you buy.For more ways to sleep better from the Filter:The best mattresses, testedThe best pillows for every type of sleeperThe best mattress toppers for a more comfortable night’s sleepJane Hoskyn is a features journalist with three decades of experience in rearranging bookshelves and‘testing’ coffee machines while deadlines loom.

Why are their set pieces so effective and can they be stopped?Niall McVeighFri 23 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 17.00 ESTShareSet pieces are dominating the Premier League this season, with almost 30% of goals coming from corners, free-kicks, penalties or long throws. The leaders,Arsenal, are kings of the dead ball, scoring 17 of their 40 league goals from set pieces (including penalties). But what makes Mikel Arteta’s side so effective in these areas, and what can opponents do to stop them? The data provides some answers.Rice and Saka in the swingArsenal have scored 19 goals from corners in all competitions this season. Much of the credit for that goes to their primary corner takers, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka. Taking corners from the left with his right foot, Rice has created eight goals, compared with five from Saka, who offers left-foot deliveries from the right. The vast majority of Arsenal’s corners (81%) are in-swinging, and statistically more likely to lead to a goal than out-swinging deliveries. Arteta learned the ropes under Pep Guardiola, but whereas the Manchester City manager has generally favoured out-swinging or short corners to maintain possession, his former assistant has opted for a more aggressive stance.Rice, Gabriel and Saka are Arsenal’s most potent set piece playersGetting it in the mixer …Arsenal’s use of set pieces is grounded in old-school methods. There is nothing particularly sophisticated about the pattern of corner deliveries; about three-quarters are aimed squarely at the six-yard box. While not a giant side – they are 15th in the league in terms of average height – Arsenal have assembled a fleet of tall, imposing defensive players. At least three of Arteta’s back four are usually involved at corners, with William Saliba often tasked with disrupting the goalkeeper – as he did successfully forthe winning goal at Old Traffordin August, scored by Riccardo Calafiori. The then United manager, Ruben Amorim, took issue, claiming Arsenal are “allowed to do a lot of things at the corners – we need to do the same”.View image in fullscreenManchester United keeper Altay Bayindir can only part-punch the ball under a challenge from William Saliba and it leads to Arsenal’s winning goal at Old Trafford in August.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock… but also mixing it upWhile launching balls directly towards leaping centre-backs is an effective strategy, some variety is needed to keep it that way. Arsenal’s set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, curates the finer details. The system is not reliant on Rice and Saka –Martin Ødegaard, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke have created goals from corners this season – and whoever delivers dead balls into the six-yard box is encouraged to mix things up. There is a fairly even spread between deliveries into the middle (37%), near post (23%) and far post (15%) – even more so in terms of where the goals are scored (10 central, eight at the near post, and six at the far post).Arsenal’s set-piece goals have mostly come from central areasHeavy rotationWhile the defining image of Arsenal’s set-piece domination may be Gabriel Magalhães towering over defenders at the far post, the league leaders are not reliant on any one player to finish the job. Gabriel has four goals from dead balls this season but 11 of his teammates have also scored from a set piece, including free-kicks and penalties. This also points to another factor: Arsenal players’ movement off the ball. A group of three players will usually make a run from the far post across the six-yard box, creating confusion over where the ball will end up. One such example came in the Champions League win over Bayern Munich, withJurriën Timber heading home.Gabriel has been Arsenal’s top scorer from set-pieces this seasonControlling the chaosBy shifting players’ starting positions, pressuring the goalkeeper and varying the direction of deliveries, Arsenal can create a level of chaos that is advantageous. Arteta’s side have scored seven goals from a knock-down, flick-on or goalmouth scramble after a set piece this season. Leandro Trossard’s winner at Fulham was created by Gabriel flicking Saka’s delivery to the far post, where the Belgian was unmarked. Trossard turned provider in this week’s victory over Inter: hisheader aimed back across goalclipped the bar and fell for Gabriel Jesus to score. The panic that Arsenal create in defences has also led to two converted penalties and four own goals, with the Wolves keeper Sam Johnstone andBrighton’s Giorginio Rutterfinding their heads scrambled in matches at the Emirates Stadium last month.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Georginio Rutter (right) flicks a header into his own net for Arsenal’s second goal of the game at the Emirates in December.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PACounter balanceArsenal’s aggressive approach to set pieces should, in theory, leave the defence exposed to counterattacks, with both centre-backs and a full-back usually deep in the opposing area. But they have avoided that completely, conceding only 14 league goals all season – with onlyErling Haaland’s opener at the Emiratesa definitive counterattacking goal. Defending corners, Arsenal’s opponents crowd the box to try to counter the danger, reducing their chances of breaking away. If they do get the ball upfield, they come up against one of the league’s hardest-running sides – tracking back quickly and cohesively even when 2-0 up in stoppage time.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

It’s a risky approach, but one that Premier League sides may have to take to find a flaw in this finely tuned goalscoring machine. It could be about to get even worse for opposing defences, too. Arteta’s squad areworking with a long-throw specialist, Thomas Grønnemark, to add another dimension to their set-piece prowess.Explore more on these topicsArsenalFootball tacticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The head coach also ­welcomes back George Furbank, who has struggled with calf and arm injuries recently and has not played for England since November 2024.A clutch of players including Fin Smith, Ollie Lawrence, Fin Baxter, Tom Roebuck and Ben Curry will head to next week’s warm weather training camp in Girona for rehabilitation but it remains to be seen whether they will be fit to face Wales at Twickenham for England’s opener on 7 February.Trips to Murrayfield and Rome follow, either side of the visit of Ireland to Twickenham, but despite England’s poor record in the tournament of late, Borthwick has told his players to put themselves on course for the title in Paris on the final weekend, calling on supporters to cross the Channel in their droves.Quick GuideMcCall to step down as Saracens director of rugbyShowSaracens have announced Mark McCall will step down as director of rugby at the end of the season, with Brendan Venter  to return for the 2026-27 campaign.Following 15 seasons in the job, McCall will remain as technical adviser and join the board. The South African Venter will return to a position he first held in 2009, having then recruited McCall as first-team coach, before switching to a part-time role as technical adviser, with Saracens going on to success domestically and in Europe.McCall said: \"I am immensely proud of what we have achieved at Saracens and grateful for the opportunity to have led the rugby programme for so long.\"I feel the time is right for change, while still remaining deeply involved in the club I care so much about. I am really looking forward to supporting Brendan and contributing in a way that helps Saracens continue to move forward.\"Saracens said the  changes will provide a \"sense of continuity and collaboration\" as the club moves into its \"next chapter\".Venter said: \"I am incredibly proud to once again lead the rugby programme. Mark's continued involvement was key to me accepting the appointment.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We met a couple of weeks ago and we talked about theSix NationsChampionship. We know it’s tight, we know there’s lots of good teams in it,” said Borthwick. “We also know the last seven Six Nations Championships have gone down to the last round of fixtures and we talked about that as a team.“On 14 March in Paris, we want to be in a position entering that game where we can achieve what we’re all aiming to achieve. That’s what we want. We want England fans flooding across the Channel to Paris to come and watch the team in a massive encounter in the final round with the opportunity to achieve what we want. We also know that the only way you get there is by ensuring each of you take each step one at a time and get our preparation right for the start of the tournament.”Borthwick has also called on his players to relish the added expectation that comes with a winning run that dates back to last February. “The first thing I’d like to say about that is I think it is brilliant that people are talking in that way about this England team,” he added. “They can see the development of the team and they can see the talent that’s in the team and they can see the potential that’s in it. I think we’re nowhere near ­maxing out the potential.“We have players in there with huge amounts of talent, and whilst we’re still reasonably low on experience at Test level, as they get used to Test rugby their growth is going to be enormous. I’m really pleased at how the players are embracing how we want to play, and taking the game on. I want them to attack this tournament, come in with a mindset to play brave and attack.”Quick GuideEngland's Six Nations squadShowForwards:Ollie Chessum (Leicester , 30 caps), Arthur Clark (Gloucester, 1 cap), Alex Coles (Northampton, 14 caps), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale, 53 caps), Chandler Cunningham-South (Harlequins, 20 caps), Tom Curry (Sale, 65 caps), Theo Dan (Saracens, 20 caps), Trevor Davison (Northampton, 3 caps), Ben Earl (Saracens, 46 caps), Greg Fisilau (Exeter, uncapped), Ellis Genge (Bristol, 75 caps), Jamie George (Saracens, 105 caps), Joe Heyes (Leicester, 17 caps), Maro Itoje (Saracens, 97 caps) – captain, Emmanuel Iyogun (Northampton, uncapped), Guy Pepper (Bath, 7 caps), Henry Pollock (Northampton, 5 caps), Bevan Rodd (Sale, 10 caps), Vilikesa Sela (Bath, uncapped), Sam Underhill (Bath, 45 caps)Backs:Henry Arundell (Bath, 11 caps), Seb Atkinson (Gloucester, 2 caps)Elliot Daly (Saracens, 74 caps), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton, 7 caps), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter, 13 caps), George Ford (Sale, 105 caps), Tommy Freeman (Northampton, 22 caps), George Furbank (Northampton, 14 caps), Alex Mitchell (Northampton, 27 caps), Cadan Murley (Harlequins, 4 caps) , Max Ojomoh (Bath, 2 caps), Henry Slade (Exeter, 74 caps), Marcus Smith (Harlequins, 46 caps), Ben Spencer (Bath, 14 caps), Freddie Steward (Leicester, 41 caps), Jack van Poortvliet (Leicester, 21 caps)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sela’s inclusion in a training squad for the first time comes after injuries to Will Stuart and Asher Opoku-Fordjour. Trevor Davison, who has three caps, is also included as is his Northampton teammate Iyogun with doubts over Baxter’s availability in the early part of the tournament. Such injury disruption to the front row threatens to blunt the impact of Borthwick’s “Pom Squad”, used with such impressive effect during the autumn internationals.Asked if he will have to tweak his strategy for replacements, Borthwick said: “Possibly. You deal with each of those situations on their own merits. We have also got plenty of depth in other positions and playing experience. That decision, I have talked at length about what we need to do in how there are so many Test matches that are within a score of each other in that final part of the game. So that’ll be a decision around the experienced front-row forwards.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

It is an ambition that began more than a decade ago and is now close to being realized.The climb will be broadcast globally onSkyscraper Live, Netflix’s latest foray into live sports programming. The star of the 2019Oscar-winning documentary Free Soloinsists that climbing Taipei 101 will feel no different from any other of his ascents.‘It’s sort of the extreme’: Free Solo’s Alex Honnold on rock-climbing without ropesRead more“You walk up to the base, you hop on to the building, you climb all the way to the top,” Honnold said on his podcast, Climbing Gold. “No ropes. No gear. No margin of error.”The two-hour event will take place at 9am local time in Taipei on Saturday, or 8pm ET on Friday in the US, and has already generated both excitement and criticism.There is a long tradition in the US of live-broadcast daredevil feats, from Evel Knievel’s motorcycle jumps in the 1970s to Red Bull’s modern-day record attempts.Netflixis not breaking new ground with Honnold, but it is continuing its push into live sports, joining Apple, Amazon Prime and Alphabet’s YouTube in acquiring rights to major events.Last year, Netflixaired Christmas Day NFL gamesand theJake Paul v Anthony Joshuaboxing match. It is also set to broadcast Major League Baseball’s Home Run Derby and the2027 Fifa Women’s World Cup.“What their strategy has been so far is to eventize sports,” said Richard Deitsch, a journalist who has covered US sports media for more than two decades. “They’re looking for one-offs rather than large inventories.”He described Skyscraper Live as “sports adjacent”, designed to draw viewers to Netflix’s broader catalogue. “Sports drives audience,” Deitsch said. “You have to watch it live.”Even so, Deitsch argues that streamers have an ethical obligation to be transparent about risk. “They owe you honesty,” he said. “Here are the dangers. Let the audience know this is not 100% foolproof.”Netflix is disclosing those risks, but it is also selling them. Thousands of people are placing bets on Honnold’s fate and completion time on Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction market, where current odds suggest he will finish the climb in around 75 minutes.View image in fullscreenAlex Honnold, pictured in London in 2019.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Guardian understands that the live stream will carry a viewer-discretion advisory and run on a 10-second delay, allowing Netflix to cut the feed if necessary. Honnold will remain in constant communication with his camera crew and producers.Netflix is working with Plimsoll Productions and Secret Compass, both of which have previously collaborated with Honnold on high-stakes projects including Arctic Ascent in Greenland and The Devil’s Climb in Alaska. A small live audience has been invited to watch in Taipei, and an on-air panel – featuring elite climbers alongside a former ESPN anchor, a WWE champion and a Nasa engineer turned YouTuber – will contextualize the attempt.In recent days, Honnold has been spotted conducting rope-assisted test runs amid drizzle and the wail of ambulance sirens, with permission from the Taipei city government.The decision to livestream the 1,667ft (508m) ascent has sparked backlash froms some within the climbing community. Critics, including a Wall Street Journal columnist, have pointed to the high number of free-solo deaths and to Honnold’s role as a husband and father, branding the event “voyeuristic, ghoulish and irresponsible”.Concerns intensified afteran Alaskan climbing influencer died last yearin a fall that was livestreamed on TikTok. Saturday Night Live even skewered the ethics of Honnold’s climb ina recent cut-for-time sketch.At Long Dong, the sandstone “dragon caves” overlooking the Pacific Ocean northeast of Taipei and a popular climbing destination, amateur climber Chien Ai said he would not watch the live stream.“I don’t want to see something I’m not supposed to see,” he said. Instead, he plans to check news reports first and watch the replay only if Honnold succeeds.At a climbing gym in Taipei’s Zhonghe district, Yang Tse-hsiao, 41, a teacher who has climbed for six years, said he expects Honnold to succeed but still opposes the live stream.“I don’t understand why it has to be done this way, other than for commercial reasons,” he said. “If he falls, the price is huge.”His friend Chou Yen-shin, 61, who has climbed for 24 years, was less concerned. He believes Honnold would not attempt anything reckless and sees Skyscraper Live as a chance to raise Taiwan’s global profile.To the untrained eye, Taipei 101 looks forbidding. To climbers, its architecture offers predictability. The building’s distinctive “bamboo box” design features stacked segments with balconies every eight floors, providing regular opportunities to rest – akin to a multipitch rock climb.“One of the big differences between climbing a building and climbing rock is that there isn’t really a single hardest move,” Honnold told Netflix. Skyscrapers, he said, test endurance more than technical skill. “The challenge is the overall physicality. I don’t know how it’s going to feel.”The only person with comparable experience is Alain Robert, the 63-year-old French climber known as “Spiderman”, who climbed Taipei 101 on top rope in 2004. At the time, Robert was recovering from elbow surgery and faced high winds, rain and greasy holds on the unfinished structure.“I know Alex,” Robert said. “He has already planned his limits. There is not even a one-in-100-million chance that this will be his last climb.”Asked about the potential trauma of witnessing an accident, Robert shrugged. Wars, riots and coups are livestreamed every day, he said. “Death is part of life.”Dr Jamie Shapiro, a professor of sport and performance psychology at the University of Denver, said Honnold’s mental preparation – including visualisation and self-talk – would be crucial.“You can’t predict every challenge,” she said. “But you can trust your training and your competence. He has enough experience to stay composed if something unexpected happens.”Audiences, Shapiro added, are often drawn to moments of genuine risk. Watching an elite athlete attempt something impossible for the average person can inspire people to push themselves in positive ways.If weather conditions permit and he is not climbing outdoors at Long Dong, Chou plans to tune in.“Anyone who has climbed that long has a calm mind,” he said. “It will be a breakthrough.”Explore more on these topicsSportFree SoloRock climbingTaiwanAsia PacificNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Optimism was somewhat checked by controversy, however, following the allegations surrounding Thomas Partey and Arsenal’s decision to offer the midfielder a new contract.Manchester UnitedRuben Amorim’s first full campaign in charge promised much after a summer in which three new attackers had been signed – Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, the lack of any midfield arrivals alongside lingering concerns about the head coach’s rigid tactical approach meant supporters were also somewhat apprehensive.What happened …Manchester United 0-1 ArsenalRiccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of a largely drab contest, the Italian nodding in a Declan Rice corner at the far post to set in a motion the defining trend of Arsenal’s season so far. United had once again lost at Old Trafford but in delivering an encouraging performance, cohesive as well as committed, there was a clear sense of things coming together under Amorim.View image in fullscreenRiccardo Calafiori scores the only goal as Arsenal win at Old Trafford.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWhere are they now?ArsenalDreaming of a first title since 2004 after finding themselves seven points clear with less than half the season remaining. This surely has to be Arsenal’s season, given the respective shortcomings of their main rivals and their formidable and now largely fit squad. There has also been talk of a quadruple, which while highly unlikely cannot be ruled out given the various strengths of Arteta’s side, most notably in defence and at set pieces.Manchester UnitedWith Michael Carrick again in interim charge after a falling-out between Amorim and United’s hierarchy, most notably the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, had made the Portuguese’s position untenable. Carrick’s task is clear: raise spirits while making a push for the top four, and he has started with a bang withvictory in a Manchester derby. The former midfielder also has a clear run of things given United are out of both cup competitions, as well as not competing in Europe.Bournemouth v LiverpoolStart-of-season shape:BournemouthAn excellent 2024-25 campaign had, rather inevitably, led to the south-coast club’s best and brightest talents being slowly but surely picked off by bigger clubs. Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez all departed in the off-season, the last joining the team Andoni Iraola’s men were scheduled to face on the opening day.LiverpoolThe sudden death of Diogo Jota in early July meant thePremier Leaguechampions were in a state of mourning. Excitement about a new season had been tempered, albeit an eye-catching summer outlay, headlined by the £116m arrival of Florian Wirtz and expected to soon include Alexander Isak, had supporters in high expectation regarding what lay ahead.What happened …Liverpool 4-2 BournemouthA Friday night thriller in which Liverpool took a 2-0 lead, with their first goal scored by Hugo Ekitiké, another summer arrival, only to be pegged back to 2-2 by a double from Antoine Semenyo, his second goal a stunning solo effort. The visitors appeared to have secured a draw only for Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah to score late on for the hosts. Cue joy and relief inside Anfield.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa (left) and Mohamed Salah scored late to deny Bournemouth at Anfield.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/APWhere are they now?BournemouthIn 15th amid a season that has been relentlessly difficult. That is little surprise given the loss of key players, with Semenyo the latest to depart in a £62.5m move to Manchester City at the start of the month. There have still been flashes of excellence from Iraola’s side, with Alex Scott, Eli Kroupi and Evanilson regularly catching the eye. That could, of course, well be a problem for Bournemouth come the opening of the next summer transfer window.LiverpoolNowhere close to defending their title after a collapse in which Arne Slot’s side lost nine out of 12 games in all competitions. The Dutchman has stemmed the bleeding but his side are performing with little cohesion and conviction amid a series of setbacks, including a serious injury to Isak just before Christmas. And, before that, there wasthatoutburst by Salah. Nonetheless, they sit fourth and retain what it takes to have strong runs in the FA Cup and Champions League.Brentford v Nottingham ForestStart-of-season shape:BrentfordA mess, on paper at least. Thomas Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Nørgaard and Mark Flekken all gone, Yoane Wissa on strike, and the set-piece coach promoted to manager. Few knew what to expect, but most were tipping a serious struggle for Keith Andrews and his side. The return from long-term injury of Igor Thiago, previously the club’s the record signing, was one source of positivity, at least.Nottingham ForestFans were anxious mid-summer, seeing Anthony Elanga sold and Morgan Gibbs-White flirt with Spurs. But some dynamism from the owner changed the mood: Evangelos Marinakis convinced Gibbs-White to stay, secured acontroversial elevation to the Europa League, and added a series of new faces late on, including the £36m Bologna winger Dan Ndoye. Optimism was high.What happened …Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford. The visitors were duly overrun, three down at the break to goals from Chris Wood, Ndoye on debut and Gibbs-White. “We will learn a lot from that 45 minutes, especially me,” said Andrews. A goal from Thiago, his first for the club, was one consolation. For Nuno Espírito Santo it was evidence his players were ready to kick on. “I just want to go home and celebrate. It’s a beautiful start.”View image in fullscreenDan Ndoye’s career at the City Ground got off to a flying start when he headed home the second Forest goal in their 3-1 victory over Brentford.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWhere are they now?BrentfordSeventh in the table, Thiago is second behind Erling Haaland in the top scorers list, and the new signings Jordan Henderson and Caoimhín Kelleher are excelling. “The hinges could have come off the door in the summer because of all the changes,” said Andrews. “But I was well aware of the values of the club, the humility, the way we worked. When you do that and work hard collectively, there’s only one outcome.”Nottingham ForestSo much for the beautiful start. Nuno was sacked after three games for going public on his testy relationship with Marinakis. The owner then hired Ange Postecoglou, sacked him a month later, and turned to Sean Dyche instead. Forest sit 17th, five points above the relegation places. There are signs of life – awin at 18th-placed West Hamand adraw with Arsenalshowed fighting spirit – butthe display at Bragawas feeble.Burnley v TottenhamStart-of-season shape:BurnleyAfter a four-season run of yo-yoing, the target was simple: stick it out. The club’s big strength in the promotion season was a defence which conceded just 16 goals in 46 games, but the key components James Trafford and CJ Egan-Riley departed, as did the captain, Josh Brownhill. Scott Parker added experience in Kyle Walker and Axel Tuanzebe. Up front, much would depend on £20m Armando Broja.TottenhamNot even the Europa League trophy could save Postecoglou from his 17th-place finish, via 22 defeats. Daniel Levy picked Frank to replace him, preferring the Dane over Iraola and Marco Silva. Son Heung-min left for the US, but Mohammed Kudus, Mathys Tel and João Palhinha arrived, with reports of a deal close for Eberechi Eze, too. The mood: cautiously upbeat.What happened …Tottenham 3-0 Burnley. A dream start for Frank as Kudus teed up two goals for Richarlison, the second a stunning scissor-kick. Brennan Johnson hit the third. Parker, meanwhile, was left to reflect on “the ruthlessness of the Premier League … We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us, but it’s one we are going to embrace.”View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Richarlison unleashes his acrobatic effort against Burnley.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?Burnley19th, on a 13-game winless run, with Broja having scored once. A spell of seven straight defeats in November and December led to boos from fans which, said Parker, “broke my heart … It was only four months ago that I was standing on the balcony in the town centre and all of us were celebrating.” Buta fine point won at Anfieldlast time out showed spirit. Eight points from the last safe spot, but not buried yet.TottenhamThe positivity did not last. Eze signed for Arsenal and, despite a solid start, Frank’s injury-hit side have now won just twice in the last 13, sit 14th in the table andlost 2-1 to West Hamin their last league game. The pressure on the new manager’s position has reached Postecoglou levels. But could their stylish, surprise2-0 Champions League win against Borussia Dortmundon Tuesday be a turning point?Crystal Palace v ChelseaStart-of-season shape:Crystal PalaceOliver Glasner’s side began the campaign with fresh silverware to their name after beating Liverpool to the Community Shield. There were few ins and outs before the opener, albeit Eze was widely expected to be on his way to Tottenham.ChelseaEnzo Maresca’s side started the season as – technically – the best team on the planet having won the first iteration of Fifa’s expanded Club World Cup. There was also once again a hive of transfer activity at Stamford Bridge, with João Pedro and Jamie Gittens among those arriving and Noni Madueke and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall among those departingWhat happened …Chelsea 0-0 Crystal PalaceThe hosts delivered an uninspiring performance and were fortunate not to lose after Eze saw a firmly hit free-kick ruled out by a somewhat pedantic video assistant referee intervention, with Marc Guéhi penalised for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall as he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. Palace were the better team and, justifiably, felt hard done by.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze had a free-kick strike ruled out at Chelsea due to a harsh VAR ruling which stated that Marc Guéhi of Crystal Palace was standing too close to the Chelsea wall.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesWhere are they now?Crystal PalaceIn a state of turmoil and decline. Eze joined Arsenal shortly after the season started with Guéhi also moving, toManchester City, this week; two blows that led to Glasner accusing the club’s board of “abandoning” the team after confirming he will leave Palace in the summer, when his contract expires. He may well go before then, leaving behind a team in mid-table and seeking to progress in the Conference League.ChelseaManaged by Liam Rosenior after Maresca was sacked on New Year’s Day following a falling-out with the club’s hierarchy that reared its head in the shape of comments made by the Italian after a 2-0 victory overEvertonin December. Qualification for the Champions League – and from the Champions League league phrase – remains achievable for the new man in charge, albeit both are far from certain.Everton v LeedsStart-of-season shape:EvertonA first summer under new owners, The Friedkin Group, meant Everton were notable spenders in the market, yet it was a loan deal that had supporters most excited. Jack Grealish’s arrival from Manchester City very much pointed towards an exciting and ambitious campaign ahead for David Moyes’s team.LeedsThere was much excitement surrounding Daniel Farke’s side after promotion back to the Premier League and a summer of notable spending. Eight new players had arrived at the club, including the imposing German midfielder Anton Stach from Hoffenheim and, intriguingly, Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer.What happened …Leeds 1-0 EvertonElland Road rocked on the first Monday night of the campaign and the majority of those in attendance were rewarded for their backing with a win. Lukas Nmecha, another summer arrival, scored the only goal of the game, converting an 84th-minute penalty awarded for a handball by James Tarkowski that the visitors deemed to be a hugely unfair call.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha reacts after scoring the decisive late penalty for Leeds against Everton.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?EvertonSlap-bang in mid-table. Moyes’s men are 10th having displayed curious form throughout the campaign – woeful home losses and excellent away wins sprinkled alongside frustrating and/or dull draws. What’s for sure is that this will not be another season defined by a relegation battle, albeit it will be one in which Everton once again fail to win a trophy.LeedsIn 16th and very much looking up after a turnaround in performances and results sparked by a change of system – from 4-1-4-1 to 3-5-2 – by Farke. The German has gone from dead man walking to the toast of West Yorkshire, helped in sizable apart by Calvert-Lewin’s prowess in front of goal. A fourth-round trip to Birmingham also offers Leeds the very real prospect of extending their run in the FA Cup.Fulham v BrightonStart-of-season shape:FulhamThe west London’s club’s transfer dealings had been incredibly quiet in the buildup to the opening weekend, with the only addition to Silva’s ranks being the 34-year-old reserve goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte from Montpellier.BrightonA busy summer of transfer activity featured about £70m spent on eight new additions, including Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos and Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge, while a host of players also departed, no one more notable than João Pedro, who joined Chelsea for £60m in early July.What happened …Brighton 1-1 FulhamFabian Hürzeler’s side started the season very much how they had performed throughout the previous one – by giving up a lead. Matt O’Riley had put the hosts in front via a 55th-minute penalty before Rodrigo Muniz converted a Harry Wilson corner deep in stoppage time to give the visitors something to take with them from the south coast.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz claims a point for Fulham at Brighton.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?FulhamOne place and one point ahead of Brighton in 11th, which feels right given their mix of results this season. In their last four games alone, Silva’s side have won two, drawn one and lost one. Fulham also have a tricky-looking FA Cup fourth-round tie, travelling to a Stoke team firmly pushing for promotion from the Championship.BrightonSitting 12th feels right for a team whose form has been mixed throughout the season and could very much go either way between now and the end of the season. There could be a decent run in the FA Cup but for that to happenLiverpoolwill have to be beaten at Anfield in the fourth round. Such an outcome is unlikely but by no means impossible.Manchester City v WolvesStart-of-season shape:Manchester CityAfter finishing a distant third and losing the FA Cup final, a reset. Pep Guardiola overhauled his staff and reshaped the squad with signings including Rayan Aït-Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and the goalkeeper Trafford. Plenty of focus too, on managing Rodri’s comeback from long-term knee injury. “It’s difficult but he’s desperate to play,” said Guardiola. “We need his ambition, his personality, his quality.”WolvesThe target was no repeat of 2024-25’s nightmarish start: nine points from their first 16 games and Gary O’Neil sacked. Vítor Pereira replaced him and turned it round, and approached his first full season in bullish mood. But losing Cunha, Aït-Nouri and Nélson Semedo left the squad looking depleted during a winless, frustrating pre-season. Hopes were high, though, for the new arrival Jhon Arias.What happened …Wolves 0-4 Manchester City. A vintage City display headlined by two goals from Haaland and a superb Reijnders debut. For Wolves, Marshall Munetsi had an effort ruled out for offside, but that was as close as they came to making an impact. Pereira looked for the positives, though. “I didn’t lose my smile because each mistake that we committed, they punished us with a goal. I will take good things from the game.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland on his knees after scoring Manchester City’s third against Wolves.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWhere are they now?Manchester CityAfter beating Wolves they lost the next two – but it seemed like a blip. By the end of November they were second, and set off on a six-game winning run. But 2026 has been bruising: no league wins in four,defeat in a Manchester derby, and a3-1 humiliation at Bodø/Glimt. Rodri has laboured; Haaland likewise. Guardiola: “We have the ­feeling that everything is going wrong in many details. We have to try to change.”WolvesAdrift, via a familiar opening few months: eight defeats in their first 10 league games, with Pereira sacked in November. Rob Edwards, the new manager, then lost the next eight. Arias has underwhelmed and last season’s key scorer, Jørgen Strand Larsen, has misfired and looks set to leave. They are, though, unbeaten in the last four, including astirring 3-0 win over relegation rivals West Ham. So … maybe?Newcastle v Aston VillaStart-of-season shape:NewcastleAn Isak-shaped cloud hung heavy over the entire club going into the opening day. Eddie Howe’s star striker was refusing to play as part of his attempt to force a move to Liverpool but was going nowhere until the champions met Newcastle’s £150m valuation. Attempts to lure Wissa from Brentford were also proving difficult.Aston VillaThe mood around Unai Emery’s side was not great given the previous campaign had ended with them being pipped to Champions League qualification by the team they were facing at Villa Park and a summer in which profitability and sustainability rules meant they could not spend more than €5m net.What happened …Aston Villa 0-0 NewcastleAmid chants of “There’s only one greedy bastard” from their fans, Newcastle delivered a united, defiant display but one that highlighted their lack of cutting edge without Isak, with Anthony Gordon largely ineffective as their central striker. Villa were ultimately happy with a point given they had been reduced to 10 men after Ezri Konsa’s sending-off on 66 minutes.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Ezri Konsa fouls Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon, earning an opening-day red card.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersWhere are they now?NewcastleIn eighth on the back of very good home form and very poor away form. Nick Woltemade – Isak’s replacement – has blown hot and cold, as has Wissa following his eventual arrival and recovery from injury. Howe’s men are well placed to qualify for the Champions League playoffs and are still in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, albeit a semi-final exit from the former is likely.Aston VillaFirmly ensconced in third on the back of 11 successive wins at Villa Park, a run brought to an end by defeat to Everton last weekend. They could still win the title but almost certainly will not. Decent runs in the FA Cup and Europa League should not be ruled out, however, especially if Morgan Rogers continues to deliver eye-catching displays between now and May.West Ham v SunderlandStart-of-season shape:West HamWould this be the real start of the Graham Potter era, his first full season after replacing Julen Lopetegui in January? Or would it be more of the same? Potter brought in a sports psychologist and pre-season signs looked fairly positive, despite Kudus departing to Spurs. Hopes were high for the new left wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf, and for Niclas Füllkrug to come good.SunderlandNo lack of ambition: £132m on 11 signings, with arrivals including Roma’s Enzo Le Fée, the Paraguay defender Omar Alderete, Arsenal old boy Granit Xhaka and the £30m midfielder Habib Diarra. The departed Jobe Bellingham was a loss, though, and doubters wondered whether the manager, Régis Le Bris, could blend so many new faces into a cohesive top-flight unit.What happened …Sunderland 3-0 West Ham. The hosts fielded seven of their new signings, but old faces made the difference: Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard put them two up, before Wilson Isidor rounded it off in added time. For Potter and West Ham fans, it was a bleak start. “We have to learn the lesson that it’s difficult to win matches,” he said. “It’s one game but we have to bounce back. We have to be better. We have to make it happen.”View image in fullscreenSunderland fans celebrate Wilson Isidor’s goal to cap their win over West Ham.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhere are they now?West HamPotter lasted until last September, with his side 19th. Nuno has them 18th, including a run of 10 games without a win, and no clean sheets in any of his 17 league games so far.A 2-1 win at Spurslast time out showed spirit, but the mood remains toxic, with fans still protesting against the board. The £27.5m striker Füllkrug, meanwhile, wasloaned out this month, after three goals in 29 appearances.SunderlandLe Bris did find that blend. Sunderland sit ninth, three points off Liverpool in fourth, having beaten Chelsea away and Newcastle at home, and held Arsenal. Noah Sadiki and Nordi Mukiele have excelled, with Xhaka outstanding in the middle. They are resilient, too, winning 16 points from losing positions so far – second only to Aston Villa, and the most by a promoted side since West Brom in 2010-11.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaNewcastle UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionFulhamChelseaCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was optimistic, having been involved in the development of aFerrarifor the first time but acknowledged that a huge task lay ahead.“The 2026 season represents a huge challenge for everyone, probably the biggest regulation change I have experienced in my career,” he said. “Being involved from the very start in the development of such a ­different car has been a particularly fascinating challenge, working closely with the engineers to help define a clear direction for it.Storm brews over new F1 rules loopholes as Mercedes and Red Bull gain advantage | Giles RichardsRead more“It will be an extremely important year from a technical perspective, with the driver playing a central role in energy management, understanding the new systems and contributing to the car’s development.”The scale and complexity of what the teams are building, including entirely new engines split 50-50 between combustion and electrical energy and the use of active aerodynamics, was made strikingly clear on Friday when Williams, who finished fifth in the championship last season, announced they were not ready to take part in the first test in Barcelona, beginning on Monday.Williams said they would instead run a virtual test-track programme next week and expect to make the second test in Bahrain, but it is an inauspicious start to what will likely be a frenetic championship.Indeed, the Ferrari team principal, Fred ­Vasseur, emphasised that he expected the new cars to be developed at a furious rate as the season progresses and also highlighted how the drivers would have to adapt extensively to driving them.“The biggest challenge will include the integration of all the systems together, including the drivers, it will be a full reset for them on their approach,” he said. “They will have to change completely the way that they approach the weekend. Even the way of driving will probably be a bit different. This also for them will be a challenge and part of our job will be to give them the good tools to be at their maximum.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton waves to fans after his test drive of the new car.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APFerrari was one of the teams, alongside Audi and Honda, who had written to the FIA, the governing body, expressing concerns that Mercedes and Red Bull had gained an advantage in their engine design by using thermal expansion of components to increase their compression ratio. The row over the design will almost certainly now carry on into the season, after a meeting between engine manufacturers and the FIA on Thursday did not resolve the issue.The question over when the compression ratio is measured, currently when the car is “cold” and not running, against on track when thermal expansion can be exploited is central to the argument. However with no agreement reached – perhaps understandably from Mercedes and Red Bull – if they do have an advantage that might amount to as much as 0.3seconds a lap they will carry it into the start of the season.Enrico Gualtieri, the Ferrari power unit technical director, maintained that they remained in a dialogue with the FIA. “We are still discussing with them,” he said. “We are going to have an additional meeting in the next days. We are trusting them for managing the topic in the proper way, going through the procedures and the governance that is in place by regulation. We completely trust that the process could come in the next days and weeks.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Formula OneLewis HamiltonFerrariMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The former Masters champion could prevail this weekend in the Dubai Desert Classic and see a decent chunk of the $1.5m (£1.1m) first prize duly handed back to the DP World Tour in fines. Reed has joked that it will not be particularly easy for him to make a profit on this tour during 2026. Indeed, he basically starts his season in the red.Reed’s membership of the DP World and LIV circuits leads to sanctions from the former every time he tees up on the latter. He lost an appeal over that situation in 2023 yet, unlike some others, opted to keep playing on what was once theEuropean Tour. Reed’s position is further affected by the general understanding that LIV would no longer pay fines on behalf of its members from the end of 2025.“It is a really fluid one depending on how much it [the fine] is because it also depends where the event is,” Reed said. “There are so many different factors that go into it. Trying to wrap your head around all of it, it’s confusing. I’d rather just tee it up and play; and if costs me this, that, whatever, I’ll go play.Hatton dismisses LIV tension with McIlroy as talk in Dubai focuses on wines not finesRead more“We haven’t played an event yet that we would be fined so we don’t know really what it entails for this year. If it happens to be where I’m being fined and having to pay fines to play out here, so be it. I’m not going to allow that to deter me from showing support and playing on this tour. Play well and it offsets.”So far, so good on that front. Reed’s second round of 66 at the Emirates Club placed him at the summit of the leaderboard, nine under par, one clear of Andy Sullivan. Reed has previous for being at the centre of drama in Dubai; he infamously threw a tee peg at Rory McIlroy herethree years agobefore being edged out for the title by the Northern Irishman.“I guess I need to put my hand out, break the ice,” said Reed before a smile which implied devilment. “Or maybe he needs to throw one at me.”McIlroy’s 69 meant he comfortably survived for the weekend at two under. A further 36 holes will be useful to the Masters champion, who has looked well short of his best in the opening half of this tournament.Given McIlroy’s specialism at this course and the potential for him to make an early Saturday run, the gap to Reed is far from insurmountable.“I think I came from 10 behind a couple of years ago to win,” McIlroy said. “I’m seven back at the minute. If I go out there tomorrow, maybe in slightly better conditions in the morning and post a low one, then I’ll be right in the mix come Sunday. ”Tyrrell Hatton matched McIlroy’s round-two score to leap to five under. Reed’s LIV teammate Dustin Johnson missed the cut. Danny Willett, who had opened with a 76, withdrew before the start of Friday’s play.Explore more on these topicsEuropean TourGolfUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It never hurts to have strength in depth at Cheltenham in March, however, and a win for Taurus Bay in the Grade Two AIS Novice Hurdle would see him shoot towards the market leaders for the Turners Novice Hurdle.The British are coming! Will the tide turn at the 2026 Cheltenham festival?Read moreBen Pauling, who trains both The Jukebox Man and Taurus Bay, has made no secret of the regard in which he holds the five-year-old, a £155,000 purchase at Cheltenham’s February sale in 2025.“I think Taurus Bay is very smart,” Pauling said, “but we are going from two miles to two and a half miles on what will be very testing ground and hopefully he will stay.“He’s in very good order and looks a million dollars and we’re keen to see how he progresses at this level. I think he’ll handle the ground, but it’s whether he really wants this trip in a bog. There’s a difference between somewhere like Aintree on soft ground and then Cheltenham in soft ground, but he’s a classy horse and I would hope he can take it in his stride.”Act Of Innocence, from the Nicky Henderson stable, is the marginal favourite for the contest, and one of three Henderson-trained market leaders on the card including Sir Gino in the International Hurdle.Sir Gino made a brilliant debut over fences at Kempton’s Christmas meeting in 2024 but has since reverted to hurdles after his stable companion and former Champion Hurdle winner Constitution Hill suffered a series of falls to put his future over jumps in doubt.“We could have done without the [recent] rain and Ferraris probably don’t work in a muddy field,” Henderson said at Warwick on Friday. “It might not be that, but it might be hard work tomorrow.“Everyone is probably quite twitchy at the moment and nobody really wants to see horses walking up the hill at Cheltenham, as that is not a good preparation two months before the festival.”Lion can roar in key Champion Hurdle trialSir Gino is a red-hot favourite to win his first ever meeting with The New Lion in the International Hurdle at Cheltenham on Saturday but there is next to nothing to choose between the pair on their form to date and soThe New Lion (3.00)appeals as a much better bet at around 2-1.Dan Skelton’s runner was still going through the gears when he came down two out in the Fighting Fifth Hurdle at Newcastle last time, and would almost certainly have remained unbeaten but for that mishap.He is rated within 2lb of Sir Gino by Timeform, and has as much, if not more, scope for improvement as Henderson’s runner after just five starts over hurdles.Doncaster 12.55Ben Pauling’sKicour Laeased 13 lengths clear in a good time at Leicester last month and can extend his unbeaten record.Cheltenham 1.15Booster Bobput up a new career-best on his return from a nine-month break at Newbury and two of the next three home were winners next time.Doncaster 1.30A strong second behind Wodhooh at Leopardstown last time should perhaps not be taken too literally, butFeet Of A Dancerwas also fourth under 11st 7lb in last season’s Pertemps Final at the festival and has an obvious chance on that form.Cheltenham 1.50The one-two from the Cross Country handicap at the December meeting take each other on again and Emmet Mullins’sJ’Arrive De L’Estcould reverse the form on 6lb better terms.Quick GuideGreg Wood's Saturday tipsShowLingfield11.58Harlington12.33Lovethiswayagain1.08Far Too Fizzy1.43Mick’s Spirit2.14Voix De Bocelli2.48Alyara3.26Secret Road4.00Watermelon SugarCheltenham12.05Jordans Cross12.40One Horse Town1.15Booster Bob1.50J’Arrive De L’Est2.25Spillane’s Tower3.00The New Lion (nb)3.35Impose Toi4.10Heads UpDoncaster12.20Manganese12.55Kicour La1.30Feet Of A Dancer2.05Docpickedme (nap)2.38Ki Woo3.13Mighty Bandit3.48Hobbson’s DayUttoxeter12.47Kenzoko1.22Up To Trix1.57Jaipaletemps2.32Master Breffni3.06In The Age3.41Aboutdamntime4.18Eton MesNewcastle4.05Alpine Sierra4.35Bishop’s Glory5.05Million Gold5.35Carbine Harvester6.05Alfa Whiteburd6.35Esque Elegance7.05Relevant RangeWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Doncaster 2.05Three or four of these will be vying for the lead which could leave last year’s winner,Docpickedme, ideally placed to strike.Cheltenham 2.25Jack Kennedy takes over onSpillane’s Towerfor the first time since his career-best run splitting Fact To File and Galopin Des Champs in the 2024 John Durkan Memorial Chase, and he will be a serious player if this return to fences sparks a revival after two sub-par runs over timber.Cheltenham 3.35Nicky Henderson’sImpose Toicontinues to progress at the age of eight and should add this Grade Two contest to his Grade One win at Ascot before Christmas.Explore more on these topicsHorse racingHarry RedknappCheltenham festivalfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But maybe, as Trump stalks, that old slogan is finally making senseFri 23 Jan 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.50 ESTShareIt has become known as the “war of nerves”. An apt name for a jittery, jangling time in British history, consumed with fear of what may be coming, in which the sheer unpredictability of life became – as the historian ProfJulie Gottlieb writes– a form of psychological warfare. Contemporary reports describe “threats of mysterious weapons, gigantic bluff, and a cat-and-mouse game intended to stampede the civilian population of this island into terror”.It all sounds uncannily like life under Donald Trump, who this week marched the world uphill to war, only to amble just as inexplicablyback down again. But Gottlieb is actually describing the period between the Munich crisis of 1938 and the blitz beginning in earnest in September 1940. Her fascinating study of letters, diaries and newspapers from the period focuses not on the big geopolitical picture but on small domestic details, and what they reveal about the emotional impact of living suspended between peace and war: companies advertising “nerve tonics” for the anxious, reports of women buying hats to lift their spirits and darker accounts of nervous breakdowns. We did not, contrary to popular myth, allKeep Calm and Carry On. Suicide rates, she notes, rose slightly.How do you live an ordinary life under the shadow of a war? Though for now that shadow has thankfully receded, this peace remains uneasy. If he did use force againstGreenlandhe would be unstoppable, Trump boasted, before conceding that actually: “I won’t use force” – nor the threatened trade tariffs either. Well, not today, anyway. Tomorrow, who knows?I’ve written before about what this age of US anarchy means for governments, scrabbling to adapt to life without a superpower ally. But it’s less clear how the rest of us – doing the school run, taking the bins out, wondering whatexactlyVictoria Beckham did atBrooklyn’s wedding– are supposed to respond to vague exhortations to become more resilient, orget on a war footing.Emily Thornberry, Labour chair of the foreign affairs select committee,described this weekhow a friend had been so scared watching Keir Starmer’spress conference on Greenlandthat she burst into tears. Parents of teenage sons, in particular, are fielding difficult questions about whether they might have to fight in some looming world war three. High-street business owners will be bracing for another slump, knowing that anxious people tend to stop spending money.View image in fullscreenA baby, with his parents, is tried for his gas mask in London just after the declaration of war, 13 September 1939.Photograph: Daily Herald Archive/SSPL/Getty ImagesSo it felt surreal to walk out of a bleak briefing on Trump hosted by the Institute for Government thinktank this week on to streets full of people jogging, window-shopping, going out for dinner like nothing’s happening. The public mood seems almost as disconnected from the seriousness of the moment as in the weeks before the first Covid lockdown, when pubs were full even as intensive care wards overflowed with the dying.Yet two days on, I’m wondering whether the joggers and the window-shoppers were on to something. The threat remains real enough. But the challenge for anyone not professionally involved in countering it may be learning to live with chaos as our new normal, rather than panicking every time Trump does this. Frivolity might be crucial to staying sane.Don’t get me wrong: the golden rule remains never to normalise Trump or his wildly transgressive presidency. But in everyday life, when something is not within your power to change – and what can an ordinary British person realistically do about a rogue US president? – people adapt to survive, imposing some semblance of normal life on the palpably abnormal. It’s how we coped with lockdown, how Belfast lived through the Troubles, whyFinns were advised(after the invasion of Ukraine reignited old fears of Russian invasion) to create a daily routine and stick to it, while being careful not to project their own anxiety on to their children.We could use a Scandinavian mindset now, a certain emotional sturdiness. Just as Danes pride themselves on fostering emotional resilience in their children, Finland is famous forsisu– Finnish for the mix of collective grit and resolve arguably required for living along the Russian border in a country where winter temperatures can hit minus 40. It’s a particular kind of resilience that doesn’t just rely on toughness, but on strong social bonds encouraging people to pull together – survival prospects increase in a crisis where neighbours pool resources – and a healthy work-life balance to keep stress low.The final ingredient is preparedness, or taking practical steps to control whatever risks you can control, which helps with the otherwise soul-sapping feeling of powerlessness engendered by a modern war of nerves. Though following official advice on how to prepare for interruptions to power, or water, or wifi – designed to counter the threat of hybrid warfare by Russia or China, perhaps involving the sabotaging of energy supplies, banking systems or internet connections to demoralise and frighten people – may not sound very soothing, preparing for the worst can help manage the fear of it.Perhaps the hardest skill to master, however, is knowing when to just switch off. The last time the world supposedly held its breath like this, during the 1962Cuban missile crisis, the absence of rolling news and smartphones made it possible to block out the possible end of days if you wanted to. Now, we’re steeped in a social media culture that portrays looking away as immoral. But though as a lifelong news junkie it pains me to say so, not everyone is obliged to personally bear witness to everything all the time. Resilience in 2026 isn’t doomscrolling yourself into depression but knowing how to arm yourself with just enough information, before putting the phone down and watching The Traitors. For perhaps above all, surviving a war of nerves means taking your pleasures where you can.“Apple blossom snowing in the garden,” wrote Virginia Woolf in her diary in the spring of 1940, on a day that jarringly combined the invasion of Holland and Belgium with the small personal satisfaction of posting off some book proofs. “Leonard [her husband] says he has petrol in the garage for suicide should Hitler win, but we go on. It’s the vastness and the smallness that make this possible.”The entry is tinged with the guilt of dwelling on small joys amid such horror, but it’s perhaps only the comfort of the former that make the latter psychologically possible to absorb. To live only and always in the vastness would drive you mad. It’s all right, sometimes, just to watch the apple blossom fall.In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

But the next crisis will soon be hereFri 23 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTShareDonald Trump’s climbdown, after days of escalation during which he had refused to rule out amilitary attack to annex Greenland, was spectacular. In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his desire to own Greenland, claiming that you cannot defend what you do not own, only to then announce that he would not conquer the Arctic island by force. Hours later, he claimed that he had reached an unspecified deal on Greenland, and would therefore refrain from imposing additional tariffs on those European countries that had had the audacity to participate in a joint military exercise in Greenland at Denmark’s invitation.We know neither the details of the framework agreement reached by Trump and the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, nor whether it carries any weight, given the US president’s fickleness. But it appears that the deal,while open to discussing Arctic security, mineral rights and possibly even the sovereignty of US bases,preserves Greenland’s sovereigntywithin the Kingdom of Denmark. In short, this has been a remarkable U-turn.There are several possible explanations for this reversal. Discomfort among Republicans and the American public at the prospect of attacking a Nato ally,turbulence in global marketsand Rutte’s sycophancy are all possibilities. Domestic pressures in the US may have played a role, but they were not yet strong enough to fully explain the sudden about-face.Rutte’s servility is certainly appreciated by Trump, but it is unlikely to have dissuaded him from his ambition to leave a mark as the first president to have expanded US territory since the late 1950s. The markets’ decline offers a more plausible explanation. This is not the first time: Trump’s abrupt retreat on trade after hisbombastic “liberation day” last springcoincided with a market freefall and China’s refusal to back down, ready to retaliate tit for tat in the trade war.Yet the markets do not care whether Greenland belongs to Denmark or the US, nor do they lose sleep over violations of international law. WhenTrump attacked Venezuelawithout even seeking a UN security council resolution, the market response was muted. Nor were markets rattled when, shortly after, the US threatened another war on Iran.The markets reacted negatively this time, as they did in spring 2025, becauseEuropesignalled it would not be a pushover once again.Everyone knows that Europe does not hold the same cards as China in its dealings with the US, and that the US can hurt Europe more than the other way around. But Europe does have some leverage. Even the hint of using it, therefore reopening the prospect of a trade war, sent shivers through markets, pushing Trump to step back from the brink.The lesson for Europeans is clear. For a year, they tried to mollify, seduce and appease Trump. They offered himgilt-framed birth certificates, broke protocol to sendroyal invitations,played golf with himand sent sycophantic text messages. They accepted a terrible trade deal andagreed to raise defence spending to 5%of GDP, knowing many countries would never meet that target. They did so to buy time, hoping to induce Trump to side with them on Ukraine and remain committed to European security.But Trump has humiliated Ukrainians and mocked Europeans, stubbornly refusing to exert any pressure on Vladimir Putin. Yes, the US still sells weapons to Europeans, who then channel them to Ukraine. More recently, it has opened the door to providing security guarantees to Kyiv in a postwar scenario. But US military support for Ukraine has dwindled, and any security guarantees are hypothetical, given that a ceasefire is not in sight.Moreover, what is the value of any agreement signed with Trump if he can tear it up at any moment, as he has already demonstrated with trade? Europeanstacitly condonedTrump’s illegal war on Iran and were ambiguous about his equally illegal attack on Venezuela. In return, they received the threat of Greenland’s annexation. The US president could not have been more candid in Davos when he stated thatno one defends what they don’t own. If anyone still had any doubt about his commitment to Nato, there wentarticle 5 on collective defence,thrown out the window.Europe’s year of genuflection has been a spectacular failure. But something is changing. Europeans have stood firm onGreenland. European leaders, individually and collectively, spoke out in solidarity with Denmark and in support of its sovereignty. A group of European countries sent troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise. Most EU countries, with the exception of Hungary and Bulgaria, have shunned Trump’s “board of peace”.The European parliament suspended ratification of the EU-US trade deal on tariffs, and EU institutions began debating possible retaliatory measures should the US proceed with economic coercion. These include counter-tariffs worth just under €100bn, and the use of the EU’s most powerful trade weapon, the anti-coercion instrument, to limit access to the European single market or impose other measures aimed at curbing the ability of US firms to invest in Europe.All this remains hypothetical, given the US climbdown. We cannot know for certain whether the EU has the stamina to follow through if US economic coercion were actually ramped up. And it is highly likely that, if the EU did retaliate, it would do so incrementally, seeking consensus and always offering an off-ramp. In other words, the EU would continue to act in a quintessentially European way.But the lesson Europeans should draw from this latest episode of the Trump show is that the firmness they have tentatively displayed works far better than the subordination they attempted over the past year. The temperature has been lowered, so the risk is that European leaders will revert to their comfort zone of cowardice and inaction. But the calm will not last long, and when the next transatlantic crisis erupts, they should remember that Trump, like any strongman, understands strength and strength alone.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionGreenlandDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York were identified as primary targets. The stated goal was to keep communities “safe and free from illegal alien crime, conflict, and chaos”. Federal agents rapidly became a part of many residents’ everyday lives.No stable state can protect its borders, public order and the legitimate interests of its citizens without immigration law and effective enforcement mechanisms.The question is not whether the state has the right to enforce the law. The question is how themannerof enforcement shapes everyday life, feelings of safety and social trust. Do all forms of enforcement necessarily produce security, or do some of them – unintentionally – turn social fear into a lasting condition?A few days after the statement was released, I received a brief but urgent message from a colleague at Georgetown University Law Center. He warned that ICE agents were expected to be widely present across Washington DC, and that the likelihood of detentions was high. The advice was clear and practical: “Stay home. Don’t go out.”The question is not whether the state has the right to enforce the law. The question is how the manner of enforcement shapes everyday lifeThis warning was neither exaggerated nor emotional. It was a professional, precautionary recommendation of the kind that has become increasingly routine for many people in recent months. This subtle shift – from exceptional emergencies to the everyday management of fear – marks the point at which law enforcement moves beyond the legal domain and becomes a structuring force in daily life.From a sociological perspective, fear is not just a personal feeling – it’s a social reality. When people shape their behavior not based on direct experience but on the constant possibility of intervention, fear becomes part of the everyday. In this situation, arrests don’t need to happen daily; just knowing that somethingmighthappen is enough to change how people act.At this point, immigration enforcement goes beyond geographic borders. A knock on the door is no longer just a knock. Contacting a government office is no longer an ordinary administrative act. For certain groups and in certain spaces, these signals take on new meanings – meanings mixed with caution, silence and anxiety.Migration studies have long described this condition as “living on alert”: existing under the shadow of a possibility that is always there. The result is a series of small but ongoing behavioral changes: going out less, avoiding public offices, reporting problems less often and participating less in civic life. Each change alone may seem minor, but together they slowly wear down the social fabric.For example, imagine a family with a child in school. After hearing reports about immigration officers in the neighborhood, parents may go out less themselves or not allow their child to go outside even for simple errands or trips to the park. Contacting the school to follow up on educational issues may be delayed, and over time, the family’s participation in school and community activities decreases. This simple example shows how fear can shape everyday behavior and social relationships in real ways.Children of the Afghanistan diaspora in the United States are among the first to bear the psychological burden of heightened immigration scrutiny and the pervasive climate of fear, because they are deeply embedded in US schools and communities while remaining legally and emotionally tethered to parents whose immigration status is often uncertain, placing them at the frontline of family anxiety and instability. According to the 2024 American Community Survey, approximately46.6% of people in households from the Afghanistan diaspora in the U S– nearly 100,000 individuals – are children, many of whom were born in the US or arrived at a very young age. For these children, fear does not originate solely from home or family; news about ICE activities and rumors of mass deportations quickly circulates among peers and within school settings. Even without direct encounters with authorities, children absorb anxieties transmitted through classmates’ conversations and school-based chatter, leading to defensive behaviors such as speaking less, withdrawing from classroom participation and attempting to remain invisible. These experiences manifest in sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating and declining academic performance, while also undermining trust in institutions and weakening their sense of social belonging. The normalization of fear in social and educational environments threatens both long-term social integration and the resilience of the next generation.This pattern doesn’t just affect undocumented immigrants. Mixed-status families – where some members are citizens and some are not – show how fear spreads. Even a legally protected citizen adjusts their daily life with caution and self-censorship. Fear travels through social ties, not passports.In recent months, I’ve repeatedly heard friends from Afghanistan in the US describe how their American friends – people with no immigration concerns – have warned them to “be extra careful these days” or “call me immediately if the police stop you”. These are neither political statements nor exaggerations. They show how fear has entered everyday language of care and solidarity. Here, fear is no longer just an individual experience or a legal condition; it becomes a shared social reality that reshapes human relationships.For the Afghanistan diaspora and other Middle Eastern communities, fear has long been part of daily life, especially because of ICE’s presence and activities. Everyday routines, commuting, school participation and even simple social interactions are quietly shaped by the possibility of encounters with immigration authorities.When an Afghan immigrant wasaccused of shootingtwo US national guard members – killing one – the incident did more than make headlines; it intensified collective anxiety and reinforced the everyday caution already driven by immigration enforcement. In the days and weeks following the event, I observed increased silence, hesitation and worry among members of the diaspora. Many feared the allegations against one individual could be unfairly generalized to the entire community. In everyday conversations, there was concern that they might again be labeled a “security threat”.It must be emphasized that this act of violence was unethical and inhumane. The Afghanistan diaspora consists of people who have already endured war, displacement and the loss of home and security. The actions of one person cannot and should not define the moral character of an entire community that has suffered so much.But in this environment, daily life – accents, appearance, travel routes, even ordinary jokes – becomes a matter of calculation. Fear, amplified by the logic of generalization and by the structures of enforcement, turns everyday existence into a constant state of vigilance and anxiety.A common mistake is to see the current situation as simply an “immigration issue.” What is happening is a quiet redefinition of social belonging. Social belonging refers to the sense that individuals are part of a community, living alongside others and entitled to participate in society without fear or discrimination. When certain people or groups are considered “suspicious” or “outside” by default, this sense of belonging gradually erodes.In such an environment, the logic of unfair generalization and labeling can extend to race, social class, accent, appearance and even visible signs of poverty or difference. The question is no longer merely who is at risk of deportation or restriction; it is who is allowed to live an ordinary life with security and a sense of belonging.The issue is not the existence of the law, but how the law is experienced in society. Law enforcement is not just an administrative or security process; it is a social practice that can either build trust or make fear permanent. When fear becomes routine, it not only shapes behavior but also reshapes trust and social cohesion, undermining the very foundations of community life.This piece deliberately avoids policy recommendations – not out of caution, but because until we clearly see and name the problem, any solution will remain shallow. The final question is simple, but not comforting: does a society truly become safer when part of its population learns to live in constant fear and when that fear becomes an unspoken rule of everyday life?Abdul Wahid Gulrani is a political sociologist from Afghanistan, whose work focuses on migration, gender and national security.

Our focus on this former colony of Denmark, and its amazing Indigenous people, was motivated by one big factor. For political drama I always look for stories with emotion, and the old colonial tale of Denmark and Greenland is full of it.The modern history of that complex relationship began in 1721, when the priest Hans Egede, with permission from the Danish King Frederik IV, founded a mission and trading station in southernGreenland. The indigenous Inuit people were welcomed into the realm of Christ either voluntarily or by force. Egede remains a controversial figure in Greenland even still, and with good reason. A huge statue of him that sits on a hill just outside the island’s capital, Nuuk, was vandalised in 2020 with the slogan “Decolonize”.Greenland was formally made an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark in our constitution of 1953. But more than a decade earlier, during the second world war, Greenland had become a strategic hotspot for the United States, which needed a place to refuel its heavy bombers en route to Europe. Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany and the daring Danish ambassador to the US, Henrik Kauffmann, acting on his own,signed an agreementon behalf of the Danish king giving the Americans military access to Greenland. In 1951, during the cold war, the American need for even bigger bases was secured in a treaty that is still in existence. Basically, it means the Americans can build as many bases in Greenland as they want.View image in fullscreenA funeral scene in Ilulissat, Greenland, from the final series of Borgen in 2022.Photograph: Mike Kollöffel/NetflixIn 1953 the Americans decided to build their biggest base yet, Thule airbase (later renamed Pituffik space base) in a harsh northern area of Greenland that was home to the old Inuit settlement of Uummannaq. Again, the Inuit people were given an ultimatum: move immediately or we will move you by force.In the 1950s and 60s Thule airbase had more than 10,000 personnel and B-52 bombers were landing and taking off constantly. This posed a new challenge for the American-Danish-Greenlandic relationship.Denmarkwould not allow nuclear weapons on Danish soil but pragmatically decided that, if we refrained from asking the Americans whether the B-52s were carrying nuclear bombs they wouldn’t have to disappoint us with the truth.This wilful ignorance ended in 1968 when a B-52crashed near Thule airbaseand four nuclear bombs rolled out on the ice. This became yet another scandal in the difficult relationship between the superpower that is the US, its loyal ally the kingdom of Denmark, and Greenland, the world’s biggest island with a tiny population – currently about 57, 000 people.Greenlandgained home rule in 1979and finally in 2009 theAct on Greenland Self-Governmentwas passed by the Danish parliament, acknowledging that Greenland ultimately belongs to the Greenlandic people and that they should decide their own fate as an autonomous part of the kingdom.This law was the primary source of inspiration for Power & Glory, the final season of Borgen, as the legislation deals with dividing the income from Greenland’s natural resources between the Danish and Greenlandic peoples. In my story, a huge oil find close to the pristine ice-fjord of Ilulissat on the west coast of Greenland (one of the most popular tourist sites on the island) ends up as a geopolitical nightmare for Borgen’s main character, Birgitte Nyborg, Denmark’s fictional foreign minister. The oil company behind the discovery is first believed to be Canadian but turns out to be Russian; later on we learn it is actually Chinese. Of course, we know that such an oil find would be considered critical infrastructure by the US, which would be highly critical of it falling into Chinese ownership. This puts Denmark in the difficult position of a little brother who must follow orders, and in the process demand that Greenland does what it is told – thus reopening the old colonial wounds yet again.We really tried to create a dramatic plot that would seem credible yet take the Arctic tension further than had been done before. And we find ourselves completely overtaken by the theatre of the absurd played out by the Trump administration.Had I ever suggested a storyline involving an American president who becomes obsessed by the thought of owning Greenland, to the extent that he is willing to sacrifice Nato and use mob methods to bully allies into compliance, I would have been laughed out of any pitching session.Now we are living this nightmare. Listening toTrump’s rant in Davosdid not make us feel much safer.It is bizarre how accustomed we have become to a US president who openly lies, distorts facts and is utterly ignorant about history. (Leaving aside that heconfused Iceland with Greenlandin his speech.) Trump claimed that Europeans alone benefit from Nato and said he doubted anyone would come to the aid of the US. Yet the only country that has ever called for help invoking Nato’sArticle 5is the US after 9/11. Europe immediately responded. Denmark, along with the UK and other Nato allies, sent troops to Afghanistan. Denmark lost more soldiers per head than any other country in the coalition apart from the US. How utterly insulting for the families, still mourning their dead, to hear the ingratitude of a US president so ignorant of their loss.View image in fullscreenGreenlandic leaders negotiate with the Danish government in the final season of BorgenPhotograph: Mike Kollöffel/Netflix / Mike KollöffelIn Greenland, people are genuinely afraid of the madness coming out of the White House. So are the Danes. But if anything good has come out of this, it is that Danish and the Greenlandic people stand more united than ever. Danes fully support Greenlanders’ right to Greenland and to decide their own destiny.In Davos, Trump ruled out military action in Greenland, sure, andcalled offhis outrageous tariff threats as part of somevague “deal”, with Mark Rutte, the secretary general of Nato, reportedly involving a renegotiation of the 1951 treaty between the US and Denmark. The devil’s advocate might ask: how can “Daddy” Trump and the ever pleasing Rutte even negotiate theframeworkof a “deal” involving the US military presence in Greenlandwithout the participation of Greenland and Denmark? It almost reminds me of Trump meeting Putin todiscuss peace in Ukrainewithout inviting Zelenskyy.But maybe these theatrics arejust part of the new Trumpian “art of the deal”, where a more sinister scheme is really at play. Could Europe’s defence of Ukraine become the hostage in a mad game of power Monopoly, where the unity of Nato is at stake and ownership of Greenland is the ultimate reward? I certainly hope not. But this could be my dystopian pitch for how the nightmarish story develops. Please let me be laughed out of the pitching session one more time.Adam Price is a Danish screenwriter, executive producer and the creator of the TV series BorgenExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDonald TrumpDenmarkTelevisionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Retiring in your 80s is the new 60sSimon JenkinsAs long as you want to work and have wisdom to offer, you should continue to do so. Although some on the world stage outstay their welcomeFri 23 Jan 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 05.23 ESTShareSo Prue Leith is standing down from The Great British Bake Off. She has done nine years and feels it to be “the right time to step back” and “spend summers enjoying my garden”. Her fans and her friends will be sorry to see her go and will wish her well. The only thing they might question is her throwaway justification, “I’m 86, for goodnesssake.”What has that to do with it? Ever since the Equality Act of 2010, various discriminations in employment have been illegal. They included those based on ethnicity, gender, faithand age.After the 2010 act, the state pension age was planned to rise to 67, meaning that more older people are staying in the workforce. Those aged over 65 and recorded as “economically active” surged from around 900,000 to 1.5 millionin a decade. Still just 12% of over-65s were at work in 2023, but the idea of Britons becoming useless at 60 was increasingly unreal. Witha declining birth rateand a shortage of experienced labour during the same period – notably in welfare and hospitality services – an idle resource simply had to come to the aid of the economy.So hurrah for 86-year-old Prue Leith and her predecessor,Mary Berry, who stood down from the same cookery programme before her at 81. A credit to their generation, they both looked fit and showed no signs of deterioration, but of course they may have wished to go.Old people are far healthier than they used to be, but they should have their eyes – and ears – regularly tested for driving. Those working in professions such as medicine and the law should be forced to keep up to date. Incompetent public officials should be “retirable” at any age. There are also legitimate and possibly necessary reasons for retiring staff, but they should be stated. Declaring a person unfit to earn their living is a serious matter and should be justified – even if it has led to a rash of unfair dismissal cases.There are often unquantifiable virtues that come with age. Maturity, judgment and experience are invaluable assets in most forms of work. Every politician I know tends to reflect how much better they might have done in high office if only they had come to it later. They were simply wiser.Which bring us to the soon-to-be-80-year-old Donald Trump. The US has a great respect for old age. That supreme court justices are appointed for life is said to help guard the constitution. Senators can beas old as they like. But the veneration of age is also their vulnerability, because if age is not an issue then what is the benchmark for bringing a career to a close??In Trump’s first term in 2017 a team of psychiatrists, backed by a petition from 50,000 mental health professionals,declared him mentally unfitfor the job. They called for his sacking under the 25th amendment, which allows the removal of the president if he “is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office”. Trump survived and appeared to prove them wrong by securing re-election in 2024. But who or what determines fitness for office? The answer is set out in exhaustive detail in the constitution. Removalunder the amendmentrequires the collaboration of the vice-president and two-thirds of both houses of Congress. That is a mountain to climb.Either way this issue seems likely to vex American politics – and possibly global politics – with increasing severity over the next three years. It could well result in an unprecedented Washington power struggle. The one thing to be hoped for is that its outcome should turn on the president’s health, not his age.Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist and the author ofA Short History of America: From Tea Party to TrumpDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

For those of you not familiar with the term, it denotes the third Monday of January, which is alleged to be the most depressing day of the year. Collectively, I mean – obviously each of us has a birthday, plus a year coming up that will inescapably include bad haircuts, disappointing Vinted purchases and expensively untraceable leaks in the home. And Prue Leith’s leaving Bake Off.Let us focus, then, on the few, brief bright spots we can – if we really squint hard into the darkness – see. There’s microplastics maybe not poisoning our every organ as thoroughly as we thought. There’s Gwyneth Paltrow announcing that she loves a 6pm dinner and early beddy-byes. That’s not quite how she put it, but that’s what she meant. Now you have a something in common with Hollywood royalty! Can a glowing skin and multimillion-dollar wellness empire be far behind?There’s HBO Max coming to the UK in March and bringing with it The Pitt, starring Noah Wyle and honestly, this is just going to improve life – trust me.There’s … umm … other stuff, too? I mean, I’m sure you can fill in your own particular delights here. I’m just leaving things there because I’m overwhelmed by the array of choices on offer. So much, so much to look forward to. Hurrah.TuesdayEven in my bleakest moments, however, I never saw this one coming: hotels are saving money by abolishing toilet doors. I. Can’t. Even.The new trend is not to bother with things for which the hinges and handles cost money to maintain and that people had assumed were a basic, immutable component to the room in which you eliminate unspeakable material while pulling a variety of faces unconducive to human happiness were they ever to be sighted by the unfortunates not already laid out by the gases you are simultaneously producing. If you are lucky, you might get a fancy place that decided to incorporate sinks and showers into the bedroom and box off the loo itself with frosted glass. I mean, why not go the whole hog and just relocate the thing outside and make everyone troop down there, squares of newspaper in hand, like in the good old days?As Churchill more or less said, there are some things up with which we must not put. I don’t think he foresaw us ever falling so low, but surely his words have never rung more true.View image in fullscreenKim Jong-un: ‘Relax! Why do you look so nervous? This is a holiday camp and glorious leader says relax!’Photograph: KCNA via KNS/AFP/Getty ImagesWednesdayHarry Styles (a vastly popular young singer with slightly overcomplicated hair) has announced a new album, four years after the Grammy award-winning and grammatically uncontroversial (this will become salient in a moment, please be patient) Harry’s House. Joy, however, was not unconfined and that is because the new oneis called Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally. Prescriptive grammarians assemble! To comma or not to comma? Or, to comma, or not to comma?Well, not to comma, obviously. Kiss all the time – an imperative (grammatically speaking only. Otherwise it’s usually sexual harassment). Disco occasionally – matching imperative. Also, fun. But, without going too far. I, approve.Disco, occasionally – what is that? A playful disapplication of the rules, some say, as if there’s any such thing. A visual fillip for the album cover, say others, even more nonsensically.What’s a comma? says the average Styles fan, because it is generally foetal. So the world turns, towards anarchy, entropy and regret. Mainly because it doesn’t listen to me.ThursdayHang on – more good news. Add this to Monday’s list: the baked potato is making a comeback. Supermarket sales of giant taters are up, 70 food-related businesses with the word “spud” in their names opened last year (up from just four in 2023), the sandwich chain Subway is in on the act, street food vendors are popping up all over the place and online influencers are increasingly proselytising on the beautiful food’s behalf.Do you remember the late, great Victoria Wood’s line about hoping that if she hung around for long enough, someone would put in a good word for wine gums? I feel I’m living a version of that dream. I have been in love with the baked potato since I first read about them in my Milly Molly Mandy omnibus. I suspect the story was called Milly Molly Mandy and the Baked Potato, because Joyce Lankester Brisley never buried the lede, and it involved MMM’s “Muvver” cutting off the tops of two baked potatoes, mashing the insides with salt and butter, putting the tops back on and letting MMM and Little Friend Susan eat them by the fire. And if you have a better idea than that for a story, a meal or an evening, I would like to hear it.View image in fullscreen‘Back? To the future? Sure. Anywhere but here.

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) held around a quarter of the country and many critical resources – but were forced out of much of it within days. Though the SDF has effectively agreed to dissolution in principle, it has not shown it will do so in practice: a worrying sign for a fragile truce. A peaceful resolution is in everyone’s interests. Forcible integration by Damascus would risk breeding insurgency.The US relied upon the SDF in the battle against Islamic State. But Donald Trump hasembraced “attractive, tough” Mr Sharaa– a former jihadist who had a $10m US bounty on his head until late 2024. The US administration became increasingly frustrated at the SDF’s failure to implement last spring’s agreement to integration into the new army, apparently due to internal divisions. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey,wrotethis week that the rationale for partnership with the SDF had “largely expired” because Damascus was ready to take over security responsibilities.If the US has turned its back on the SDF, the second abandonment in this crisis is the western failure to deal with the tens of thousands of suspected IS members and their familiesheld in previously SDF-run prison camps such as al-Hawl– including their own nationals. The EU says that alleged breakouts are of “paramount concern”. In a country already struggling to recover from decades of Assad family dictatorship and years of civil war, which sawbrutal sectarian violenceinvolving government or allied forces last year,the risks are immense– and extend beyond the region.The US says it is transferring up to 7,000 of the most hardened fighters to detention in Iraq. Whatever they have done, they should be protected from torture, forced confession and execution. Women are reported to be among the most fanatical inmates, and to have raised their children accordingly. But years of dire conditions,without serious investment in deradicalisation, have increased the dangers they pose to others. Some of the foreign nationals held – like Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she left the UK to join IS – werestripped of their citizenship. But the British state cannot so easily shed its responsibility. Because countries hoped the issue would remain someone else’s, the threat has only grown. These detainees should be repatriated and dealt with by their own governments.Whatever the security capacity of the Syrian state – and Mr Sharaa’s forces went after IS as rivals before targeting them as an insurgent group – the country’s long-term prospects will be bleak without a brighter political horizon. That means inclusivity, dialogue, transitional justice and elections. Damascus has rightly reaffirmed the language and cultural rights ofKurdsin recent days, but shows little sign of tolerating political organisation by minorities which might threaten the centralised rule that it seeks.The volatility of Syria’s situation highlights the shamefulness of a third abandonment: Europe’s treatment of Syrians who managed to escape the country. While the country’s future remains in grave question, Austria and others are nowpushing for their repatriationto a place that will take an estimated $200bn to reconstruct, where their safety and rights remain fragile at best. Those governments must think again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

His enduring point was that strong leaders use their parties to contain power; weak ones try to banish it. Sir Keir Starmer seems ready to make this mistake over Andy Burnham.Reportssuggest that the prime minister’s allies will block any attempt by the Manchester mayor to run in a parliamentary byelection after a Labour MP, Andrew Gwynne, resigned. Mr Burnham may be eyeing a route back to Westminster and the possibility of a future leadership challenge. But No 10 wants to stop him before he gets going. Sir Keir is not asserting authority through confrontation. He is surrendering control and accepting responsibility for the consequences.Labour’s national executive committee, which is dominated by Sir Keir’s supporters, must give permission for a directly elected mayor to seek selection to be an MP. That discretion is now being presented as an obstacle course, with cost, a potential mayoral byelection and gender balance rules being thrown in Mr Burnham’s way. It is true that there is a chance Labour could lose the Manchester mayoralty if he were to stand down. But that underscores the message that the decision to block him is already made; the reasons can be assembled later.The defence of such skulduggery is that discipline matters, and now is not the time for party instability. But this is a profound misreading of the political mood. Labour’s problem is not too much debate. It is a growing inability to convince large numbers of voters that it has progressive answers equal to the scale of the crises the country faces: stuttering growth,stagnantreal wages, the rise of the far right and a sense that the political system itself no longer delivers.Pushing out one of the few figures with a reputation forgoverning effectively and for economic seriousnessmakes Downing Street appear petty and fearful. Excluding Mr Burnham could leave him with little to lose by leaving Labour and standing as an independent parliamentary candidate while remaining mayor. He would be weaponising apersonal popularitythat Labour itself now relies on in Greater Manchester – and ensuring that a defeat for Labour would be read not as a local difficulty, but as the price of a leadership unwilling to tolerate internal dissent.Labour is already losingsocially conservative votes to Reform UK and left-liberal ones to the Greens. Driving out a politician who can bridge those divides reinforces the impression that voters and members already have about Labour: pluralism of thought is no longer welcome. Significantly, polling by More in Common shows Mr Burnham as the only senior Labour figure whosefavourabilityrises with recognition, outperforming Sir Keir among voters that Labour has lost since 2024. Blocking him would be an electoral gamble – and the leadership would own the result.Labour MPs and union leaders have warned against a “stitch-up” to block Mr Burnham’s selection. This does not require the leadership to endorse a rival or invite a contest. It requires judgment. Is Sir Keir now so insecure that he cannot see that power is best managed inside the tent – not driven out in the vain hope that it will disappear? One would hope not.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But I had no idea just how brutal custody cases can be, 18 January). In heightening conflict between parents, this system destroys the potential of a negotiated co-parental agreement determined by parents themselves. The best laws are those which limit judicial discretion, including in family law, where children are caught squarely in the middle of the conflict.There is a viable alternative to the dominant litigation model for couples in conflict: a legal presumption of equal parenting, rebuttable in family violence cases, a model that reduces the harms of adversarial resolution. Shared parenting maintains children’s relationships with each parent and their extended family, reduces inter-parental conflict, and prevents first-time violence. What is missing, however, is the political will to enact legislative reform based on reliable scientific evidence on the benefits of shared parenting and a child-focused and collaborative approach. Despite family courts’ invocation of the “best interests of the child”, meaningful law reform remains elusive in the UK and beyond.The adversarial system provides a forum for the weaponisation of parental alienation and family violence allegations on the one hand, and minimisation and denial of actual violence on the other, rather than protecting those who are actually victimised. Family violence is a criminal matter and should be taken seriously by criminal courts, rather than abrogating responsibility to family courts which determine who is innocent and guilty, who is the winner and who the loser.The need for dialogue among activists in the fields of shared parenting and family violence is vital, given that ideological polarisation thwarts family-related law reform efforts. When it comes to post-separation parenting, the interests of mothers and fathers overlap. As Ms Feigel demonstrates, this is a life-and-death issue, and the cruelty of the child custody system is squarely to blame. The time has come for a long-needed alliance toward reform in the right direction.Edward KrukPresident, International Council on Shared ParentingYour extract from Lara Feigel’s book powerfully describes the emotional strain of family court proceedings, but it risks turning a painful personal outcome into a wholesale critique of the system. I am currently protecting my son from a high-conflict situation with my partner and understand how difficult it is. However, family courts are not designed to validate adults’ narratives but to make difficult decisions in circumstances already shaped by parental choices.Tragic custody outcomes do not in themselves demonstrate institutional bias. Courts are often forced to choose between imperfect options, prioritising stability over parental preference. The parents themselves create the conditions in which the court must operate. To interpret an adverse judgment primarily as misogyny or systemic failure sidesteps personal responsibility and obscures the central question of children’s long-term welfare.A public discourse that frames family courts as inherently unjust may ultimately be counterproductive, encouraging grievance rather than reflection in situations where cooperation and accountability matter most.Name and address suppliedIt is concerning to read in your article that the term “alienation” is still in use in custody family court contexts. Children are labelled (by self-appointed “experts”) as “alienated” as a weapon that effectively silences their voices and experiences, but also their choices. “Parental alienation” labels (and any descriptive variations) usually aim to continue controlling behaviours by one controlling (or otherwise abusive) parent.The2018 guidelinespublished by the European Association for Psychotherapy clarify how unscientific “parental alienation” conceptions may facilitate further victimisation, pathologisation, or even violence towards vulnerable people. We can only hope that more family courts will act to improve the protection of the most vulnerable parties, and particularly the children, trapped in such custody cases.Tom WarneckeGeneral secretary, European Association for PsychotherapyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It took another “late, great”, Anthony Minghella, to cast him as the romantic lead in Truly, Madly, Deeply for Alan’s screen career to take wing.Kevin WhatelyAspley Heath, BuckinghamshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The Home Office claims the reforms are the biggest in two centuries.But one serving chief told the Guardian: “It’s a power grab by national politicians for influence in policing.”Among the changes are targets for forces on how quickly they respond to emergency calls, the satisfaction of crime victims with the service they receive, and public trust and confidence in their local force.A source said the results would be published on a dashboard, so people could compare their area to others.Nationally set targets were introduced under the Blair government, but fell out of favour and were abolished in 2011 when the Conservative-led coalition was in power.The reforms generally have broad support from police chiefs, but some of the measures are more controversial.One said national targets, with forces potentially ranked in league tables, could lead to perverse incentives. “People worry about their position in league tables as opposed to the quality of service,” they said. “What gets measured gets done, and what does not get measured does not get done.”Another chief in a different part ofEnglandsaid: “You can hit the target and miss the point.”As part of boosting crime fighting, the home secretary will take powers to intervene directly in forces by sending in special teams. TheHome Officegave the example of a force where crime clear-up rates are low having teams sent in from another force where they are higher.The home secretary will also take powers to oust chief constables deemed to be failing.Since 2011, policing powers have been devolved locally, with elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs) in charge of priorities and budgets, chief constables given operational control, and central government having limited powers. PCCs will be abolished by 2028.View image in fullscreenHome secretary Shabana Mahmood has described her approach in private to police reform as ‘we go large, or we go home’.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe philosophy of Labour’s reforms is that it is right that the centrally elected government holds policing accountable, and current localised systems have been ineffective at doing so.Mahmood said: “It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces.“I will make police forces accountable to parliament – driving up standards so they fight more crime in their communities.”The white paper containing the reforms, being officially trailed ahead of its unveiling to parliament on Monday, is called: “From local to national: a new model for policing.”Sources said it will cost £500m over three years, and police chiefs who support it believe the upfront expense will be recouped through savings.The Guardian reported last April that police chiefs had asked government for a new national centre for policingto include counter-terrorismand the fight against serious and organised crime. In July,they asked for fewer forces.Mahmood has privately described her approach to police reform as: “We go large, or we go home.”She is expected to back a “significant” cut in the 43 forces currently carrying out local policing in England andWales, but not announce a number the government backs. A commission will instead review the issue and suggest which forces should merge, with chiefs supporting a number between 12 and 15.One chief welcomed government pledges to protect and enhance neighbourhood policing in the reforms, but warned recent results showed problems in bigger forces, with smaller ones clearing up more crime. “Big forces don’t necessarily improve performance,” they said.Implementation of force mergers and abolitions could be years away, and one chief said: “It feels like it is being kicked into the long grass.”Mergers are at risk from many factors, including local sensibilities and cultures.The PCC for Devon and Cornwall released a survey showing 66% want the force to stay as it is, with only 18% preferring a bigger regional force and just 1.5% wanting Cornwall to get its own police officers.One source suggested a reason some people in Cornwall might want little to do with their neighbours in Devon: “They think they are too English.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeEnglandWalesPolice and crime commissionersHome OfficeShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

This, it appears, enabled him to gather information about the campaigners to pass on to police.He helped supervise the acquisition and distribution of equipment, such as rope and harnesses.The radio engineer also helped to set up a network of CB radios so that activists camped at different points along the planned route could warn each other about likely moves by the police. He was nicknamed “Radio Nick”.Policehave previously disclosedthat, in an apparently unprecedented move, they paid a private security firm to infiltrate the Newbury campaigners. They believed that this was necessary as the cost of policing the protest was escalating.It is understood that in turn the private security firm hired Gratwick to spy on the protesters. Thames Valley police, which policed the protests, declined to comment.Gratwick also infiltrated animal rights groups, including thecampaign to shut a laboratory run by a commercial firm, Huntingdon Life Sciences.After he was arrested last March on suspicion of the paedophile charges, Gratwick, whose full name is Edward Nicholas Gratwick, had hinted at his previous covert role during interviews with the NationalCrimeAgency.His work as an informer was subsequently confirmed at his six-week trial at Guildford crown court inSurrey.Court papers disclosed that “records show that during the eight-year period between 1995 and 2003, [Gratwick] provided information to police for a total period of approximately six years. He provided information on animal rights and environmental matters.”Kathryn Hirst, defending Gratwick, said that in the past he had “proved very useful to investigating authorities”, without specifying how.He had been arrested at Stansted airport as he was about to fly to Bucharest to rape the 10-year-old girl.The jury dismissed his claim that he had created a false identity to ingratiate himself with paedophiles, with the aim of gathering information to help convict them. The judge said the jury had seen through his claim and “unmasked” him.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

Palestinian residents there will have access to basic services like education, healthcare and running water, as long as they submit to biometric data collection and security vetting, according to planning documents and people familiar with the latest round of talks at the US-led Civil Military Coordination Center inIsrael.The planned city would mark the UAE’s first investment in a postwar reconstruction project located in the part of Gaza currently held by Israel. The wealthy Gulf state has contributed more than $1.8bn of humanitarian assistance to Gaza since 7 October 2023, according to UAEstate media, making it Gaza’s largest humanitarian donor.Blueprints for the Emirati-backed endeavor are laid out in anunclassified slide deckobtained by the Guardian and firstreportedby Dropsite, but the UAE’s role as its planned financier has not previously been reported. The presentation was prepared for a cohort of European donors who visited the CMCC on 14 January, according to an aid official who shared details about the briefing on the condition ofanonymity.Israeli military planners have given the plans their stamp of approval.Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and Josh Gruenbaum, all members or advisers to the US-led Board of Peace, arrived on Friday in Abu Dhabi to broker peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. The Gulf ally agreed to host the landmark trilateral meeting after pledging its support for several US-led efforts, including the Board of Peace.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff speaks alongside Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe group is newly mandated to oversee reconstruction efforts inGaza, following Donald Trump’s endorsement of its founding charter on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.TheUnited Arab Emiratesdid not comment on its decision to endorse the Board of Peace, or its plans to fund one of the first US- and Israeli-backed reconstruction projects in Gaza.One US official said that the first Emirati-backed compound could “become a model” for a string of residential camps that US and Israeli officials have described as “alternative safe communities”.Within the first Rafah community, billed as a “case study”, planners envision several efforts to preventthe influence of Hamas, including the introduction of electronic shekel wallets “to mitigate the diversion of goods and funds to the Hamas financial channels”, and a school curriculum that will “not be Hamas-based”, but supplied by the UAE. Planners also specify that residents will be permitted to “enter and exit the neighborhood freely, subject to security checks to prevent the introduction of weapons and hostile elements”.View image in fullscreenA slide about the plan for Gaza’s new economy.Photograph: Obtained by the GuardianPlans do not indicate who will conduct security checks at the entry and exit points of the planned community.Any new residential compounds will be built atop of the rubble left from Israel’s two-year war on Gaza – an assault that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians and leveled three-quarters of the structures in Gaza amid Israel’s efforts to rout out Hamas militants after their deadly 7 October attack.Rebuilding Gaza will cost at least $70bn,according to the United Nations, which estimates that at least three-quarters of Gaza’s roads, water pipes and buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment.UN expertsestimatethat rebuilding efforts could take up to 80 years, given the level of destruction. Clearing debris, disarming unexploded ordnance and retrieving bodies trapped under the rubble could all complicate the process.‘New Rafah’Under the terms of Trump’s brokered peace agreement, Gaza is now divided into two halves: a “green zone”, controlled by the Israeli military; and a “red zone”, in effect governed by Hamas. Initialreconstruction efforts are only slated for the Israeli-held half of Gaza.Kushner dispensed with the artificial red zone and green zone divisions during a presentation at Davos on Thursday, where heunveiledBoard of Peace ambitions to redevelop Gaza’s entire Mediterranean coast. On a slide titled “master plan”, Kushner’s group re-envisioned a map of Gaza featuring eight “residential areas” spanning Gaza, including two development blocks called Rafah 1 and Rafah 2.The first city, called “New Rafah” in the Board of Peace slide deck, would be built during an early phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan. The Board of Peace plans promise 100,000 permanent housing units, 200 education centers and 75 medical facilities in the new city.View image in fullscreenA slide about the proposed plan for Gaza.Photograph: Obtained by The GuardianA White House spokesperson said that the Emirati-backed compound would be built during the board’s initial reconstruction push.Land-clearing efforts for the Rafah site are already under way, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told the Guardian.“Israel’s mission on the east side of the yellow line is to clear the infrastructure in that territory, including tunnels, booby-trapped houses – all of the infrastructure left on our side,” the IDF spokesperson said.They also said that Israel would not participate in building or running the Emirati compound. “When construction begins, that’s when the ISF participates with boots on the ground.”The ISF, or International Stabilization Force, is a concept introduced by the Trump-brokered peace agreement. It envisions countries pledging troops to serve as a neutral security body responsible for overseeing public security in Gaza. Countries have yet to pledge forces.A project timeline obtained by the Guardian indicates that site planning began with a “land deed” review in late October and will entail at least four to six months of preparations before construction begins.A deed review was a top priority for planners, according to two people briefed on the process. If Palestinian landowners can prove deeded claims to the site, Gulf funders and other groups linked to “Gaza’s first planned community” could be accused of forcible displacement of a civilian population, which is a war crime.Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, expressed skepticism that the Emirati-backed compound would ever be built, but said that, either way, the plans serve Israel’s political goals.View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy speaks during a UN security council meeting in New York on 25 February 2025.Photograph: Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images“Without one brick being laid, it gives a further layer of permission to Israel clearing the area, and displacing or killing Palestinians in the process,” Levy said.The Emirates’ participation allows Israel to insist that construction is proceeding with the support of an Arab state, Levy added.“It distracts from the fact that Israel occupies 58% of Gaza because this portion of Gaza they will attempt to label as ‘happy Gaza’, with schools and a judiciary and hospitals,” Levy said.It’s not clear exactly how reconstruction efforts will proceed. United Nations programs that once serviced 80% of Gaza’s schools have been largely dismantled, following Israel’s allegations that UN staff participated in 7 October. And Israel hasbarred several longstanding aid groupsfrom Gaza, including those that oncestaffed and supplied its hospitalsor funded community water projects.Private contractors have been courting White House officials in hopes of securing lucrative reconstruction bids since October, when Trump brokered the peace agreement. One group, led by a Republican insider, has claimed to have an “inside track” to reconstruction work, the Guardianreportedin December.Muhammad Shehada, a visiting Middle East fellow for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that reconstruction planners at the CMCC seem to be operating under the assumption that Palestinians will leave the Hamas-controlled red zone and move into newly constructed communities “if you dump enough food there”.He said that those tactics may not work and overlooked the politics of the area, which he said “did not interest” military planners.View image in fullscreenBuildings lie in ruins amid the rubble in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on 8 December 2025.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersTo move into the Emirati compound, Palestinians living in the “red zone” will have to cross an Israeli checkpoint into the “green zone”. Next, they will be subjected to “security vetting” and “biometric documentation”. The plans do not specify who would complete the vetting or manage biometric data collection, nor do they articulate why someone would be turned away.Palestinians approved for entry will use their Palestinian ID numbers, as issued by the Palestinian Authority in coordination with Israel’s COGAT, the Israeli agency charged with administration of Gaza, to join the community registry, planning documents say.Matt Mahmoudi, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge and researcher and adviser on AI and human rights at Amnesty International, reviewed planning documents for “Gaza’s first planned community” and raised concerns the plan would “expand biometric surveillance in Gaza”.“Israel’s deployment of biometric surveillance reinforces apartheid and the oppression of Palestinians by perpetuating a coercive environment intended to force Palestinians out of areas of strategic interest to Israeli authorities,” Mahmoudi said.Should Palestinians voluntarily subject themselves to the surveillance and biometric measures proposed for “Gaza’s first planned community”, Levy and others suggested that Israel would be happy to see this first “case study” succeed.“As far as Israel is concerned, if Gaza ends up with four or so model Palestinian communities of say 25,000 each, all of them vetted, and everything else is a hellscape where you’re further encouraging the ethnic cleansing, or the physical removal of Palestinians from there, that’s a desirable outcome.”Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???”The winter storm will surgefrom the Rockies across the midwest and southern US on Friday, ending up on the east coast over the weekend. At least 230 million people are expected to be affected in some way by the storm with roads set to become dangerously icy and power blackouts expected in multiple locations.This storm is being caused by a mass of frigid air from the Arctic hitting warmer, moister air in the US. Colder Arctic air is usually confined to the far northern latitudes by the polar vortex, a vast circular ribbon of wind. When the polar vortex weakens or stretches out, the freezing Arctic air can spill out south into the US, a bit like when you open the front door on a very cold day. This is what is happening now.Researchpublished last yearfound that the stretching of the polar vortex in this way is contributing to extreme weather in the US and that global heating, counterintuitively, could be playing a role in accelerating this process.The Arctic is heating up as muchas four times as quicklyas the rest of the planet, with these elevated temperatures causing a series of knock-on impacts that may be altering the polar vortex. For example, the loss of sea ice in the Arctic region is amplifying the heating that can lead to these polar vortex disruptions.Also, scientists point out that a single winter storm in one region of one country tells us very little about longer-term, global climate trends. Not only is the worldundeniablyheating up, in countries like the US wintersare warming at a faster ratethan other seasons, causing the loss of glaciers and the shifting of seasonal norms.Even amid the current winter storm, parts of the western US have been affected by asevere lack of snow, which has hamstrung many ski resorts. Longer term, the trend is clear – winter cold snaps have got shorter, by six days on average, across much of the US since 1970,accordingto Climate Central, a research non-profit.Cold days are still occurring but are being significantly outnumbered by record hot days. Across the US, since 1970 there has been an average temperature rise of at least 2.5C (4.6F) in the coldest temperatures people experience each year.Explore more on these topicsUS newsClimate crisisDonald TrumpExtreme weatherexplainersShareReuse this content"

Over the past week, Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, has announced a number of measures to hold companies accountable over what scientists say was an“extinction-level disturbance”for the world’s rarest ape.“This is the news we have been waiting for, and the deep breath the Batang Toru ecosystem desperately needed,” said Amanda Hurowitz, the forest commodities lead at conservation nonprofit Mighty Earth, which has long been fighting threats to the Tapanuli.View image in fullscreenA search and rescue worker among the destruction and debris left by November’s flash floods in Batang Toru district, North Sumatra.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, the Indonesian government said it wouldrevoke the permits of 28 companies, halting their operations in the area. This includes the permits for mining company PT Agincourt Resources, behind theMartabe goldmine, as well as the permit for PT North Sumatera Hydro Energy, the developer of a large hydropower project being built along the Batang Toru River. The other permits were largely focused on timber harvesting and oil palm plantations.The decision follows the results of an investigation by the country’s Forest Area Regulation Task Force.Earlier this week, the country’senvironment ministry also sued six companies– identified only by their initials – for 4.8tn rupiah (£211m) over alleged links to the environmental damages in the Batang Toru ecosystem.It’s the world’s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its futureRead moreThe ministry said the six companies were responsible for unspecified damages spanning 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) in the region’s watersheds.PT Agincourt Resources said it had only learned about the revocation of its permit from media reports. “We are following up with the regulators,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian.“The company respects every government decision and maintains its rights in accordance with applicable regulations.” Operations at the mine have been paused since 6 December.Scientists and environmental advocates have long urged the government to strengthen protections for the Batang Toru region, considering that the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutan can be found only in this patch of forest.Preliminary findings after the Sumatra floods suggest that between 6.2% and 10.5% of the Tapanuli orangutan population – which numbered about 800 – probably perished in just a few days.View image in fullscreenThe Martabe mine, operated by PT Agincourt Resources, in Batang Toru, North Sumatra province, Indonesia.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBiological anthropologist Erik Meijaard said a team would soon visit the area to fully assess effects on the orangutans in the area. But he noted that most of the landslides that had occurred in the western portion of the ecosystem, known as West Block, had little to do with the six companies that were being sued.“As far as we can see, these were primarily caused by extreme rainfall that affected forests on steep slopes in the interior of the West Block.“Of course, the hydro dam and goldmine have impacted Tapanuli orangutan habitat, but the relationship with the landslides is tentative,” he added.Still, environmental campaigners took the government’s actions as a win for the Tapanuli.“The Indonesian government must now act to permanently end any further deforestation,” Hurowitz said. “And to begin work, as it has indicated, to restore the damage that has been done, prevent any further loss of human life and offer a future for the Tapanuli orangutan.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe age of extinctionFloodingEndangered speciesAnimalsWildlifeMiningConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

It includes high-paid jobs producing electric vehicles and batteries, retrofitting buildings and work on wind turbines and solar energy.Lady Elliott, the former Labour MP for Sunderland Central who now chairs the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, said it was vital for Reeves to build the clean energy strategy around the north of England.View image in fullscreenThe Nissan production plant in Sunderland which produces electric vehicles.Photograph: Ian Forsyth/AFP/GettyShe said: “If making the north a leader in energy transition isn’t front and centre in growth strategy, how can we expect the national wealth fund or GB Energy to deploy more of their investment up north if the Treasury hasn’t clearly instructed them to do so – as the evidence proves they should.”Experts said the transition to net zero presented both an opportunity and a risk for the north of England. With Treasury backing, it would support reindustrialisation, raise productivity and anchor long-term investment in regions that have struggled to recover from the loss of heavy industry. However, if net zero jobs are prioritised elsewhere it would “reinforce current disparities” and leave cities and towns like Sunderland and Warrington behind.Last week, northern leaderswelcomedthe government’s long-promised commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail, an improved east-west link to replace the region’s creaking Victorian railways. But many commuters will not see these revamps until the early 2030s, leading many to urge the Treasury to commit to clean energy in the north to deliver an earlier economic boost.Michael Mordey, the Labour leader of Sunderland city council, said he feared Reform UK would “introduce Trump-like climate change denial policies” that would harm the economy if the party was elected.He said: “We will only continue to attract more of these well-paid jobs for local people in our city if we keep a Labour council in Sunderland in May.”Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsNorth of EnglandSunderlandRachel ReevesLabournewsShareReuse this content"

They are called “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down and accumulate in the environment, and they are linked to serious health problems such as cancer, kidney disease, liver problems, immune disorders and birth defects.Republicans aim to exempt major polluters from Pfas cleanup costsRead moreCurrent filtration technology like granular activated carbon, reverse osmosis or ion exchange absorbs Pfas in water, and the chemicals caught in the filter must be stored in hazardous waste facilities, or destroyed. Destruction of the chemicals typically involves a thermal process that subjects them to high heat, but that leaves toxic byproducts, or essentially breaks larger Pfas into smaller Pfas. There is no technology that fully destroys Pfas on an industrial scale.Wong said Rice’s non-thermal process works by soaking up and concentrating Pfas at high levels, which makes it possible to destroy them without high temperatures.The LDH material Rice developed is a variation of similar materials previously used, but researchers replaced some aluminum atoms with copper atoms. The LDH material is positively charged and the long-chain Pfas are negatively charged, which causes the material to attract and absorb the chemicals, Wong said.“There you go – it just soaks it in to the order of 100 times faster than other materials that are out there,” Wong added.Pfas are virtually indestructible because their carbon atoms are bonded with fluoride, but Rice found that the bonds could be broken if the chemicals in the material were heated to 400-500C – a relatively low temperature. The fluoride gets trapped in the LDH material and is bonded to calcium. The leftover calcium-fluoride material is safe and can be disposed of in a landfill, Wong said.The process works with some long-chain Pfas that are among the most common water pollutants, and it also absorbed some smaller Pfas that are commonplace. Wong said he is confident the material can be used to absorb a broad array of Pfas, especially if they are negatively charged.Most new Pfas elimination systems fail to work at an industrial scale. Wong said the new material has an advantage because its absorption rate is so strong, it can be used repeatedly and it is in a “drop in material”, meaning it can be used with existing filtration infrastructure. That eliminates one of the major cost barriers.Laura Orlando, a Pfas researcher with the Just Zero non-profit and a civil engineer who works on waste-management design, said she was always skeptical of claims around total destruction of Pfas, and new filtration technologies, because the processes are so complex in real-world conditions. Other challenges such as occupational safety, or regulations and permitting, would have to be considered.“We’re going to need as many technologies as we can possibly find to deal with Pfas in drinking water, and if this works to scale on wastewater, then it would be really something to pay attention to,” Orlando said.Explore more on these topicsPfasPollutionWaterResearch and developmentChemistryResearchnewsShareReuse this content"

Other arrests took place of a man, 30, in Birmingham and a woman, 40, in north London, both of whom have been released on bail.The seventh arrest on Friday was of a 25-year-old man who was arrested in Warwickshire and remains in custody in a London police station.Counter-terrorism detectives say they also carried out a series of searches, with four in Birmingham, one in Coventry, one in Warwickshire and two at sites in London.Police said the investigation continues and added: “Detectives are keeping an open mind as to any potential motivation behind the incidents. Officers are also keeping an open mind as to whether any of the incidents are potentially linked, and this remains an active line of inquiry being considered.”Akbar, 48, told the Guardian he was in hiding after the attacks: “They are trying to scare and intimidate me, and I am pretty scared. I fear for my life and for my family’s lives.”The human rights barrister added: “I am a Pakistani dissident living in exile here. I am an open critic of the Pakistani regime, which is backed by the military.“I cannot say who did it. However, one thing is certain: it was a targeted attack and the people who attacked were probably hired by someone.”Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismPakistanImran KhannewsShareReuse this content"

It prohibits the presence and gathering of self-proclaimed members of the groups in the districts of Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Montreuil-sur-Mer and Lille.The French prefecture statement added that the aim of the ban was to preserve public order in the area. “State services, particularly internal security forces, will be fully mobilised to ensure the proper implementation of this decree, with the aim of protecting migrants, who are often victims of exploitation by smuggling networks, and guaranteeing the safety of everyone on the coast,” it said.“British nationals belonging to these groups, who are apprehended by law enforcement, will be returned to the border as quickly as possible.”View image in fullscreenRaise the Colours (flags in the Birmingham area, above) has been ‘involved in actions of intimidation against migrants and humanitarian organisations … on the coast of Nord and Pas-de-Calais’, the French prefecture said.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianOn Friday, Thomas posted on X: “Last night I gave an update on the gathering in Dover and on British and English lads travelling to France on the 24th of January.

The decision from France shows these people to be what we in Calais always knew them to be, far-right racist agitators who are intent on coming out to France to harass displaced people and threaten violence.“These are British citizens whose movement, groups and rhetoric have been normalised by the British government. They pose a threat to the stability of the UK and are promoting violence and hatred in the UK, too. The British government needs to take action against them and face up to the challenges of racism and hatred.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

The instant proceedings are also brought in breach of the covenant not to sue.”Dudfield says he is owed $17.5m (£13.1m).The dispute has shone a light on the largely hidden operations and vast sums of money that power one of the world’s most successful betting operations.Bloom is the majority shareholder and chair of the Premier League club Brighton and has made his fortune from gambling.Dudfield, a professional gambler who used to work for Bloom, introduced his former boss to Cottrell. He is pursuing a case against Bloom and his syndicate, claiming that he is owed potentially millions of pounds from an arrangement they reached in which bets were placed for Bloom through Cottrell’s accountsIn the 17-page response to Dudfield’s claims, Bloom says: “It was an express term of the agreement that Mr Cottrell would allow Mr Bloom to place bets on a certain gambling account in Mr Cottrell’s name, described by Mr Cottrell as a ‘hedging account’ which he held with [the gambling platform] Sportsbet.io.”The syndicate was entitled to a 60% share, and Dudfield and Cottrell 40% between them. Dudfield and Cottrell were entitled to 7% and 33% respectively, the document says.It alleges Bloom’s syndicatemade millions of dollars from betting using accounts in the name of Cottrell; $3.7m in net winnings from August to December 2022.In his claim filed last year, Dudfield alleges he thought the arrangement had ended at the end of 2022 because he believed Cottrell had ended his ties with Bloom’s syndicate.But Bloom’s defence says the syndicate continued to place bets through Cottrell up until October 2025, garnering another $2.4m in net winnings. It also claims Dudfield had no agreement for any fee or commission for business between him and Cottrell after 2022, and that if Dudfield is owed any money, it is for Cottrell to pay him.Another key point of contention between Dudfield and Bloom appears to be over whether or not the agreement with Dudfield, Cottrell and Bloom covered a wide range of Cottrell’s betting accounts.Just one account belonging to Cottrell was used before Dudfield “cashed out”, according to Bloom’s court document. Five others were used by Bloom only afterwards and he denies these include an alleged account at the online betting platform stake.com.The court document confirms that multiple apparent third parties were used by Bloom’s syndicate to place bets through “exotic accounts”. But there was no “standard practice” for how they operated and they were not referred to as “secret”, according to the defence.Bloom does not admit the syndicate is “secretive”, but confirms it keeps “information barriers” between departments and those who place bets at Starlizard Consulting, which operates the syndicate, according to the document. It is “generally successful” but that it generates £600m a year – a claim made by Dudfield – is an “exaggeration”, the defence says.Bloom’s defence does not address some of the allegations, including claims that footballers and businessmen were used as frontmen for the betting syndicate.Bloom’s defence notes that in 2018, after Dudfield left employment at Starlizard Consulting Limited but before the agreement involving Cottrell, he was given £405,000 to settle a debt, which was set against his share of future winnings from the syndicate, which amounted only to £102,000.Membership of the syndicate was a perk sometimes given to employees, though there are also non-employee members, according to the defence.Bloom agreed via Ian McAleavy, an employee at StarLizard, to enter into a new agreement with Dudfield in 2022, after he introduced him to Cottrell.High-profile, successful gamblers can find themselves effectively shut out of betting sites because of the scale and frequency of the bets they place. This means “whales” are often deployed to place bets on their behalf. As someone known for high-stakes betting, Cottrell has the profile of a “whale”.Still, Bloom did not require so-called “exotic accounts” that used other people’s identities, and much of his betting does not “involve the use of such accounts”, according to the court document.Lawyers acting for Cottrell said when approached last year about Dudfield’s legal action: “Our client is not a party to those proceedings but considers it would be inappropriate for him to comment on them in the media.”Dudfield and Bloom declined to comment on the ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionSport bettingGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as aresult of Storm Goretti.“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown thatCornwallisn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”Goretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines andcaused countless trees to fall, including one thatcrushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.For days, manyhundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Rona Cowls, Elaine Claxton and Mark Pugh, who felt forgotten after being left without broadband, a landline and mobile signal.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.Her sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”On the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.View image in fullscreenSam Kirby’s home in Porthoustock, Cornwall, was damaged by Storm Goretti earlier this month.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”Kirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry thatOpenreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.There is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a tree that knocked through someone’s roof in Goldsithney, Cornwall, during the storm.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.A new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”These are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it willexplore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.‘It has destroyed years of work’: Cornish beauty spot loses 80% of its trees to Storm GorettiRead moreThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognisedunder part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.But the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.Loveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political partyMebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”Jenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service,brought in strong winds and heavy rainon Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”View image in fullscreenThe remains of a fallen tree in Goldsithney which also blocked a road.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.A spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”The recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.Trees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”Moore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCornwallExtreme weatherBroadbandInternetUK weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The lawsuit seeks a court order requiring the exhibits to be restored while the case proceeds.The display stood at the President’s House site, once home to George Washington and John Adams, and includedinformationrecognizing people enslaved by Washington, along with a broader chronology of slavery in the US.“The interpretive displays relating to enslaved persons at President’s House are an integral part of the exhibit and removing them would be a material alteration to the exhibit,” city lawyers wrote in the legal filing. According to the suit, officials were not informed in advance that the exhibit would be changed.The Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro, sharply criticized the decision to take down the signs, arguing that Trump “will take any opportunity to rewrite and whitewash our history”.“But he picked the wrong city – and he sure as hell picked the wrong Commonwealth,” Shapiro added in a messageposted on X. “We learn from our history in Pennsylvania, even when it’s painful.”View image in fullscreenAn informational panel is seen at President’s House site on 19 August 2025, in Philadelphia.Photograph: Matt Rourke/APKenyatta Johnson, the Philadelphia city council president, saidin a statementon Thursday: “Removing the exhibits is an effort to whitewash American history. History cannot be erased simply because it is uncomfortable. Removing items from the President’s House merely changes the landscape, not the historical record.”Congress had encouraged the National Park Service in 2003 to formally acknowledge the enslaved people who lived and worked at the President’s House. The lawsuit states that in 2006, the city and the agency agreed to collaborate on creating an exhibit for the site, which opened in 2010 with a memorial and informational panels focused on slavery.The removal of the exhibit is part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to eliminate cultural content that does not align with his policy agenda.In anexecutive orderissued last March, Trump accused the Biden administration of promoting “improper, divisive, or anti-American ideology” and instructed the interior secretary to alter materials under the department’s control that “have been improperly removed or changed in the last five years to perpetuate a false revision of history or improperly minimize or disparage certain historical figures or events”.Changes have already been made to Smithsonian Institutiondisplays mentioningTrump since his return to office.

I have never abused, coerced or disrespected any woman.

At the same time the shooting saw a wave of public anger at the practices of the for-profit US healthcare industry, and since his arrest Mangione has attracted a cult following of supporters.Luigi Mangione lawyers fight death penalty, saying Pam Bondi is biasedRead moreMangione entered the courtroom at 11.05am in khaki jail garb. He had scruffy facial hair. When Mangione walked into court, some of the approximately two dozen supporters in attendance craned their necks to get a better look.Many of his supporters in attendance sported green, a nod to the Nintendo character with whom Mangione shares a first name. The hues ranged from olive to hunter to emerald to pine. One woman wore a pink flower crown and a coordinating furry coat.After jury selection, the next major trial date hinges on whether Garnett decides Mangione will face the death penalty.Donald Trump’s attorney general, Pam Bondi, is pushing for the death penalty. Lawyers for Mangione, who has pleaded not guilty, are fighting to take that off the table.If Mangione does not face the death penalty at trial, openings would kick off on 13 October. If Mangione does face a capital trial, openings would be expected on 11 January 2027.Following Garnett’s scheduling announcement, Nathan Snyder, the deputy police chief of Altoona, Pennsylvania, was called to testify about search procedures during Mangione’s arrest in the town.Garnett decided to hear testimony about search procedures following a 9 January conference, citing “the seriousness of the charges the defendant is facing”.Altoona police encountered Mangione at a McDonald’s on 9 December 2024. Police cuffed Mangione after he provided a false ID, and an officer started searching his backpack. The officer encountered a firearm, loaded gun magazine and notebook.Mangione’s team contends that his backpack was illegally searched upon arrest. They contend that police were wrong to go through his bag without a warrant and are asking for that evidence to be barred from his trial.Garnett is expected to rule on the evidence issue at a later date.Explore more on these topicsBrian Thompson shootingNew YorkUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.Much of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked byDonald Trump’s on-off tariff threatsover the future of Greenland.But many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.Georgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.Lagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.But Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Work & careersComputingEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Among them was the head of America’s largest bank: Jamie Dimon, the chair and chief executive of JP Morgan.Dimon’s name alone was a boon to Trump’s nascent political credibility. Easily the biggest name on Wall Street, Dimon – now 69 andpaid $43m last year– was feted for steering JP Morgan through the 2008 banking crisis and on to enviable financial success.Rumours were also swirling that the executive would be tapped to serve in Trump’s administration. And while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, reportedly turned down an offer to lead the US Treasury department, the pair continued to be on surprisingly good terms. “I’d try to help any president of the US because I’m a patriot,”Dimon told shareholders. Even Vanity Fair commented onDimon’s “unbridled optimism”despite the new president’s growing list of gaffes.A decade on, the pair’s relationship has hit rock bottom.View image in fullscreenThe JP Morgan Chase building in New York.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPATrump on Thursday took aim at his one-time ally, launching a$5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit against JP Morgan and Dimonover claims the bank had unfairly closed his accounts for political reasons after the 6 January Capitol riots in 2021. JP Morgan said that while it closed accounts that created legal or regulatory risk for the bank, the lawsuit itself “has no merit”.While this may not be the absolute end of the relationship between the billionaires, there were signs their once-affable relationship could become rocky even from the start of Trump’s first term.Back in 2017, months after Trump’s first inauguration, Dimon said he had disagreed with, but tolerated, Trump’s controversial decision topull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. But he drew a line after Trumpfailed to denounce white supremacistswho took part in a violent and fatal rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the summer of 2017.Theeconomic advisory council, which counted General Motors, Walmart, and Disney bosses among its top brass, quickly disbanded in response. “It is a leader’s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,” Dimon said.View image in fullscreenDimon at the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersPersonal tensions between the pair also escalated. Dimon, addressing speculation over his own presidential ambitions,told a panel in New Yorkin late 2018: “I think I could beat Trump … because I’m as tough as he is, I’m smarter than he is.” He added: “And by the way, this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money. It wasn’t a gift from daddy.”Regret for his comments did not appease Trump, who responded online that Dimon did not have the “aptitude or ‘smartness’ & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess”.Still, the two had common ground. Despite their personal friction, Dimon made positive sounds about Trump’s tax cuts and nascent China trade deal, just months before the ground was laid for this week’s big lawsuit. But the shocking Capitol riots prompted swift condemnation from bosses including Dimon – and, Trump claims, resulted in the unfairclosure of his JP Morgan bank accounts. The row is reminiscent of thedisputebetween Nigel Farage and NatWest in the UK, which ultimately led to thedeparture of the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose.Those simmering tensions boiled over into Trump’s second presidential run. “Highly overrated Globalist Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMORGAN, is quietly pushing another non-Maga person, Nikki Haley, for President,” Trump said in aposton Truth Social in late November 2023. “I’ve never been a big Jamie Dimon fan … I guess I don’t have to live with him any more, and that’s a really good thing.”View image in fullscreenDimon has warned about the risks of Trump’s continued undermining of Federal Reserve independence and of its chair, Jerome Powell.Photograph: Richard Drew/APBut until this month, the war of words between Trump and Dimon seemed to be on pause. Despite market turmoil triggered by Trump’s unpredictable trade and tariff policies, banks such asJP Morganhave been largely appeased. The president’s bonfire of regulation was widely welcomed, as was capitulation to Wall Street’s longstanding campaign for looser capital rules.However, Trump’s sustained attacks on the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell – which have culminated in a highly controversial Department of Justicecriminal investigation– proved a step too far.Dimon publiclybacked Powellearlier this month, telling reporters that the widely condemned investigation was putting the central bank’s independence at risk. “And anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view, will have the reverse consequences. It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase [interest] rates over time,” he said.Policies that threaten JP Morgan’s profit margins, such as Trump’s plans for a10% capon US credit card interest rates, have also drawn Dimon’s ire.But Trump has continued to throw blows: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing,” Trump said. He called Powell “a bad Fed person” who had “done a bad job” and again called for lower rates.“Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates. Maybe he makes more money that way,” Trump said.At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimonwarned that AI could cause civil unrestand was critical of Trump’s interest rates cap proposal, calling the idea a potential “economic disaster”.He alsosuggestedthat the US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me: ‘Has America become unreliable?’ No,” Dimon said at an event. “It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.” A day later, Trump launched his lawsuit.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJamie DimonTrump administrationTrump tariffsJP MorganBankingTariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Consistent wage growth tends to push up inflation if there is not a corresponding rise in productivity growth, and Greene said she was “certainly sceptical” that productivity would rebound this year.Greene said the MPC’s decision on when next to lower borrowing costs would also be affected by whether the US Federal Reserve lowered rates, as this could cause inflation in the UK to rise.“If the Fed were to cut rates more aggressively than the Bank this year, this should cause US demand for UK exports to rebound, providing upward pressure on UK inflation,” she said.Greene’s warning comes as a separate report from the Bank concluded that it had consistently underestimated the full effects of inflation that came after the energy price shock of 2022 due to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.“After 2022, the Bank’s medium-term inflation and wage growth forecasts proved repeatedly too low,” the central bank said in its first ever forecast evaluation report.The report found that the Bank’s models had not anticipated the extent to which higher inflation in 2022 then led to households and businesses having higher inflation expectations, leading them to push for higher wages, which in turn added to further inflation pressure.The Bank said it would try to improve its “modelling and understanding of key economic mechanisms, including the labour market, wage-price interactions and inflation expectations” to better understand the recent “inflation persistence”.A separate, closely watched survey of activity among UK businesses showed that companies were reporting a sharp rise in costs in January, with the overall pace of inflation unchanged from December’s seven-month high.The purchasing managers’ index, from S&P Global, showed businesses in manufacturing and services sectors were “overwhelmingly” linking rising costs to “elevated wage pressures”, alongside rising transport bills and raw material prices from suppliers.These cost pressures had led firms to make the greatest increase to their own prices in more than a year, it said.The survey also showed a “steep loss” of jobs among many of its respondents, especially in the hospitality sector. Many companies attributed the job cuts to the government’s introduction of higher national insurance contributions and increases to the “national living wage”.The survey has led City economists to reduce their expectations of the MPC making two interest rate cuts this year, with the first quarter-rate cut now not expected until June. Thecurrent base rate is 3.75%, after four cuts by the MPC in 2025.However, the survey showed a reading of 53.9 in January, up from 51.4 in December at a 21-month high. A score over 50 indicates growth.Explore more on these topicsInterest ratesInflationEconomicsBank of EnglandMonetary policy committeeEconomic policyPaynewsShareReuse this content"

He was tasked with addressing problems such as the sewage scandal, frequent tap water outages and lack ofpreparedness for drought.He said it should be easier to get rid of failing water CEOs. David Hinton, the chief executive of South East Water, has beenunder pressure to resignafter tens of thousands of people in Kent and Sussex faced days, and in some cases weeks, without drinking water.The government responded to Cunliffe’s recommendationsin a white paperthis week, which adopts many of his suggestions including a supervisory model, more technical knowledge in a new super-regulator, and turnaround regimes to make water companies fix problems quickly. He was told not to consider nationalising the industry in his review.England and Wales are the only countries in the world with a privatised water system. This system has come under huge criticism as companies have paid billions in dividends while failing to invest in pipes and reservoirs, so many have called for nationalisation.But Cunliffe said: “You can’t fix these problems with one simple solution. If we nationalised the system tomorrow, we wouldn’t necessarily solve all the problems that we have to solve.”He said the report looked at systems around the world and that privatisation was not the problem. He said: “We didn’t think the problems the sector was facing could just be laid at the door of privatisation and profit. We pushed very hard for evidence that shows that other ownership structures are systemically better, and the results were mixed. We didn’t have results that conclusively showed any system was better than any other.”The current, privatised system “can work”, he insisted, adding: “I do think that’s possible and I do think that is going to require a lot of work and change.”Campaigners responded negatively to the white paper and said the problems would not be solved while the water companies were still run for profit. The CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: “None of these reforms will make a meaningful difference unless the failed privatised model is confronted head-on. Pollution for profit is the root cause of this crisis.”The water campaigner and former Undertones singer Feargal Sharkey said: “Ministers have failed to grasp the underlying issue, which is corporate greed. The only people who will be paying for this are customers and bill payers.”Cat Hobbs, the CEO of the campaign group We Own It, believes water companies should have anti-sewage groups and representatives of households on the board. She said: “Water is an essential natural monopoly and we have no choice about which company to use. With public ownership, we could have households and anti-sewage groups on the boards of water companies to make them truly accountable.”Hinton has faced calls to resign after being absent from the media and public spotlight during two major water outages caused by a shutdown of a water treatment centre and burst pipes. He has a base salary of £400,000 and received a bonus of £115,000 last year.Cunliffe told the Guardian he had proposed measures that would make “senior managers personally accountable”. He said: “In the financial sector it can lead to managers resigning but we have to see how far Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] are going to go. Something that holds them accountable in that way will make a big difference.”He said the situation in Kent and Sussex was “clearly unacceptable”.The white paper was criticised as it contains measures that could let water companies off fines. The idea behind this is that failing companies cannot improve their performance if they are spending millions on fines rather than investing it in their infrastructure. Thames Water, for example, is on the hook for more than £120m of fines for sewage dumping and other failures.Cunliffe defended this, saying: “You have to make sure that [letting companies off fines] isn’t an easy option – there need to be sanctions for poor performance. But if your answer to poor performance is to take money out of the company which they cannot invest, or leave with a shadow hanging over it for five years, it is not going to help customers to get things fixed.”He added: “If you just punish them you end up with a dead water company, which is in no one’s interest.”Explore more on these topicsWaterWater industryUtilitiesPrivatisationEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The UK had been facing its first nomination-less year inthe acting categories since 1986.But the Sinners star was joined by a fellow cast member, Lewisham-born,Delroy Lindo, who will also be representing Britain on the big night on 15 March.The actor, who was born in south London in 1952, wasa surprise pickin the best supporting actor category, edging out supposed sure thing Paul Mescal and helping to take Sinners toa record 16-nod haul.View image in fullscreenSouth London star … Delroy Lindo at the annual Movies for Grownups awards in Beverly Hills this month.Photograph: Maarten De Boer/Getty Images for AARPLindo was reportedly as taken aback as the rest of the industry. In bed in Los Angeles on Thursday morning, he was rung by his son and told the news. “Really? Are you for real?” he asked, before looking at his phone and finding 179 messages confirming it.In Ryan Coogler’s box office hit, Lindo plays Delta Slim, a blues man who ends up barricaded in a Mississippi juke joint fighting back vampires while dealing with the looming spectre of Jim Crow racism. For many, it represented the perfect role for an African American cultural grandee, but the reality is more nuanced: Lindo is a child ofthe Black Atlantic.Unlike Mosaku who can stillquote a Greggs menu and has a strong Mancunian twang, Lindo has no hint of a London accent after leaving the capital for the US as a teenager.His first film role was as an army sergeant in the follow up to American Graffiti, 1979’s unimaginatively named and critically panned,More American Graffiti, shot while he was still in acting school.But it was his first ever acting role as one of the three kings in a primary school nativity play in south London that gave him the acting bug. A teacher praised Lindo, who was the only black child in his school, telling others in the cast “to do it like Delroy does it”.That is one of the few positive memories Lindo has of a country that, when he left, was getting to grips with rising support for far-right groups including the National Front and overtly racist political posturing from Enoch Powell, whose 1968 Rivers of Blood speech wasdirected at families like the Lindos.He recalled when he heard about the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, “it did not surprise me,” he said. “Given incidents that happened to me there.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lindo often describes his own relationship to the UK as “complicated”. His Jamaican parents emigrated as part of the Windrush generation but it was only after he left Britain as a teenager that he learned about Black British history via books such as Peter Fryer’s landmark historyStaying Powerand the work of academics, includingStuart HallandPaul Gilroy.He was disturbed by theWindrush scandal, calling it “disgusting and enraging”, adding that “British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism”. Speaking to the Guardian in 2020, Lindo said that he became conscious of the fact many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. “I’m curious to unpack those stories,” he said. “I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.”His research had a purpose: he’s also crafted a screenplay based on his mother’s time in England, although he doesn’t have a rose-tinted memory of his time in the UK. “Everything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England,” he said. “I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.”View image in fullscreen‘From memorable face to belated leading man’ … Lindo opposite Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyA look at his CV and it’s fair to say he has a point. Lindo’s filmography is peppered with the kind of roles black British actors plying their trade in the UK could only dream of in the 1980s and 1990s.An accomplished stage actor, Lindo made his Broadway debut alongside Danny Glover in apartheid-era dramaMaster Harold … and the Boys. He got the chance because James Earl Jones, for whom he was understudying, had to go to Hollywood to finish some voice work for Star Wars.Lindo managed to marry a stage career with mainstream successes, such as roles in the Elmore Leonard adaptationGet Shortyand the action movieGone in 60 Seconds, where he starred alongside Nicolas Cage and Vinnie Jones.But it’s his relationship withSpike Leethat he is best known for. He has been described as Lee’s “secret weapon” and the relationship with the director has “levelled him up from memorable face to belated leading man,” in the opinion of one critic, who argued he creates “characters no one else in the Lee orbit would have been right to play”.He was a strong contender for an Oscar nod in 2020, for his performance in Lee’sDa 5 Bloods, where he played an African American Vietnam veteran who returns to the country to lay old ghosts to rest. But he was ultimatelyfrozen out(the Sinners recognition is his first Oscar nomination).View image in fullscreenCritically lauded … Lindo with Alfre Woodard, centre, in 1994’s Crooklyn.Photograph: David Lee/Rex/ShutterstockThat was his fourth collaboration with Lee, and the relationship has arguably produced his best – or certainly most critically lauded – work. Da 5 Bloods followed the trio of films he made in the 90s. He played a menacing criminal mentor inMalcolm X, then followed that with a performance as a struggling father in Crooklyn, before playing another bellicose drug boss in Lee’s haunting adaptation of Richard Price’s Clockers.When the Guardian interviewed Lindo in 2000 to mark the release of Gone in 60 Seconds, Lindo was asked what irked him most about Hollywood. “I wish there were more adherence paid to the body of one’s work,” he said. “I always feel that people only remember the last thing that I did, and that’s unfortunate.”Perhaps on Sunday 15 March when Hollywood pays homage to its stars, Lindo will hope the voters do focus on the last thing he did and take the chance to give an Oscar to one of the industry’s most consistent talents.Explore more on these topicsFilmDelroy LindoSinnersOscarsBritish identity and societyWindrush scandalCommonwealth immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Like an off-brand ripoff from the 90s (anyone rememberRicky’s Room?), he’s another friendly, furry friend to wide-eyed young children, the main star of a TV show we’re thrown straight into, neatly styled to feel like we’re suddenly transported back to that era (similar to 2024’s far darker and far superior Sundance throwbackI Saw the TV Glow).Carousel review – Chris Pine and Jenny Slate are lost in static romance dramaRead moreThe formula is familiar – lessons, singing, syllables overpronounced – but there’s somethingoff. The persistence of Buddy, an orange unicorn with undying enthusiasm, is bordering on aggressive as his playful suggestion to dance suddenly devolves into something far more sinister. What if Buddy isn’t really our friend after all?For the rare few who have seen 2002’s black comedy flop Death to Smoochy, the sight of a Barney-adjacent figure losing his temper might not be a novel surprise, but in Buddy we’re not just witnessing a temporary breakdown. Writer-director Casper Kelly, whose work has mostly been for Adult Swim, wants us to see him as a bold new horror icon, creating an elaborate universe centered around his power and influence (Buddy himself even turned up to last night’s midnight premiere). Is Buddy quite deserving of being so forcefully propelled into the spotlight? Not nearly.The gimmick of Buddy, who stabs and decapitates with sunny disposition intact, is a basic joke that wears off far too quickly. The novelty of a malevolent presence in the wholesome, brightly lit world of a kids TV show can’t quite sustain an engaging 95-minute feature, Kelly not knowing where to take his admittedly attention-securing setup. As the kids in the show (led by If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’s Delaney Quinn) start to realise that Buddy is killing off those around them, they must figure out how to use the limited tools at their disposal to stay safe and escape. The film moves forward, episode-by-episode, before we’re taken out and sat with a confused parent in the real world, played by The Penguin’s Cristin Milioti, who, a la Julianne Moore in The Forgotten, is convinced she has a daughter who everyone else claims doesn’t exist.It’s territory Milioti knows rather well, having slid between similar worlds in Black Mirror’s standout episode USS Callister, although any of Charlie Brooker’s suspense and intricately thought-out world-building is nowhere to be seen here. Buddy, voiced by Keegan Michael-Key, is never as monstrous or as sadistic as we expect he might be given the premise; there’s something weirdly restrained about what he does and how he does it (for all of his pleas to play, the film just isn’t playful enough). There are touches of something more gonzo (a scene of Buddy, flesh burning, groping the local nurse) but the kills are mostly ineffectively tame and boringly uninventive and even as Buddy inevitably transforms in the finale, the results are too tinny to scare anyone over the age of eight.It’s moments like this, as we remain stuck in the world of the show, that make us question what we’re watching and who it’s for. With the overwhelming majority of the film set in a nauseatingly fake studio, complete with a Patton Oswalt-voiced backpack, it’s difficult to really take any of what happens seriously – what are the stakes, who are these characters, why should we care? – and as Kelly starts to merge the two realities, he also tries to force some emotional weight to something far too silly to carry it. With the poor child actors forced to stay in well-observed yet progressively grating Nickelodeon schtick, it’s hard to feel all that bothered about their survival.History has taught us that this year’s Sundance will likely offer up at least one breakout horror, to be filed alongside Get Out, Hereditary, Saw and The Babadook, but Buddy is most certainly not it. Barney remains far more terrifying.Buddy is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewHorror filmsComedy filmsSundance film festivalComedyFestivalsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Over three near-perfect seasons, hispeerless HBO series How To With John Wilson, executive-produced by Fielder, spun spoofs of practical guides (“How to Cook the Perfect Risotto”) into profound meditations on the loudness, loneliness and ridiculousness of modern urban life, each half-hour episode a magic trick of elaborate, bizarre tangents reined in at the last second. Forfans of the show– in my opinion, the single best TV series about New York this decade – Wilson’s feature documentary debut, supposedly about the most iconic element of urban life, was a must-see.Good news for me, then, as The History of Concrete is essentially a 100-minute version of a How To episode, with extra diversions and the added absurdity of Wilson’s newfound status as a celebrity, of sorts. His signature greeting – “Hey, New York” – belies a weird time to start filming. His HBO series, which got his face on to a Times Square billboard and his team to the Emmys, is over. He has reached an alien, distinctly 2020s mid-level of success: his face is on black-market weed products (“high, New York!”), he’s getting offers to collab with Arby’s, he’s the answer to a $1,000 question on Jeopardy! that no one gets. Most flatteringly, someone on TikTok is using an AI-generated version of his voice to sell gutters. Finding direction for the next thing, he relatably confides in his signature stilted, nasally narration, is hard.Enter the Writer’s Guild of America (WGA), which during the 2023 strikes offered members like Wilson a workshop called “How To Make and Sell A Hallmark Movie”. Wilson, his sixth sense for oddity piqued, brings home a risible montage of practical tips: trauma is fine if it ends on a high note, film in Canada, avoid The Big City Girl Goes Home trope in the post-girlboss era. A real Hallmark movie called ’Twas the Date Before Christmas, about an affordable housing developer attempting to buy out a candle shop (or something), sparks an idea: if Hallmark can do property development, why can’t he sell concrete? As he correctly realizes – and I will continue thinking about this – it is embarrassing to know so little about something that dominates your visual environment.This is a spin on an old Wilson idea; The History of Concrete is basically a sequel to How To’sall-timer second episode about scaffolding, which proved that with enough close attention, even the most mundane and boring of subjects can become fascinating, a portal into universal human themes. Through Wilson’s narration, an $8bn industry of metal poles and planks to keep chunks of building from hitting our heads asked bigger questions about the cost of safety, how seemingly temporary things become permanent. Similarly, and along with Cori Wapnowska’s pinpoint editing, concrete – apparently the second most-used material on the planet after water, the stuff of our cracked roads and gum-stained sidewalks – becomes both a symbol of decay and a metaphor for hardscrabble, imperfect change.Thematic and stylistic repetition, in this case, does not indicate stagnation. Fame, however niche or sporadic, seems to have only enhanced Wilson’s singular magpie instinct for the discordant, mismatched and gloriously profane – he is perhaps the only person who could film a ritzy LA dinner with Kim Kardashian and an Ohio driver’s ed class with the same offbeat curiosity. There’s plenty of hilarity and wonder to be found in Wilson’s gold-standard visual collages and wacky tangents, from a junior bricklaying competition to a 3,100-mile race around a single block in Queens. As ever, he finds borderline unbelievable characters who deliver lines like “mean Gene the embalming machine!”, and whose risible appearances never feel compelled by mockery.Still, the connective tissue is a little loose and baggy, even by Wilson’s admirably loose standards; at times, particularly in the film’s lagging final third, Wilson seems more interested in chasing absurdity – just seeing how far following a true eccentric will take him – than finding a cohesive point. Though Hallmark did advise mixing serious bits with audience hooks, more informative tangents on affordable housing, New York’s crumbling infrastructure and hobbling nimbyism peter out before fully landing the punch, as if Wilson was afraid of getting too polemical.Still, he sticks the landing. As a standalone film, The History of Concrete is consistently laugh-out-loud funny, compelling and surprising, if 20 minutes too long. And, of course, about much more than just concrete. It is about languishing in periods of transition, the difficulty of convincing yourself to move forward. It’s about trying to keep making documentaries in this era of vanishing budgets and media consolidation. About false feelings of security, haunting impermanence and moving forward, gum stains and all. You know, the real hard stuff.The History of Concrete is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026First look reviewDocumentary filmsSundance film festivalFestivalsComedy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

With the notable exception of Alien: Earth, which cleverly reframes the franchise’s xenomorphs as little more than fluffy house cats compared with humanity’s own talent for self-destruction, it is almost always a terrible idea. Who remembers Galactica 1980, the early-80s offshoot of Battlestar Galactica that lasted all of one season? Or the later seasons of Lexx, which took one of television’s most glorious space operas and promptly shrank it by parking large chunks of the action in this solar system.Absurd … the original He-Man.Photograph: Masters of the UniverseAnd then there was the 1987 big-screen adaptation of Masters of the Universe, which somehow decided to send Nordic lunk Dolph Lundgren to LA before audiences had even finished adjusting to the idea of him being He-Man at all – as if the true stuff of epic fantasy was not skull-faced castles, cosmic sorcery and men built like exploded anatomy textbooks, but shopping malls, car parks and the vague promise of a California food court.This was a bad idea for obvious reasons. If you’ve ever watched the early-80s He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, you’ll be well aware that it may be the most psychedelic children’s programme ever smuggled on to afternoon television without a warning label. In one episode, He-Man descends into a surreal underworld of floating platforms, warped gravity and abstract peril, where spatial logic collapses entirely. In another, Skeletor rules a nightmarish shared dreamworld, in which everyone on the planet is trapped, as a sort of bony, mad god. Eternia wasn’t a place so much as a collective hallucination. This is why Lundgren and company are remembered less as mythic heroes than as deeply confused intergalactic exchange students, wandering suburban California in search of a bus stop back to fantasy.View image in fullscreenCalifornian vacation … Dolph Lundgren in the 1987 film.Photograph: Cannon/Kobal/ShutterstockPerhaps it’s this misguided, abstract sense of loss that has inspired Travis Knight’s forthcoming reboot, the first trailer for which dropped online this week. Here, Nicholas Galitzine’s Prince Adam has somehow been exiled (again) to Earth, where he works in a boring office and dreams of a return to Eternia, if only he can get his hands on the famed Power Sword of Castle Grayskull. Remember that? Yes, it’s the sharp and shiny thing that transforms you into He-Man if you’re able to utter the inspirational legend: “By the power of Grayskull, I have the power!”The new trailer is very, very keen to show us that all the staples of the original TV show are in place, even if our hero is initially bogged down in paper-pushing purgatory. Idris Elba is Man-At-Arms, Alison Brie is Evil-Lyn, and the luminous Morena Baccarin will play the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull. Jared Leto is Skeletor, and they’ve somehow drafted in Kristen Wiig to voice Roboto, a character even I’m struggling to remember from the original show.It suggests that Knight and his team understand how fragile this property is now, and are responding by piling on familiar names, lore and signifiers. It’s a trailer that desperately wants you to know that all this stuff is important, which is perhaps unsurprising given that He-Man’s most recent high-profile appearances have attracted a distinctly mixed response.Masters of the Universe: Revelation, Kevin Smith’s well-meaning 2021 small-screen reimagining, was criticised for sidelining the Prince of Eternia altogether in favour of sidekick Teela, while loading the mythology with a level of emotional gravity and metatextual soul-searching that sat uneasily with a franchise whose original appeal lay in its blunt, neon-coloured certainty. The result was a reminder that He-Man, after more than 40 years of existence, remains a paper-thin property that collapses the moment it starts asking questions it was never designed to answer.The original show worked thanks to its gloriously overblown theme music and its sheer determination to revel in boys’-own excess: enormous muscles, clear moral lines, villains who cackled, and problems that could be solved by hitting them very hard. The minute successor shows tried to apologise for the fact that its central motifs were a magic sword and a volume problem, the whole thing began to fold in on itself.Knight is said to be a huge fan of the original Masters of the Universe, and it’s hard to imagine anyone more intriguing than the film-maker behind Kubo and the Two Strings to breathe new life into He-Man. And yet there’s a nagging sense here that adding flesh, texture and emotional shading to a property whose most iconic image is a villain who is quite literally made of bones might not be the most natural fit. Masters of the Universe has always thrived on abstraction – on archetypes, silhouettes and the blunt force of myth – and the more you insist on rounding it out, grounding it, or explaining how any of it works, the more you risk discovering that there isn’t actually very much there to explain.Explore more on these topicsFilmWeek in geekAction and adventure filmsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But, as this latest addition to the MCU shows, that can afford a certain freedom. This miniseries is a surprisingly meta affair; a superhero fantasy by way of the kind of behind-the-camera machinations familiar to fans of Seth Rogen’s The Studio. It tells the story of a pair of struggling actors, Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) and Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), who are hustling hard to be cast in eccentric European director Von Kovak’s movie Wonder Man. But what seems like a simple Hollywood satire soon develops special powers as Simon finds he shares certain attributes with his fictional persona. Intriguing.Disney+, from Wednesday 28 JanuaryTake ThatView image in fullscreenCould it be magic … Gary Barlow in Take That.Photograph: NetflixA feast of nostalgia and a fascinating origin story, this series is essentially a backstage pass to experience the rise and fall of aboyband. The early years are particularly gripping as Gary Barlow finds his feet as a songwriter and the band alternate between playing school assemblies and gay clubs. It’s also striking how quickly tensions arise, with Barlow under pressure to keep knocking out hits while the others start to feel like glorified backing dancers. The plentiful archive footage makes for an intimate tale of, as Robbie Williams puts it, “working class lads given the golden ticket”.Netflix, from Tuesday 27 JanuarySkyscraper LiveView image in fullscreenCan hardly fail to be extraordinary … Alex Honnold in Skyscraper Live.Photograph: Corey Rich/NetflixRemember how you felt as you watched free-climbing maverickAlex Honnoldascend the lethal rockface El Capitan in the Oscar-winning 2018 documentaryFree Solo?

Here, he takes his brinksmanship one step further, attempting a live, unharnessed scramble up Taipei 101 – one of the tallest buildings in the world. This can hardly fail to be extraordinary viewing, even if Honnold’s terrifying antics are best observed through your fingers.Netflix, out nowShrinkingView image in fullscreenEmpty nester … Jason Segel as Jimmy and Lukita Maxwell as Alice in Shrinking.Photograph: Kevin Estrada/AppleThis warm, insightfulseriesreturns with more broad comedy and gentle philosophical musing. For all of Jason Segel’s therapist Jimmy’s attempts to heal himself after the loss of his wife, it’s clear that he’s still stuck. The latest flashpoint concerns the imminent departure to university of his daughter Alice (Lukita Maxwell). “All I want is for her to live with me until I die peacefully”, he admits. This clearly isn’t healthy but it does enable a lucid exploration of Jimmy’s grief which, it is clear, is only ever manageable and never completely absent.Apple TV, from Wednesday 28 JanuaryBridgertonView image in fullscreenSpicing things up … Adjoa Andoh as Lady Danbury and Ruth Gemmell as Lady Violet in Bridgerton.Photograph: Liam Daniel/NetflixThe raunchy regency romance returns, and although Bridgerton is starting to feel formulaic, rakish Benedict (Luke Thompson) is taking centre stage to spice things up. It’s time for another ball and Benedict – whose mother is worried about his eternal bachelorhood – has glimpsed a captivating stranger. At first she eludes him so he enlists his sister Eloise (Claudia Jessie) to track her down. However, high society seems unfamiliar with this mystery woman.

His well-earned confidence means that rather than fill the gap between 2022’s Harry’s House and last week’s announcement of his fourth album – the confusingly-titled Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally – with various one-off releases, spurious anniversary variants or curated social media moments, Styles basically disappeared. In fact, the only sliver of excitement for his fanbase to grab on to came last September when he ran the Berlin marathon in avery respectable 2hr 59min.Having endured the music industry at the height of its #content-heavy obsession in One Direction, there’s something old-fashioned about Styles’ absence between album eras. That’s unlikely to be accidental: since launching his solo career with 2017’s muted, 1970s soft-rock-indebted self-titled debut, Styles has cast himself as a cross-generational throwback beamed into the present, albeit one sporting fashion choices that rile gender conformists. Each album has arrived with a list of influences more akin to the lineup on the Old Grey Whistle Test than the current TikTok algorithms, while 2019’s Fine Line, Styles told us, was crafted under the influence of those vintage psychedelics, magic mushrooms.On the surface, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, with its cover image of Styles sporting oversized 70s glasses under a suspended disco ball, seems to continue the theme. Even lead single Aperture’s length, 5min 11sec – long enough to trouble anyone whose attention span has been eroded by social media – feels out of step with modern pop’s brevity.But things have changed. His last comeback single, As It Was, was tightly wound and metronomic, reflecting its nervy lyrics, but the dancefloor-leaning Aperture is much looser. Opening with a minimalist electronic pulse and pretty, oscillating riff, it takes its time to fully emerge from the nightclub smoke, Styles’ lightly filtered voice slurring lyrics about drinks going straight to his knees. What starts out as a skeletal, LCD Soundsystem-lite throb soon starts to build layers, but with nary a softly stroked guitar in sight. Instead, electronic textures bleed in from the song’s edges before a sunlit pre-chorus blossoms into the chorus itself – the chant of “We belong together”, a very Styles call for unity. Expect it to sound amazing ricocheting around a stadium this summer.Musically, Styles is still tinkering in the past, only the references are a little more recent. Aperture has the feel of the early 2010s and bands such as Vampire Weekend, Yeasayer and MGMT, where electronic music mixed with elements of psych, prog and pop; it is also evocative of the 00s techno-pop released on Cologne’s Kompakt label. Lyrically, however, Styles plays it quite straight. Talking about the forthcoming album on Radio 2, he said he used his downtime to go out clubbing more, to be in a crowd rather than playing to one, and at times Aperture has a slight goes-to-Berlin-once feel; people are elevating, others are “going on clean”, light is being let in, and suddenly everyone around him is his best friend. But there’s also something endearing in that, too. By the song’s excellent bridge, as some lovely house-y pianos play out, Styles suddenly sounds a bit lost; “I wanna know what safe is” he sings, before adding, “I don’t know these spaces.”Unsure whether it’s coming (up) or going (down), Aperture grapples for a happy medium and finds its own safe space. While it’s not quite daring enough to scare his fanbase, the shift in direction still feels bold for one of pop’s few good male stars. That confidence remains undented.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesPop and rockDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

Their latest single Dance the Pain Away is the year’s first true banger, a dazzling sad-pop production that bursts through the January gloom, thrusts a spritzer in your hand and drags you to the dancefloor.The LA-based duo of Michelle Buzz and Lance Shipp know their way around a classic pop structure. Between them they’ve co-written for Katy Perry, Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears and Calvin Harris, but writing for established and relatively vanilla acts pushed their own work to the other end of the spectrum. They favour maximalism: the orchestra hit, thunderous stadium drums and lyrics that emote wildly in every direction.They may look as though they’ve been thrift shopping in every era since the 1700s, but their sound is distinctly mid-80s Britain, filled with the ghosts of West End Girls’ wavy synths, Smalltown Boy’s winding bass, Erasure’s knack for soaring crescendos. Yet none of their seven singles to date sound like a rip off: more a series of love letters. You do have to concede theycouldbe a label team’s meticulously constructed answer toChappell Roan, right down to the Elizabeth I eyebrows.

His music is a kind of lo-fi but densely produced R&B, but his setup here is the stuff of electronic prog rock, with soundboards and decks, a vast array of synthesisers, a live kit, electric guitar and bass, a violin and backing vocals. That ambition is matched by the setlist: 21 songs in two hours played in quick succession.Opening with Big Mike’s, Another Baby! and Many Times, the new sandwiched with the old, Dijon plays the bedroom R&B of his debut album Absolutely with the experimental pop mindset of Baby. He blends influences to the point of whiplash: Scratching is King Krule meets Simon and Garfunkel, emphasised by a live banjo and tambourine.View image in fullscreenUnabashed in their passion … Dijon and his extensive band.Photograph: Laura Rose/The GuardianA run of seven songs in the middle – including The Dress – starts to feel mundane, with the exception of an Appalachian-sounding jig sung and played on violin by Sam Amidon following Annie. But after (Referee), smoke carpets the stage and the lights dim: the first real use of stagecraft. The guitarists take up synth pads, creating an eerie, futurist soundscape that swells and collapses in grungy chords: despite the instrumentation, this music is earthy and deep, and, on Rewind, passionate to the point of anger. The performance wakes up: TV Blues and Talk Down feature industrial sounds as rhythmic devices, phased and filtered without consistent hi-hat rhythms, forming an oozing, glutted sonic atmosphere.Yamaha, Automatic and Kindalove close the show like the end of a 1980s prom, mirrorball lights illuminating the starry-eyed crowd. But then a clarinettist plays over the encore track Rodeo Clown, the noise diminishing until all we hear is the voice of Dijon, lit by a single spotlight, in the now-familiar silhouette of him hanging off his mic. Visually spartan but sonically rich, the show elevates Dijon’s discography to another plane, made almost unrecognisable by its fearless auteur.At Brixton Academy, 23 January.Explore more on these topicsR&BPop and rockExperimental musiclive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

The Dutch-British musician previously recorded as Someone, creating three albums in dream-pop shades, but her fourth – a rawer, richer affair, made alone in rural France – digs into ancestry, mortality and memory.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Lighthouse by Tessa Rose Jackson.The Lighthouse begins with its title track. Strums of perfect fifths, low moans of woodwind and thundering rumbles of percussion frame a journey towards a beacon at “high tide on a lonesome wind”. The death of one of Jackson’s two mothers when she was a teenager informs her lyrics here and elsewhere: in The Bricks That Make the Building, a sweet, psych-folk jewel which meditates on “the earth that feeds the garden / The breath that helps the child sing” and Gently Now, which begins in soft clouds of birdsong, then tackles how growing older can cosset the process of grief. Her approach to the subject is inquisitive, poetic and refreshing.Poppier production buoys this album’s spry limbs. Fear Bangs the Drum and Wild Geese play like confident cousins of singles by This Is the Kit or Aldous Harding, while Built to Collide, driven forward by percussive violin shivers and pacy drums, is catnip for radio. Jackson’s voice, assured but never smug, is captivating too, floating between delicacy and spirited sprechgesang. It’s most potent in simpler songs such as the piano-led Grace Notes, the final track Prizefighter, and the beautiful By Morning, led by an opening guitar melody that arrives like a Paul Simon classic. It’s a luminous rebirth.Also out this monthProduced by Philip Weinrobe (Big Thief, Adrianne Lenker), the fourth album by Irish folk bandYe Vagabonds, All Tied Together (River Lea), thrums with slow-burning, moving songs. Arresting characters pop out of the mists frequently, such as the “troubled teens and drag queens” of On Sitric Road, youths “swimming in a river of smoke and serotonin” in The Flood, and Mayfly’s “grey-eyed” Mary, who smiled when she didn’t think she was being watched, “like she had nothing left to hide”.Adam Weikert’s To Whom Ourselves We Owe (self-released) is an engagingly gutsy and noisy exploration of traditional songs: Farewell to the Green Man makes merry with a practice chanter and Thai gongs, while Greensleeves gets transported to eerie, barren landscapes on a musical saw. If you fancy even wilder boundary-pushing,Nomad War MachineandSusan Alcorn’s Contra Madre (self-released) mix the late pedal steel player’s talents, thrillingly, with death metal.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

It took a bit longer to work out the word “Parlophone”.My favourite book growing upSister Vincent taught primary six in St Joseph’s, Inverness, and was a discerning reader with very good taste, plus the kind of literary moral rectitude that meant she removed Enid Blyton from the class library because she believed Blyton’s books were written by a factory of writers. In 1972 she and I had a passionate argument when the class was choosing a book to be read out loud to us and I championed Charlotte’s Web by EB White, with which I was in love. Sister Vincent put her foot down. “No. Because animals speak in it, and in reality animals don’t speak.” I recently reread it for the first time since I was nine, and it moved me to tears. What a fine book, about all sorts of language, injustice, imaginative power and friendship versus life’s tough realities. Terrific. Radiant. Humble.The book that changed me as a teenagerLiz Lochhead’s Memo for Spring. One evening when I was 16 I babysat for our marvel of an English teacher at Inverness High School, Ann McKay. Raiding her bookshelves I found a book so slim it had no spine, just hinges, and was by a woman who was young, Scottish and a poet (at this point in time a rare combination). The poems in it were so good, gripping and clear, written in a kind of Scottish English I knew was close to my own, but I’d never read in any book. I read it twice through that evening then Ann lent me it for a week. It filled me with excitement and hope.The writer who changed my mindSee above. Liz Lochhead. She changed what was possible – for so many of us.The books that made me want to be a writerReading certain writers does this for me on a continual basis. Muriel Spark. Toni Morrison. Morrison’s oeuvre is a sustained and courageous masterclass in how the aliveness in writing shifts the energy in life, and Spark’s Loitering with Intent, like all her books, will never fail to send me on my way rejoicing.Theauthor IrereadA lot of Simone de Beauvoir’s writing came into affordable paperback translation when I was in my very early 20s. Back then I read everything I could get. Recently I’ve loved re-encountering her fiction. I think her novels are outstanding, especially Les Belles Images (1966), a coruscating postwar satire on the performance of happiness. Also, I never stop rereading Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a book that’ll always remind its readers to stay fluid and adaptable regardless of crazed changing times.The book I could never read againNever say never. I promise I’ll try Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre and Villette again, just not right now, OK?The writers I discovered later in lifeVladimir Nabokov. What sheer shining joy. Fyodor Dostoevsky. Where have I been all the years? Henry James. I read The Golden Bowl in the garden one summer not long ago and found myself running down our garden path shouting out loud to my partner: “Sarah! Sarah! The golden bowl is broken!”The book I am currently readingLiadan Ní Chuinn, Every One Still Here. These stories about Ireland and recent history face up to the truth of lives in a way that very little new writing I’ve read does. In doing this they change and recharge the potential of the short story form. Two have already become some of my favourite stories ever.My comfort readThe Summer Book by Tove Jansson. A piece of perfection composed of loss, light, clarity and good nature – a book so trim that it fits easily in the pocket of a jacket yet contains much of everything in life that really matters.Glyph by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton.

His uncertain fate plays out in the present-day imagination of an unnamed curator of unspecified gender, who has been employed by the palace to dress some of its rooms for public viewing in the wake of an undescribed personal tragedy.It’s likely that you’ll either be utterly intrigued or deeply put off by that summary of poet Rebecca Perry’s debut novel, May We Feed the King, a highly wrought puzzle-box of a book which deliberately wrongfoots the reader at every turn. However, the intrigued will find that it richly rewards those who approach it with curiosity – just not in the ways we as readers (and as interpreters of stories in any form) have been trained to expect.The book opens directly into the airless and unemotional life of the Curator as they visit the historic house to take up a new commission. “When you see a replica feast scene in the great hall of an old building, I am the person who placed the pomegranates beside the pie, and for very good reason,” they explain. We are initiated into a world in which historically accurate foodstuffs can be ordered online – “a half oyster shell, the exposed flesh shining as if with the freshest brine, is £31.25 for a single piece” – and begin to understand one of the most striking things about this novel: its insistence upon detail, its utter specificity, set against a deliberate lack of specificity regarding the larger details that the reader’s mind naturally itches to fill in. We are told everything – and nothing at all.Soon, the Curator meets the Archivist, keeper of the medieval palace’s historical records, and in those records finds mention of the brief reign of a king whose life the Curator will draw on to create their historical scenes. We are not told exactly what the records show, but the Curator does report their reaction: “It’s important to say that I cried, I wept, when I saw it. What a reduction of a life.” Although third in line, and temperamentally unsuited to rule, it seems that this king assumed the throne reluctantly after the death of both his brothers, then refused to govern. At this point, the narrative slips into the world of the King, his Queen, his hated Chief Adviser, a loyal young Attendant and the wider world of the court, the novel swallowing up the Curator and we readers like a mirrored jewel box and holding us there, dazzled by the richness of its details and, like the King, quite unable to find our way out.It is as though we are the ghosts as we creep around the palace, trying to interpret momentous events from the few clues left behindPerry’s poetry has been shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize. She has also published an essay in book form about trampolining – growing up, she competed nationally and internationally – and it doesn’t feel like a stretch to point out that in this book the views we are granted are often brief and strangely tilted, never quite stable. May We Feed the King is made up of glimpses of scenes from odd angles and perspectives, with confounding reflections, shadows and movements: rooms seen through windows or from doorways, conversations half heard. It is as though we, not the long-dead courtiers, are the ghosts, as we creep around the palace peering into its rooms dressed in careful set-pieces, trying to interpret complex and momentous events from the few clues left behind.The King is given ultimate power – he can start wars, launch fleets, have subjects killed at a word – and yet its exercise requires total personal surrender: “the King sees an apple he would like to pick and someone is called to free it from the branch”. His growing misery is that of someone raised as a subject who has objecthood forced upon him, and we sympathise with his quiet and then not-so-quiet rebellion as he seeks to escape his plight. More widely, the novel asks us to admit that we can know almost nothing about history, or even about the lives of people with whom we live contemporaneously. To read May We Feed the King is to be richly entertained but forced to sit with frustration: we want clues, we want certainty, we want a story about the King that makes sense, and Perry withholds it, instead making us watch our own minds scrabble about, compulsively putting together the scattered pieces of the past.Towards the end of the book we are returned to the present day and the world of the Curator as they dress the scenes and invite the public in to view their work. “His great gift to us,” they tell the assembled audience, speaking of the King, “– or at least it has been a gift to me – is the very lack of an ending, that could drive a historian mad. What a great – pardon my language – ‘fuck you’ to everyone who tries to manhandle ambiguity into order, to knock out the air.” And then they release the crowds into the rooms with a final instruction that made me wonder if my two close readings of the book were sufficient, if in fact there might have been a clue that I’d missed: “Listen for everything and, above all, pay attention.”Melissa Harrison’s fourth novel, The Given World, will be published by Hutchinson Heinemann in May.

The pain of mothers separated from their children, of children sobbing for their mothers, of adults who have never moved on from the trauma of their youth, and of young people who are forced to live out the conflicts of their elders. Lara Feigel casts her net across history and fiction, reportage and memoir, and while her research is undeniably impressive and her candour moving, at times she struggles to create a narrative that can hold all these tales of anguish together.The book begins with a woman flinging herself fully clothed into a river and then restlessly walking on, swimming again, walking again. This is French novelist George Sand, driven to desperate anxiety as she waits to go into court to fight for the right to custody of her children. But almost immediately the story flicks away to Feigel’s own custody battle, and then back into the early 19th century, with Caroline Norton’s sons being taken away in a carriage in the rain by their father.Norton was the extraordinary woman who seemed to be able to transmute the pain of separation into progress. Because of her courageous campaigning, women won basic rights over their own property and children. Her tale can be read as a harbinger of hope, but it is also shot through with tragedy, including the death of one of her boys during their enforced estrangement.Feigel shows how children are still being caused unnecessary pain by both parents and lawyersAnd given the way Norton’s story is framed here, it becomes impossible to hold on to any sense of progress. We step quickly from 19th-century London back into the maelstrom of Sand’s domestic life, and see how prejudice towards independent women that worked against Norton in England were also present in France. From there we switch to the United States, where poor Elizabeth Packard, who disagreed with her husband’s religious views, was forced away from her children and into an insane asylum. And then a jump cut to 2008, watching Britney Spears being incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital without her beloved children.Feigel meets Edna O’Brien for an interview and finds her “hollow-eyed with pain after a sleepless night”. O’Brien did eventually win custody of her sons, but during their conversation the two writer mothers acknowledge the pain of their struggles with such honesty that it overcomes them. “We cry, both of us, talking about the promises we made that we could not keep; promises extracted that we believed in just about enough to make … what to do when you have a little boy crying in bed unable to sleep?”The book could have ended there, in a shared moment that seems to sum up what happens when the irresistible forces of women’s liberation come up against the immovable objects of children’s needs, patriarchal reflexes, lawyers’ arguments and ex-spouses’ anger. Instead, we flick away again to the US, and into Alice Walker’s experiences of trying to share the care of her daughter with her husband after their divorce. Their arrangement was deeply resented by the daughter, Rebecca Walker, and Feigel takes this as evidence of the “curdling of the dreams of 1960s liberal progress”.By this point it has become horribly clear to the reader that there is little, if any, sense of forward movement to be found in these stories. In the epilogue, Feigel shows through contemporary courtrooms and documents how children are still being caused unnecessary pain by both parents and lawyers. Here, new voices and characters spring to life, each demanding empathy and outrage, but the presentation feels too rushed to do justice to their compelling tales.Feigel tries to end the book on an upbeat note: “Perhaps,” she writes, “we can imagine a version of modernity that isn’t flummoxed by motherhood, where emancipation and care can coexist; perhaps we can imagine a version of the legal system that gives children genuine agency.” Given the stories she has told, such hope feels thin and fragile indeed.Custody: The Secret History of Mothers by Lara Feigel is published by William Collins (£25).

For good reason:Luke Norris’s play is a harrowing portrait of pregnancy and grief, plumbing the depths of sorrow within a marriage. But it is not only that. It is funny and profound, intense without ever becoming overwrought.The play follows a thirtysomething couple who remain unnamed, just like their baby, as they navigate loss. Their relationship seems to feed off a sparky kind of contrariness. She (Rosie Sheehy) is clever, ferocious, always up for a fight. He (Robert Aramayo) is gentler, using humour – and poetry, even in the face of her jeering – to soften her edges. Their dialogue sounds like a contact sport – ricocheting, fast and furious – while they wait for the results of their 20-week ultrasound scan in the first scene.View image in fullscreenSparky …  Robert Aramayo and Rosie Sheehy.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe news is painful, we realise in the following scene. Terrible choices have to be made around the birth of their baby. Sheehy and Aramayo give explosive performances, matching each other’s intensity in different ways. This story is so dark (“Are we at the bottom yet?” he asks her) but you do not want to miss a second of it.Directed by Jeremy Herrin, the play change gears from savage to tender, devastating to humorous, and is self-assured in showing us the shape of grief. Norris, better known as an actor, distinguished himself as a writer withGoodbye to All That, which was staged upstairs at the Royal Court in 2012. This confirms his talent as a playwright of depth and flair.Plot twists bring shock and dread, but alongside this there is both whimsy and deep rumination on mortality, including a mystical element that skirts around dreams and other worlds and existences.It is strikingly staged, with blackouts between scenes. Grace Smart’s set design changes at speed in the dark, a new milieu emerging out of it suddenly – the couple’s bedroom or would-be nursery taking the place of a hospital room, with dazzling lighting byJessica Hung Han Yun.The couple’s fights are visceral, speaking the unspeakable. “Sometimes I hate you,” she says, and he wishes her dead. But through the tears and angry, unreasonable charges they hurl at each other, the love endures. This is a tear-jerker with 100% heart, 0% sentimentality. What a start to theRoyal Court’s 70th anniversary season. What an emotional tour de force.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrePregnancyParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She’s been remade as a feminist icon – a woman driven to extremes, and even incarcerated, by a society and a husband who couldn’t cope with her creativity. Some have tried, too, to capture the Fitzgeralds’ melodramatic marriage on stage (such as in the Craig Revel Horwood-directed Beautiful and Damned in the West End in 2004), with limited success. This latest attempt, with music and lyrics by actor Hannah Corneau, is directed by Michael Greif, the man behind the original Broadway productions ofRentandDear Evan Hansen.He has, unsurprisingly, assembled a cast that can pour plenty of vocal bravura into Corneau’s largely poppy score. We follow the well-worn trajectory of the Fitzgeralds’ ascent and decline from Jazz Age fame through the lens of their daughter Scottie as she wanders through their archive (book-lovers will ache over Shankho Chaudhuri’s set of shelves and stacks). The framing is as little explored as the rest of the show’s ideas – why is Scottie there in the first place? – but does allow for a moving performance from Lauren Ward, as she interacts with her parents at various ages.View image in fullscreenBook-lovers’ delight … Shankho Chaudhuri’s set for Beautiful Little Fool.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBetween Mona Mansour’s book and Corneau’s corny and repetitive lyrics (“Trust is a funny thing / You have it one day and then it’s gone”) we never get more than a superficial drawing of the central couple. There’s no sense here of why they were so dazzling, or darkly troubled. David Hunter works to bring out F Scott’s mix of arrogance and insecurity, Amy Parker – who stepped in for Corneau on opening night – belts out Zelda’s emotions as a wall of lights bursts suddenly behind her, and there’s some tender romance to their Alabama meeting in One Night in July.But no melodies linger from the many ballads, and there is no sense of the spark or wit of these two wordsmiths colliding beyond a single waspish argument on the Riviera. The show steadfastly ignores Zelda’s mental health issues for the sake of its sudden, damn-the-patriarchy climax. Still, there’s not long to wait for the next Zelda musical –The Fitzgeralds of St Paulis scheduled for a New York launch this spring.AtSouthwark Playhouse Borough, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsF Scott FitzgeraldSouthwark PlayhousereviewsShareReuse this content"

This is a group whose promo images once saw thembrandishing drumsticks as clubs, music stands as Kalashnikovs, that treats new music as a bloodsport: they like to be in at the kill.Fresh on the slab were four works from across the spectrum of scope and mood – “music of maximal difference” as conductor Aaron Holloway-Nahum put it – a playlist designed to bring a polite midweek audience up to frenzied, club levels of intensity before cooling us down and sending us out dazed and disoriented.It was hard to find much purchase in the introspective scrabblings and mutterings of Corie Rose Soumah’s Limpidités IV for violin. Performer Marie Schreer gradually appeared from darkness for this UK premiere, coming into focus like a score whose seven episodes seem to take a solo Bach suite and distil it down to essential gestures: finger motions; bow movements; double-stopped chords; breath. Often soundless (or all but), bow whispering back and forth over the fingerboard, left-hand pizzicato barely audible, this is hypothetical music, speculative, ultimately noncommittal.What a shock, then, to be plunged without pause into the ecstatic assault ofAnna Meredith’s 2015 Brisk Widow. Scored for electronics, spotlights and two drum kits (the super-slick Sam Wilson and Jack Ross) it’s a no-holds-barred sonic battle for supremacy in which duelling rhythms – aural and visual – punch back and forth across the space, casting the audience as the pinball in an arcade game of quickfire pulses, liquid electronic peals and hammering beats.View image in fullscreenNo holds barred … quickfire drums in Anna Meredith’s Brisk Widow.Photograph: Ed Maitland SmithUpping the maximalist ante, Alex Paxton’s Shrimp BIT Babyface is a musical supermarket sweep. A swirling big-band fantasy, cartoonish and candy-bright, it seizes great handfuls of musical experience – mariachi, swing, Christmas carols, school recorder ensembles, a baroque jig – and flings them all together in a heap, inviting the listener to pick through at their leisure. It’s an enticing invitation, made with swagger and plenty of groove here by Holloway-Nahum and his musicians.Which left it to Eden Lonsdale’s Tränen und Ozeane(also a UK premiere) to calm the pulse with glassy skeins of sound. Harpsichord, strings and accordion spun horizontal chordscapes: counterpoint in slow motion, polyphony left out in the rain, dissolving into smudgy microtones. Strangely gorgeous, a meditation in greys and silvers after the blinding lights of the Meredith and Paxton’s pastel hit, it took us full-circle back to the start: whispers now concrete, with something real to say.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicExperimental musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

It would be a more persuasive theory if he didn’t begin his show with two of the most relatable topics known to comedy, becoming middle-aged and moving to the suburbs. He’s clever and funny on both, mind you, and throughout a show that, at least for a while, cleaves to familiar tropes of thirtysomething standup: fussiness about dishwasher stacking; fear of turning into a “crusty old colonel”.You might incline to the conclusion that the South African-born Brit is a better writer than he is a performer. His one-liners are frequently dazzling (“I played rugby at school the same way that horses fought in the war”) but his show is formally conventional and his delivery a little stiff. I spent a portion of the show thinking along those lines, until the sheer quality of Novellie’s routines in its second half bulldozed my resistance. His grumpy riff on how people dress in airports, with a droll sidebar on Winnie the Pooh’s couture, is fun, but pales next to its succeeding section, on the game of chicken Novellie played with the cleaners in his Melbourne hotel.What’s Wrong With Benny Hill? review – a vivid reminder of what millions once found hilariousRead moreThat routine is a mini-masterpiece ofextensio ad absurdum, as applied to the hotel’s eco-friendly laundry policy. The show is then rounded off with the mock-epic shaggy dog story of Novellie’s house move, which finds him lumbering across London with six tote bags of bleeding beef strung from his neck. OK, so he’s not as expansive a personality on stage as the comedians (Rhod Gilbert,Ian Smith) whose work this hapless misadventure recalls. There are occasional hints meanwhile that his crusty-colonel curmudgeonliness may be more than just a caricature.But, particularly in that climactic set piece, he shows that his range of expression, if narrow, remains potent: see the wrung-out thousand-yard stare with which he greets his removal men as they separately reach their destination: “I’m not the man they left behind.” If this is observational comedy in 2026 – well, there’s life in the old dog yet.AtSoho theatre, London, until 31 January.Then touringExplore more on these topicsComedySoho theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Proximity to France? Easy landing beaches beneath the cliffs? The lively arts scene?Probably – pending new archaeological finds – the first two, yet there’s little doubt that this bit of Thanet has long been hopping. Van Gogh, Turner, Pugin, Tissot and Sambourne wielded brushes on its streets. Dickens everyone already knows about, but other local scribblers include Anthony Buckeridge, Russell HobanandFrank Muir.Sir Moses Montefiore transformed one area of town into a glorious slice of Georgian Jewish splendour; the brainchildren of other mad and sublime architects are dotted all about. The harbourside Home for Smack Boys, a charitable home for orphans and fishing apprentices, is the best church I know.Granted, there was a bit of a cultural lull through the 80s, 90s and 00s, which is when I knew the town best. My family are from Flora Road, and I spent every holiday there, then even more time when my grandmother was ill. She died in 2005, the year after Ukip set up their first office-cum-gift shop on nearby King Street. But the advent of a high-speed rail link in 2008 turned things around and the subsequent gentrification has been colossal. There’s a proper, credible music venue now, plus an amazing record store, wild museums (obsolete computers, pinball machines), book sales in shipping containers and endless grassroots activity.The point about Ramsgate though is that it has soul and salt in its bones. Even without the hip additions, it is a place for wild skies and big thoughts. There is no place I love more. Except perhaps Broadstairs: a short walk along the coast, with better rock pools and nicer ice-cream.Catherine ShoardLetchmore Heath, HertfordshireFor sheer density of cultural significance per square foot, surely nowhere deserves the title more than theHertfordshirevillage where I was born, Letchmore Heath. This pretty, chocolate-boxy place, with its pond, pub and village green on which morris dancers disport themselves, is a short drive from Elstree Studios and is often used for film and TV shoots. Most notably, the 1960 cult sci-fi movie Village of the Damned was shot there (based on John Wyndham’s novel The Midwich Cuckoos), in which the village’s women mysteriously give birth to a weird clutch of blond-haired, dead-eyed children: the advance party of a conquering alien master race. All of the village’s sweetly picturesque sights assumed an eerie dimension after that.My oldest friend, the novelist Joanna Briscoe – with whom I had playdates in the village when we were four years old – wrote a fascinating thriller set there calledTouched, inspired by the film. But these somewhat sinister associations were redeemed in 1973 when George Harrison bought the local manor house, then called Piggott’s Manor – around the time he was working on his album Living in the Material World – renamed itBhaktivedanta Manorand donated it to the Hare Krishna movement as a place of spiritual calm and enlightenment; there is now a George Harrison Garden dedicated to his memory in the grounds.Peter BradshawFalmouth, CornwallView image in fullscreen‘Putting Cornwall back on the touring map’ … Venezuelan calypso musicians performing at the Cornish Bank in Falmouth, Cornwall.Photograph: Hugh R Hastings/Getty ImagesSt Ives may seem the more obvious choice to represent Cornwall, but the north coast town has beencompromised by overtourism, greedily trading on its reputation as a 20th-century artistic haven. Ironically, that’s shut out most contemporary artists from being able to make work there. Plus, St Ives’s creative identity was largely imposed on it by outsiders, save Peter Lanyon and Alfred Wallis.No, better beautiful cobbled Falmouth, which by way of cultural history has the sun-dappled, softly horny expressionism of 19th-century painter Henry Scott Tuke, and the first ever polytechnic society, which is still going strong today. It was the hub of the Cornish wrestling scene; more modern sporting duels includethe annual worm-charming championships. Today, it has festivals celebrating sea shanties, oysters, beer and boats, as well as the indie music festival Wanderfal, spanning the seaside town’s many choice venues – chiefly the Cornish Bank, which organises the fest. Since opening in 2020, the Cornish Bank has put Cornwallback on the touring mapas well as cultivating local culture such as theCeltic club night Klub Nos Lowenand much-needed queer events.There are multiple anarchic theatre companies including Miracle and Near-ta, the art school is still going strong, and at pub-cum-bookshop Beerwolf you can drink cheap ale and buy cheap books (a self-perpetuating combination). The many free gardens are fertile glades, and in the face of shuttering nightclubs across the nation, the inglorious sticky carpets of Club I (sadly not owned by Steve “Phil Mitchell” McFadden, as persistent local rumours would have it) turn 60 next year. Plus, you may spot Aphex Twin in the pub. What more could you want?Laura SnapesAbergavenny, MonmouthshireView image in fullscreen‘A border-town story worth telling’ … here. Abergavenny in Monmouthshire.Photograph: Graham Hunt/AlamyMy home town now for nearly a decade, Abergavenny – Aber to lots of us – is where the radical magic of the Welsh borders meets the might of the Welsh valleys. We have what is thought to be the only surviving wooden Jesse in the world – a huge 15th-centuryreligious figure carved from an oak tree, in St Mary’s Priory – and a secret 17th-century Catholic chapel in Plas Gunter Mansion. Our town schooled the groundbreaking working-class academic and novelist Raymond Williams, and our women were instrumental in the Greenham Common peace marches.There have been recent explosions in culture here, too. Alongside our well-known food festival, the arts organisation Peak Cymru has funded and (literally) platformed up-and-coming artists at its train station HQ, while talks and exhibitions have lit up theArtShop & Chapel. Forward-thinking independent booksellers Book-ish, the Abergavenny writing festival and the Abergavenny arts festival have celebrated and encouraged local creativity, while Black Mountain Jazz run Jazz Katz, a great monthly improvisation group for young people, alongside hosting gigs. The recently refurbished Borough theatre and the Melville Centre also bubble with potential as venues. Add one of the oldest amateur symphony orchestras in the UK and an award-winning brass band, and there’s a border-town story worth telling here.Jude RogersFolkestone, KentView image in fullscreen‘Art and creativity are closely woven into Folkestone’ … Folkestone triennial festival in Kent.Photograph: Andrew Aitchison/In Pictures/Getty ImagesFolkestone is the UK’s best and largest open-air art gallery, with 91 artworks situated across the town, many of them accompanied by views across the Channel. The best are in dialogue with that body of water: Yoko Ono beaming out the words “Earth peace” towards France in morse code from a lighthouse-like lamp; Christian Boltanski’s The Whispers playing recordings of letters to and from first world war soldiers at low volume as you sit on a bench looking out to sea.The artworks, along with more that come and go with theFolkestone triennialarts festival, were commissioned by Creative Folkestone, which also bought up 90-odd buildings in the town centre to provide affordable spaces for creatives. As with any arts-led regeneration, there is a certain amount of paternalism. But this was a less lumpen scheme than in say, Bilbao, Spain, or indeed Margate around the Kent coast, where galleries were plonked down like blobs of honeycomb for tourist-sophisticates to buzz around then fly away. Folkestone’s grassroots music is also nurtured with festivals such as Compass, nights such as IYKYK and venues such as Speedway, and there are festivals for everything from documentary film to south-Asian zine culture. Art and creativity are closely woven into Folkestone, rather than just draped over one part of it.Ben Beaumont-ThomasPortobello, EdinburghView image in fullscreen‘Like herring gulls to a fine chippy, we come for the culture’ … Portobello in Edinburgh.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyTwenty years ago, when I moved to Edinburgh, folk went to Porty for the beach, the pistachio-green railings and faded Victorian vibes. The 2-mile stretch of golden sands, along with the bitter winds whipping off the North Sea, made for a bracing walk along the prom. Now, like herring gulls to a fine chippy, we come for the culture. ToPortobello Books, one of the best independent bookshops in Scotland, whose legendary events programme last year alone included Ocean Vuong, Jacqueline Wilson and Kit de Waal. To the newly regenerated historic town hall, which is continuing to grow its events programme – I recently chaired Nicola Sturgeon there.The council library is brilliant and comes into its own every October during Portobello book festival. Last year, I took my daughter to Porty’s annual Art Walk, in which residents open up their homes to show work by contemporary artists, which is as eccentric and delightful as it sounds. Porty Pride is growing year on year into a grassroots community festival to rivalEdinburghand Glasgow’s Pride festivals. Climate-focused community action is powerful in Porty, and often dovetails with the burgeoning art and food scenes. If none of that’s your jam, there’s always the forbearing line of wild swimmers, mostly middle-aged women at the end of their rope, bobbing year-round in the sea, which in Porty is a culture all of its own.Chitra RamaswamyHalifax, West YorkshireView image in fullscreen‘The Shoreditch of the north’ … Jim Kerr of Simple Minds at the Piece Hall in Halifax in 2025.Photograph: Andrew Benge/Getty ImagesA few years ago, BBC Radio 6 Music dubbed Halifax “the Shoreditch of the north” after the former mill town’s unlikely metamorphosis into a hipster haven to rival the east-London hotspot. Although residents cringed at the comparison, the town has a huge cultural imprint. The 18th-century cloth hallthe Piece Hallhas been transformed into a world-class outdoor venue hosting the likes of Paul Weller and Boygenius, while the former 19th-century carpet manufacturing complex Dean Clough now hosts a theatre and one of the largest private art galleries in the UK.The music scene most recently added dreamy indie types the Orielles to an impressive lineage stretching from thrash metallers Paradise Lost to Dubstar’s Sarah Blackwood; The Grayston Unity has emerged as a key northern grassroots hub, while the reunited Stone Roses’ warmup show here a few years back had the Victoria theatre’s balcony literally bouncing.Lately, the town’s Victorian architecture and breathtaking Calder valley landscapes painted by Turner and immortalised by Ted Hughes have provided locations for several TV series, including Shane Meadows’s The Gallows Pole and Huddersfield-born Sally Wainwright’s smashes Happy Valley, Gentleman Jack and (obviously) Last Tango in Halifax. The Piece Hall was even blown up in the Marvel miniseries Secret Invasion … but, luckily, only fictionally.Dave SimpsonTell us your own nominationYou can tell us your choice for the first UK town of culture using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The third time, when it showed up in a mutated form, it broke through. But fortunately, they already had a 98% vaccination rate.”He continued: “This is why I love New Zealand. People there are, for the most part, sane – as opposed to the United States, where you had a 62% vaccination rate, and that’s going down, going the wrong direction.“Where would you rather live? A place that actually believes in science and is sane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s at each other’s throats, extremely polarised, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter disarray if another pandemic appears.”Cameron joins an increasing exodus of film industry celebrities leaving the US, citing Trump’s second term in the White House as a key reason.

It often feels as though he’s not acting at all – just being himself. That may be because he wasn’t an actor at all until Simon Pegg cast him as his best mate Mike Watt in the much-loved sitcom Spaced, when Frost was working as a waiter in a Mexican restaurant in London. After bonding over a shared love of comedy, horror, Star Wars and video games, the pair became slacker flatmates as well as friends.Their bromance soon continued on screen, with Frost playing slovenly best mate Ed to Pegg’s Shaun in Shaun of the Dead, followed by the guileless West Country police officer Danny Butterman opposite Pegg’s Nicholas Angel in Hot Fuzz. They reunited once more for the final instalment of theirCornetto trilogy, with Frost as teetotal lawyer Andy – childhood friend to Pegg’s Gary – in The World’s End. The pair also co-wrote and starred as British geeks on a US road trip with an alien in Paul, and later teamed up again for the criminally underrated Amazon seriesTruth Seekers.Away from Pegg, Frost has carved out a varied and surprisingly eclectic career. You might have seen him as factory worker Don Burton in Kinky Boots; DJ “Doctor” Dave in Richard Curtis’ The Boat That Rocked; a local drug dealer in Joe Cornish’s Attack the Block; a former teen salsa champion in Cuban Fury; Ricky the Tattooist in Iain Morris’s The Festival; and WWE wrestler Ricky Knight in Steven Merchant’s Fighting with My Family. In 2024, he wrote and starred in the horror comedy Get Away. He’s up next in horror, Whistle, about a group of high school misfits who come across an ancient Aztec death whistle. Sounds spooky.On television, Frost has played Commander Henderson in the BBC Two sci-fi sitcom Hyperdrive; led the Sky comedy Mr Sloane, appeared as Santa Claus in two Peter Capaldi-era Christmas specials of Doctor Who; and – perhaps most improbably – narrated Channel 4’s Supernanny. More recently, he voiced SM-33 in Star Wars: Skeleton Crew. And then there’s the small matter of his upcoming role as Hagrid in HBO’s Harry Potter – the second most famous groundskeeper in the world, after Groundskeeper Willie.So, there’s plenty to ask the great man: from his love of West Ham to why he hates the word “bromance” (oops), to that time he flushed not one but two birthday cakesdown the toilet. Please get your questions in by midday on Tuesday 27 January and we’ll print his answers in Film & Music on Friday 30 January.Whistle is in UK cinemas 6 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsFilmFilm & Music reader interviewNick FrostTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Wallace was also an effective campaigner for free instrumental tuition in Scottish schools, enabling children of all backgrounds to explore and develop their talents.Following a music degree at King’s College, Cambridge, and postgraduate composition studies at York University and the Royal Academy of Music in London, Wallace started out composing but found it difficult to make a living from this alone. So in 1974 he auditioned successfully as assistant principal trumpet for the London Symphony Orchestra, then led byAndré Previn.He later said that he thought he would be “there for life”. After two years, however, he was wooed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, then conducted by Riccardo Muti, as principal trumpet. The key factor in persuading him, he explained, was that “I’d never heard Brahms played like that and fell in love with the orchestra.” He stayed for 19 years while also becoming principal trumpet with the London Sinfonietta in 1987.Wallace’s largest audience and one of his more daunting engagements came in July 1981, when his trumpet complemented the voice ofKiri Te KanawainHandel’s Let the Bright Seraphimat the wedding of the Prince Charles and LadyDianaSpencer in St Paul’s Cathedral, with 750 million television viewers around the world. It was a triumph that consolidated his position as a pre-eminent exponent of the instrument.He had a great interest in exploring lesser-known composers for the trumpet and expanding the repertoire for the instrument. Alongside his orchestral commitments, he developed a career as a soloist, making many recordings of key compositions and giving the premieres of trumpet concertos by Malcolm Arnold (1983),Peter Maxwell Davies(1988) and James MacMillan (titled Epiclesis, 1993), among others.View image in fullscreenWallace with Kiri Te Kanawa, June 1981. The following month they performed at the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer at St Paul’s Cathedral.Photograph: Jane BownHe premiered Mark-Anthony Turnage’s double trumpet concerto Dispelling the Fears, with Håkan Hardenberger, in 1995, and they gave another performance the following year at the BBC Proms. In 1996 he joined the pianist Joanna MacGregor and the BBC Symphony Orchestra forShostakovich’s concerto for piano, trumpet and stringsunder Andrew Davis for the Last Night of the Proms. His own compositions included a song cycle, The Centre of Things; Symphony for Brass Band; and afanfareperformed for the 25th anniversary of the Scottish parliament in 2024, with King Charles and Queen Camilla in attendance.He secured greater performing freedom by forming, in 1986,the Wallace Collection, made up of similarly free spirits who shared a mission to take brass music to the world.He returned to the Royal Academy in 1992 as head of brass and a decade later moved to Glasgow as principal of what was then the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. He brought tremendous flair to this role, which he held for 12 years. In 2011, the name changed to the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland to reflect Wallace’s success in making it a greatly expanded centre of excellence for all the performing arts.After retiring from the conservatoire in 2014, Wallace became convener of theMusic Education Partnership Group, which campaigned for free music tuition in Scotland’s schools at a time when it was rapidly eroding. By 2021, this had secured an undertaking from the Scottish government that it would provide funding to local authorities to underpin free tuition.Wallace himself was the embodiment of why access to music at a young age is so crucial. The son of Ann (nee Allan) and Christopher (always known as Kiff), he was born and grew up in Methilhill, a part of Fife where the Tullis Russell paper mill was a major employer amid mining communities in which the brass band culture flourished.His family were stalwarts of the Tullis Russell Mills Band, in which his father, a joiner at the mill, played for 63 years. John joined the junior band on cornet at the age of seven.The educational methods deployed by his early musical tutors were of the old school. His mother insisted that her husband was too hard on the child and the role was allotted instead to an electrician at the mill, Geordie Baxter, who would “whack you on the finger with his pencil” in response to an errant note, Wallace recalled. “But it sure helped the fingering.”View image in fullscreenWallace grew up in Methilhill, a part of Fife where brass band culture flourished.Photograph: Wallace CollectionBy 15 he was playing trumpet in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain. He later recalled being taken under the wing of the orchestra’s founder,Dame Ruth Railton, wife of the Daily Mirror owner Cecil King. She wanted him to play Haydn’s Trumpet Concerto and put him up in their house near Hampton Court, complete with butler, for daily lessons.The orchestra’s European tour opened in Portugal and the Fife teenager found himself feted by the dictator António de Oliveira Salazar, who was “a chum of King’s”. It was the start of a career that would carry Wallace from his working-class community into the great concert halls of the world. From Buckhaven high school, which had a strong reputation for music tuition, he went to Cambridge, where his formal teaching was augmented through contact with contemporaries including the conductors Mark Elder and David Atherton.He edited several books of trumpet music and co-wrote The Trumpet (2011) and co-edited in 1997 The Cambridge Companion to Brass Instruments. He was made OBE in 1995 and CBE in 2011, and was presented with the Queen’s Medal for Music in 2021. The Musicians’ Union, of which Wallace was a lifetime member, described him as “one of the UK’s greatest musical polymaths and a highly respected advocate for music education”.Last year, two of the many further honours reflected his musical journey. The Scottish Brass Band Association, of which he was patron, gave him its outstanding achievement award, while the Royal Philharmonic Society made him an honorary member.He married Elizabeth Hartwell in 1971. She survives him, along with their son and daughter.John Wallace, trumpet player, composer and educator, born 14 April 1949; died 11 January 2026Explore more on these topicsMusicClassical musicobituariesShareReuse this content"

Whether it’s a name, a personality, a sound or a smell – everything has a colour and a texture in our mind’s eye.What’s interesting is that the colours and the textures Kirsty and I see can be very different. When I drink a glass of chardonnay, I get these swirls of custardy oil but Kirsty might describe the same wine as fuzzy or blobby. It’s the same with people’s personalities, which we both see as a coloured and textured aura around that person. My best friend Jenn’s personality is poo brown, which she hates. For Kirsty, Jenn’s personality is yellow and blue with a brown stripe in the middle.We’ve always found it very jarring, hearing each other’s colours. On a family car trip to Queensland when we were about five years old we spent a good couple of hours with our mum going “what colour is the word Queensland? What colour is the word apple?”. The three of us saw different colours and textures for each and we spent hours arguing over who was right. Our dad and our brother didn’t say a thing. For years we assumed it was just their boy brains.We were 19 when we first found out there was a word for our experiences – and that it was genetic rather than gendered. I was in the second year of my communications degree at Macquarie University, sitting in a radio production class. The person being interviewed on the radio described a piece of music being played as really silver. I couldn’t help but blurt out that it was a really strong yellow. The narrator on the radio went on to explain that it was a phenomenon called synaesthesia causing these colour associations. I left the class and immediately called my mum and Kirsty. We were all fascinated.View image in fullscreenHelen and Kirsty Besgrove.Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianAround the same time, a university friend in the psychology department told me they were looking for synaesthetes to take part in a research project into the phenomenon. Kirsty and I were put in touch with Anina Rich, the cognitive neuroscientist leading the research, who was particularly interested in us because we were twins. Over the next few years, her study helped us to realise we had more than just auditory-visual synaesthesia..Kirsty and I finished our research with Macquarie University 15 years ago, back in our twenties, but we’re still making new discoveries about our synaesthesia every day. Just a couple of months ago, I went wine tasting with a friend and realised that not everyone tastes some wines as spiky.I used to work at the coffee brand Nespresso and one year I accidentally won the company’s Australian blind coffee taste test competition. Without really trying, I’d score 10 out of 10 on each round and ended up being flown to the grand final in Switzerland to compete with the top 20 tasters globally. All my fellow finalists had been studying coffee intensely to help them differentiate between the different blends. I just walked in and was able to differentiate straight away. I now realise that’s because my synaesthesia gives me more sensory stimuli, making the distinction easier. I guess it’s why I like wine and coffee tasting so much. I find it so nuanced and interesting. It also makes a great party trick.Kirsty Neal:It’s hard to know how much my synaesthesia has affected my work as a doctor, because I’ve never known life without it. But it has definitely given me an excellent memory, which is helpful when so much of my job requires rapid-fire recollection of facts.Helen and I were both freakishly good spellers from the age of three and could say words backwards with ease. I can now see that this is probably because letters and words come with an extra sense for us compared to most people. The word is just there in our mind’s eye. I scored highly in exams because I could pull the page up in my head and see all the notes in their various highlighted colours. When a rare condition comes up during my patient work now, I can immediately pull up facts about it because I can see the textbook, lecture or place I learned about it.View image in fullscreen‘But for us it’s just normal. We don’t know any different.’Photograph: Rémi Chauvin/The GuardianMy mirror-touch synaesthesia (where a person feels a physical or emotional sensation on their own body when they see another person being touched) means I can visualise and often feel a patient’s pain or symptoms. When I see a patient with a broken bone I literally feel a pain in my legs and my legs tingle. When someone says they’ve got a burning pain, my mind immediately goes to my own experience of burning pain. I can visualise my whole nerve. It’s yellow and on fire, with jagged edges all the way down to my toes.Helen’s getting tingles in her feet right now, just hearing me talk about it. I don’t know how much of it is personality versus my synaesthesia, but I do end up spending probably too much time with my patients because of it.The only time synaesthesia ever becomes a problem is when two words are the same colour. Michael and William are both dark reddy brown for me, so I get people with those names confused all the time. And neither Helen or I can do our lefts and rights because the concepts of left and right are different colours to the words “left” and “right”. For me, the word “left” is yellow but the concept of left is skin colour. If we’re driving and someone says go left, both of us have to ask them to point. We know what the word is but we have to manually process the meaning.Learning about synaesthesia has been fascinating. Almost 20 years ago, I was talking to Anina about the way the taste of vinegar looks like a floaty purple cloud to me, and she pointed out that it may well come from my association with purple salt and vinegar chip packets – that’s one hypothesis her team has assessed in their research. It’s led me to wonder whether my alphabet colours come from the letters on the wall in my kindergarten classroom. Helen and I were in different classes, maybe that’s why hers are different.Synaesthesia is a bit like sitting on a chair. Unless you tap into that feeling and go, “alright, there’s this pressure around my bottom and my legs,” you don’t actively process that information. It’s the same with my synaesthesia: I don’t tap into it and go “that’s orange” or “that’s blue” unless someone asks me to.People often ask Helen and me what it’s like having synaesthesia and the truth is it’s the same as when they ask me what it’s like being a twin. It may or may not have given us an advantage on some things without us realising. But for us it’s just normal. We don’t know any different.Anina Rich, a cognitive neuroscientist and chair ofthe synaesthesia research group at Macquarie University,assisted in reporting this seriesExplore more on these topicsLife and styleThe way I feelHealth & wellbeingAustralian lifestylePsychologyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

As a young teenager, I would stumble home from early high school, fresh from another day of taunts about my weight, the strange protrusions developing on my chest, or the perm I gave myself from a home kit at the weekend (it was the 1980s!). And, of course, I would relay every insult, every slight, every barb to my parents.My mother would immediately call for destruction to be rained down on the perpetrators from on high.But my father had a slightly different view.“Be nice to them,” he said. “Give your tormentors so much sweetness that they develop diabetes.”Some home truths are unspoken, intuited. In my family it’s: ‘We need each other’Read moreTo a girl in her early teens, that sounded like nonsense. I was the centre of the universe. Surely, no one had ever been as badly treated as I was! And here my father was, telling me to be nice to them?I would ask: “Is this some turn-the-other-cheek rubbish?”My father has quite a distinctive cackle, and I heard it in those moments.“No, it’s because they don’t know how to handle it. They just don’t know what to do – it drives them crazy!”Worth a try, I thought.And, beyond my expectations, it worked.For a while, I relished the confused looks I would receive whenever I used this tactic. But as I got older, I realised it wasn’t a tactic at all.Through the stinging barbs and deep pain we all sometimes have to face,being exceedingly nice to those who tormented me became a pathway to peace.For a while, I relished the confused looks I would receive whenever I used this tactic. But as I got older, I realised it wasn’t a tactic at all.I gradually shed my unfortunate habit of keeping an emotional ledger, of believing that every wrong, real or perceived, HAD to be addressed and resolved for me to move on.I found that giving grace to those I felt wronged by stopped the corrosive angst of needing to balance that ledger.I don’t always get it right – in fact, I frequently get it wrong – and of course there are times when one can’t forgive and forget, when one has to fight. But every misstep I make reinforces the value of that advice.As for Dad’s rationale – “it drives them crazy” – there was sagacity in that too. If he had simply told me to let things go and move on, he would have been greeted by the thousandth teenage eye-roll of the week. By framing it as a way to wrongfoot my tormentors, he ensured it stuck. But he always knew its real value.And now, so do I.Thomas KeneallyIt is interesting to get plain good, viable advice from the Bible. One expects the Bible to tell you to be good for goodness’s sake and for the subtle and imponderable rewards of that. But in two books ascribed to King Solomon, who reigned from about 970 BC, the Song of Songs and the Book of Proverbs, you get what looks like eroticism for its own sake.And hence in Proverbs, this encouragement: “if thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink. For you shall heap coals of fire upon his head …”It doesn’t defend the proposition, but tells you it will embarrass your enemy exquisitely and bring rewards from God as well.I came from a family where men were supposed to have grievances that were long term – my father nourished a grievance over something that happened, an insult offered by a cousin of his, in a bush post office in the 1920s. Sometimes when my Aunt Annie came down from the bush to visit us, my father would reiterate his grievance, and noted how many decades it had stood, and my aunt would say in a fluting voice, “Tommy, don’t forget that if you make peace, you heap coals of fire on your enemy’s head.”Thomas Keneally: ‘When I met Barbara Kingsolver I burst into geriatric tears’Read moreThis was a penetrating image and I had no idea as a child of its origins in Proverbs. During a famed revolt in Ireland in 1798 a method of punishment used by both sides was pitch-capping, in which pitch was poured on the enemy’s head and set alight. “heap coals of fire” indeed …But it was clear Annie was not talking about literal coals of fire! Nor was the Bible verse, when I became aware of its existence. The revenge mentioned is a benign one in that you raise a number of conflicting and tormenting questions in the target. They are: didn’t he or she notice I’d attacked them? Did they notice but thought it was some form of amiable joke? Do they not consider me worth taking notice or worthy of holding a grievance against?Like the prophet and Annie says: “coals of fire” indeed.Explore more on these topicsFamilyHome truthsAustralian lifestylefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I’ve covered thousands of miles in hundreds ofboots, and I know what makes a good pair. My formative years were spent being shoved into hiking boots and dragged up hills by outdoorsy parents. Now an outdoorsy parent myself, I’ve voluntarily remained in hiking boots ever since.How I testedView image in fullscreenI’ve put pairs through their paces in the French Alps, the Lake District and even as far afield as New Zealand.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianThere’s only one way to test a pair of hiking boots, and that’s to pop them on, lace them up and hit the trails. So that’s exactly what I did.First, I whittled it down to a shortlist of 23 styles, which included some I’d already worn extensively and loved. The rest were selected based on a combination of research and recommendations from industry friends and colleagues. I trawled product-comparison tables, waded through stats and agonised over features to find the boots worth considering.I then put each of the 23 pairs to the test. Living in Northumberland, I’m fortunate enough to have access to extremely varied terrain. Deserted sandy beaches, sprawling pine forests and rolling hills are all within close reach. I also travel a lot, so I’ve put pairs through their paces in the French Alps, the Lake District and even as far afield as New Zealand. I wore each pair for no less than 20 miles. In some cases, many more.I took the boots into the notoriously boggy Cheviot Hills to test their waterproofness the Northumbrian way (spoiler: not all of them passed).I’d also like to note that boots sourced for this article are being donated toShoe Aid, a charity that provides free footwear to disadvantaged men, women and children in the UK and Europe.The best men’s hiking boots in 2026View image in fullscreen‘Faultless’: the Altberg Malham boots.Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianBest walking boots overall:La Sportiva TX5La SportivaTX5£210£210 at Ellis BrighamWhat we loveSuperb comfort right out of the box and extremely versatileWhat we don’t loveLess durable than full-leather counterparts£210 at Ellis BrighamThe TX5s are for anyone who wants a durable, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing pair of boots that can handle anything from light hikes to multi-day treks. La Sportiva is an Italian brand that specialises in serious alpine footwear for climbers and mountaineers. The TX5 is an approach boot, meaning it’s designed to bridge the gap between light trails on low ground and extreme high-mountain terrain. That makes this pair perfect for hiking and hillwalking.Why we love itI’m on my third pair of TX5s. That’s not to say they’re not durable – quite the opposite. It’s more a reflection of how often I wear them. Of all the boots I’ve tried over the years, these have become my go-to, thanks to their all-day comfort, excellent mixed-terrain performance and tough-as-nails build quality.The nubuck upper is flexible, breathable and hard-wearing, and the strategically placed mesh sections aid flexibility. This is a seriously comfortable boot, even if it isn’t the lightest, weighing in at 540g for one of my size 9s.This is heavy enough to offer stability, but light enough to remain comfortable over long distances.One of my favourite details is the chunky rand, a thick rubber strap that runs around the outside of the boot, just above the midsole. It’s fantastic at deflecting bumps, scuffs and scrapes on rocky trails, and it bolsters the Gore-Tex membrane to add an extra layer of defence against water where it’s needed most. After several years in these boots, I haven’t had wet feet once –not even while standing ankle-deep in a peat bog.It’s a shame that …they run a little narrow, so may not suit wider feet.Suitable for:day hikes on varied terrainMaterial:nubuckWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:I needed a half size biggerLa SportivaTX5£210£210 at Ellis BrighamWhat we loveSuperb comfort right out of the box and extremely versatileWhat we don’t loveLess durable than full-leather counterpartsBest budget walking boots:Merrell Moab 3 Mid GTXMerrellMoab 3 Mid GTXfrom£94.74£129.99 at Decathlon£94.74 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent value for moneyWhat we don’t loveNot particularly pleasant to look at£129.99 at Decathlon£94.74 at AmazonI’d recommend the Moab 3s to anyone looking for a comfortable, versatile hiking boot that won’t completely drain their bank account. It can often be found for less than the £155 recommended retail price – and even at that price, you’re getting a lot of boot for your money.The “mother of all boots” line was first conceived in the mid-00s as a sort of one-stop shop for outdoorsy folk who needed something they could walk, hike and even run in. This latest version of the Moab improves upon the bestselling formula with upgraded ventilation, lower weight (480g for one of my 8½s) and a nice roomy toe box that’s perfect for wide-footed walkers.Why we love itNo one could ever accuse the Moab of putting style over substance. This is not, bless it, a particularly trendy boot. But what it lacks in streamlined looks, it more than compensates for with its out-of-the-box comfort and versatility. Whether you’re strolling along coastal cliffs, bagging Wainwrights in the Lake District or traipsing around a field with the dog, this is the perfect boot for the job. If you were to own only one piece of footwear, the Moab would be a strong candidate.The upper of the boot is an evenly balanced mix of mesh and pig-suede leather with a Gore-Tex membrane sitting beneath. This makes it extremely flexible and highly breathable. As a result, I’d say it’s well suited to warmer-weather adventures. The Vibram sole is supportive and grippy even on slippery surfaces such as tide-pool rocks, and the reinforced panel around the toe offers protection on technical terrain.The Moab 3 is also completely waterproof thanks to the Gore-Tex membrane, which held up impressively, even in boggy Northumberland.The biggest selling point for me is the price. It’s not the cheapest boot on the market, but it does offer some of the best value for money.It’s a shame that …they look a little clunky.Suitable for:a bit of everythingMaterial:synthetic mesh/suedeWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:true to sizeMerrellMoab 3 Mid GTXfrom£94.74£129.99 at Decathlon£94.74 at AmazonWhat we loveExcellent value for moneyWhat we don’t loveNot particularly pleasant to look atBest leather walking boots:Altberg MalhamAltbergMalhamfrom£211.49£234.99 at Altberg£211.49 at Taunton LeisureWhat we loveRobust, durable leather uppersWhat we don’t loveHeavyPhotograph: Fabio de Paola/The Guardian£234.99 at Altberg£211.49 at Taunton LeisureIf you’re a traditionalist who scoffs at the mere mention of modern synthetic boots, Altberg’s leathery offerings will be right up your street. This particular boot is designed for day hiking or hillwalking paths and trails, so it’s best for those who don’t intend to venture too far off-piste. That being said, with its robust build and sturdy sole, there aren’t many places below the snowline that the Malham wouldn’t confidently take you. It’s a proper boot for proper British hillwalking, built using knowledge passed down over generations.Why we love itQuality, handcrafted and small-batch production are Altberg’s USPs. There’s a personal touch to the entire experience that, along with the high quality of the product, I feel justifies the lofty price tag.The boots themselves are faultless. Comfortable from day one (a rarity among leather boots), and the sole features a subtle rocker profile that propels me forward in a pleasant rolling motion with every step. Of all the boots I tested, these are the ones that filled me with the most confidence as I stood ankle-deep in a Cheviot Hills peat bog. The mostly seam-free uppers and duck-like ability to shrug off water with ease meant that not a single drop got through. They look beautiful too: simple, uncluttered, brown – the way hiking boots always used to be.The best thing about leather walking boots is that they get more comfortable the more they’re worn, conforming to the contours of the foot as they soften up. I certainly found this to be the case with the Malham, which, after a few hours of walking, felt practically slipper-esque.It’s a shame that …those durable leather uppers add a lot of weight, which could be tiring on longer walks.Suitable for:hillwalking in wet and muddy British conditionsMaterial:leatherWaterproof:yes, SympatexSizing:true to sizeAltbergMalhamfrom£211.49£234.99 at Altberg£211.49 at Taunton LeisureWhat we loveRobust, durable leather uppersWhat we don’t loveHeavyBest lightweight walking boots:Inov8 Roclite Mid GTXInov8Roclite Mid GTXfrom£89.99£89.99 at SportsShoes£99.50 at Inov8What we loveFast, precise movement on technical terrainWhat we don’t loveSizing is all over the place – I’d suggest going up a size£89.99 at SportsShoes£99.50 at Inov8If you like your hikes fast and your footwear featherlight, this trail shoe on steroids from Inov8 is a solid option. Born on the outskirts of the Lake District, Inov8 is a brand with well-established roots in fell running and a reputation for creating grippy, go-anywhere footwear. The Roclite Mid GTX is no exception. That being said, those on the hunt for something robust, sturdy and built for steep, rocky terrain may wish to keep scrolling, because a stiff, mountain-ready boot this is not.Why we love itLight, flexible, sure-footed in mud, and cut just high enough to offer some support without hampering ankle mobility, the Roclite Mid GTX is ideal for those who like to move fast. It’s extremely grippy, with 6mm lugs that bite hungrily into muddy trails and a Gore-Tex membrane that seals out the worst of the British weather. The boots also have what Inov8 calls its “Powerflow Pro” midsole. Techy jargon aside, this is a lightweight foam that gives the Roclite a cushioned, almost bouncy quality.Fit wise, I found the Roclite to be wide but short. There’s plenty of room in the forefoot, but I found my usual size of 8½ to be on the snug side in terms of length. If I were to trial these boots again, I’d probably go up a half size.As fantastic as the Roclite is, it’s important to note that this is not a mountain boot. If your routes tend to involve anything more technical than light scrambling, this is probably not the boot for you.It’s a shame that …the sizing is a bit awkward.Suitable for:fast, light hikes in spring/summer and tackling muddy trailsMaterial:mesh bonded to a Gore-Tex membraneWaterproof:yesSizing:I needed a half size biggerInov8Roclite Mid GTXfrom£89.99£89.99 at SportsShoes£99.50 at Inov8What we loveFast, precise movement on technical terrainWhat we don’t loveSizing is all over the place – I’d suggest going up a sizeBest mountain-ready boots:Mammut Kento Tour High GTXMammutKento Tour High GTXfrom£220£220 at Mammut£220 at MilletsWhat we loveSurprisingly comfortable and forgivingWhat we don’t loveBeige uppers get dirty fast£220 at Mammut£220 at MilletsCasual hillwalking is all well and good, but if you’re looking for something that can carry you to higher altitudes and cope with moderate mountain conditions, this three-season boot from Mammut is an excellent choice. It’s tall, stiff and crampon compatible – perfect for UK mountain adventures.Why we love itThe Kento Tour is a boot that means business. The collar sits above the ankle for full support, the nubuck upper is thick and hard-wearing, and the rubber rand bolsters overall durability, fending off scuffs and scrapes with ease. The sole is stiff enough to allow precise movement on rocky terrain, but not to the point that walking on the flat becomes an uncomfortable slog.For a boot this burly, you might expect some initial discomfort, but I didn’t find this to be the case. The Kento felt great from day one, and I was particularly fond of the asymmetric lacing system that extends down almost to the toe. This makes it easy to dial in the fit, fine-tuning the tension where required and making it easy to relieve pressure points.If you’re tired of burning through lightweight boots, the Kento is worth the investment. Overkill for low-level summer walks? Probably. But as an option to bridge the gap between a relatively soft-soled walking boot and a full-blown mountaineering boot, it’s hard to fault.It’s a shame that …it’s simply too much boot for casual hikes and hillwalking.Suitable for:steep climbs and scrambling in spring, summer and autumnMaterial:nubuck leather with rubber randWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:true to sizeMammutKento Tour High GTXfrom£220£220 at Mammut£220 at MilletsWhat we loveSurprisingly comfortable and forgivingWhat we don’t loveBeige uppers get dirty fastBest hiking boot for durability:Meindl Bhutan MFSMeindlBhutan MFSfrom£222.99£222.99 at the Green Welly Stop£231.95 at Cotswold OutdoorWhat we loveIt’s hard to imagine a better boot for British hillwalkingWhat we don’t loveNot cheap£222.99 at the Green Welly Stop£231.95 at Cotswold OutdoorAdvancements in materials and footwear construction have left traditional leather boots lagging behind their lightweight, synthetic counterparts. But there’s still something to be said for a tough leather hiking boot – as this bestselling option from Meindl proves. If you value longevity, support and all-weather reliability, sometimes the old ways are the best.Why we love itThe Bhutan MFS is a direct descendant of the German brand’s famed Burma Pro. Like its predecessor, it’s a classic leather boot perfectly built for tackling mid-mountain conditions. This makes it a superb all-rounder and ideal for UK hiking and walking. It has a full nubuck leather upper, reinforced with a rubber rand, and there’s a Gore-Tex lining that works with the leather to keep feet bone dry. Unfortunately, that weather resistance comes at the expense of breathability, meaning the Bhutan can feel rather stuffy in warm weather.That’s not to say the Bhutan is in any way uncomfortable. Quite the opposite. The memory foam padding conformed nicely to my ankles as the miles racked up, but I was surprised at just how good the boots felt right away. The high ankle helps with support on uneven terrain, and I found the lacing system great for tailoring the fit.Underfoot, things are stiff and structured. This is more than welcome on rocky ground, but might feel a bit too rigid for casual strolls on undemanding country paths. The Vibram Multigrip sole is excellent, though. I found traction to be top notch on everything from mud to wet rocks to scree. In short, it’s well equipped to chew up anything the UK hills can feed it.At 807g per boot, this is no lightweight option, but the counter-argument is durability, especially when you consider that the Bhutan is designed to be resoled. Expensive? Yes, but consider it an investment. With the right care, it’ll outlast those modern featherweight alternatives several times over.It’s a shame that …they’re a bit cumbersome and definitely overbuilt for fast, low-level walks, but that’s not what they’re made for.Suitable for:mountain hikes, long days on rough ground, all-weather hillwalkingMaterial:nubuck leather with full rubber randWaterproof:yes, Gore-TexSizing:I had to go a half size down from my usual UK 8½, but I do have very narrow feet.

It felt comfortable immediately. In fact, the first time I put it on, I went straight for a 15-mile walk with no rubbing or pinching whatsoever. That being said, my feet did get rather hot wearing them on a warm summer’s day. Perhaps they’re better suited for use in cold weather.The boot features aggressive lugs to the sole, which I found to be great for traction on muddy terrain, and the synthetic uppers are surprisingly effective at shedding water. It held up well in the Cheviot slop, too, with no leaks.But what I like most about this boot is the way it looks. It’s almost like a trainer without sacrificing too much sturdiness. I’m a big fan of the felt overlays on the upper and the pop of green in the midsole, too.It didn’t make the final cut because …the trainer-like feel lacks the stability required for the most demanding terrain.Suitable for:day hikes and casual wear;material:synthetic;waterproof:yes, Gore-Tex;sizing:true to sizeMerrellMoab Speed 2 Mid Gore-Texfrom£125.95£125.95 at Cotswold Outdoor£160 at MerrellWhat we loveLight, grippy and looks greatWhat we don’t lovePerhaps a bit too trainer-y for someQuechua MH500QuechuaMH500£69.99£69.99 at DecathlonWhat we loveVery cheapWhat we don’t loveBuild quality could be better£69.99 at DecathlonBest for:cash-strapped hikersDecathlon’s in-house camping brand, Quechua, is known for the impressive bang-to-buck ratio of its products. These boots are a prime example. They’re accessibly priced at £69.99, but they’re also surprisingly durable, sturdy and waterproof. They even remained water-tight in the boggy Cheviot terrain.Granted, they’re not the most beautifully constructed boots – my test pair has visible glue where the outsole meets the toe, and the tongue is extremely thin – but they’re reasonably comfortable, grippy beyond their modest price tag and yet to let in water.

Still, it was important to include something for those who find traditional hiking boots too hot in summer. This is essentially a hiking shoe-sandal hybrid, offering a rare combination of complete ventilation and a robust, grippy sole for support and traction on rough terrain. The neoprene lining means the walking shoes are comfortable with or without socks, and bungee laces make them easy to get on and off.If I had to pick fault, I’d say the Arroyo II is not much of a looker. But, hey, you’re heading to the hills, not Milan fashion week.They also feature a label that confusingly says “waterproof”.

It is, in a word, beefy. Every textile panel, piece of leather and rubber overlay is burly and tough, giving an overall sense of robustness – if it can be reinforced, it has been reinforced. It’s also the tallest boot I tested, extending several inches above the ankle, and waterproof all the way to the top. That means it works well when carrying heavy loads, such as on overnight backpacking trips or multi-day expeditions.If your average jaunt into the wilderness involves mostly light trails, bridleways and rarely creeps above 10 miles, this is not the boot for you. If, on the other hand, you regularly venture off the beaten track and cover long distances in less than favourable conditions, the Quest 4 is the workhorse for which you’ve been looking.It didn’t make the final cut because…this heavy, stiff boot is overkill for casual hikes.Suitable for:multi-day treks with a heavy pack;material:leather/synthetic mix;waterproof:yes, Gore-Tex;sizing:true to sizeSalomonQuest 4 Gore-Texfrom£160£160 at Salomon£200 at BlacksWhat we loveExcellent support and stability for carrying heavy packsWhat we don’t loveFar too much boot for casual walking and hikingDanner Mountain 600 EvoDannerMountain 600 Evofrom£250£250 at Cotswold Outdoor£260 at Ellis BrighamWhat we loveGreat for all-round use and works casually tooWhat we don’t loveThe price£250 at Cotswold Outdoor£260 at Ellis BrighamBest for:classic looks packed with modern techOld meets new in this hybrid boot from American bootmaker Danner. With a round toe, D-ring lacing system and clean full-grain leather upper, it looks like a traditional leather hiking boot at first glance. Look a little closer, though, and you’ll find it’s anything but. A springy foam midsole lends the boot an almost trainer-like quality, and a synthetic textile in the tongue gusset adds a pop of colour while also bringing the weight down. I found them to be completely waterproof in rain and standing water.I was particularly fond of the lacing system, which extends almost to the toe. This meant I was able to tailor the fit by tightening and loosening certain portions all the way up the boot, resulting in a remarkably comfortable first hike. There’s also a spare pair of flat laces in a different colour included, which is a nice touch.It didn’t make the final cut because …it lacks a proper toe guard for rocky trails.Suitable for:day hikes on mixed terrain;material:leather/synthetic mix;waterproof:yes, Gore-Tex;sizing:true to sizeDannerMountain 600 Evofrom£250£250 at Cotswold Outdoor£260 at Ellis BrighamWhat we loveGreat for all-round use and works casually tooWhat we don’t loveThe priceVivobarefoot Tracker Forest EscVivobarefootTracker Forest Escfrom£210£210 at Vivobarefoot£220 at AmazonWhat we loveUnparalleled grip and tactilityWhat we don’t loveNot fully waterproof£210 at Vivobarefoot£220 at AmazonBest for:wide feet or barefoot shoe enthusiastsBarefoot shoes, also known as zero-drop or minimalist shoes, have been growing in popularity for several years. Vivobarefoot is the brand responsible for starting the craze. Its thin-soled footwear is designed to reconnect the wearer to the earth below them while allowing the foot to move in the way nature intended.The Tracker Forest Esc brings this concept to the world of hiking. The boot features a wide, roomy front that gives toes room to spread while walking, and the sole is thin enough to allow the terrain to be felt underfoot, despite being heavily treaded with deep rubber lugs. Once I got used to the sensation of having my foot flat on the ground with no cushioning elevating my heel, I found the Tracker Esc to be incredibly comfortable and grippy. My feet had plenty of room to move around inside, but the high collar and wide positioning of the lace loops meant the boots never felt loose or excessively roomy.I know several avid walkers and hikers with wide feet (including my own mother) who have historically struggled to find shoes that fit. They tell me that switching to barefoot designs has been a gamechanger in terms of comfort. On top of that, Vivobarefoot is a certified B Corporation, which makes me feel slightly better about trampling all over Mother Nature in its products.It didn’t make the final cut because …these boots are not fully waterproof. They will let water through in the wettest of conditions, so they may not be the best option for British winters.Suitable for:hiking and trekking in dry conditions;material:leather;waterproof:no;sizing:runs half a size largeVivobarefootTracker Forest Escfrom£210£210 at Vivobarefoot£220 at AmazonWhat we loveUnparalleled grip and tactilityWhat we don’t loveNot fully waterproofWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘Even the very best waterproof boots may not keep your feet bone dry all the time.’Photograph: Fabio de Paola/The GuardianWaterproof vs water resistantMost hiking boots are treated with a durable water repellent (DWR) coating that allows water to bead off the surface. This makes them water resistant, but it doesn’t necessarily make them waterproof. DWR alone won’t stop water from getting through in heavy rain or when the boot is fully submerged.Waterproof boots are treated with DWR too, but they also feature a membrane beneath the face fabric that stops water droplets from passing through while still allowing water vapour – ie sweat – to escape from within.Gore-Tex is the biggest name in waterproof membrane, but there are others, such as Sympatex and Pertex, that work in much the same way.It’s worth noting that even the very best waterproof boots may not keep your feet bone dry all the time. Sometimes, water can creep in at the ankle and be unable to escape, or your feet will begin to produce sweat faster than the fabric can wick it to the outside. Either way, the result is damp socks.FitHiking boots are supposed to be worn with thick socks. It’s also likely your feet will swell slightly as you rack up the miles. Your boots should fit slightly larger than your street shoes to accommodate for this. But fear not, most boot brands factor this in. So, in most cases, your normal size should be correct.If in doubt, many brands have online sizing tools and charts you can consult. Or, in an ideal world, go into your local outdoors shop to try on a few pairs. As a wise shop assistant once told me: “The pair of boots youwantisn’t necessarily the pair of boots youneed.”Another option is to go for a scan. This is the most accurate way of measuring your feet, and it can be particularly useful for those who struggle to find footwear that fits. Many outdoor shops offer this service in store,Cotswold Outdoorbeing one of them.Another thing to consider is weight. Lighter boots tend to be more comfortable and manoeuvrable. Heavier boots often provide greater stability, but can tire out the legs over long distances.MaterialLeather boots are famously hardy, but they’re also heavy, cumbersome and can lack breathability. As a result, brands are increasingly working with synthetic materials that allow them to make their boots lighter and more breathable. Unfortunately, this tends to come at the expense of durability.If you’re looking for a lightweight boot that’s highly breathable and immediately comfortable but may last only a year or two, go for synthetic. If you want a solid workhorse of a boot that’s perhaps a little heavy, but will still be chugging away after multiple resoles, choose leather.A good compromise is nubuck. This low-maintenance buffed leather is more flexible and breathable than its full-grain counterpart, with better durability than many synthetic materials. This makes it a popular choice for hiking boots.Care and cleaningMaintenance is extremely important if you want to preserve the life and waterproofness of your boots. Most brands offer detailed instructions, but generally speaking, you’ll need to do the following regularly.Clean:scrub away excess mud and wipe boots with a damp cloth.Dry:remove moisture from inside the boots by stuffing them with newspaper and leaving them to dry out.Reproof:that DWR coating needs to be refreshed at regular intervals. The material of your boots will determine the best product for the job, so check the manufacturer’s website for recommendations.PriceJust like energy, food and housing, hiking boots aren’t getting any cheaper. These days, it’s difficult to find a durable, comfortable pair for less than £100 without hitting the sales. Most mid-range pairs sit somewhere between £150 and £220, and high-end mountaineering boots can easily hit £500-plus.The mid-range tends to be the most cost-effective place to aim. Cheap out on low-quality boots, and you risk having to replace them sooner than anticipated. As for the high-end stuff – if your typical outdoor adventure tends not to involve ropes, helmets or belay devices, they’re almost certainly overkill.How to break in walking bootsIf your new boots are giving you trouble, you might be wondering how to break them in. Well, good news and bad news. According to Peter, a boot fitter atLD Mountain Centrein Newcastle upon Tyne, most boots should be pretty comfortable straight out of the box. If yours aren’t, it could point to a problem with the fit. The good news is that it may just be a case of wearing them on shorter walks at first and gradually building the distance. Failing that, the shop you bought them from might be able to help.“Most modern synthetic boots shouldn’t really need breaking in, but if your leather boots are nipping somewhere, the shop you bought them from can use a rubbing bar [a boot-fitting tool for reshaping leather footwear] to stretch the problem area out slightly,” Peter says. “Chances are, these things sort themselves out over time anyway, but using the rubbing bar can speed up the break-in process.”In Peter’s view, prevention is better than cure, which is why trying on boots is such an important part of the process. “I always give the customer at least three boots to try after assessing their foot shape and volume,” he says. “We then pick the best fit out of those.”He also points out that most good boot shops will give you the option to wear your boots around the house for a few weeks and return them if they’re not quite right.What to do with worn-out, old bootsYou can practise rigorous boot care, following all of the tips above, but if you use your boots the way they’re supposed to be used, they will eventually wear out. When that happens, you have a few options.DonateIf there’s some life left in your boots, you might be able to take them to a charity shop or a shoe bank. Just be mindful that these types of places waste lots of time disposing of items that aren’t fit for sale, so don’t donate if the boots are dropping to bits.RepurposeYour old boots might not be fit for hiking any more, but could you extend their life by using them in the garden or for walking the dog instead?RepairIf you have leather boots and the sole has worn out, there’s a chance you may be able to have them repaired. Resoling is a common service offered by most cobblers, and you can find ones that will be used to dealing with walking boots by searching theVibram website.RecycleSome outdoor retailers and brands run recycling programmes where they take old kit, including boots, and rehome or repurpose them.Cotswold Outdoorgoes as far as to put recycling points in many of its stores. If the boots are wearable or repairable, they’ll be given a second life with one of many participating charities around the world. If they’re completely done, they’ll be stripped down and used for their materials instead.For more:How to look after your walking boots, according to expertsThe best hiking essentialsThe best men’s waterproof jackets to get outdoors whatever the weatherPaddy Maddison is aconsumer journalist, outerwear enthusiast and exercise addict.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.No? If the “Great Chieftan o’ the Puddin-race” were that delicious, we’d all be eating it all the time, surely? And yet Burns’Address to a Haggisis enticing enough to dispel any such doubts justoncea year. I especially like the bit about slitting it open so the bright entrails spill out: “And then, O what a glorious sight / Warm-reekin, rich!”The poem is, really, an argument against culinary snobbery, and in favour of a sensuous appreciation of the here and now. So it’s strange how, when it comes to scotch whisky – the traditional accompaniment to Burns Night feasting – something approaching the opposite attitude prevails. It wasn’t so long ago that single malt scotch – “as noble a product of Scotland as any burgundy or champagne is of France,” asthe Highlands writer Neil Gunnhad it – was, like haggis, little appreciated outside Scotland. However, over the past few decades, the style has rebounded so successfully that single malt (that is, whisky produced from malted barley in one distillery) is almost a luxury marque in itself. When Tom Hiddleston’s agent poses as a sleazy investor inThe Night Manager,this is the drink he demands. Distilleries such as theMacallanhave meanwhile leaned into the premium market with fashion collabs and elaborate packaging. Prices have inflated. Snobbery, too. And, along the way, a certain Burnsian gusto has been lost.Happily, a counter-trend is taking root, towards making Scotch fun and, dare I say it, affordable again. If you’re interested in liquid as opposed to label, I’d recommend seeking out independent bottlers – smaller operators who buy up casks from distilleries and age them in their own warehouses (with a bit of judicious Googling, it’s not so hard to figure out which prestigious distillery the liquidactuallycomes from, either). Indeed, it was these independent bottlers who helped create the demand for single malts in the days when distilleries mostly concentrated on blends.Then again, what’s wrong with blended whisky? For most of the 20th century, the most revered whiskies were blends of grain and malt from all corners of Scotland. The American John Glaser helped to revive interest in the category with hisCompass Box brand, newly available in Waitrose, and one of its early releases was pointedly calledThis Is Not a Luxury Whisky. Even more pointedly, Compass Box published the full recipe online, incurring the wrath ofthe Scotch Whisky Associationin the process.The point is, Scotch is a wonderful thing upon which “to deliberate thoughtfully”, as Gunn had it. But it’s also pretty fun just necking it with mates, lobbing it into a shaker or, my personal fave, mixing it with coconut water (try it!). There’s plenty to keep you going, all year round.Four great modern scotchesCompass Box Orchard House£42 (700ml) Waitrose, 46%. A cheerful whisky!

The fresher it is, the better, so don’t keep the syrup for longer than two days. I’m pretty particular about citrus shelf life, too, so always squeeze it fresh and never keep it overnight or, heaven forbid, even longer.BumblebeeServes1For the honey and ginger syrup20g gingerAbout 40ml English honey– ideally one that’s local to youFor the drink10ml honey and ginger syrup– see above and method20ml fresh lemon juice40ml London dry gin– we useHayman’s1 thick slice lemon(about ½cm thick), to garnishFirst make the syrup. Soak the ginger in just enough cold water to cover (this softens the skin and makes it easier to peel), then drain, peel with a teaspoon and slice into fairly thin coins. Blend with 20ml water, then strain through a fine sieve, ideally lined with muslin. Measure the resulting ginger liquid (you should end up with about 40ml), then add equal parts honey and stir to dissolve.To build the drink, put the syrup and lemon juice in a shaker half-filled with ice, add the gin and shake as hard as you can.

True to its origins, my version uses salted butter, with an added pinch of flaky salt to sharpen the flavour. It also takes a small detour from tradition: a slick of marmalade brings a fragrant bitterness, while a handful of ground almonds softens the overall richness and lends a tender crumb. The result is still buttery and luxurious, but with a brighter, more aromatic edge.Breton butter cake with marmaladeBrief stints in the freezer help firm up the dough between layers, making it easier to spread the marmalade without disturbing the base.Prep5 minCook1 hr 15 minFreeze30 minServes10-12For the butter cake180g room-temperature salted butter, plus extra for greasing150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orangeSeeds from ½ vanilla bean pod4 large egg yolks200g plain flour60g ground almonds½ tsp flaky sea salt160g marmaladeFor the glaze1 egg yolk1 tsp milk or creamA pinch of saltGrease the base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin with a removable base. Put the butter, sugar, orange zest and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with the paddle on medium speed for about two minutes, until creamy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating to incorporate each one fully before adding the next.Sift the flour into a small bowl, then stir in the ground almonds and salt. With the mixer on low, add these dry ingredients in three or four instalments to the wet ingredients in the mixer until it comes together into a dough that’s somewhere between a cake batter and cookie dough.Spread half the dough (about 300g) evenly over the base of the cake tin (a small offset spatula would be useful here), then freeze for 15 minutes, or until just firm.Dollop the marmalade on top of the frozen dough, then spread it out into an even layer, leaving a 1cm border all around. Freeze again for 15 minutes, then carefully place spoonfuls of the remaining batter on top. Spread these out into an even layer that completely covers the marmalade, then put in the fridge.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. When the oven is at temperature, make the glaze. Beat the egg yolk, milk (or cream) and salt in a small bowl, then brush evenly over the top of the cake. Score a cross-hatch pattern on top by dragging a fork across the surface: start with three sets of parallel lines, then rotate the tin slightly and repeat.Bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown and shiny on top. Transfer to a rack to cool, then release the cake from the tin. Cut into small slices and serve with strong coffee.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodFrench food and drinkDessertBakingFruitEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

But everything she hands over is dwarfed by the £400-plus of interest that is added to her debt every month, thanks to rates that have been as high as 8%.Her total outstanding debt had ballooned to more than £77,000 by the end of November, and it is set to get a lot bigger as there are another 25 years left of the 30-year repayment period.Lambert does not think her studies should have been free, but she says: “It is so disheartening to have this level of debt hanging over you with no achievable way to clear it or even reduce it while they add on upwards of £400 a month in interest.”If MPs are barely making a dent in their student loan debt after six years of repayments, what chance do other graduates have?Nadia Whittome MPShe was particularly unlucky because from 2017 to 2020 – the three years she was at university – there was little financial help available for nursing students. NHS bursaries, which covered tuition fees and some living costs and were worth up to £16,454 a year, wereaxed in August 2017, just weeks before she started her course. It was not until September 2020, after she had graduated, that the government introduced a partial replacement in the form ofa grant worth at least £5,000 a yearto help with living costs.Lambert is one of millions of graduates who have a plan 2 student loan. They include the 29-year-old Labour MP Nadia Whittome, who this monthposted on Instagramthat she had left university in 2019 with £49,600 of debt and then a few months later became an MP, giving her a salary “that puts me in the top 5% in the country”. Six years on, her repayments have shaved just £1,000 off that debt. “If MPs are barely making a dent in their student loan debt after six years of repayments, what chance do other graduates have?” she said.View image in fullscreenLabour’s Nadia Whittome addresses fellow MPs during a Commons debate.Photograph: Parliament TVIn last year’s budget Rachel Reeves turned the screw even further on people such as Lambert. The chancellor froze the salary threshold for plan 2 loan repayments for three years – which means borrowers will have to pay even more towards their student loans as they benefit from pay rises.The move has fuelled fresh calls for student loan debt to be rebranded as a graduate tax. It certainly works like one: graduates simply pay 9% of everything they earn over the threshold, regardless of how much they owe, and it is collected through the payroll, just like income tax. Crucially, the loans are written off after 30 years, and most plan 2 borrowers will never repay their loans in full.The basicsStudent finance is made up of a tuition fee loan, which covers course fees and is paid directly to the university, and a maintenance loan, which is designed to help with costs such as rent and food.Both need to be paid back, and interest is added to the balance each month from the moment the first payment is made to the student and/or their university, until the loan has been repaid in full or written off.When someone starts repaying their student finance and how much they pay depend on which repayment plan they are on (they don’t choose). There are five plans for UK borrowers, each of which works in a different way.View image in fullscreenStudents are graduating with huge debts and have to repay 9% of everything they earn over a threshold – now at £28,470 a year.Photograph: Simon Hadley/AlamyPlan 2 loans such as Lambert’s were taken out by students from England who started university between September 2012 and July 2023, and students from Wales who have started since September 2012.Graduates have to repay 9% of everything they earn over a threshold – now £28,470 a year. So if someone is earning £38,470, their annual repayment is now £900.The interest rate on plan 2 loans is linked to the RPI rate of inflation and can vary from month to month: in August 2024 it hit 8%. The loans are written off 30 years after you were first due to start making repayments, which is the April after you leave university. The debt is wiped even if you haven’t paid anything.How the debt growsLambert, 33, attended Edinburgh Napier University, and took out a tuition fee loan and a maintenance loan from the Student Loans Company. Although she studied and now works in Scotland – in a high dependency unit within NHS Highland – she was born in England and living there when she applied.She borrowed a total of £57,958, and interest began to be added to the first loans in September 2017. During her time at university, her debt accrued interest at between 5.4% and 6.3%.She qualified in 2020 during the pandemic, graduated early and set to work in a Covid ward in Edinburgh. In May 2021, she made her first repayment. Between then and the end of March 2025, she repaid just under £4,000; over the same period £15,176 was added in interest. By April 2022, her debt had risen to £66,648, and by the end of November 2025 it had hit £77,359.Her monthly repayments vary because her earnings depend on whether she has worked weekends or night shifts or done overtime. During 2024-25, the repayments deducted from her pay ranged from £78 to £263. Meanwhile, the interest added each month has sometimes been as high as £488.View image in fullscreenA graduate tax is gaining in popularity, increasingly seen as a fairer way to repay student finance.Photograph: Chris Ison/PA“My student loan is not ‘bad debt’ – it would not go against me if I apply for financial loans etc,” she says. “It will also be wiped after 30 years regardless of the remaining balance, which I will never clear, but … each month I’m forced to pay a sizeable sum to a pointless debt.“My payments don’t go against the principal balance – they are not even making a mark on the interest accrued.”Lambert’s outstanding debt will be a lot higher than that of many students who received an NHS bursary or benefited from the supportintroduced in September 2020, which does not need to be paid back.There were calls from unions and politicians for those who missed out to receive backdated funding or a reduction in their loan repayments, but ministers ruled this out and it is understood this is no longer a live campaigning issue.“I find it outrageous that students of the 2017-20 cohort were not reimbursed,” says Lambert, who has not given up hope that the government might have a rethink.She agrees with the idea of rebranding student loan debt as a graduate tax, and adds: “I don’t know anyone in my situation who is ever going to be able to pay that sort of sum off.”The budget changesThe salary threshold at which repayments kick inwill riseto £29,385 in April.Normally it would have been expected to then rise again each year. However, Reeves announced it will stay frozen at that level until 2030.Freezing the threshold as wages go up means more people will have to start repaying their loans as the amount they are earning goes over the limit. Those already over the threshold who get pay rises will have to repay 9% of a bigger chunk of their earnings.What can those in this situation do?Managing the debtMany, like Lambert, are bothered by this huge debt hanging over them.Some might assume that if they have spare cash, they should make extra payments to shrink the debt and clear the loan early. But experts suggest that for most, overpaying is not a good idea.Save the Student, a student money website, says that unlike most other types of debt, “it’s not always the best idea to make extra repayments … It’s unlikely you’ll repay your loan in full before it is cancelled, so making the extra repayments just means you’ll be paying back more than you need to in the long run”.View image in fullscreenThe interest rate on plan 2 loans is linked to the RPI rate of inflation, which can vary from month to month: in August 2024 it hit 8%.Photograph: Sam Oaksey/AlamySave the Student and the MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis say that pretty much the only plan 2 people who should be overpaying their student loan debt are very high earners and those with very strong salary prospects ahead of them.Lewis’s MoneySavingExpert.com website has astudent loan calculatorthat plan 2 people can use to get an idea of whether they are likely to be in this category.“If you have the qualifications and drive to pursue a very high-paying career, paying off your loan early could save you money (as the interest will have less time to accrue),” says Save the Student.If your earnings are near the threshold it is worth checking if you are due a refund. You will make a repayment via your pay if your income goes over the weekly or monthly threshold for your plan – which might happen if you work extra shifts or receive a bonus. For plan 2 loans, these thresholds are now £547 and £2,372 respectively.However, you can ask for the money back at the end of the tax year if your annual income comes to less than the yearly threshold.In 2024-25,643,000 people with a plan 2 loanwere entitled to request a refund of the overpayment(s).‘Fair choices’Guardian Money asked the Department for Education about people in Lambert’s situation. It says: “This government is making fair choices to make sure the student finance system is sustainable – protecting taxpayers and students.“We’re raising the plan 2 student loan repayment threshold for the next academic year, meaning a graduate earning £30,000 would repay only about £4 a month in 2027–28.“The freeze will not impact anyone who started their course after August 2023, and lower-earning graduates will continue to be protected, with loans and interest written off after 30 years.”Explore more on these topicsStudent financeBorrowing & debtStudentsHigher educationUniversitiesTuition feesTax and spendingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These include one-year fixed-rate savings bonds paying up to 4.35% and an easy-access account with a rate of 4.5%.The impact of the Bank of England’s pre-Christmas interest rate cut – the sixth reduction since August 2024 – has been making itself felt, with reductions to rates on many savings accounts. But some best-buy savings rates have arguably held up better than one might have expected.“January is the ideal time for savers to set new financial goals and check if their savings are working as hard as they can,” says Caitlyn Eastell at the financial data provider Moneyfacts.The news this week that UK inflation rose by slightly more than expected in December has pros and cons for savers. It prompted many experts to all but rule out another interest rate cut when the Bank of England’s rate-setting committee next meets on 5 February. If the next interest rate cut is pushed back, that could slow the pace at which top savings rates disappear. But the tradeoff is that higher inflation erodes the real value of the returns that savers receive, says Alice Haine at the investment platform Bestinvest.This week there were more than 1,400 savings accounts offering rates that beat inflation, about half of which were fixed-rate bonds.A fixed-rate bond is a product that can offer people “peace of mind” by allowing them to lock in at today’s rates before they fall, says Harriet Guevara at Nottingham building society.However, you need to move quickly to grab the best offers: on Wednesday this week, the top rate on a one-year fixed-rate bond was the 4.55% offered by Marcus, a banking brand operated by Goldman Sachs. But by Thursday morning that deal had been withdrawn after MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis highlighted it, resulting in a flood of applications. “It is crucial that savers are fast to react to attractive deals, otherwise they face missing out,” says Eastell.At the time of writing, the top-paying one-year fixed-rate bond was an account paying 4.35% on £1,000-plus offered by the savings and investment brand Meteor in conjunction with OakNorth Bank. Other best-buy one-year fixed-rate bonds included one from Shawbrook Bank paying 4.27%, and another from OakNorth Bank offering 4.23%.Some savers may prefer to lock their money away for two years, on the basis that they will then be protected from any future rate cuts for longer. This week there were plenty of two-year bonds from the likes of Shawbrook Bank, Investec and Atom Bank paying more than 4.1%. Keep a close eye on the best-buy tables atMoneyfactscompare.co.uk. For those who want to get their hands on their money, there are a number of easy-access savings accounts paying more than 4%.Chase (the UK retail arm of the US bank JP Morgan) has one available to new banking customers called Chase Saver that pays 4.5%, although that rate is boosted by a 2.25% bonus that lasts for 12 months (the account’s standard rate is 2.25%). That rate is available during the first 31 days of being a new Chase current account customer.Haine says: “Those hoping to preserve returns on cash held in bank and building society savings would be wise to seek out the most competitive deals sooner rather than later.”Explore more on these topicsSavings ratesSavingsBanks and building societiesBankingnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s Stephen. And here they all come to chat a load of bollocks.” So said Jessie Roux all the way back in episode four, spewing truth bombs while wearing sweetcorn-yellow eyeshadow. Yet here we are – as I write this, on the day of the final – with Stephen Libby still masquerading as a Faithful, looking th’innocent flower but being the serpent under’t, as per Lady Macbeth’s advice.But it hasn’t been for want of Jessie trying – the 28-year-old has been a fan favourite on the latest season ofThe Traitorsfor smarts like these, but also for her bright and mismatched makeup. Often yellow and red, like Rupert the Bear’s outfit or the Lego logo, the shades are what Little Greene paint company calls exclamatory things such as Trumpet and Heat.Seen through the prism of received makeup wisdom –au naturel, barely there, “no-makeup makeup” inspired by abare-faced Pamela Anderson– it doesn’t sound appealing, but that just shows what we know. Because it looks brilliant: quirky, offbeat, resplendent, lively. An antidote to the idea that makeup should be discreet, it grabs the attention like a shield in a task. It’s been a joyful shot of warmth during the past few weeks – like a dram of whisky – amid all the backstabbing and drizzle on our screens. Not to mention emboldening for anyone stuck in a smoky-eye rut.View image in fullscreenMismatched eyes … Jessie Roux.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Euan Cherry/PACould Jessie’s makeup have played a role in her wisdom being ignored, via the unconscious bias of the other players? Standing out isn’t always the best tactic on The Traitors, after all. She says she “did wonder if I should tone it down” for her time on screen: “I didn’t know if people would question whether I was being genuine or if it was an act to try to look more ‘trustworthy’. But I felt it was important to stay true to myself, and I love expressing myself through makeup.”Plus, she says, “because of my stammer, it can sometimes be hard to express myself, so it’s a comfort to have my bright makeup and clothes to show who I really am.”Jessie has, she says, always liked to wear bright makeup, “but it probably became more of an everyday thing around lockdown because I was at home every day and could experiment more”. Her inspiration? She namechecks America’s Next Top Model, which she watched growing up, “and I was always inspired by the different makeup for different photoshoots” – as well as the musician La Roux and the hairdresser Sophia Hilton.View image in fullscreenA model made up by Aoife Cullen.Photograph: Aoife CullenOn TikTok, users have beenapplying shades of marigold orange and canary yellowto their eyes in her honour,using metallics in prosecco shadeson eyelids and under-eyes in videos about how to get the Jessie look, and“channelling their inner Jessie”with mismatched eyeshadow.“I noticed Jessie’s makeup immediately. I think it’s hard not to,” says makeup artistAoife Cullen, who describes her own makeup style as “futuristic, kind of alien-esque and kind of retro”. “To the knowing eye, Jessie is obviously someone who really enjoys beauty; isn’t afraid to subvert beauty standards and wear something that people would typically deem to be unattractive or not flattering,” says Cullen.Jessie isn’t alone in wearing noteworthy makeup in the castle’s wings. Traitors host Claudia Winkleman has made an icon of herself via operatic amounts of kohl (and her omnipotent fringe, of course).View image in fullscreenChancellor of kohl … Claudia Winkleman.Photograph: Matt Burlem/BBC/Studio Lambert/CodyBurridge“It’s certainly something of an antidote to the ‘clean girl’ look that’s prevalent at the moment,” saysLucy Gibson, Winkleman’s makeup artiston the show. “But that’s never been deliberate. Makeup trends come and go, but when someone finds their own style and commits to it, it becomes timeless and noticeable in a way that trends aren’t.”Cullen – and, in her own way, Jessie – are part of a movement on TikTok that has been reclaiming so-called “ugly make-up”.

In a series titledWeird Lip Combosshe decorates lips with combinations more typically found on abird of paradisethan a human mouth: in one a classic pillar-box red is upended by a sky blue; in another a candyfloss pink with a sickly lime green.Generally, says Gibson, she’s starting to see “a real swing back towards colour, character and individuality in makeup”. It has, she says, “been a dialogue among makeup artists on social media recently, and that’s exciting to see!”So, for those of us religiously applying black mascara (if any at all), how do we start pushing the needle?“The best way to start is change the colour of your mascara,” says Cullen. “If you wear black or brown, maybe pivot to a plum. Then you could go to maybe a dark green … it’s not a complete jump to something really alien to you, it’s still pretty safe and comfortable.” Before you know it, she says, “you don’t care any more and you’re ready for blue eyeliner”.From the Met Gala to your Instagram feed: how ugly beauty took over fashionRead moreOn the lid, “stick with the traditional shape of a smoky eye or the kind of colour that you’re comfortable with,” she says, “and then move into adding shimmer or sparkle or, like, a little bit of something that is a different colour, just to wash a colour over the eye as opposed to going straight to one block colour.” Adding a little bit at a time is an ideal way to be more comfortable with it.Then, “once you find what colour looks great on you, you can go to the most extreme version of it”.Naturally, a lot of it is more about the ’tude than the actual eyeliner or lipgloss. Winkleman is a great example. “When it comes to her look, Claudia simply doesn’t take other people’s opinions too seriously,” says Gibson. “She knows what she likes, she owns it, and she’s not swayed by external noise.”Jessie is on board: “If you love colour, then go for it,” she says. “It’s always better to be yourself than to follow the crowd.”Explore more on these topicsMakeupBeautyThe TraitorsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Called Fiesta, it was a strapless gown decorated with roses across a full skirt. He was famously inspired by the sight of an older woman at the opera wearing a red dress, and how she stood out from the crowd.Valentino: his life and career in picturesRead moreIt was this impact that arguably made the designer continue to use the colour throughout his career, says Alistair O’Neill, the curator of Somerset House’sValentino: Master of Coutureexhibition in 2012. But, as images of women wearing Valentino’s dresses attest, the specific shade mattered: scarlet, with a hint of blue.“It’s a tone that works across a range of skin colours and it makes nearly all women look great,” says O’Neill. “I think that’s because it’s a very pure and clean colour but it has a luminosity about it.”Charlie Porter, a fashion writer who worked onValentino Rosso, a 2022 coffee table book about the colour, notes that Valentino developed his colour before Pantone began systemising colours in the early 60s.“[Now] if you say the number on the Pantone chart, a graphic designer in Tokyo can design with the same colour as someone in Los Angeles,” he says. “[Valentino’s] red is a red with real sensitivity and depth and human feeling because it’s before this time of ‘let’s choose a red’, mechanical colour.”View image in fullscreenThe front cover of Vogue Italia’s Valentino tribute issue.Photograph: Vogue ItaliaFor Vogue Italia’scover, the magazine’s head of content, Francesca Ragazzi, says the team worked with Valentino’s foundation to identify the Pantone shade closest to Valentino red – settling on2347Cbecause it was “the most vibrant, it best expresses a sense of light”.Italy – and Rome – were, says Porter, central to the creation of the shade. “There’s location to colour, which we don’t think about so much now,” he says. “[But] the way the sun sits in the sky or the tilt of the Earth makes colour be seen in different ways.”If Valentino red is of its time and inseparable from its creator, it also sits within a broader resurgence of red in fashion. The“unexpected red theory”, which first gained traction in interiors, has spilled into wardrobes, with red scarves – notablya foulard by the British brand & Daughter– becoming a familiar sight at fashion weeks.Kassia St Clair, the author of the 2016 colour historyThe Secret Lives of Colour, says red clothing, which was originally produced using expensive dyes, has long been a symbol of luxury, worn by kings, the military and senior figures in the church.“It really has said the same things – power, wealth, status – for as long as we know,” she says. There may also, be a biological dimension. “It’s really difficult to disentangle what is our cultural conditioning and what is natural human reaction. [But] of all the testing that gets done, there’s the most interesting evidence for red having some kind of impact on us.”View image in fullscreenAnna Wintour at the funeral in Rome.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersFor Valentino, red also became deeply personal. “When he designed the Fiesta dress, he decided that he wanted to have a red dress in every collection that he produced. It was a lucky symbol for him,” says O’Neill.Sixty-seven years after Fiesta, Valentino red remains a defining part of the designer’s legacy. “Legacy means leaving something to the world, and it is extraordinary that Valentino was able to leave a colour as a universal language, one that will remain for ever in the global imagination,” says Ragazzi.View image in fullscreenDonatella Versace (left) and the designer Pierpaolo Piccioli in Rome on the day before the funeral.Photograph: Yara Nardi/ReutersNot everyone is convinced Valentino and red will remain so closely intertwined in the years to come, however. Porter argues there is a more contemporary reference that many associate with Valentino – one not designed by him at all.“In the public imagination right now, the biggest talking point about Valentino is the [2010] Rockstud shoes thatshould or should not be worn in The Devil Wears Prada 2,” he says. “I think when someone passes, then we can enter into a eulogising world of ‘it’s changed something for ever’. I don’t think it has, actually.”St Clair also disputes the idea that red will now become more popular because of renewed relevance, arguing this is a colour that does not need new associations. “Valentino has a very specific place in our time, and is huge for our time,” she says. “But red transcends that.”Explore more on these topicsFashionItalyFashion industryWomen's dressesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Sign up hereCharlie TeasdaleFri 23 Jan 2026 02.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 09.56 ESTShareLast spring, Tom Broughton, founder of eyewear brand Cubitts, was asked to comment on a meme that was going viral, that featured a pair of his company’s ‘Plimsoll’ frames. The small, delicate, and slightly round unisex shape had been worn by British actor, Jonathan Bailey, in leaked stills from the 2025 movie, Jurassic World Rebirth – and had been dubbed by the internet as a pair of‘slutty little glasses’.“It all just blew up,” remembers Broughton, noting how the brand struggled to deal with the sudden demand for what had become the sexiest specs on the market. A subsequent capsule collection, made in partnership with Bailey’s LGBTQ+ charity theShameless Fund, sold out almost instantly, too. Thousands of pairs were gone in minutes, and after multiple restocks, “we’re maybe down to our last 15 pairs,” adds Broughton. Nearly the entire run was bought by men.The extremely-online among you will remember those glasses, and have likely moved on with your lives. However, it seems they weren’t a phenomenon, but a harbinger; a new era of delicate, performatively bookish men’s eyewear is just getting started.All across pop culture there are cute guys, in even cuter specs. Those same Cubitt’s frames popped up in the cinema again recently, worn by Glen Powell in Edgar Wright’s remake ofThe Running Man. And in the new series of The Night Manager, Tom Hiddleston goes all Clark Kent, removing his neat,Mykita Mylon Tritonframes when he steps out from behind a desk and into the field, as if they were a plot device in themselves.Even The Traitors has its own bespectacled hunk in the form ofStephen Libby. He took to Instagram last week to explain how his perfectly circular lunettes are in fact a family heirloom that he fitted with his own prescription.And then there’sMarty Supreme. Over the past couple of months it has been almost impossible to avoid the coverage of Timothée Chalamet’s titular protagonist, and in almost every image, he’s wearing teeny tiny, rimless glasses, their soft beveled curves offset by the most perpendicular jawline in Hollywood.Broughton suggests that this burgeoning era of men’s statement eyewear has been coming for some time. “Five years ago, everyone wanted to buy the same ‘Panto’ shape [a flat-topped, rounded frame with a keyhole bridge],” he says. “It played into that whole mid-Century, Gregory Peck thing.”View image in fullscreenTinted cool … Jacob Elordi brings it at the Golden Globes.Photograph: Monica Schipper/Getty ImagesGlasses are even popping up in fashion itself. On the recent catwalks of Paul Smith and Prada, models wore specs (sunglasses are a common sight, spectacles not so much). This year’s awards season has been awash with tinted lenses – eyewear which sits somewhere between sunglasses and opticals – as an accessory to slick tailoring, most notably onJacob Elordiand Michael B Jordan at the Golden Globes. In case you aren’t au fait, a standard pair of sunglasses might feature an 85% tint, but these are more like 40%, or even less, so the wearer’s eyeline is readily on show.Today’s market is “bifurcated” between oversized, almost “cartoonish” acetate frames, and a “super slim, almost-not-there vibe”, Broughton adds, noting that low-key frames are on the wane, and that this new drive for statement eyewear may be down to our collective increase in on-screen time. “Being in a post Covid world with us all still on Zoom calls definitely plays into it,” he says. “People realise that their haircut, makeup and glasses are increasingly important.”Jonathan Bailey, it turns out, doesn’t even need glasses. In an interview with GQ, he said that he has 20/20 vision and faked an eye test as a kid to get his first pair. And Timothée Chalamet doesn’t need them either (however, director Josh Safdie says he asked him to wear -10 contacts under the +10 spectacles for added ocular authenticity), so why should capable vision serve as a hurdle for style? It isn’t a problem for about 15% of Cubitt’s customers, says Broughton.View image in fullscreenChannelling sexy professor … Jonathan Bailey as palaeontologist Dr. Henry Loomis in Jurassic World: Rebirth.Photograph: Universal Pictures/Amblin EntertainmentI am a spectacles wearer, and have been accused of wearing prescription-less lenses in the past. I can proudly attest that I am in fact shortsighted, but only just. And I would be lying if I said I wasn’t happy when the optician first told me I was in need of glasses, even if it was just for driving at night and trips to the cinema.In the same way that even the dopiest sunglasses make you somehow feel (and look) slightly cooler, just by virtue of hiding your eyes, there is something elevating about a pair of spectacles. Aesthetically, they can frame your face, accentuate your eyes, and serve as a kind of finishing touch to an outfit. But the right frames can also make you look more put together, and somehow more … capable.“A lot of men wear limited jewellery, some men don’t wear a watch,” says stylistTom O’Dell, “and so sometimes eyewear can either soften a look, add a new dimension or touch of colour to an outfit, or just be something of interest.”But I almost feel like I need my glasses – a pair of Panto frames byFinlay– as some kind of social crutch. They’ve become little windows I can hide behind when I’m out in the world. And it seems I’m not alone. “An actor I work with said that sometimes, when in the public eye, a pair of tinted glasses acts as a barrier between you and the public,” adds O’Dell. It gives you a little bit of distance, without a full pair of sunglasses.”O’Dell thinks tinted glasses can lend a look of “gravitas”, whereas Broughton suggests they might just serve as a handy excuse to wear sunglasses inside. Either way, it’s an improvement. I can’t say I’ve ever had to shield myself from the glare of the clamouring masses, but I can understand that desire for a sense of detachment.To read the complete version of this newsletter – complete with this week’s trending topics in The Measure –subscribe to receive Fashion Statementin your inbox every Thursday.Explore more on these topicsFashionFashion Statement newsletterAccessoriesMen's fashionMarty SupremeJacob ElordiJonathan BaileyGlen PowellnewslettersShareReuse this content"

I’d been running on always-on mode, and that climb forces you to slow down and breathe properly. From the Coppermines valley up to the ridge, then along the rocky summit and back via Goat’s Water, it’s rugged without being showy. The weather kept the crowds away, and the low cloud made the tarn feel like a secret. I came home muddy, soaked and weirdly calm, and started making space for long walks again.Brandon KindellI binned the car after cycling in ItalyView image in fullscreenThe baptistry in the Piazza dei Miracoli, Pisa.Photograph: Lorenzo Bovi/AlamyA couple of years ago, after turning 60 and retiring, I invested in a simple but nice bicycle, and participated in a “silver Giro d’Italia”, organised by a cycling club in Milan. I met like-minded people from all over Europe and we followed our own mini tour – starting from Milan’s cathedral down to Pisa, ending with a route along the coast and around the famous tower. We stopped at wonderful trattorias along the way for pasta-fuelled lunches and slept in simple hotels. The experience motivated me to sell my car and use my bike to get around – it’s been a brilliant move. I am fitter and better off. I’ve done a favour to myself and the environment.BillVolunteering raised my horizonsView image in fullscreenVolunteering in the UK countryside.Photograph: SolStock/Getty ImagesThe British Trust for Conservation Volunteers (BTCV) ran very popular working holidays doing environmental conservation in the 1980s – hedge-laying, walling, scrub-bashing in the UK and exciting wildlife adventures such as tracking wolves in Slovakia. Volunteers ranged from teenagers to pensioners, some employed and some signing on every week. My first experience was building a footbridge and hanging some farm gates in a remote part of Devon. We slept on the floor of the local village hall, cooked our own meals and had a shower in a sports centre midweek. Teamwork and friendship blossomed over the week and I exceeded my wildest expectations of what could be achieved with largely unskilled honest labour. BTCV changed its name to the Community Volunteers in 2012 and I continue to volunteer with a local group that is a member ofTCV’s community network, still getting scratched and sore but revelling in the company and continually amazed by what gets done.MartinProfileReaders' tips: send a tip for a chance to win a £200 voucher for a Coolstays breakShowGuardian Travel readers' tipsEvery week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The wind increased and the waves got higher. The skipper stayed below with severe sea sickness until dawn. The seas got bigger and then I was looking up at them breaking over me while I steered alone by the compass. I tied myself in the open cockpit with two ropes. At last there ahead was the Southwold lighthouse flashing a welcome beam. My adventure had included fear and uncertainty. But learning some tenacity and perseverance was a life-changing experience.David Innes-WilkinAlpine yoga and hikes in AustriaView image in fullscreenA mountain retreat in MoaAlm.Photograph: MoaAlm Mountain RetreatDesperate for an exciting winter break we ended up choosing MoaAlm near Kals am Großglockner in Austria. Beyond MoaAlm’s superb vegan food we discovered authentic Austrian warmth as locals greeted us in their villages. Sophie’s yoga classes transformed our practice, especially sun salutations as dawn light flooded the mountain-view studio. I had one of the best mountain hikes of my life climbing to the snowfields and culminating in views across to the distant Dolomites. For my wife, it was a chance to rediscover her love of skiing with one on one tuition. The holiday was withWeareactive.AdamHospitality and kindness in FlorenceView image in fullscreenA language-learning stay in Florence proved rejuvenating for our reader Alison.Photograph: Suttipong Sutiratanachai/Getty ImagesThe Florentine night sky exploded with noise and colour, as I celebrated the San Giovanni festival in June with hundreds of excited locals. After a bereavement, I booked a three-week Italian language course throughApple Language Courses, opting to stay with a local host family. During that time, I immersed myself in learning the enchanting language, spending my free time admiring Botticellis at theUffizi, daydreaming by the River Arno with its terracotta reflections, consuming my body weight in gelati and experiencing some sorely needed Florentine hospitality and kindness. I returned from my Italian adventure with my heart soothed and something that money cannot buy … hope.Alison NChildren’s joy on a road trip in FranceView image in fullscreenOur reader Clare enjoyed a road trip around the Loire valley.Photograph: Ryhor Bruyeu/AlamyOur first road trip as a family ignited a love of France and travel in our sons. A drive to the Loire valley, via an exciting ferry crossing, and a wildflower meadow in which to eat our picnic and stretch our legs. Then there was the wonder of our “tiny” house (a mobile home on a campsite). There was daily swimming, endless seafood and pain au chocolat. We planned and executed it on an absolute shoestring but realising that the smaller parts of travel, which as adults we take for granted, can be awe-inspiring for children was our biggest and most valuable lesson.ClareScandinavia with my daughterView image in fullscreenCafe society in Gothenburg.Photograph: Ian G Dagnall/AlamyI travelled to Scandinavia with my adult daughter on a backpacking trip and came home changed. In Stockholm the Abba Experience turned singing badly into pure joy. In Gothenburg we slowed down and did some vintage shopping, enjoyed the green spaces and had some long cafe stops, which created space for real conversation. In Copenhagen we walked everywhere – from the lights of Tivoli Gardens to the cool Meat-Packing district, the city rewards curiosity. Travelling with my daughter stripped away old roles and reminded me the best journeys aren’t just defined by where you go, but by who you travel with. Ask someone you love to come with you; it will make your trip unforgettable.Lindsay PartridgeSerenity in CroatiaView image in fullscreenSailing off the Croatian coast near Hvar.Photograph: Andrew Jenkins/AlamyMy sailing holiday in Croatia was truly serene, with breathtaking scenery at every turn. From crystal-clear waters to dramatic coastlines, every island felt beautiful in its own way. Exploring the islands revealed an incredible diversity of landscapes and atmospheres. The cities of Split and Dubrovnik were especially memorable, rich with history, charm and timeless beauty. Wandering their ancient streets and coastal views made the experience unforgettable and deeply inspiring.DebraBackpacking in Colombia taught me to improviseView image in fullscreenA squirrel monkey in Colombia.Photograph: Karin Pezo/AlamySometimes it’s things going wrong that change you most. I went backpacking through Latin America at 26, organised and needing everything to go to plan. In Mocoa, where the Colombian Amazon tangles with the Andes, thick jungle clings to steep green mountains, with monkeys calling from the canopy. I did not speak Spanish, had no phone signal and did not bring enough cash for the bus, but the kindness of strangers got me where I needed to be. I learned you don’t need to plan everything, and I sleep much better for it.SarahView image in fullscreenExplore more on these topicsHealth and fitness holidaysReaders' travel tipsTop 10sfeaturesShareReuse this content"

At first, seeing the gel on my stomach and the flickering black and white image on screen was familiar and soothing. Then I saw the look on the sonographer’s face.She dropped the probe and ran out of the room without a word. I tried not to panic, but by the time she sprinted back in with a doctor, who looked at the screen and said, “Oh my goodness”, I was terrified.I now live in California but I was born in Ukraine; English is my second language. I heard the words, “It looks like you have conjoined twins” but I didn’t understand what that meant. It was only later, when I got back to my car and looked up the word, that I fully understood what was going on.I called my husband, Anatoliy, sobbing. He promised to come home straight away. I began driving. I was a mess, swinging from feeling certain I’d need a termination, to denying this was happening at all. I felt as if I was going mad. Then, as I sat at a red light, I suddenly felt this sense of calm wash over me. It was like a sign from God.Anatoliy ran through our front door, looking worried but determined. These are our children and we love them already, he said as we hugged. I replied calmly that I had decided to simply take each day as it came.More than 200 medics prepared for my delivery. One twin would be looked after by ‘team orange’, the other by ‘team purple’View image in fullscreenAbigail, on the left, and Micaela when they were still conjoined.Photograph: Courtesy of Liliya BachinskayaAt the specialist clinic a few days later, doctors explained our girls were craniopagus twins, conjoined at the head. It is an incredibly rare condition, occurring in just one in every 2.5 million live births. I gripped Anatoliy’s hand as we heard that their chance of survival to delivery was slim. I thought about the babies I had seen on the screen and refused to give up hope.Despite constant medical appointments, I tried to live a normal life. My friends were amazed to see me meeting up for meals and celebrating at their baby showers. But that normality kept the fear at bay.Four months later, we had some good news. An MRI scan confirmed there was a decent chance the girls could be separated in the future. We were relieved but cautious, knowing there were still so many hurdles to go.More than 200 medics prepared for my delivery. One twin would be looked after by “team orange” and the other by “team purple”; each team would have neurologists, heart experts and plastic surgeons.My waters broke early. Being rushed to hospital was stressful. All I recall is asking people to pray for me, then the girls being whisked away to intensive care as I lay in a haze of medication.When I finally saw my daughters the next day, all I could think was: they’re perfect. We named them Abigail and Micaela. Holding them in my arms, I felt overwhelming love.Everything from changing nappies to breastfeeding required a combination of imagination and instinct – a standard bath wouldn’t work, so we used a clear plastic box – but to me, they were just my girls. They had different personalities. Abigail was alert, while Micaela was calm. Every milestone – the first smile, the first babble – felt precious.Finally, in October 2020, at 10 months old, they were ready to be separated, in a daunting 24-hour procedure involving 30 medics. ItExperience: My friend turned out to be my long-lost sisterRead morefelt endless, and because of Covid-19 we couldn’t wait in the hospital. We were texted updates at every step, and when we were told the operation had succeeded, I felt so relieved, I struggled to breathe.I sobbed with happiness as I ran into the hospital and saw them separated for the first time. They were able to turn around and look each other in the eye. It was a moment any other mother of two would have taken for granted – but to me, it felt like a miracle.That sense of wonder hasn’t faded, even as I watch six-year-old Abigail dash about and Micaela carefully follow behind. I hear their secret twin chatter, see how adored they are by their brothers, and wonder at their very existence.It was amazing when, at five, they could look at their own baby photos and understand that one girl was Micaela and the other Abigail.This journey has shown me a strength I didn’t know I had, and the power of not looking too far into the future. Today they are here, and that is enough for me.As told to Kate GrahamDo you have an experience to share?

Almost anything else, as it turned outSimon HattenstoneFri 23 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTShareThe Friendship Inn, PrestwichI adored pubs. They were my natural home. And now, thanks to my best friend, Ned, I’d got a job at the Friendship Inn in Prestwich. It was the mid-1980s, and I was in my early 20s, preparing for the first shift. What could be better than working in a pub called the Friendship alongside my bezzy? And I understood drink – you left Guinness to stand, aimed for half an inch of head on a pint of bitter, and if someone asked for water with a whisky you didn’t fill the glass. Easy-peasy.As soon as I got behind the bar I panicked. There were perhaps half a dozen people waiting to order, but it looked like a sea of thousands. The bar was particularly tricky because it was shaped like the bow of a ship. Every time I went to one side, customers started calling from the other. I couldn’t remember the faces. Nor the drinks they ordered. I took a funny turn. The faces became twisted, distorted, ghoulish, cackling manically or cursing my incompetence. I felt like Mia Farrow confronting the neighbours’ coven in Rosemary’s Baby, only thankfully I didn’t have a knife.I poured Guinness for people who had ordered a glass of red, Budweiser for those who wanted a Boddingtons. There wasn’t a thing I didn’t get wrong. And then I broke my first glass. The crowd staring at me got more Rosemary’s Baby by the second. My bitter was headless; my lager all head. I broke another glass. I was getting dizzy, struggling to breathe. My legs were collapsing.Simon Hattenstone (left), with his best friend Ned.Photograph: Courtesy of Simon HattenstoneAfter half an hour, the manager put me out of my misery. He told me that I wasn’t cut out for this line of work and he was going to have to let me go. No, he wasn’t going to pay me. Thankfully, he didn’t ask to be compensated for the broken glasses.By now my legs had completely gone. I was a snake of a man, slithering my way out of the bar. But the humiliation wasn’t complete. I couldn’t find the hatch to liberate me. I walked round and round in circles looking for my release. My mouth was dry and salted. No words came out. Eventually the manager lifted up the hatch for me and let me go.I couldn’t bear to tell my parents. Nor could I bear to talk to Ned about it. How could this have happened?Pubswere my natural home. And this one was called the Friendship.The shame doesn’t diminish with the years. And ever since, I’ve been in awe of skilled bar staff. I recently fessed up about my disgrace to Joyce, who runs the Lincoln Arms, my brilliant local in King’s Cross. She has promised to give me a few minutes behind the bar just to get it out of my system. Aversion therapy, 40 years on.Explore more on these topicsPubsThe pub that changed meGreater ManchesterfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The one that taught me so much, where I made compost for the first time and cut peonies from the bare roots I’d ordered as soon as we exchanged contracts on the place. Where I painted the back wall pink and strung up lights and held parties and watered the ground with cheap prosecco; where I planted a tree for my newborn son, and lay beneath it with him in languid, too-long summer afternoons, trying to make sense of motherhood.Anyway, every time I’d show estate agents around our two-bed flat, they’d conjure unconvincing compliments about our airing cupboard, before sticking their head cursorily out the back door and saying: “Oh, it’s winter, no gardens look good in winter, no buyers will be expecting it to look nice,” and I’d seethe.A bare-root plant looks like a twig, but what you lack in instant gratification you gain in economyI’d argue that there’s an essential beauty to a winter garden, but it’s true that some look more considered than others, and those tend to have some structure. Trees, hedges, evergreens. Now’s a good time to both assess how your space may benefit from those – because you can see the gaps that might look better with, say, a handsome yew hedge picking up the frost – and also plant them, as long as the ground isn’t rock-solid or completely boggy.You may have ambitions for a grand evergreen number that defines your garden year round, traditionally grown from yew or box – which these days arrives with understandable concern of box tree caterpillar and box blight – or something less formal that will blend into your bedding as the year turns, such as a hedge ofAmelanchier lamarckii, hydrangea or rose. Hornbeam and beech, meanwhile, are beautifully deciduous, marking the colder months with bright foliage.Now is the time to be bold and give your garden a reshuffleRead moreAll of them can be planted bare-root at this time of year. Bare-root plants are exactly what the name suggests: the bare root of a plant, no soil, no plastic pot. Yes, it looks like a twig, but what you lack in instant gratification you gain in economy – it’s far cheaper to plant bare-root than something that has been cosseted into leaf and flower. The plants tend to adjust better to their new surroundings in your garden, too.If you don’t want to commit fully to a hedge, it’s still a good time to build some structure into your garden with bare-root bargains. An idea stolen from Susanna Grant of Linda planting design is to add a “handful of rosa glauca, spindle, wild privet or hawthorn” to lacklustre tubs and containers in smaller gardens to boost height, texture and resources for wildlife. You’ll be amazed by how much they’ll have grown next year.Explore more on these topicsGardening adviceGardensPlantsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You could also have walked between two constituencies where More in Common ran focus groups with 2019 Conservative voters this week – Warrington South and Godalming and Ash. These are two seats that tell the story of the breadth and collapse of the Conservatives’ 2019 coalition.Warrington South, a north-west marginal that has flipped between Labour and the Conservatives, sits just outside the “red wall”. It voted leave in 2016, backed Johnson in 2019 and swung to Labour in 2024. Today, More in Common’s MRP (multi-level regression and post-stratification) modelling suggests it would be won comfortably byReform UK.Godalming and Ash, by contrast, is deep in the “blue wall”. An affluent commuter seat inSurrey, it voted remain, and in a rare bright spot for the Conservatives in 2024, Jeremy Hunt managed to fend off the Liberal Democrats to hold the seat.These very different seats are now central to the “battle for the right” that exploded back on to the political scene this week with Robert Jenrick’s defection/dismissal. How did voters in these seats react to the latest skirmish?It is fair to say that even 14 months into her leadership, views ofKemi Badenochremain fuzzy. But when played a clip of the video Badenoch filmed announcing her dismissal of Jenrick, the groups were unusually approving. Sarah, an admin officer from Godalming, said she was “blown away”, while James, an IT engineer from Warrington, described Badenoch as “decisive”. In both groups, the participants said they wanted to see more like that from Badenoch and wondered why they had not seen it before.2:01'Clear, irrefutable evidence': Badenoch on Robert Jenrick sacking over 'plot to defect' – videoBut while Badenoch personally impressed, for some it brought back memories of why they had booted the Conservatives out of office in the first place – their tendency to infighting. “I think she’s one to watch,” Allie said, “but it’s all a bit risky, isn’t it?” James said it could feel like a return to the “chaos inside the party” of the last government.Neither of these groups took to Jenrick. Shown clips of his defection speech. George, a Warrington service engineer, thought Jenrick seemed “primed” or “scripted”, Jenna said he was “not very convincing”, and Helen said: “He said words but there was no substance to them.” This feedback mirrored what we heard during the Conservative leadership election, when voters struggled to warm to Jenrick and questioned his authenticity.What about Jenrick’s “broken Britain” claim, now at the centre of a three-way debate betweenLabour, the Conservatives and Reform? In Godalming, some felt it a tad hyperbolic. “He was a bit of a drama queen,” Allie said, “a bit sensationalist.” Did she think Britain was broken? “Breaking, yeah. Not broken yet.” Even so, the group worried about the direction of travel: crime, the cost of living, small boats, government waste.In Warrington, the mood was darker. Derek reeled off examples: “NHS, definitely broken. Police force, officers leaving in droves. Pensions being affected.” Valerie, a receptionist in her 70s, told us: “I thought now I’d be enjoying life, going out during the day, socialising, but I’m having to work … The price of everything, whether it’s heating, your utilities, plus food – prices have just gone up so high.”View image in fullscreenWarrington in Cheshire. The Warrington South constituency sits just outside the ‘red wall’.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianFor George, the cost of living was eroding solidarity. “It’s becoming a bit selfish now because it’s got to the point where everybody is struggling. You’re kind of thinking: how is it going to benefit me and my immediate family?” he said.IsNigel Faragethe answer? Valerie earned nods of approval when she said: “I don’t like him but he stands by his convictions.” Rachel agreed: “He’s a bit like Thatcher. He might not be right but he stands by what he does.”Even in Godalming, hardly Reform’s home turf, some were tempted. Jenna said he “seems more positive and proactive about stuff. And, I don’t know, you sort of seem to have a bit more faith in an individual like that.”Leaving aside their antipathy for Jenrick, the groups tended not to think it mattered that Reform were taking in Tory defectors. Asked whether they felt it undermined Reform’s claim to be something new, Tom from Godalming replied that they could be “becoming like the Globetrotters”, taking the best players from the other teams. Likewise, Valerie from Warrington was not concerned about Reform’s talent being diluted. “Is he [Farage] trying to cherrypick the best just like a company would? Pick from the opposition so that your company ends up better?” she said.Nor didaccusationsagainst Farage of racism at school move the groups. Presented with the accusations and the Reform leader’s response, almost everyone felt it was unfair to judge Farage by what he had said as a schoolboy, and added that most people would have said things they regretted in school. Helen said: “As you grow up, you go: actually, no, that was ridiculous. That was awful. Why did we do that stuff?”Hanging over both groups was another name. Westminster’s obsession with the US does not normally extend to our focus groups but this past week has been an exception. Whatever they thought of Farage, their attitudes to Donald Trump were sulphurous. “I feel he’s pushing us towards world war three,” Valerie said. Kerry said: “He’s just going to make things 10 times worse.”View image in fullscreenGodalming and Ash, an affluent commuter seat in Surrey, is deep in the ‘blue wall’.Photograph: Teri Pengilley/The GuardianFor many voters on the right, it is Farage’s Trump problem above all else that puts them off. Matthew, a travel agent in Godalming, said Farage was “very much a mini Trump … he’s going to take the country down the wrong path”. Bill, a retiree from Ash, saw it a bit differently: while not a fan of Trump, he wondered whether Britain needed a shock to “get us kicked in the right places, because we’re just going nowhere at the moment”.Britain may feel broken but the right is far from united on how to fix it, split between traditional conservatism and Reform’s insurgence. Most recoil from Trump’s style of disruption and upheaval, and ties to him remain a top liability for Farage. But one thing that did unite the two groups was their sense thatKeir Starmerwas struggling as prime minister. Allie summed it up by saying Starmer was “floating over it all without going very deep into anything”.That sense of a prime minister adrift, after the failures of the last Tory government, was driving these voters to contemplate something more radical. Or as Derek put it: “We’ve tried Conservative, we’ve tried Labour, they didn’t work. Why not try Reform? We’ve got nothing to lose. If that doesn’t work …” he chuckled, “then it’s definitely broken.”(Participants’names have been changed)Luke Tryl is the UK director of the research group More in CommonExplore more on these topicsPoliticsReform UKConservativesLabourNigel FarageRobert JenrickKemi BadenochfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its star and writer-director Mona Fastvold talk fear, bonding – and not needing an OscarFri 23 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.07 ESTShareNot many actors take an interest in the audience’s aftercare. When it comes to The Testament of Ann Lee, however,Amanda Seyfriedis hands-on. “Did you watch it with someone you could talk to?” she asks, tilting her head sympathetically, then dipping her full-beam headlight eyes and giving a worried look when I admit that I saw it alone. “It’s nice to process it with somebody else.”Her concern is understandable. Whatever feelings the film provokes, indifference will not be among them. Heady and rapturous, this is an all-round odd duck of a movie, the sort of go-for-broke phantasmagoria – an 18th-century musical biopic complete with feverish visions and levitating – that was once typical of Lars von Trier or Bruno Dumont. I confess I didn’t know exactly what to make of it, but I knew I had been through a singular experience. Its director, Mona Fastvold, seated beside Seyfried on a sofa in a London hotel room, looks delighted. “That’s my favourite sort of feeling,” she says.Fastvold co-wrote the screenplay with her partner, Brady Corbet; their previous collaborations include last year’s Oscar-winning dramaThe Brutalist, which Corbet directed. (The couple also perform second-unit directing duties on one another’s movies.) Like that film,The Testament of Ann Leeis an immigrant story, though in this case a factual one. Seyfried gives a fearless, fever-pitch performance as Lee, the illiterate daughter of a Mancunian blacksmith, who in 1758 fell in with the Shaking Quakers, a religious group so-called because of the ecstatically shaking, trembling dances by which adherents responded to the infusion of God’s spirit. This was accompanied by soaring song and panted, rhythmic incantations; for the film, the British composerDaniel Blumberg, who won an Oscar for his score for The Brutalist, has rousingly adapted real Shaker hymns and spirituals.View image in fullscreen‘There was a lot of repetitive movement, using my body in a way that I’ve never done before’ … Amanda Seyfried.Photograph: Giulia ParmigianiIn 1774, Lee and her fellow Shakers brought the religion to the US, built a village in Albany County, New York and preached their gospel of pacifism, equality of race and gender – and celibacy. Just as there is an austere beauty to the minimalist furniture that the Shakers made, such as ladder-back chairs with woven seats, so other elements of their lives were similarly pared back. “No one can love God while following the lust of the flesh,” Lee tells the disgruntled husband who fathered her four children, each of whom died in infancy. Her maternal agony escalated her religious devotion. “She decided to mother the world,” says Fastvold.Aside from their vanilla-coloured hair, she and Seyfried are a study in contrasts today. The 40-year-old Pennsylvania-born actor, wearing a black dress with a white collar, is relaxed enough to stretch out her bare legs, plonking her black-shoed feet on the coffee table. As she talks, she gestures expansively. Fastvold, 44, barely moves: the Norwegian former dancer is perched on the edge of the sofa with her hands clasped in her lap. Her outfit is giving Star Trek: a boxy, stiff-shouldered charcoal felt top from which ribbed grey sleeves protrude. Together, actor and director resemble a high-spirited student and her reserved but loyal governess.View image in fullscreenSeyfried (centre) in the titular role of The Testament of Ann Lee.Photograph: BFA/AlamyBoth are singing from the same hymn sheet on how they hope viewers will approach the film. Introducing an American Film Institute screening last year, Seyfried told the audience: “Don’t be afraid to laugh: it’s absurd at moments and that’s what makes it special.” Fastvold agrees: “It’s operatic,” she says now. “Sometimes it’s very serious, and sometimes it doesn’t take itself seriously at all. You don’t want to make fun of anyone, but at the same time we can’t be full-on devout Shakers. It’s not like we’re trying to convert people.”Fastvold stumbled on Ann Lee’s story while researching her previous film, the 19th-century lesbian dramaThe World to Come. The question hanging over the new picture, as with any period work, is: why tell this story today? “The more I found out, the more I felt I needed it now more than ever. We need to think about leadership in a different way. Leaders around the world are leading from a place of fear and intimidation, which is the opposite of Ann Lee. She led from a place of nurturing, mothering and equality.”Fastvold met Seyfried when she was directing three episodes of the 2023 seriesThe Crowded Room, in which the actor played an investigator grilling a suspected gunman (Tom Holland); they worked together again last year on the missing-person miniseriesLong Bright River. In between, she gave Seyfried the Ann Lee script and offered her the lead. The story goes that her instant response was: “I know the way in.”“Youdidsay that,” says Fastvold, beaming proudly at her star. “But you also said, ‘Maybe you should cast someone British. Maybe you shouldn’t trust me.’ You had all these excuses. It was sort of gracious – like you wanted what was best for me and the film.”What was the way in that Seyfried had identified? “I was holding on to Ann’s unadulterated passion and devotion,” she says. “I can understand how someone can be brought to their knees in that way, and how delicious and attractive that is to people who need something to believe in.”Undercutting her confidence was something else: “Fear.” She hadn’t been this afraid of a role since playing Marion Davies, mistress of the media baron William Randolph Hearst, in David Fincher’s Citizen Kane-adjacent dramaMank. “Anything that feels far away from the contemporary-ness of the world scares me. Which makes it a thousand times more worthwhile.”Mank went swimmingly: Seyfried’s joyful performance stole the movie and brought her an Oscar nomination. There may be any number of reasons why she hasn’t received one for playing Ann Lee. The movie itself is intoxicating once you submit, but not everyone will. An anonymous Academy voter recentlytoldVariety that Seyfried was “astounding … I haven’t seen a better performance this year”, but admitted they “didn’t really like the movie”.I’d work on my Mancunian accent in my trailer by watching videos of Maxine PeakePerhaps her outspokenness has also counted against her this time. Last year, she distinguished herself spectacularly by refusing to row back on her description of the murdered far-right activist Charlie Kirk as “hateful” in an Instagram comment. ShetoldWho What Wear: “I’m not fucking apologising for that.” In her own statement, she addressed the importance of nuance: “I can get angry about misogyny and racist rhetoric and ALSO very much agree that Charlie Kirk’s murder was absolutely disturbing and deplorable in every way imaginable.”Shortly after that controversy, her name seemed to stop appearing among the five performers predicted to receive a best actress Oscar nomination this year. Could it be that the Academy feared another social media-related uproar in that category after last year’sscandalover reactionary tweets by Karla Sofía Gascón, star of Emilia Pérez? Seyfried needn’t care. “I’ve gotten this far without an Oscar,” shetoldthe New Yorker this month. “Why would I need one now?” She is, as she has said, “sitting pretty” after the success of her loopy thrillerThe Housemaid, in which she co-stars with Sydney Sweeney. With that and The Testament of Ann Lee, she has multiplex and arthouse all sewn up.As a trained singer, she has starred in musicals before, but The Testament of Ann Lee was infinitely more demanding than Mamma Mia! or Les Misérables. “It’s so technical: the choreography, the live singing, the Manchester accent. I was spinning so many plates.” Long before filming began, her preparation was already under way. “While I was on other jobs, I’d work on my Mancunian accent in my trailer by watching videos of Maxine Peake.” Celia Rowlson-Hall’s choreography also put mighty demands on her. “There was a lot of repetitive movement, using my body in a way that I’ve never done before. It becomes this full-bodied expression of your devotion. I was this vessel. It was exciting and scary and fucking great!” To decompress after a day of rhythmic pounding and lurching and swaying in 18th-century costume, she would “listen to something ridiculously separate like Backstreet Boys”.View image in fullscreenSeyfried and Lewis Pullman as Ann and William Lee.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyMuch of the film was shot in Hungary, on a bustling set: Fastvold encouraged her cast and crew to bring their children along, too. Once most of the families had departed, the two women became roomies for the final stretch. “I made her move into my apartment,” Seyfried says. “It was very cosy.”“I wanted to!” Fastvold protests. “The sweet thing was that we had both been working and taking care of our children, but once I moved in with Amanda …” She turns to address her directly: “You were doing little things to take care of me. I’d done my laundry, then gone out location scouting on a Sunday, and when I came home my socks had been balled up and placed in my closet. I nearly cried. Brady’s very nurturing and he makes the best sandwich ever. But at the same time, there was something about living with this very maternal person that was amazing.” It has set a high bar for the future. “Now I’ll ask all my leading ladies, ‘How do you feel about folding laundry?’”The nourishment flowed both ways. “I would wake up and you’d have the French press, the beautiful music playing, a candle going,” Seyfried recalls. “We went to the spa and you brought your little shot list. Mona’s so funny. She gets ready for work and she has her cute handkerchief. I was, like, ‘My God, she’s an angel from heaven!’” Not the sort of stories you hear from a Michael Bay set.Fastvold and Corbet have an 11-year-old daughter, Ada, while Seyfried and her husband, Thomas Sadoski, have a son and daughter, both under 10. Corbet made a point of singling out a tearful Ada in the audience at the Golden Globes last year when he won the best director prize. Fastvold says: “Early on, when my daughter was young, she would say, ‘Why do you have to go off and make a film and be away from me? Why can’t you be a teacher?’ My instinct was to say, ‘I have to go out and make money for us.’ Then I realised that’s not the right thing to say. What I should say is, ‘I’m going to leave you because I really want to do this job. I’m so excited to do it. And I am going to miss you, but I’m going to have such a fun time.’ And she accepted it in a totally different way. She didn’t feel that I was being forced to leave her.”Amanda’s very free. She needs to not have any filter, I think, to access all the places she needs to go in her workSeyfried likes to let her children see her vulnerability. “The other day, I told my daughter, ‘I’m sad because right now I’m tired and I’m travelling away from you, and I miss you.’ But she knows that what I’m doing right now is important for me. Of course, she also knows I’m going to pick stuff up for her. She’ll get stationery, she’ll get plushies …”Both women have been extravagant in their praise for one another while promoting The Testament of Ann Lee, but two adjectives have leapt out: Fastvold has admiringly labelled her star “a little mad”, while Seyfried has plumped for “brave”. Would they care to elaborate? Fastvold clarifies her remark: “Mad in a playful way. The best of us are, I think. What I mean is, Amanda’s very free. She needs to not have any filter, I think, to access all the places she needs to go in her work.”As for the bravery part: “You don’t care about the rules,” Seyfried tells Fastvold. “You don’t care if something is hard to do. You absolutely stay on your own path. Look, you directed a fucking Shaker musical set in the 1770s about a woman no one’s ever heard of. And it premiered atVenice!”It sounds almost Ann Lee-like. Does that mean there is an autobiographical dimension to the film? Fastvold smiles bashfully. “Isn’t there always?” she says.The Testament of Ann Lee is in UK cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAmanda SeyfriedDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

The brainchild of a US games company, The Troubles: Shadow War inNorthern Ireland1964-1998, is played with dice, tokens and a deck of 260 cards.The game is not yet complete or available for purchase, but disclosure of its existence on Thursday prompted an outcry inNorthern Ireland, where a victims’ rights group said it could retraumatise people.“They’re oversimplifying what is a very complex issue,” said Kenny Donaldson of theSouth East Fermanagh Foundation. Victims and survivors could feel “triggered” by the game, he said. “Many will feel that it has the effect of minimising their suffering.”View image in fullscreenThe proposed Troubles-themed board game has cards with titles such as ‘nutting squad’, ‘sniper at work’ and ‘Stakeknife’.Photograph: Compass GamesTheproposed gameoverlooked the conflict’s enduring legacy, said Donaldson. “What would be the likely response of 9/11 families were these US producers to make a comparable board game about 9/11, with players being the FBI, a terrorist murdering pilot?“The core failure of this initiative is the lack of understanding that ‘the NorthernIrelandTroubles’ are not past tense, they remain inextricably linked with Northern Ireland society today.”The Belfast Telegraph was thefirst to reportthat Compass Games, a Connecticut-based company that makes board games based on military history, had a Troubles-themed game available for preorder on its website for $85 (£63.20).Bill Thomas, the company’s founder and president, told the Guardian the game remained in development and would not be released for several years. “This is not the final version. It’s not even close to being final. It has to be play tested. We’re doing a lot of development on it.”Compass Games– which makes board games about battles from antiquity as well as more recent conflicts – sought to give an accurate depiction of Northern Ireland’s conflict, said Thomas. “This is to protect history, not to make fun of it.”View image in fullscreenDonaldson said victims and survivors could feel ‘triggered’ by the game.Photograph: Horst Friedrichs/AlamyThe game was designed by Hugh O’Donnell, a secondary school teacher in Scotland, and delves back to Westminster’s 1886 home rule bill to explain the trajectory of Ireland’s partition and the evolution of Northern Ireland.“I was expecting 20 or 30 pages of rules, that’s not what I got,” said Thomas. “It was far more complex and over 200 pages. That’s why it’s taken so long to go through development and play testing.”In the current iteration, two to six players adopt the role of a “faction” – such as security forces, the IRA, loyalist paramilitaries or nationalist or unionist politicians – and attempt to prevail over opponents while navigating political and security currents.View image in fullscreenParamilitaries have the option of attacking or colluding with security forces.Photograph: Compass GamesParamilitaries have the option of attacking or colluding with security forces – the IRA mole known asStakeknifeis cited and political factions can choose between backing terrorism, contesting elections and sharing power.The instructions read: “Each faction may use primary and secondary actions analogous to its real world counterparts, or may choose from the 259 rich narrative cards, divided into eight key epochs in Northern Ireland’s recent history.”Epochs include the “bloody years” of the early 1970s, the “iron and hunger” of the early 1980s when Margaret Thatcher battled republican hunger strikers and the “target mainland” campaign of the mid 1980s, when the IRA launched high-profile attacks in England.In addition to maps, sheets and markers the game includes blue cubes representing “RUC troops”, blue cylinders representing RUC bases, black octagons representing IRA active service units and black cylinders representing IRA bases. British military units are tan, loyalist paramilitaries are red, unionist politicians are orange and nationalists are green. There is also a “historical playbook” and a “rules booklet”.The Troubles game would be an educational tool, said Thomas. “Kids in their 20s and 30s in America know nothing about history. You have to make it interesting.”People in Northern Ireland endured a “tough time” but outsiders would be oblivious unless the history of the Troubles was told in engaging ways, said Thomas. “Do you want that memory to never exist, for no one outside Northern Ireland or the UK to understand that it ever happened?”Explore more on these topicsNorthern IrelandIRAIrelandBoard gamesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

African health leaders said it wascancelled. At the heart of the controversy is the west African nation of Guinea-Bissau – one of the poorest countries in the world and the proposed site of a hotly debated US-funded study on vaccines.The study on hepatitis B vaccination, to be led by Danish researchers, became a flashpoint after major changes to the US vaccination schedule and prompted questions about how research is conducted ethically in other countries.On Thursday, Quinhin Nantote, a military doctor and the recently appointed minister of health inGuinea-Bissau, confirmed to journalists that the trial had been “cancelled or suspended” because the science was not well-reviewed. Guinea-Bissau experienced a coup in November, and top leaders were recently replaced.A team of research experts at theAfricaCentres for Disease Control and Prevention, at Nantote’s request, will travel to Guinea-Bissau to help officials review the study. Officials from Denmark and the US have also been invited to review the trial, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa CDC, said at the press meeting.The decision to halt the trial is not for international organizations or foreign countries to determine, Kaseya said.“It’s the sovereignty of the country,” he said. “I don’t know what will be this decision, but I will support the decision that the minister will make.”Officials with the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have called into question the credibility of the Africa CDC, after officials with the organizationconfirmedthe study was cancelled.“To be clear, the trial will proceed as planned,” Andrew Nixon, an HHS spokesperson, said in a statement on Wednesday. He said the Africa CDC was waging “a public-relations campaign aimed to shape public perception rather than engaging with the scientific facts”. When asked by the Guardian, he offered no proof of either claim.An HHS official also called the Africa CDC “a powerless, fake organization attempting to manufacture credibility by repeating its claims publicly”, adding that the organization was “not a reliable source”.Kaseya said he had spoken to senior HHS officials, who were unaware of the statement, and he pointed to the Africa CDC’s key role in responding to outbreaks with global implications.“It’s very important to fund research that Africans actually want,” said Abdulhammad Babatunde, a medical doctor and global health researcher in Nigeria. “Africans want to solve Africa’s problems, not satisfy the curiosity of the funders.”The researchers would have given hepatitis B vaccines to 7,000 infants at birth and withheld the vaccines for another 7,000 infants until six weeks of age in order to study the overall health effects of giving the vaccines alongside other shots. Nearly one in five adults and about 11% of young children in Guinea-Bissau have hepatitis B – putting them at high risk of severe illness and death.“This is not acceptable,” said Babatunde of the study’s design. “To prevent things like the Tuskegee study and others, the control group has to get the standard of care, and the intervention group should get [potentially] better care.”The World Health Organizationrecommendsgiving the hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns within 24 hours of birth. Infants in Guinea-Bissau currently receive the shot at six weeks of age, but the doses will roll out to all newborns in 2028 in order to close gaps in care standards. “The current reason why the vaccine is not achieving coverage in Guinea-Bissau is because there’s no funding, and the funding should try to promote the vaccine, not use children as lab rats,” Babatunde said.Officials in an imbalanced power structure might be intimidated, he said. “It might be a very tough call for the officials in Guinea-Bissau, depending on what they stand to lose if they restrict the study. At this moment, it’s [time] for other African member states to come support Guinea-Bissau, to maintain their sovereignty and protect the children of Guinea-Bissau.”When deciding whether a revised version of the study will move forward, “the most important voice” was that of Guinea-Bissau’s ministry of health, which is responsible for protecting the health of all Bissau-Guineans, said Gavin Yamey, professor of global health at the Duke GlobalHealthInstitute. “So hearing from ministry officials today is hugely important.”The confusion in Guinea-Bissau comes back to how the trial was given the green light, said Nantote, who spoke in Portuguese through a translator.An early version of the study was approved by Guinea-Bissau’s six-person ethics committee, Comité Nacional de Ética em Pesquisa em Saúde (CNEPS), on 5 November,accordingto the Danish researchers. The researchers have since made updates that have not been approved by the committee.The Guinea-Bissau ethics committee, CNEPS, initially approved the study, according to an individual who identified himself to the Guardian as the interim director of CNEPS. The study did not mention that infants would go unvaccinated, he said – but the ethical concern is that the vaccine would be withheld from some newborns at birth, when it is most needed. No further changes have been made to the design of the trial because it was “suspended” by the country’s ministry of health, he said.“We think that they did not meet and they did not address this issue adequately,” Nantote said of the ethics committee.The Danish researchers did not appear to seek approval from ethics boards in Denmark or the US, though the Helsinki declaration requires approval from research ethics committees in both the sponsoring and host countries.The HHS said in a statement to the Guardian after publication on Friday that the trial is paused, but did not respond to the Guardian’s questions on ethical concerns and its characterization of the Africa CDC. The researchers did not respond to inquiries about the trial’s cancellation or questions about their research. The HHS, the researchers and the University of Southern Denmark did not respond to inquiries about whether US or Danish ethical committees were consulted.Nantote and Kaseya both highlighted the challenges to health in Guinea-Bissau. Less than a quarter of the country has access to basic services such as water and sanitation. Poverty and food insecurity are persistent. With limited access to healthcare, maternal mortality is high, and malaria is a leading cause of death.“The authorities of Guinea-Bissau, they know that,” Kaseya said. “They are doing their best to address that.”Explore more on these topicsGuinea-BissauHealthAfricaVaccines and immunisationUS healthcareRobert F Kennedy JrfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I have never abused, coerced or disrespected any woman. These accusations are absolutely false and pain me deeply.”Explore more on these topicsSpainEuropeDominican RepublicBahamasAmericasCaribbeannewsShareReuse this content"

He is due to appear in court on Monday in California. He ischargedwith drug trafficking, conspiracy to murder, witness tampering and money laundering.Officials in the US allege that Wedding’s organisation had moved nearly 60 metric tons of cocaine a year into Los Angeles fromMexicousing a network of semitrucks. Wedding is also accused of ordering the killing of a key FBI witness as well as several other murders, including that of a couple who were killed in a case of mistaken identity.US charges ex-Olympic snowboarder turned drug kingpin with murder of witnessRead moreSince 2023, the RCMP and theFBIhave been collaborating on a sprawling investigation known as Operation Giant Slalom. In March, 2025, Wedding was added to the FBI’s Most Wanted List.“We told you in November we would find Mr Wedding. Today, that day has arrived,” said Akil Davis, the assistant director of the FBI’sLos Angelesfield office. “The long arm of the law extends beyond our border.”David said the arrest was a “good day” for victims. “Ryan Wedding tormented several people and several families that will never be the same,” he said. “But today, they get the justice that they sought.”Davis said in addition to “crushing sanctions” against 19 people, including Wedding, authorities also seized a Mercedes sports car worth $15m and motorcycles worth $40m.US authorities had previously said that they believed Wedding to be in hiding in Mexico. On Thursday, Patel was in Mexico City for what he called “pre-planned” meetings with the country’s security chief, García Harfuch. And on Friday morning he left with a souvenir: Wedding and another, unnamed, “priority objective”.The decision for an FBI director to be present in the field for an arrest is exceedingly rare and speaks to the political focus on capturing Wedding.García Harfuch released a statement saying that Patel was leaving with “a non-US citizen who was arrested by Mexican authorities and is among the FBI’s 10 most wanted, and a Canadian citizen who voluntarily surrendered yesterday at the US embassy”.“If it’s true that he handed himself in, this may be an attempt to negotiate better terms,” said Cecilia Farfán-Méndez, an analyst with the Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime. “Maybe it gives him a little more room for manoeuvre.”Or there could be another explanation: he feared for his safety in Mexico, said Farfán-Méndez.The arrest comes at a time of tension in North America, with Mark Carney and Donald Trumpclashingat Davos, and renewed threats of US military strikes on Mexican cartel targets.“There was a message from the secretary of state, talking about the need for tangible results [against organised crime],” said Farfán-Méndez. “I think grabbing Ryan Wedding is a very media-friendly way to show tangible results. I think it could be filed under that column.”Alejandro Rosales Castillo, one of the FBI’s 10 most wanted fugitives, who is accused of the murder of a woman in North Carolina in 2016, was also arrested. A US citizen, he crossed the border to Mexico in 2017 and was in hiding for almost a decade until he was captured in Pachuca, Hidalgo, on 16 January.NBC News first announced news of the arrest and US law enforcement officials familiar with the operation confirmed it to the Guardian.In March, the FBI announced a $15m reward for the capture of Wedding, whose nicknames allegedly include “Public Enemy”, “El Jefe” and “Giant”.At the time,Patel, compared Wedding to Pablo Escobar and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.The head of the RCMP, Michael Duheme, was also present at the announcement and said “no single country” can break up transnational drug-trafficking organizations.Wedding was allegedly being protected by the Sinaloa cartel in Mexico while he was on the run.Some analysts have suggested that Wedding’s significance in the international drug trade had been exaggerated by US authorities and the media.“There’s been a high-level characterisation of Wedding as a major kingpin. There was a $15m reward for him. At least from a media standpoint, he was a big fish,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But I think the indictment gives a different sense of proportion.”Though US authorities claim Wedding’s enterprise was trafficking 60 tonnes of cocaine a year, this figure does not appear in the indictment, which only mentions specific cases of a few hundred kilos being moved at a time.“These arrests are important for law enforcement,” said Farfán-Méndez. “But whether they impact [drug] supply is another question.”Explore more on these topicsCanadaUS crimeDrugsAmericasMexicoLos AngelesCalifornianewsShareReuse this content"

She also concedes that her priority was “to preserve political power”.Her remarks appear in a leaked recording of the nearly two-hour meeting that was held inVenezuelaseven days after the US attack.Venezuela’s Delcy Rodríguez assured US of cooperation before Maduro’s captureRead moreThe video, first reported by the local journalism collective La Hora deVenezuela, gives a rare glimpse into the workings of Venezuela’s Chavista regime, and reveals how the country’s rulers rushed to regain control of the narrative after Washington removed its figurehead.Amidreports that Rodríguez and other cabinet members held talks with the US and its envoys before the attack, the recording reveals the surviving regime figures’ concerns that they would be branded traitors – and their efforts to prevent their political movement from fracturing from within.“The only thing I would ask for is unity,” Rodríguez says in her call to the group.Before putting her on speakerphone, the then communications minister, Freddy Ñáñez, seeks to defend Rodríguez, calling for “gossip, rumours, intrigues and attempts at discrediting” her to be shut down. He argues that she is “the only guarantee we have that … we can bring back the president and the first lady – but also turn the page and reconfigure our forces”.View image in fullscreenVideo shows Venezuelan officials and influencers scrambling to coordinate the official narrative after US soldiers seized Nicolás Maduro.Photograph: YouTubeRodríguez, who spoke on speakerphone for six minutes, said it “hurt … to have to assume responsibilities in these circumstances”.She then referred to the US military operation: “The threats began from the very first minute they kidnapped the president. They gaveDiosdado [Cabello, the interior minister], Jorge [Rodríguez, the acting president’s brother and congressional president,] and me 15 minutes to respond, or they would kill us.”Rodríguez said that at first US troops allegedly “told us [Maduro and his wife,Cilia Flores] had been assassinated, not kidnapped”, and that she, her brother and Cabello replied that they “were ready to share the same fate”.“And I tell you, we stand by that statement to this day, because the threats and the blackmail are constant, and we have to proceed with patience and strategic prudence, with very clear objectives, brothers and sisters,” she added, before listing three goals: “to preserve peace … to rescue our hostages … and to preserve political power”.The meeting appears to have been recorded on a videoconferencing platform – most of the influencers were in the room, but others joined online – and it remains unclear how it was leaked. Neither the Venezuelan nor the US governments responded to requests for comment.Rodríguez has not repeated the allegation of a US death threat, and this week officials in Washington said she would soon visit the US capital.“We are in a process of dialogue, of working with the United States, without any fear, to confront our differences and difficulties … and to address them through diplomacy,” said Rodríguez on Wednesday.Since the capture and rendition of her predecessor, Rodríguez has walked a fine line, voicing defiance at home but signalling to Washington that she is ready to cooperate with the Trump administration.The historian and political analyst Margarita López Maya, a retired professor at the Central University of Venezuela, said it was difficult to know whether there had even been a death threat.“It may be a narrative Rodríguez herself is constructing to hold the base together, because everyone knows that Maduro’s removal could only have happened with internal complicity,” she said.At the meeting, the communications minister urged influencers to be “careful” with “purists” who “will come out saying we are handing over the country, the revolution, betraying” Chavismo.Ñáñez also claimed that “everything happening today”, including US control overVenezuelan oil, “is simply the plan that Maduro put on the table”, adding: “It’s not a concession, a gift or a defeat; selling oil to the US has always been our plan.”Since the US strike, the regime has maintained a seemingly contradictory rhetoric, flooding social media and Telegram channels with harsh-sounding language against the US while complying with all of Trump’s demands.“I think what the [Venezuelan] government is really negotiating is how to save its own skin,” said López Maya.Days after the video was leaked, Ñáñez was named as the environment minister in a cabinet reshuffle.One of the first moves by his successor, the writer Miguel Ángel Pérez Pirela, was tocreatea social media account purportedly aimed at “defending the truth about Venezuela against fake news campaigns”, a move that is being seen as another example of how, even without Maduro and amid a rapprochement with the US, the regime remainsfundamentally unchanged, marked by repression, hundreds of political prisoners and no timetable for new elections.“We have two broad options: one is that the country opens up to a democratic transition,” said López Maya. “The other is the one Chavismo is clearly playing with: obeying the US, but trying to buy time to see whether, along the way, they can remain in power through an authoritarian option with some economic openings,” she added.Explore more on these topicsVenezuelaDelcy RodríguezUS attack on VenezuelaNicolás MaduroAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The board, which will be chaired by Trump, was originally described as a temporary body to oversee the governance and reconstruction of Gaza.Permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1bn each, according to Trump.While the leaders of many liberal democracies declined to sign on to Trump’s new international organization, Carney had, before Davos, accepted in principle, though he said on Sunday his officials had not yet gone through “all the details of the structure, how it’s going to work, what the financing is for, etcetera”.“Canada wants money to have maximum impact,” Carneytold reporters.Canada’s finance minister, François-Philippe Champagne, thensaid on Tuesdaythat the Canadians did not plan to pay the $1bn countries were asked to hand over to Trump for a permanent seat on the board that was originally described as a temporary body to oversee the governance and reconstruction of Gaza.Ina frank addressto world leaders at Davos on Tuesday, Carney described what he called “a rupture” in the previous “rules-based” world order overseen by the United States caused by Trump’s aggressive behavior.When he arrived in Davos, Trump made it clear that he had heard or at least heard of Carney’s viral speech.“Canada lives because of the United States,” Trump said in his own address on Wednesday. “Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements.”“Canada doesn’t live because of the United States,” Carney responded on Thursday. “Canada thrives because we are Canadian.”Neither Carney’s office nor the White House immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment on Thursday evening.“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do,” Trump said in Switzerland on Thursday. “And we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.”The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN security council resolution as part of Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and a UN spokesperson, Rolando Gomez, said on Thursday that UN engagement with the board would only be in that context.Member nations include Argentina, Bahrain, Morocco, Pakistan and Turkey.

Over the past week, Indonesia’s president, Prabowo Subianto, has announced a number of measures to hold companies accountable over what scientists say was an“extinction-level disturbance”for the world’s rarest ape.“This is the news we have been waiting for, and the deep breath the Batang Toru ecosystem desperately needed,” said Amanda Hurowitz, the forest commodities lead at conservation nonprofit Mighty Earth, which has long been fighting threats to the Tapanuli.View image in fullscreenA search and rescue worker among the destruction and debris left by November’s flash floods in Batang Toru district, North Sumatra.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, the Indonesian government said it wouldrevoke the permits of 28 companies, halting their operations in the area. This includes the permits for mining company PT Agincourt Resources, behind theMartabe goldmine, as well as the permit for PT North Sumatera Hydro Energy, the developer of a large hydropower project being built along the Batang Toru River. The other permits were largely focused on timber harvesting and oil palm plantations.The decision follows the results of an investigation by the country’s Forest Area Regulation Task Force.Earlier this week, the country’senvironment ministry also sued six companies– identified only by their initials – for 4.8tn rupiah (£211m) over alleged links to the environmental damages in the Batang Toru ecosystem.It’s the world’s rarest ape. Now a billion-dollar dig for gold threatens its futureRead moreThe ministry said the six companies were responsible for unspecified damages spanning 2,500 hectares (6,200 acres) in the region’s watersheds.PT Agincourt Resources said it had only learned about the revocation of its permit from media reports. “We are following up with the regulators,” the company said in a statement to the Guardian.“The company respects every government decision and maintains its rights in accordance with applicable regulations.” Operations at the mine have been paused since 6 December.Scientists and environmental advocates have long urged the government to strengthen protections for the Batang Toru region, considering that the critically endangered Tapanuli orangutan can be found only in this patch of forest.Preliminary findings after the Sumatra floods suggest that between 6.2% and 10.5% of the Tapanuli orangutan population – which numbered about 800 – probably perished in just a few days.View image in fullscreenThe Martabe mine, operated by PT Agincourt Resources, in Batang Toru, North Sumatra province, Indonesia.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesBiological anthropologist Erik Meijaard said a team would soon visit the area to fully assess effects on the orangutans in the area. But he noted that most of the landslides that had occurred in the western portion of the ecosystem, known as West Block, had little to do with the six companies that were being sued.“As far as we can see, these were primarily caused by extreme rainfall that affected forests on steep slopes in the interior of the West Block.“Of course, the hydro dam and goldmine have impacted Tapanuli orangutan habitat, but the relationship with the landslides is tentative,” he added.Still, environmental campaigners took the government’s actions as a win for the Tapanuli.“The Indonesian government must now act to permanently end any further deforestation,” Hurowitz said. “And to begin work, as it has indicated, to restore the damage that has been done, prevent any further loss of human life and offer a future for the Tapanuli orangutan.”Find moreage of extinction coverage here, and follow the biodiversity reportersPhoebe WestonandPatrick Greenfieldin the Guardian app for more nature coverageExplore more on these topicsIndonesiaThe age of extinctionFloodingEndangered speciesAnimalsWildlifeMiningConservationnewsShareReuse this content"

Police were attempting to contact another three people. Families enjoying the summer school holiday were among the campers. Recreational vehicles and at least one structure were crushed, images showed.During a visit to the region on Friday, prime minister Christopher Luxon said he had met with some of the grieving families, who had told him they were feeling well supported during an “absolutely tragic” time.“New Zealand is full of grief today … and grieves with them,” he said.The Chinese ambassador to New Zealand, Wang Xiaolong,posted on Xthat one of the dead from the landslides was a Chinese citizen.“Our hearts are with the impacted families at this difficult moment,” he said. “Deeply appreciate the assistance provided promptly by Mfat and NZ Police when we reached out yesterday.”mapThe first landslide hit a house in the community of Welcome Bay on New Zealand’s North Island at 4.50am, police said. Two people escaped the house, and the bodies of two who were trapped inside were recovered hours later, the emergency management minister, Mark Mitchell, said.Later the same morning, emergency services were called to asecond slide at the base of nearby Mount Maunganui, also on the North Island. The rubble hit Beachside Holiday Park in a town named after the extinct volcano. Images showed vehicles, travel trailers and an amenities block crushed by debris.New Zealand authorities are facing questions about why people were not evacuated after reports of a landslip at the campsite earlier in the day.“We’ve heard there was possibly a small slip where people did move away from the site,” local Tauranga mayor Mahé Drysdale said.“Those questions will be answered.”Drysdale told Radio New Zealand that search-and-rescue teams had continued at the campground through the night but no one else had been found.“That’s really hard, and we’re here with the families and as you can imagine, just that uncertainty of where they are and when we might have a result is pretty hard,” Drysdale said.He said the area remained unstable. Mitchell told Radio New Zealand it was a challenging and difficult environment. He said police were checking if some campers may have left without informing authorities.1:17Helicopter vision shows aftermath of Mount Maunganui landslide – videoThe landslide happened after heavy rains soaked much of the North Island’s east coast earlier this week and caused widespread damage.NZ Civil Defence warned on Thursday morning that landslides can happen without warning, and advised the public to keep an eye out for rockfalls or sinking land at the bottom of slopes, as well at stuck doors and windows, or gaps in window frames.“Get out of the path of the landslide quickly. Evacuate if the building you are in is in danger,” the agency posted on Facebook.Roads remained closed in some of the worst-hit areas, making some North Island towns inaccessible by land. The civil defence organisation in Tairawhiti District said in a social media post that people were walking over landslides to collect water and food from welfare hubs and warned against this because of the risk of more landslides.Police superintendent Tim Anderson said the number of people missing was in the “single figures”.No survivors or bodies had been recovered by late Thursday from the Mount Maunganui rubble, where dogs were being used to sniff for human victims, Mitchell said.“There was a shower block and a, sort of, combined shower block-kitchen block and there were people using that at the time the slide came through and they are some of the ones that we’re working hard to try to recover now,” Mitchell told the Australian Broadcasting Corp.Further north near Warkworth, a man was missing after flood waters swept him from a road Wednesday morning as heavy rain lashed large swathes of the North Island, a police statement said.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of an area affected by a landslide triggered by heavy rains, in Mount Maunganui.Photograph: Amy Till/ReutersLuxon urged residents in affected areas to heed local authorities’ safety advice during the extreme conditions.“Extreme weather continues to cause dangerous conditions across the North Island. Right now, the government is doing everything we can to support those impacted,” Luxon posted on social media.Fire and Emergency NZ commander, William Pike, said there were some signs of life immediately after the Mount Maunganui slide.“Members of the public … tried to get into the rubble and did hear some voices,” Pike told reporters. “Our initial fire crew arrived and … were able to hear the same.

There is no telling at the moment how long it will take,” site superintendent Takeyuki Inagaki told a news conference.“We will for now fully focus on trying to identify the cause of what happened,” he said.Spokesperson Takashi Kobayashi told the AFP news agency that “once it became clear that it would take time, we decided to reinsert the control rods in a planned manner”, he said, adding that the reactor “is stable and there is no radioactive impact outside”.Control rods are a device used to control the nuclear chain reaction in the reactor core, which can be accelerated by slightly withdrawing them, or slowed down or stopped completely by inserting them deeper.Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s biggest nuclear power plant by potential capacity, although just one reactor of seven was restarted. The facility was taken offline in 2011 whenJapan pulled the plug on nuclear powerafter a colossal earthquake and tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima atomic plant into meltdown.However, resource-poor Japan nowwants to revive atomic energyto reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and meet growing energy needs from artificial intelligence.Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the first Tepco-run unit to restart since 2011. The company also operates theFukushimaDaiichi plant, now being decommissioned.Public opinion in Niigata is deeply divided: About 60% of residents oppose the restart, while 37% support it, according to a survey conducted in September.Earlier this month, seven groups opposing the restart submitted a petition signed by nearly 40,000 people to Tepco and Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority, saying that the plant sits on an active seismic fault zone and noted it was struck by a strong earthquake in 2007.Explore more on these topicsJapanNuclear powerFukushimaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

increasingly charging customers for fresh produce by the item, rather than by weight, in a strategy that is leading to “wild volatility” in pricing with some items more than 50% more expensive, new analysis shows.A Sydney-based data analyst who compared the “per each” price online with the actual “per kilo” shelf price of 15 fruits and vegetables at their localWoolworthsstore found the price variations were “completely arbitrary”.The analyst, who asked not to be identified because of their employment, said the findings proved the pricing strategy was a “massive transparency failure” for consumers.Woolworths still uses weight-based pricing for most fruits and vegetables in-store – with a few items such as avocados and mangoes an exception – but when it sells groceries online it prices fresh produce items individually.Coles has started trialling an expansion of per-each prices for fresh produce in some stores, telling customers the move is “aimed at giving you clarity on exactly what you will pay at the checkout”.However, because supermarkets are not required to display a per-kilo price, or even the average weight of items, shoppers are unlikely to know whether they’re actually getting a good deal when paying a set price per item.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailThe analyst said they wanted to test if the shift to pricing produce by each piece rather than weight was fair for consumers, and their results proved the current regulations should be reviewed.‘Capsicum paradox’Unless a customer did complex maths on the spot, they wouldn’t know if they were being “ripped off” by the “per each” price, the analysis found.In the most striking example, which the analyst called the “capsicum paradox”, Woolworths charged 51% more for green capsicums when priced individually compared with when they were priced by weight.Most shoppers wouldn’t realise they were paying nearly $15/kg for a vegetable they could get for $9.90/kg on the shelf, the analyst said.The green capsicums cost $9.90/kg in store and $2.48 each online.Woolworths online delivery platforms tested: which is cheapest and how do they compare with in-store shopping?Read moreBut when the analyst calculated an effective price per kilo by dividing the online item price by the average weight of each item they found in store, the capsicums turned out to be far more expensive when priced “per each”.In order to calculate the average weight of each item, the analyst weighed five randomly chosen pieces of each fruit or vegetable – apart from broccoli, which they used two heads of, in a Sydney Woolworths, then divided the total by the number of pieces.They reviewed the “per each” price for the same produce on the same day from the Woolworths website, with the same store in Sydney selected as the pickup point.Red washed potatoes, mandarins, limes and carrots were all more expensive when priced per individual piece than weighed, with the potatoes 30% more expensive at their “per each” price.Conversely, broccoli, brown and red onions, red chillis, red capsicums, black plums, apricots, bananas and truss tomatoes were all cheaper “per each” than when priced by weight.The broccoli and brown onions were respectively 43% and 39% cheaper at their “per each” prices compared with their per-kilo price in store.Push to close ‘loopholes’ in pricing rulesUnder the existing rules, the major supermarkets can price fruit and vegetables “per each” or “per kilo”, whether they are packaged or loose.“It’s a big loophole and as long as it exists the big supermarkets are going to use it because it’s legal,” the analyst said.“The lack of transparency means that consumers cannot make a better decision as to how they spend their money in terms of whether they’re getting value for their money or not.”The analyst said they were also concerned “per each” pricing could facilitate so-calledshrinkflation, because retailers could source smaller pieces of produce while maintaining the same price.Ian Jarratt, from the Queensland Consumers Association, said the trade measurement legislation and unit pricing code – which regulate how grocery prices are set – should be amended to reduce, or remove, the ability of retailers to price fruit and vegetables only per piece.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the

Pre-mortem dingo bite marks are not likely to have caused immediate death. There are extensive post-mortem dingo bite marks.”The statement from the court concluded: “There is no evidence that any other person was involved.”It had been speculated that James could have entered the water to escape dingoes before drowning.Map of K’gariK’gari is home to about 150 human inhabitants and a population of dingoes genetically distinct from those on mainland Australia.Violent dingo and human interactions have been increasing in recent years.

This is despite the Nationals leader,David Littleproud, being blamed for the break-up.Senior Liberal MPs expected Ley’s fate would effectively be sealed as soon as Hastie and fellow rightwingerAngus Taylordecide on which of them will run.Guardian Australia has confirmed Hastie – who has previously declared leadership aspirations – was prepared to run for the top job after encouragement from colleagues. His office was contacted for comment.One conservative source said the former soldier was emerging as the preferred choice inside the faction, partly due to a belief he could win back voters who were switching to Pauline Hanson’s One Nation.Multiple MPs who spoke to Guardian Australia were hopeful the party’s first female leader would agree to step aside, avoiding the need for a contested ballot.“We would like her [Ley] to realise the benefit of a uncontested ballot,” one said.View image in fullscreenDavid Littleproud (left) dug in on Friday, continuing to blame Sussan Ley for the Coalition split, and claiming he had tried to ‘avert it’.Composite: Mick Tsikas/Lukas Coch/AAPHastie or Taylor would need support from MPs in other factions in a potential contested ballot against Ley.Some MPs had been discussing a spill on the Monday before parliament resumes on 3 February.Hastiequit shadow cabinet in Octoberafter a dispute with Ley on immigration policy.Taylor was understood to be returning to Australia over the weekend, after an overseas holiday that caused him to miss this week’s special sitting of parliament.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailA day after Littleproud blew up the Coalition and said his party would not serveunder Ley’s leadership, the opposition leader told Channel Seven on Friday she expected to remain in the top job.Asked if she would survive as leader, Ley said: “Yes, I will.”Sussan Ley just outlasted the Liberal party’s shortest serving leader. But will she survive another milestone?Read moreShe said she remained open to the possibility of another reconciliation with Littleproud and the Nationals.Senior Liberal sources described Ley’s leadership as all but over on Thursday, after a the secondCoalitionsplit in eight months, sparked by a dispute on Labor’s hate speech laws.“My focus is always on the Australian people, so I just want to say the door is not closed, but my eye is not on the door,” Ley said.In another interview, Ley was asked if she was worried about a challenge from Hastie or Taylor, both conservatives. She said they were “strong, committed members of my team”.Anne Ruston, a close ally of Ley, stuck by the leader and said she had done a “phenomenal job” navigating tough issues.“I think that her actions of this week are absolutely fully backed by the Liberal leadership group. But I haven’t heard one person in my party who doesn’t believe that the actions that the leader took this week were not absolutely necessary,” she told 5AA radio.Littleproud continued to blame Ley for the split on Friday, claiming he had tried to “avert it”.The Nationals leader said it was not up to him to determine who the Liberal leader is, despite his comments yesterday that he would not work with Ley.The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, was scathing of the Liberals on Friday, saying the Coalition were focused on their internal politics and predicted “at least one more defection to One Nation over coming weeks”.“The first woman leader of theLiberal party, undermined from day one and the alternative leaders are worse,” Albanese told ABC radio.The split followed the Nationals senators Bridget McKenzie, Susan McDonald and Ross Cadell crossing the floor to vote on Tuesday, breaking with the Coalition’s position on the laws drafted after the Bondi terror attack.Littleproud, who had warned Ley that accepting resignations from the trio would spark a walkout by the Nationals, said the party’s door is “open”.“What I said is that we couldn’t serve in Sussan Ley’s ministry after she accepted the resignation of three senators that shouldn’t have been accepted. There was an avenue not to,” he said.Ley’s deputy, the shadow treasurer Ted O’Brien, said he expected her to remain leader.The Coalition has collapsed, will Ley’s leadership? - podcastRead morePrivately, several Liberal MPs told Guardian Australia they did not want the Coalition to reunite, and said theNational partyshould be “severely punished”.“On our side, a number of us are saying, that’s it … I was speaking strongly to keep the Coalition together [the last time], but not any more,” one Liberal MP said.The firebrand conservative senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, who moved from the Nationals party room to the Liberals after the election, continued to criticise Ley’s leadership.“I made it very clear that obviously the leader had lost trust in me, lost faith in me, and I suppose I felt the same at the time,” she told Sky News on Thursday night.“I don’t feel like things have improved.”Explore more on these topicsCoalitionLiberal partySussan LeyDavid LittleproudAngus TaylorAndrew HastieNational partynewsShareReuse this content"

Some inland areas could experience more than five days above 40C.The heat would be “challenging for everyone”, the senior meteorologist Jonathan How said. He reminded people to stay cool and up to date with heat and fire warnings.High to extreme fire danger was expected across several southern states, with catastrophic fire danger forecast for the Yorke and eastern Eyre Peninsula in South Australia on Saturday.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailFires were still burning in many parts of Victoria after an intense heatwave earlier in January, which analysts said was made five times more likelydue to global heating.While there was no meaningful rain forecast over coming days, winds were not expected to be as gusty or damaging in the coming heatwave, How said.A statewide total fire ban has declared inVictoriaon Saturday. In South Australia, total fire bans were in place for all districts except Adelaide.The Country Fire Authority’s chief officer, Jason Heffernan, said new fires could start and spread quickly in the hot and dry conditions.“With fires already in the landscape, communities hurting and healing, and emergency services still on the fireground, we’re asking people to follow the strict conditions associated with the total fire bans.”Several bushfire warnings were in place across the state on Friday at 4pm, with residents of Crawford Crossing, Hodgson Crossing, McNamara Crossing, Nariel Creek, Nariel Valley, Stacey’s Bridge and Willow Crossing advised to “leave now”.Total fire bans were already in place in South Australia’s eastern Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula and the Mount Lofty Ranges.Brett Loughlin, the chief officer of the SA Country Fire Service, said Saturday was shaping up to be “some of the most significant fire weather forecasts we have seen in South Australia in recent years”.At their peak, temperatures could soar into the high 40s, challenging all-time temperature records in some states.The heat was already rising in South Australia, with Oodnadatta hitting 34.7C at 10am Friday.

Kyiv’s delegation “knows what to do,” he said in a voice note to journalists. Russia sent a delegation led by the GRU military intelligence chief, Adm Igor Kostyukov, indicating a focus on military rather than political negotiations.The talks come after a seventh meeting between Trump’s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, andVladimir Putinin Moscow, where the main topics of discussion were Russia’s demands for territory and Ukraine’s security guarantees, which Zelenskyy has said were agreed with Trump at this week’s World Economic Forum in Davos.A map shows Russian-controlled territory and recent advances in UkraineWitkoff was accompanied in Moscow by Trump’s son-in-lawJared Kushner. They were joined by Josh Gruenbaum, the commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service (FAS). He was recently appointed as a senior adviser on Trump’s international “board of peace” for Gaza.The Kremlin’s diplomatic adviser, Yuri Ushakov, told reporters the talks had been “useful in every respect” and that it was “agreed that the first meeting of a trilateral working group on security issues will take place today in Abu Dhabi”.As the talks were about to begin on Friday, the Kremlin repeated its demand that Kyiv withdraw its forces from the eastern Donbas region for the war to end.Other senior Russian officials have gone on record demanding Ukraine adopt other measures that have been left out of a “20-point peace plan”, in what they indicated were plans to pursue regime change in Kyiv.“Any settlement proposal founded on the primary goal of preserving the current Nazi regime in what remains of the Ukrainian state is, naturally, completely unacceptable to us,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said on Tuesday.2:16Trump suggests he will settle Ukraine-Russia war 'pretty soon' at 'board of peace' launch – videoBefore the talks, a German government spokesperson questioned whether Moscow would be willing to concede on any of its demands, which include taking over territory currently not under its military control.“There are still major questions about the extent to which Russia is really willing to move away from its maximalist demands,” Steffen Meyer said.“Nothing would be gained if a peace agreement ultimately only gave Russia some breathing space and allowed it to launch new attacks at a later date. That is why we have focused very strongly on the issue of security guarantees.”The full details of the UAE talks had not been released at the time of writing, and it was not clear whether Russian and Ukrainian officials would meet face to face. Zelenskyy said the meetings would last for two days.1:44Volodymyr Zelenskyy: Europe needs to know how to defend itself – videoThe Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said: “Russia’s position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, the Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas. They must be withdrawn from there … This is a very important condition.”The Trump administration has beenpushing for a peace settlement, with representatives of the US president shuttling between Kyiv and Moscow in a flurry of negotiations that some worry couldforce Ukraine into an unfavourable deal. Trump said on Wednesday that Putin and Zelenskyy would be “stupid” if they failed to come together and get a deal done.Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Witkoff said one key issue remained to be resolved, without giving further details.Zelenskyy said the future status of land occupied by Russia in eastern Ukraine was unresolved, but that peace proposals were “nearly ready”. Both sides have previously highlighted the issue of territory as crucial.Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine surrender the 20% of the eastern region of Donetsk it still holds. Zelenskyy has refused to give up land that Ukraine has successfully defended since 2022 through grinding and costly attritional warfare.View image in fullscreenVolodymyr Zelenskyy and Donald Trump meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.Photograph: Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/UPI/ShutterstockRussia also demands Ukraine renounce its ambition to join Nato and rejects any presence of Nato troops on Ukrainian soil after a peace deal.Trump claims Nato troops ‘stayed a little off the frontlines’ in AfghanistanRead moreZelenskyy said from Davos: “The Russians have to be ready for compromises because, you know, everybody has to be ready, not only Ukraine, and this is important for us.” He said postwar security guarantees between Washington and Kyiv were ready, should a deal be reached, although they would require each country’s ratification.Zelenskyy was speaking after a closed-door meeting with Trump and a blistering Davos speech in which heaccused European leaders of being in “Greenland mode”as they waited for US leadership rather than taking action themselves.Despite Trump’slimited and scattergun support for Ukrainesince taking office a year ago, Zelenskyy focused on Europe’s role in the conflict, accusing the continent’s leaders of complacency and inaction.“Just last year, here in Davos, I ended my speech with the words: ‘Europe needs to know how to defend itself,’” he said. “A year has passed, and nothing has changed.”Speaking to reporters as he flew back to Washington, Trump said his meeting with Zelenskyy had gone well,and that the Ukrainian president had told him he wanted to make a deal to end the war.“I had a good meeting, but I’ve had numerous good meetings with President Zelenskyy and it doesn’t seem to happen,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineVolodymyr ZelenskyyRussiaEuropeUS foreign policyVladimir PutinDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

The ban comes into force at 11pm on Friday evening and continues until 8am on Monday morning.‘They’re emboldened’: British far-right activists step up harassment of asylum seekers in northern FranceRead moreOperation Overlord was launched by Raise the Colours, an anti-migrant group placing England flags and union jacks on lamp-posts. But Daniel Thomas, an associate of the activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, known as Tommy Robinson,parted companywith the group and is now running Operation Overlord.View image in fullscreenSt George’s flags in Weoley Castle, Birmingham: England and union jack flags have been flown on streets and roadsides in England as part of the Raise the Colours campaign.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianBertrand Gaume, the prefect of the Nord department, and François-Xavier Lauch, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais department, have issued an interdepartmental order prohibiting the British far-right activists from gathering.In a statement they said: “For several months, the presence of activists from the British far-right movement, particularly the Raise the Colours movement, involved in actions of intimidation against migrants and humanitarian organisations, has been observed on the coast of Nord and Pas-de-Calais.“These actions, widely disseminated on social media, are part of a xenophobic and anti-immigrant ideology and create a clear risk of public disorder.”They said the ban had been introduced to “prevent any confrontation or threat to public safety”. It prohibits the presence and gathering of self-proclaimed members of the groups in the districts of Dunkirk, Calais, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Montreuil-sur-Mer and Lille.The French prefecture statement added that the aim of the ban was to preserve public order in the area. “State services, particularly internal security forces, will be fully mobilised to ensure the proper implementation of this decree, with the aim of protecting migrants, who are often victims of exploitation by smuggling networks, and guaranteeing the safety of everyone on the coast,” it said.“British nationals belonging to these groups, who are apprehended by law enforcement, will be returned to the border as quickly as possible.”View image in fullscreenRaise the Colours (flags in the Birmingham area, above) has been ‘involved in actions of intimidation against migrants and humanitarian organisations … on the coast of Nord and Pas-de-Calais’, the French prefecture said.Photograph: Richard Saker/The GuardianOn Friday, Thomas posted on X: “Last night I gave an update on the gathering in Dover and on British and English lads travelling to France on the 24th of January. What I need people to understand is this: some details must be held back until the very last moment, not out of secrecy for secrecy’s sake, but because of how important this is and what we’re trying to achieve.“The logistics are being handled carefully, responsibly, and with purpose. When the time is right, people will know what they need to know.”Named afterthe Normandy landingson D-day in 1944, Operation Overlord, when part of Raise the Colours, circulated appeals for stab-proof vests, plate carriers, high-powered torches, thermal cameras, drones and encrypted radios.Lachlan Macrae of Calais Food Collective, an NGO working to support asylum seekers in northern France, said: “We welcome the decision by the French government to ban the actions of those involved with ‘Operation Overlord’. The decision from France shows these people to be what we in Calais always knew them to be, far-right racist agitators who are intent on coming out to France to harass displaced people and threaten violence.“These are British citizens whose movement, groups and rhetoric have been normalised by the British government. They pose a threat to the stability of the UK and are promoting violence and hatred in the UK, too. The British government needs to take action against them and face up to the challenges of racism and hatred.”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

Its slogan is: “Make Hummus Not War.”View image in fullscreenJalil Dabit claps as the activist and artist The Darvish C performs at Kanaan in July 2024.Photograph: Imago/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.The 120-seat restaurant became a neighbourhood mainstay and a potent symbol of dining across religious and political divides.Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, invited the owners to his Berlin palace in late 2023 to share their thoughts on how best to address the tensions sparked locally by the conflict in the Middle East.Ben David used the occasion to call out the country’s often hardline on pro-Palestinian rallies and expressions of support for the Palestinian people.The restaurant’s premises were ransacked in 2024after it hosted a queer Jewish-Muslim brunch and the owners have faced persistent anonymous threats.View image in fullscreenThe mayor of Berlin Kai Wegner, centre, visits Kanaan in a show of support after the restaurant was ransacked in 2024.Photograph: Imago/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Live News.Soon after the attack, Berlin’s mayor, Kai Wegner, visited Kanaan in a show of support that coincided with its regular drag brunch, calling the restaurant “exemplary” in trying to conquer seemingly intractable divisions. An online fundraising campaign to help rebuild drew nearly €30,000 (£26,000).Ben David and Dabit told the Guardian Kanaan would now shut its doors “probably in March” owing to economic factors, the bite of German bureaucracy but also the fraught political environment.“People say: ‘Unless we have a good reason to go out from the house and to spend some money, we want to do it in some quiet Italian place, a Japanese place, without the whole story behind it,’” Ben David said, describing a “political overdose” among patrons over the Middle East conflict.View image in fullscreenJalil Dabit, pictured with Oz Ben David in the kitchen of Kanaan, said its impending closure was ‘bittersweet’.Photograph: Hannibal Hanschke/EPA-EFE/ShutterstockDabit, speaking by telephone from Ramla, a mixed Israeli city of Arabs and Jews, called the impending end of Kanaan “bittersweet”. But he is excited about the television series, which he and Ben David are helping to shape with input on the writing and character development.“It was hard but after I talked with Oz we understood it is the best thing to do,” he said of closing the restaurant. “It’s like if you have a child and release him to the world – it’s a good thing.”Ben David agreed the next step felt like a new beginning, with a chance to spread their message of mutual understanding to a wider audience with the TV series and a Germany-wide cooking tour beginning in April.“It’s no longer (just) a story of Israelis and Palestinians but about people who disagree and still can dream and envision something together,” he said. “Hopefully we will reach more hearts.”Explore more on these topicsGermanyIsraelPalestineIsrael-Gaza warTelevisionRestaurantsMiddle Eastern food and drinknewsShareReuse this content"

Palestinian residents there will have access to basic services like education, healthcare and running water, as long as they submit to biometric data collection and security vetting, according to planning documents and people familiar with the latest round of talks at the US-led Civil Military Coordination Center inIsrael.The planned city would mark the UAE’s first investment in a postwar reconstruction project located in the part of Gaza currently held by Israel. The wealthy Gulf state has contributed more than $1.8bn of humanitarian assistance to Gaza since 7 October 2023, according to UAEstate media, making it Gaza’s largest humanitarian donor.Blueprints for the Emirati-backed endeavor are laid out in anunclassified slide deckobtained by the Guardian and firstreportedby Dropsite, but the UAE’s role as its planned financier has not previously been reported. The presentation was prepared for a cohort of European donors who visited the CMCC on 14 January, according to an aid official who shared details about the briefing on the condition ofanonymity.Israeli military planners have given the plans their stamp of approval.Jared Kushner, Steve Witkoff and Josh Gruenbaum, all members or advisers to the US-led Board of Peace, arrived on Friday in Abu Dhabi to broker peace talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators. The Gulf ally agreed to host the landmark trilateral meeting after pledging its support for several US-led efforts, including the Board of Peace.View image in fullscreenSteve Witkoff speaks alongside Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Thursday.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersThe group is newly mandated to oversee reconstruction efforts inGaza, following Donald Trump’s endorsement of its founding charter on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos.TheUnited Arab Emiratesdid not comment on its decision to endorse the Board of Peace, or its plans to fund one of the first US- and Israeli-backed reconstruction projects in Gaza.One US official said that the first Emirati-backed compound could “become a model” for a string of residential camps that US and Israeli officials have described as “alternative safe communities”.Within the first Rafah community, billed as a “case study”, planners envision several efforts to preventthe influence of Hamas, including the introduction of electronic shekel wallets “to mitigate the diversion of goods and funds to the Hamas financial channels”, and a school curriculum that will “not be Hamas-based”, but supplied by the UAE. Planners also specify that residents will be permitted to “enter and exit the neighborhood freely, subject to security checks to prevent the introduction of weapons and hostile elements”.View image in fullscreenA slide about the plan for Gaza’s new economy.Photograph: Obtained by the GuardianPlans do not indicate who will conduct security checks at the entry and exit points of the planned community.Any new residential compounds will be built atop of the rubble left from Israel’s two-year war on Gaza – an assault that has killed more than 70,000 Palestinians and leveled three-quarters of the structures in Gaza amid Israel’s efforts to rout out Hamas militants after their deadly 7 October attack.Rebuilding Gaza will cost at least $70bn,according to the United Nations, which estimates that at least three-quarters of Gaza’s roads, water pipes and buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardment.UN expertsestimatethat rebuilding efforts could take up to 80 years, given the level of destruction. Clearing debris, disarming unexploded ordnance and retrieving bodies trapped under the rubble could all complicate the process.‘New Rafah’Under the terms of Trump’s brokered peace agreement, Gaza is now divided into two halves: a “green zone”, controlled by the Israeli military; and a “red zone”, in effect governed by Hamas. Initialreconstruction efforts are only slated for the Israeli-held half of Gaza.Kushner dispensed with the artificial red zone and green zone divisions during a presentation at Davos on Thursday, where heunveiledBoard of Peace ambitions to redevelop Gaza’s entire Mediterranean coast. On a slide titled “master plan”, Kushner’s group re-envisioned a map of Gaza featuring eight “residential areas” spanning Gaza, including two development blocks called Rafah 1 and Rafah 2.The first city, called “New Rafah” in the Board of Peace slide deck, would be built during an early phase of Trump’s 20-point peace plan. The Board of Peace plans promise 100,000 permanent housing units, 200 education centers and 75 medical facilities in the new city.View image in fullscreenA slide about the proposed plan for Gaza.Photograph: Obtained by The GuardianA White House spokesperson said that the Emirati-backed compound would be built during the board’s initial reconstruction push.Land-clearing efforts for the Rafah site are already under way, an Israel Defense Forces spokesperson told the Guardian.“Israel’s mission on the east side of the yellow line is to clear the infrastructure in that territory, including tunnels, booby-trapped houses – all of the infrastructure left on our side,” the IDF spokesperson said.They also said that Israel would not participate in building or running the Emirati compound. “When construction begins, that’s when the ISF participates with boots on the ground.”The ISF, or International Stabilization Force, is a concept introduced by the Trump-brokered peace agreement. It envisions countries pledging troops to serve as a neutral security body responsible for overseeing public security in Gaza. Countries have yet to pledge forces.A project timeline obtained by the Guardian indicates that site planning began with a “land deed” review in late October and will entail at least four to six months of preparations before construction begins.A deed review was a top priority for planners, according to two people briefed on the process. If Palestinian landowners can prove deeded claims to the site, Gulf funders and other groups linked to “Gaza’s first planned community” could be accused of forcible displacement of a civilian population, which is a war crime.Daniel Levy, a former Israeli peace negotiator, expressed skepticism that the Emirati-backed compound would ever be built, but said that, either way, the plans serve Israel’s political goals.View image in fullscreenDaniel Levy speaks during a UN security council meeting in New York on 25 February 2025.Photograph: Mostafa Bassim/Anadolu via Getty Images“Without one brick being laid, it gives a further layer of permission to Israel clearing the area, and displacing or killing Palestinians in the process,” Levy said.The Emirates’ participation allows Israel to insist that construction is proceeding with the support of an Arab state, Levy added.“It distracts from the fact that Israel occupies 58% of Gaza because this portion of Gaza they will attempt to label as ‘happy Gaza’, with schools and a judiciary and hospitals,” Levy said.It’s not clear exactly how reconstruction efforts will proceed. United Nations programs that once serviced 80% of Gaza’s schools have been largely dismantled, following Israel’s allegations that UN staff participated in 7 October. And Israel hasbarred several longstanding aid groupsfrom Gaza, including those that oncestaffed and supplied its hospitalsor funded community water projects.Private contractors have been courting White House officials in hopes of securing lucrative reconstruction bids since October, when Trump brokered the peace agreement. One group, led by a Republican insider, has claimed to have an “inside track” to reconstruction work, the Guardianreportedin December.Muhammad Shehada, a visiting Middle East fellow for the European Council on Foreign Relations, said that reconstruction planners at the CMCC seem to be operating under the assumption that Palestinians will leave the Hamas-controlled red zone and move into newly constructed communities “if you dump enough food there”.He said that those tactics may not work and overlooked the politics of the area, which he said “did not interest” military planners.View image in fullscreenBuildings lie in ruins amid the rubble in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip on 8 December 2025.Photograph: Nir Elias/ReutersTo move into the Emirati compound, Palestinians living in the “red zone” will have to cross an Israeli checkpoint into the “green zone”. Next, they will be subjected to “security vetting” and “biometric documentation”. The plans do not specify who would complete the vetting or manage biometric data collection, nor do they articulate why someone would be turned away.Palestinians approved for entry will use their Palestinian ID numbers, as issued by the Palestinian Authority in coordination with Israel’s COGAT, the Israeli agency charged with administration of Gaza, to join the community registry, planning documents say.Matt Mahmoudi, an assistant professor at the University of Cambridge and researcher and adviser on AI and human rights at Amnesty International, reviewed planning documents for “Gaza’s first planned community” and raised concerns the plan would “expand biometric surveillance in Gaza”.“Israel’s deployment of biometric surveillance reinforces apartheid and the oppression of Palestinians by perpetuating a coercive environment intended to force Palestinians out of areas of strategic interest to Israeli authorities,” Mahmoudi said.Should Palestinians voluntarily subject themselves to the surveillance and biometric measures proposed for “Gaza’s first planned community”, Levy and others suggested that Israel would be happy to see this first “case study” succeed.“As far as Israel is concerned, if Gaza ends up with four or so model Palestinian communities of say 25,000 each, all of them vetted, and everything else is a hellscape where you’re further encouraging the ethnic cleansing, or the physical removal of Palestinians from there, that’s a desirable outcome.”Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited Arab EmiratesMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinenewsShareReuse this content"

It was later established that the phones of the interior minister and the agriculture minister had also been targeted.The revelations led to thedismissal of Spain’s spy chief, Paz Esteban, and the admission that there had been “shortcomings” within the country’s national intelligence centre (CNI).In a decision announced on Thursday, Judge José Luis Calama at the Audiencia Nacional in Madrid said the investigation into the use of Pegasus was being dropped for the second time because of a continuing lack of cooperation from Israel.He said the court had been obliged to shelve the case because the Israeli authorities’ failure to respond to requests for information – in the form of letters rogatory – had impeded “the investigation into the attribution of the authorship of the investigated facts to any specific person”.4:55Pegasus: the spyware technology that threatens democracy – videoCalama said Israel’s failure to respond to his requests violated two international legal agreements it had signed, and he said its behaviour in the Pegasus case “disrupts the balance inherent in international cooperation and violates the principle of good faith that should govern relations between states”.Calama originally ended the investigation in July 2023 but reopened it a few months later after the French authorities provided information on the use of Pegasus to infect the mobile phones ofFrench ministers, MPs, lawyers and journalists.In this week’s ruling, the judge said the material received from France did not contain any new information that would have allowed him to identify who had used Pegasus to target the Spanish politicians.Calama said he had been frustrated by the Israeli authorities’ repeated failure to respond to his inquiries, which had included a request to take a statement from NSO’s chief executive. Without such cooperation, the judge said, his investigation “remains dormant … until information obtained through a possible, and unlikely, fulfilment of the letter rogatory that the state of Israel has obstructed, or until new sources of evidence [emerge], allowing the investigation to continue”.In a statement sent to the Guardian when news of the targeting broke, NSO Group said its “firm stance on these issues is that the use of cyber tools in order to monitor politicians, dissidents, activists and journalists is a severe misuse of any technology and goes against the desired use of such critical tools”.It said it was committed to investigating “any suspicion of misuse, and will cooperate and assist with any governmental investigation of these issues”.It added: “NSO is a software provider, the company does not operate the technology nor is privy to the collected data. The company does not and cannot know who the targets of its customers are, yet implements measures to ensure that these systems are used solely for the authorised uses.”NSO and the Israeli government have been approached for comment.In July 2020, ajoint investigationby the Guardian and El País revealed that senior pro-independence Catalan politicians were warned their mobile phones had been targeted using Pegasus spyware.Two years later, cybersecurity experts at Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto said the devices of at least 63 people connected with the Catalan independence movement had beentargeted or infected with the spywarebetween 2017 and 2020. It subsequently emerged that 18 of the 63 Catalan activists hadbeen spied on legallyand with the relevant judicial approval by the CNI.Explore more on these topicsSpainPedro SánchezEspionageIsraelEuropeMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The Home Office claims the reforms are the biggest in two centuries.But one serving chief told the Guardian: “It’s a power grab by national politicians for influence in policing.”Among the changes are targets for forces on how quickly they respond to emergency calls, the satisfaction of crime victims with the service they receive, and public trust and confidence in their local force.A source said the results would be published on a dashboard, so people could compare their area to others.Nationally set targets were introduced under the Blair government, but fell out of favour and were abolished in 2011 when the Conservative-led coalition was in power.The reforms generally have broad support from police chiefs, but some of the measures are more controversial.One said national targets, with forces potentially ranked in league tables, could lead to perverse incentives. “People worry about their position in league tables as opposed to the quality of service,” they said. “What gets measured gets done, and what does not get measured does not get done.”Another chief in a different part ofEnglandsaid: “You can hit the target and miss the point.”As part of boosting crime fighting, the home secretary will take powers to intervene directly in forces by sending in special teams. TheHome Officegave the example of a force where crime clear-up rates are low having teams sent in from another force where they are higher.The home secretary will also take powers to oust chief constables deemed to be failing.Since 2011, policing powers have been devolved locally, with elected police and crime commissioners (PCCs) in charge of priorities and budgets, chief constables given operational control, and central government having limited powers. PCCs will be abolished by 2028.View image in fullscreenHome secretary Shabana Mahmood has described her approach in private to police reform as ‘we go large, or we go home’.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPAThe philosophy of Labour’s reforms is that it is right that the centrally elected government holds policing accountable, and current localised systems have been ineffective at doing so.Mahmood said: “It is essential that the people can determine what they expect from their forces.“I will make police forces accountable to parliament – driving up standards so they fight more crime in their communities.”The white paper containing the reforms, being officially trailed ahead of its unveiling to parliament on Monday, is called: “From local to national: a new model for policing.”Sources said it will cost £500m over three years, and police chiefs who support it believe the upfront expense will be recouped through savings.The Guardian reported last April that police chiefs had asked government for a new national centre for policingto include counter-terrorismand the fight against serious and organised crime. In July,they asked for fewer forces.Mahmood has privately described her approach to police reform as: “We go large, or we go home.”She is expected to back a “significant” cut in the 43 forces currently carrying out local policing in England andWales, but not announce a number the government backs. A commission will instead review the issue and suggest which forces should merge, with chiefs supporting a number between 12 and 15.One chief welcomed government pledges to protect and enhance neighbourhood policing in the reforms, but warned recent results showed problems in bigger forces, with smaller ones clearing up more crime. “Big forces don’t necessarily improve performance,” they said.Implementation of force mergers and abolitions could be years away, and one chief said: “It feels like it is being kicked into the long grass.”Mergers are at risk from many factors, including local sensibilities and cultures.The PCC for Devon and Cornwall released a survey showing 66% want the force to stay as it is, with only 18% preferring a bigger regional force and just 1.5% wanting Cornwall to get its own police officers.One source suggested a reason some people in Cornwall might want little to do with their neighbours in Devon: “They think they are too English.”Explore more on these topicsPoliceCrimeEnglandWalesPolice and crime commissionersHome OfficeShabana MahmoodnewsShareReuse this content"

On Friday night, the government was forced to delay its bill on the Chagos Islands in the House of Lords.Labour sources insisted it was a temporary pause because Tories had tried to wreck the bill but it comes after Trump said it was a great act of stupidity, with suggestions the US may be able to block the transfer due to a 1961 treaty.Starmer’s decision to call the president’s Afghanistan remarks “appalling” risks a further diplomatic rupture with the White House, but No 10 made the decision to speak out amid fury among veterans groups and the families of soldiers who lost their lives.After a day of mounting outrage around the world over the US president’s claim that British andNatotroops who fought in Afghanistan avoided the frontlines, he paid tribute to the 457 members of the armed services who lost their lives during the conflict.“I will never forget their courage, their bravery and the sacrifice that they made for their country,” the prime minister said on Friday. “There are many also who were injured, some with life-changing injuries.“And so I consider President Trump’s remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I’m not surprised they caused such hurt to the loved ones of those who were killed or injured.”1:15Starmer calls Trump's comments on Nato and Afghanistan ‘insulting’ – videoAsked if he would call for an apology from the president, Starmer said: “If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologise.”But the prime minister stressed the importance of the “very close” relationship with the US for Britain’s security, adding: “It is because of that relationship that we fought alongside the Americans for our values in Afghanistan. And it was in that context that people lost their lives or suffered terrible injuries, fighting for freedom, fighting with our allies for what we believe in.”Trump’s suggestion in an interview with Fox News on Thursday that Nato troops hadstayed “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistanprompted widespread condemnation across the political spectrum and resurfaced questions about his own avoidance of military servicein Vietnam.The president has previously been criticised for avoiding being conscripted to fight in Vietnam after being diagnosed withbone spurs in his heels– a medical claim that has been subject to significant doubt.View image in fullscreenPeople have pointed to Donald Trump’s medical exemption from fighting in the Vietnam war after his recent comments.Photograph: Francis Chung/EPAIn the interview, Trump said: “[Nato will] say they sent some troops to Afghanistan … and they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the frontlines.”Speaking in Davos on Wednesday, he made similar claims against the 32-member military alliance, saying: “I know them all very well. I’m not sure that they’d be there. I know we’d be there for them. I don’t know that they would be there for us.”A total of 3,486 Nato troops died in the 20-year Afghanistan conflict, of whom 2,461 were US service personnel. Canada recorded 165 deaths, including civilians.Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, accused Trump of “denigrating” British troops and said his comments were “flat-out nonsense”. Posting on X shortly before Starmer’s afternoon broadcast, the Reform UK leader, Nigel Farage, said: “Donald Trump is wrong. For 20 years our armed forces fought bravely alongside America’s in Afghanistan.”The Liberal Democrats urged Starmer to summon the US ambassador “over this insult to our brave troops”, with the Lib Dem leader,Ed Davey, accusing Trump of avoiding military service. “How dare he question their sacrifice. Farage and all the others still fawning over Trump should be ashamed,” he said. It is understood there has not been any call between No 10 and Trump and the UK is not considering admonishing the US ambassador.The defence secretary, John Healey, said the UK and Nato allies had “answered the US call”, and the war dead should “be remembered for who they were: heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation”.10:09Is this the week Trump went too far? | The LatestWithout referring to Trump by name, the armed forces minister, Al Carns, a former marine who served and led during four tours in Afghanistan and was awarded the military cross in 2011, said the claims were “utterly ridiculous”, and invited anyone believing the remarks to meet him and some of the bereaved families.The Duke of Sussex, who undertook two frontline tours to Afghanistan, said the “sacrifices” of British soldiers “deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect”.“I served there. I made lifelong friends there. And I lost friends there,” said Prince Harry. “Thousands of lives were changed for ever. Mothers and fathers buried sons and daughters. Children were left without a parent. Families are left carrying the cost.”Diane Dernie, whose son Ben Parkinson sustained horrific injuries when an army Land Rover hit a mine near Musa Qala in 2006, said the president’s comments were “beyond belief” and urged Starmer to “call him out”.View image in fullscreenL/Bdr Ben Parkinson with his mother, Diane Dernie, and stepfather, Andrew.Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PAShe said: “Come and look at us, the life that Ben leads 19-and-a-half years on, still fighting for his care, still fighting for him to have a decent life, recovering from a recent operation.“To hear this man say: ‘Oh, well, you just fannied about behind the frontlines’ … It’s the ultimate insult.”Trump’s remarks also drew international criticism. The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, said: “No one has the right to mock the service of our soldiers.”Writingin the Guardian, Adam Price, the Danish writer who created the TV series Borgen, said: “How utterly insulting for the families, still mourning their dead, to hear the ingratitude of a US president so ignorant of their loss.” Denmark, which has been at loggerheads with the US overTrump’s designs on Greenland, had 44 combat deaths in Afghanistan, the most per capita outside the US.Calvin Bailey, a Labour MP and former RAF officer who served alongside US special operations units in Afghanistan, said Trump’s claim “bears no resemblance to the reality experienced by those of us who served there”.View image in fullscreenLabour MP Calvin Bailey is a former RAF officer who served in Afghanistan.Photograph: Mrs Sharron Floyd/Sharron Floyd/MODThe Conservative MP Ben Obese-Jecty, who served in Afghanistan as a captain in the Royal Yorkshire Regiment, said it was “sad to see our nation’s sacrifice, and that of our Nato partners, held so cheaply by the president of the United States”.The former head of the British army Lord Dannatt condemned the comments on TalkTV, saying: “He has got the disrespect and outrageous choice of words to say that we hung back from the frontline. My God, we were certainly on the frontline, as 457 young people died.”Stephen Stewart, a former soldier and an author and journalist, said Trump’s comments were “as offensive as they are inaccurate”, while Richard Streatfeild, a former army major in Afghanistan and now a Liberal Democrat councillor, said: “To be told that your service is not as demanding or as difficult as the Americans’ is untrue and deeply insulting.”The US remains the only country to have invoked article 5 of Nato’s collective security provision, activated after the 11 September terrorist attacks in 2001.Trump has also faced criticism in the US. The former Nato supreme allied commander James Stavridis said hundreds of allied troops had died under his command on the frontlines in Afghanistan. “I honour their memory every single day,” said the retired US Navy admiral.Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to China, described Trump’s remarks as “shameful”, adding: “We need our allies but are driving them away.”Sami Sadat, the former commanding general of Afghan Special Operation Corps, said Trump was wrong, adding that he was “grateful to each and every one of the Nato countries who helped us”.Late on Friday the White House rejected the UK’s criticism. “President Trump is absolutely right – the United States of America has done more for Nato than any other country in the alliance has done combined,” said spokesperson Taylor Rogers.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNatoMilitaryAfghanistanForeign policyKeir StarmerKemi BadenochnewsShareReuse this content"

Other arrests took place of a man, 30, in Birmingham and a woman, 40, in north London, both of whom have been released on bail.The seventh arrest on Friday was of a 25-year-old man who was arrested in Warwickshire and remains in custody in a London police station.Counter-terrorism detectives say they also carried out a series of searches, with four in Birmingham, one in Coventry, one in Warwickshire and two at sites in London.Police said the investigation continues and added: “Detectives are keeping an open mind as to any potential motivation behind the incidents. Officers are also keeping an open mind as to whether any of the incidents are potentially linked, and this remains an active line of inquiry being considered.”Akbar, 48, told the Guardian he was in hiding after the attacks: “They are trying to scare and intimidate me, and I am pretty scared. I fear for my life and for my family’s lives.”The human rights barrister added: “I am a Pakistani dissident living in exile here. I am an open critic of the Pakistani regime, which is backed by the military.“I cannot say who did it. However, one thing is certain: it was a targeted attack and the people who attacked were probably hired by someone.”Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismPakistanImran KhannewsShareReuse this content"

This, it appears, enabled him to gather information about the campaigners to pass on to police.He helped supervise the acquisition and distribution of equipment, such as rope and harnesses.The radio engineer also helped to set up a network of CB radios so that activists camped at different points along the planned route could warn each other about likely moves by the police. He was nicknamed “Radio Nick”.Policehave previously disclosedthat, in an apparently unprecedented move, they paid a private security firm to infiltrate the Newbury campaigners. They believed that this was necessary as the cost of policing the protest was escalating.It is understood that in turn the private security firm hired Gratwick to spy on the protesters. Thames Valley police, which policed the protests, declined to comment.Gratwick also infiltrated animal rights groups, including thecampaign to shut a laboratory run by a commercial firm, Huntingdon Life Sciences.After he was arrested last March on suspicion of the paedophile charges, Gratwick, whose full name is Edward Nicholas Gratwick, had hinted at his previous covert role during interviews with the NationalCrimeAgency.His work as an informer was subsequently confirmed at his six-week trial at Guildford crown court inSurrey.Court papers disclosed that “records show that during the eight-year period between 1995 and 2003, [Gratwick] provided information to police for a total period of approximately six years. He provided information on animal rights and environmental matters.”Kathryn Hirst, defending Gratwick, said that in the past he had “proved very useful to investigating authorities”, without specifying how.He had been arrested at Stansted airport as he was about to fly to Bucharest to rape the 10-year-old girl.The jury dismissed his claim that he had created a false identity to ingratiate himself with paedophiles, with the aim of gathering information to help convict them. The judge said the jury had seen through his claim and “unmasked” him.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

A candidate will be chosen within a week.Burnham has not confirmed he intends to run for the seat but he made no secret of his ambitions. In the runup to the party’s conference last year he said many MPs hadurged him to run for Labour leader, prompting outrage within No 10 and among cabinet ministers.He would have to stand down as mayor of Greater Manchester if he were to run. Bev Craig, the leader of Manchester city council, is another possible Labour contender, believed to be favoured by allies of Starmer.Reports on Friday suggested Burnham could try to line up a high-profile figure to run as Labour candidate for Greater Manchester mayor, such as the footballer Gary Neville, if he were to resign to seek a Westminster seat.The byelection is shaping up to be a hotly contested race, with Zack Polanski, the Green party leader, not ruling himself out, and George Galloway, the independent former MP and Workers party leader also hinting he could stand. Reform UK could also stand a chance, with possible contenders including the policy chief, Zia Yusuf, or a former Tory MP such as Jonathan Gullis.The contest was triggered by the resignation of the independent MP Andrew Gwynne on medical grounds, immediately sparking speculation that Burnham could be in parliament in time for any potential leadership challenge to Starmer if May’s local elections are disastrous for Labour.The Guardianreported on Thursdaythat allies of Starmer were trying to prevent Burnham’s return. Members of the party’s ruling national executive committeepredictedit would be impossible for Burnham to make it through the selection process given the number of Starmer loyalists on the body.But Andrea Egan, the new general secretary of Unison, warned against “control-freakery” in the party. “I’m sure all trade unionists expect a democratic process for Gorton & Denton in which local party members decide who they want to represent them,” she said on X.“We’ve seen enough control-freakery in the Labour party and it has done our movement nothing but harm.”Jo White, a leading MP who runs Labour’s so-called red wall group of MPs, said: “Let the north decide who their Labour candidate should be for the Gorton and Denton byelection. A London stitch-up will be a disaster for Labour.”One northern backbencher said it wasn’t just a leftwing caucus of MPs who were hoping Burnham would make a return to Westminster. “There’s a few of us thinking it would be a sign of weakness for the PM to block him via the NEC.”They added that if speculation that Yusuf and Polanski could stand materialised, then Burnham would be the centrist candidate. “I wouldn’t want to see him challenge for leader this year, but I think we need stronger northern representation in government.”Stephen Kinnock, a health minister, insisted the process would be the same as any other candidate selection, despite rumours it could be limited to an all-women or all black, Asian and minority ethnic shortlist. He said Burnham was “doing a great job in the role that he currently has” and was an “incredibly talented and effective leader as the mayor of Greater Manchester”.Allies of Burnham suggested there would be significant disquiet among MPs, unions and party members should the leadership try to block him from returning to parliament, where he served as the MP for Leigh from 2001 to 2017.He has long been believed to be seeking a return to parliament tostand for the leadershipif there was a challenge to Starmer, but was thought to have limited options for a byelection in the north-west of England.Labour won the seat under Gwynne, who was later suspended from the party, with a 13,413 majority in 2024. Reform and the Greens were in second and third place and almost neck and neck, with 14% and 13% of the vote respectively.Explore more on these topicsAndy BurnhamKeir StarmerLabourAngela RaynernewsShareReuse this content"

A video accompanying the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.The US military has carried out more than 30 strikes against boats that it alleges were smuggling drugs off South American waters since early September. Those strikes have killed more than 100 people, according to the Associated Press, citing information from theTrump administration.The US military has more recently been focused on seizing sanctioned oil tankers with connections to Venezuela, in the wake of the surprise raid to capture Maduro and bring him to New York to face drug trafficking charges. Last week, US forces in the Caribbean Seaseized an oil tankerthat Trump said had ties to Venezuela.The Trump administration has moved to control the distribution of Venezuela’s oil products globally after ousting Maduro. Since then, Trump has announced an agreement with Venezuela’s interim leaders that he said would provide up to50m barrels of crude oilto the US. He also signed an executive order to “safeguard” Venezuelan oil revenues in US-controlled accounts.The last boat strikes occurred in late December, when the military said it struck five alleged drug-smuggling boats over two days, killing a total of eight people while others jumped overboard.

Yet he may have undermined its potential attractions by insisting on inviting the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to join – despite his refusal to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.Indeed, by any objective reckoning it could be argued that Davos was the venue where the much-abused Nato allies began to fight back – as evidenced by the fighting rhetoric of Macron, Von der Leyen and the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, who told the gathering the day before Trump’s arrival that the changes being wrought in the US’s relations with its allies signaled not “transition” but “rupture”.Yet with the ever-capricious Trump, any perceived gain may turn out to be a mirage.Was his demand for Greenland ever real in the first place? Or just a play to keep erstwhile allies – already maligned in theWhite House national security strategyfor surrendering to “civilizational erasure” – off balance and vulnerable to a mercurial president’s every whim?Domestically, some of Trump’s critics have surmised that the Greenland strategy is little more than a ploy to draw attention from the Epstein files, surely an enduring achilles heel.What was undoubtedly real to his audience in Davos was Trump’s malevolent, bile-filled contempt for countries that have for generations been considered America’s friends.No one had ever done as much for Nato as he; the US would always be there for Nato, but he doubted Washington’s partners would be there for it in a crisis – overlooking the reality that the only time the alliance has invoked its article 5 requiring all its members to come to the defence of an ally was after the al-Qaida attacks of September 11, 2001.Without the US military, said the man who avoided the Vietnam draft, all Europeans would be speaking German – oblivious to the fact that he was in a German-speaking region of a country with a nearly two-thirds German language majority.At least three times in a meandering speech replete with false statements, he referred to Greenland as Iceland, a separate country whose sovereignty is recognized at the United Nations. The error was only exacerbated by attempts by the White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, to deny that he had made it, despite video evidence to the contrary.Such glaring frailties, an increasing feature of Trump’s public appearances, make contriving a victory from his Davos appearance a stretch for all but his most ardent proponents.Yet so mercurial is the nature of his second presidency that his Nato partners dare not regard the avoidance of disaster over Greenland as anything more than a respite before the next crisis.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpDavosUS foreign policyanalysisShareReuse this content"

Among them was the head of America’s largest bank: Jamie Dimon, the chair and chief executive of JP Morgan.Dimon’s name alone was a boon to Trump’s nascent political credibility. Easily the biggest name on Wall Street, Dimon – now 69 andpaid $43m last year– was feted for steering JP Morgan through the 2008 banking crisis and on to enviable financial success.Rumours were also swirling that the executive would be tapped to serve in Trump’s administration. And while Dimon, a lifelong Democrat, reportedly turned down an offer to lead the US Treasury department, the pair continued to be on surprisingly good terms. “I’d try to help any president of the US because I’m a patriot,”Dimon told shareholders. Even Vanity Fair commented onDimon’s “unbridled optimism”despite the new president’s growing list of gaffes.A decade on, the pair’s relationship has hit rock bottom.View image in fullscreenThe JP Morgan Chase building in New York.Photograph: Justin Lane/EPATrump on Thursday took aim at his one-time ally, launching a$5bn (£3.7bn) lawsuit against JP Morgan and Dimonover claims the bank had unfairly closed his accounts for political reasons after the 6 January Capitol riots in 2021. JP Morgan said that while it closed accounts that created legal or regulatory risk for the bank, the lawsuit itself “has no merit”.While this may not be the absolute end of the relationship between the billionaires, there were signs their once-affable relationship could become rocky even from the start of Trump’s first term.Back in 2017, months after Trump’s first inauguration, Dimon said he had disagreed with, but tolerated, Trump’s controversial decision topull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. But he drew a line after Trumpfailed to denounce white supremacistswho took part in a violent and fatal rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in the summer of 2017.Theeconomic advisory council, which counted General Motors, Walmart, and Disney bosses among its top brass, quickly disbanded in response. “It is a leader’s role, in business or government, to bring people together, not tear them apart,” Dimon said.View image in fullscreenDimon at the recent World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersPersonal tensions between the pair also escalated. Dimon, addressing speculation over his own presidential ambitions,told a panel in New Yorkin late 2018: “I think I could beat Trump … because I’m as tough as he is, I’m smarter than he is.” He added: “And by the way, this wealthy New Yorker actually earned his money. It wasn’t a gift from daddy.”Regret for his comments did not appease Trump, who responded online that Dimon did not have the “aptitude or ‘smartness’ & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess”.Still, the two had common ground. Despite their personal friction, Dimon made positive sounds about Trump’s tax cuts and nascent China trade deal, just months before the ground was laid for this week’s big lawsuit. But the shocking Capitol riots prompted swift condemnation from bosses including Dimon – and, Trump claims, resulted in the unfairclosure of his JP Morgan bank accounts. The row is reminiscent of thedisputebetween Nigel Farage and NatWest in the UK, which ultimately led to thedeparture of the bank’s chief executive, Alison Rose.Those simmering tensions boiled over into Trump’s second presidential run. “Highly overrated Globalist Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMORGAN, is quietly pushing another non-Maga person, Nikki Haley, for President,” Trump said in aposton Truth Social in late November 2023. “I’ve never been a big Jamie Dimon fan … I guess I don’t have to live with him any more, and that’s a really good thing.”View image in fullscreenDimon has warned about the risks of Trump’s continued undermining of Federal Reserve independence and of its chair, Jerome Powell.Photograph: Richard Drew/APBut until this month, the war of words between Trump and Dimon seemed to be on pause. Despite market turmoil triggered by Trump’s unpredictable trade and tariff policies, banks such asJP Morganhave been largely appeased. The president’s bonfire of regulation was widely welcomed, as was capitulation to Wall Street’s longstanding campaign for looser capital rules.However, Trump’s sustained attacks on the chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell – which have culminated in a highly controversial Department of Justicecriminal investigation– proved a step too far.Dimon publiclybacked Powellearlier this month, telling reporters that the widely condemned investigation was putting the central bank’s independence at risk. “And anything [that] chips away at that is probably not a great idea, and in my view, will have the reverse consequences. It’ll raise inflation expectations and probably increase [interest] rates over time,” he said.Policies that threaten JP Morgan’s profit margins, such as Trump’s plans for a10% capon US credit card interest rates, have also drawn Dimon’s ire.But Trump has continued to throw blows: “I think it’s fine what I’m doing,” Trump said. He called Powell “a bad Fed person” who had “done a bad job” and again called for lower rates.“Jamie Dimon probably wants higher rates. Maybe he makes more money that way,” Trump said.At the World Economic Forum in Davos this week, Dimonwarned that AI could cause civil unrestand was critical of Trump’s interest rates cap proposal, calling the idea a potential “economic disaster”.He alsosuggestedthat the US had become less reliable under Trump. “If you said to me: ‘Has America become unreliable?’ No,” Dimon said at an event. “It’s just, you had total reliance, and now it’s less reliable.” A day later, Trump launched his lawsuit.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpJamie DimonTrump administrationTrump tariffsJP MorganBankingTariffsanalysisShareReuse this content"

Thousands of people took the day off from their jobs to join the action, while others participated by not shopping on Friday. The Minneapolis city councilendorsedthe day of action and the general strike.The state’s cultural institutions – including the Walker Art Center, the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Science Museum of Minnesota and the Minnesota Children’s Museum –closedon Friday as well.During a protest at the Minneapolis-St Paul airport on Friday morning, hundreds of clergy members called for an end to the ICE surge and urged airline companies to join them in opposing ICE in the state. Video of the action showed hundreds of people walking outside the airport in sub-zero temperatures, singing songs and praying together. Deportation flights go in and out of the airport daily.On Friday afternoon, thousands clad in winter gear and carrying signs filled the streets of downtown Minneapolis to march in subzero temperatures, ending in a rally inside the Target Center, an arena downtown.“We are going to be having dangerously cold weather on Friday – -10F with wind chills. Like the high is going to be -10F with wind chills of up to -20F,” Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, president of theMinnesotaRegional Labor Federation, AFL-CIO, had told the Guardian earlier.“We are a northern state, and we are built for the cold, and we are going to show up, but folks are going to need to pay attention to not just the march, but what people are doing, the individual stories of solidarity that people are going to be doing.”The Minnesota AFL-CIO, the state’s federation of more than 1,000 affiliated local unions,endorsedthe day of action, along with dozens of local labor unions.“I think what generated the idea for this action came out of the need to figure out what we can meaningfully do to stop it,” Kieran Knutson, the president of Communications Workers of America (CWA) Local 7250 inMinneapolis,told the Guardian last week. “The government in the state ofMinnesotahas not offered any path towards stopping these attacks, this violence.”13:09The occupation of Minneapolis: how residents are resisting Trump’s ICE 'invasion' – videoA childcare worker in Minneapolis, who requested anonymity for fear of retaliation toward the immigrant families they serve, said they were shutting down for the day after consulting and receiving immense support from the families of the children they care for.“We had time to ask the families that we serve if they would be on board with shutting down and we got a hugely positive response,” they said. “We serve families that are on childcare assistance, families that pay out of pocket. So they were all in agreement, even ones that have been trying to go to work, even during this time where they were fearful of being out of their houses. So it was really the families. They all stood up for it, too.”Number of people in ICE detention hits record high, data showsRead moreAt the University of Minnesota campuses in Minneapolis, St Paul, and Duluth, labor unions representing student workers and staff have called for the university system to shut down on Friday to allow students and workers to participate in the day of action.The University of Minnesota graduate labor union said ICE’s operations have had an impact on student workers since the beginning of the Trump administration. In early 2025, at least three international students at the University of Minnesota werearrested and detainedby ICE, despite an immigration judge ordering their release.“It’s really concerning to us that the university is remaining neutral in a time when immigrant communities and international students are literally under attack,” said Abaki Beck, president of the University of Minnesota graduate labor union. “One of the other things we’re pushing for on campus specifically is increased support for immigrant workers and international students.”A spokesperson for the University of Minnesota cited aguidance memofrom university leadership in response to the day of action. They said in a statement: “The University of Minnesota fully supports the rights of faculty, staff, and students to engage in lawful civic expression. We also must ensure continuity of operations and meet our responsibilities to students and the university community.”The Department of Homeland Security (DHS)claimedto have made 3,000 arrests in Minnesota over the past six weeks.The US armyput 1,500 soldierson standby for possible deployment to Minnesota, as 3,000 immigration officers have beendispatchedto the state by the Trump administration.“This is beyond insane. Why would these labor bosses not want these public safety threats out of their communities?” a DHS spokesperson said in an email in response to the economic blackout.“These are the criminals these labor bosses are trying to protect,” the spokesperson added, citing 23 uncaptioned photos of claimed undocumented immigrants with criminal records who have been arrested by ICE.Nationwide, immigrants withno criminal recordcontinue to make up the largest group in US immigration detention, which is atrecord levels.Explore more on these topicsMinnesotaBuilding powerMinnesota ICE shootingEconomicsICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.Much of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked byDonald Trump’s on-off tariff threatsover the future of Greenland.But many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.Georgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.Lagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.But Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Work & careersComputingEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.The year of the ‘hectocorn’: the $100bn tech companies that could float in 2026Read moreLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.Reports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI,the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. Thepotential IPOshave been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms anddatacentres into orbit.Referring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AIIPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment.

The pair wreaked havoc, sacking Maye five times and forcing him into three of his four fumbles. The Los Angeles Chargers also forced two from him in the wildcard round. Denver led the league in sacks (68) in the regular season, and will be intent on causing similar damage on Sunday. But Maye can mitigate that threat if he sharpens his awareness in the pocket and takes the sack rather than rushing into impossible passes. New England’s left tackle Will Campbell is very likely to lose a couple of duels with edge defender Nik Bonitto, so Maye needs to be ready for a helmet sandwich while holding on to the ball for dear life. Simply punting and giving Denver’s second-string quarterback, Jarrett Stidham, tough field position may be all it takes to reach the Super Bowl.What Denver need to do to win:Limit the Patriots to 20 points or fewer. Stidham then needs to stay calm and manage the offense with care rather than forcing the ball against a team with a great defense. It would be ideal if Denver can generate a huge day in the run game but withoutthe injured Bo Nix’sscrambles they just don’t have the quality to ease the burden on Stidham. So it’s up to you Stiddy … or is it? Denver’s receivers certainly need to do a better job of catching the ball – specifically their best wideout, Courtland Sutton, who endured a serious case of dropsy against Buffalo. The offensive line is rock solid, but even so Stidham will have to be patient and wait for his wide men to get open rather than panicking in the face of pressure. CJ Stroud’s meltdown last week is a cautionary tale about what happens when New England’s QB hunters get in your head.Key player for the Patriots:Stefon Diggs, wide receiver. Diggs is the perfect antidote to Denver’s excellent passing defense. The 32-year-old still has immaculate hands and is as reliable as they come, finishing 12th for receptions in the regular season despite being 34th for total targets, with only two drops. If Maye finds Diggs in the end zone you can guarantee the receiver will rise to the occasion.Key player for the Broncos:Garett Bolles, left tackle. The veteran just keeps getting better, and he earned his first All-Pro accolade this season at 33 years old. In 2025, Bolles allowed just six QB hits and zero sacks across the regular season. That’s exactly the kind of protection Stidham needs in only the fifthNFLstart of his career.Prediction:Patriots over Broncos. The home crowd spurring on Denver’s defense to even greater heights will make it close, just not close enough. The Broncos offense is likely to be overmatched and outscored by Maye’s superior ability to make plays under pressure.View image in fullscreenSam Darnold and Matthew Stafford meet again on Sunday.Photograph: Sean M Haffey/Getty ImagesLos Angeles Rams v Seattle Seahawks (Sunday 6.30pm ET/11.30pm GMT)What Los Angeles need to do to win:Running back Kyren Williams can unlock Seattle’s disciplined, fast and destructive defense, which is led by linebacker Ernest Jones. To help beat a team that will dare Matthew Stafford to throw by showing light boxes, Williams has to shine. Fortunately for the Rams he is one of the most patient rushers in the NFL, always waiting for gaps to develop before punching through. The Rams’ elite pass protection also gives Sean McVay the flexibility to keep Stafford safe in the pocket against a menacing Seattle front. If Williams can keep moving the chains and force the Seahawks to bring an extra safety into the box, deep shots to Puka Nacua and Davante Adams should open up. The Rams will then find the rhythm needed to overcome Seattle’s mean machine.What Seattle need to do to win:The Seahawks have lost a key piece of their offensive gameplan. Zach Charbonnet’s torn ACL means Seattle’s run game will go through Kenneth Walker III, a change that risks slowing down the offense’s efficiency. The Seahawks need to scheme up the passing game to make up for the shortfall, rather than throw in a rusty Cam Akers. Akers, recently on the practice squad, may keep Walker’s legs fresh but he isn’t likely to do any damage to the Rams. A more potent threaten is Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Rashid Shaheed receiving quick, high percentage throws and speeding away with yards after the catch.Key player for the Rams:Kevin Dotson, right guard. The offensive lineman has been stewing for weeks, after Seattle’s Derick Hall stepped on Dotson when he was down injured in LA’sepic defeatat Lumen Field in week 16. “I’m not going to hold nothing against him until I can see him and get my get-back. Not gonna step on nobody, I’ll get it between the whistles,” Dotson said before facing Chicago last week. Bold to call your shot a game early but the brilliant run blocker has earned his chance to dominate the enemy.Key player for the Seahawks:Sam Darnold, quarterback.“We want him to be decisive and rip it,” said Seattle head coach Mike Macdonald last month on what he expects from the best version of Darnold we have seen yet. When he is protected and letting it fly, few are better in the NFL and, thanks to a palate-cleansing first playoff win last week, Darnold could find his flow state quickly. The Seahawks may need him to: they have a hamstrung running game, and this one could quickly turn into a shootout.Prediction:Seahawks over Rams. Whoever has the ball last wins this one, but it is Macdonald’s team who have been more consistent. Stafford’s struggle to complete passes in Chicago last week was noteworthy; he is facing a tougher defense in just as hostile environs on Sunday. A raucous home crowd will boost Seattle to the Super Bowl.Explore more on these topicsNFLDenver BroncosSeattle SeahawksLos Angeles RamsNew England PatriotsUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIn an exclusive interview at his base, athletics’ ‘iron man’ reveals why his career feels like ‘99% losses’ but he plans to retire as the greatest distance runner in historyBySean Inglein Sandnes, NorwayFri 23 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 17.15 ESTShareOn a bone-cold new year’s morning, the world’s most compelling athlete is sweating so much that tiny puddles are starting to ooze across his treadmill.For 40 minutes Jakob Ingebrigtsen makes 6min 40sec mile pace look like a Sunday stroll, breezily chatting away even as the heatbox in his home gym pushes the temperature inside to more than 32.4C (90F). Only when I ask the double Olympic champion what his super-strength is does he pause to take a proper breath. “In Norwegian we have a word for it,” he eventually replies. “Ingen kompromiss. No compromise.”For the final 20 minutes of his run, Ingebrigtsen starts to push it. The music goes on. The treadmill is cranked up to 5:13 minute-per-mile pace. His pulse steadily climbs from 130 to 172 beats per minute. Sweat starts to flow. And, as he finishes, it seems apposite that Black Sabbath are pounding away on the stereo. “Running as fast as they can, Iron Man lives again!”Because after a year from hell in 2025, during which the Norwegian injured his achilles and was involved in ahighly public court case against his fatherand former coach, Gjert, track and field’s iron man is ready to run fast again.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen in his garden gym. He ran twice on Christmas Day.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenEvery morning he does a 40-45 minute run on a treadmill.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenHe can turn up the temperature to mimic hot climates.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIngebrigtsen is often mischaracterised as arrogant, when really he is just forthright. He is also unusually welcoming, inviting us into his home in Sandnes, near Stavanger in south-west Norway, where we spend the best part of a day with him, his wife, Elisabeth, and his two golden retrievers, Maximus and Jupiter.At one point Elisabeth pops down to the local bakery to buy us lunch, while later Jakob drives me to his farm in one of his sports cars. There is no PR person acting as a buffer either. All of this, to put it mildly, is highly unusual.And Ingebrigtsen’s lack of filter, which can rub his rivals up the wrong way, also means he is blunt and honest about his own scar tissue.Early in our conversation, I ask Ingebrigtsen whether the wins or the losses linger more in his head, and I am taken aback by the reply. “I want to say that I almost don’t remember the wins,” he replies. “Almost.”But you remember the defeats? A nod. “Right now I feel like it’s 99% losses to wins.”Shortly afterwards a noise distracts Ingebrigtsen and he goes off to investigate. When he comes back I start to ask: “Do you think you’re slightly …” when he interjects. “Autistic, yes?” he says, laughing. “With this obsession, this dedication, this level of intensity, of course there has to be something …“For me, this is not only a job. I’ve had this life for as long as I can remember. So in reality it’s not only: ‘I lost, let’s go on.’ It’s bigger than that for me, because it’s such a big part of my life. Everything that I do, and I’ve always done as long as I can remember, has always been performance-oriented.”Can you blame Ingebrigtsen for such an approach? His upbringing, which was part science experiment, part Truman Show, made him that way almost from the crib.He started training professionally from the age of four or five, and by 12 he was running upwards of 100km a week. At 16 he became the youngest person to break the four-minute mile.At 17 he was the European 1500mand 5,000m champion. And by 20he was the Olympic 1500m champion. Much of this was captured on Team Ingebrigtsen, a docu‑series featuring Gjert and Jakob’s brothers, Henrik and Filip, that became Norway’s most successful ever TV show.Since then his CV has expanded to include two Olympic gold medals, four world titles, indoor and out, five world records, and 22 European titles over track and cross-country. But it is the ones that got away – such asthe 1500m in the Olympic Games in Paris– that continue to linger and sting.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen likes to keep his home life private, but says he can be ‘an extrovert’ in the right company.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen with his dogs Maximus and Jupiter.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianIn that final he went out in a suicidal 54 seconds for the first lap and paid the price as he ran out of gas in the final 100m and finished fourth. Regrets? He certainly has a few, even 18 months on.“Considering how good shape I was in at that Olympics, I think nine out of 10 times I would have won the 1500m,” he says. “And this was the 10th. If I had just done anything differently, I think I would’ve had a better outcome.”Still, at least he had redemption by destroying the field to win 5,000m gold a few days later, I tell him. He looks at me like I am mad. “No, no,” he interjects. “It definitely wasn’t a redemption, no. There’s really nothing that can outweigh the disappointment of the 1500m.”Has winning become an obsession, I ask. “Yes, definitely. It’s an obsession. But I’ve been able to feed that obsession my whole life.”Given Ingebrigtsen’s uncompromising attitude, the fact he showed up to compete at September’s world championships in Tokyo spoke volumes. He knew he was not fit, having just recovered from his achilles injury. And, he says, there were no stipulations in his Nike contract that meant he would lose money if he didn’t turn up. He just felt it was the right thing to do.“That is just how I am, and how my life has been,” he says. “I’m always competing, even if the odds are against me. Even when I was 12 years old and competing against seniors at national level, I still wanted to win, but I knew it was unrealistic.”Ingebrigtsen, who was knocked out of the heats in the 1500m and could finish only 10th in the 5,000m, knew what was coming. But still he pressed on. “I’m not a dreamer,” he says. “I am analytic and realistic. But there’s always a chance of anything. And that chance is taken away if you don’t show up.”So how is his body now, four months on from his last race? “The achilles is very good,” Ingebrigtsen says. “But because of the last couple of years, I am a little bit more cautious. So I am prioritising my fitness towards the outdoor season. I will probably start at the Bislett Games in June. But my goals are to get double gold at the European championships, a Diamond League final victory, and to make one good world record attempt in the 1500m, the mile and also the 5,000m.”The 25-year-old will also get to renew his testy relationship with Josh Kerr,who beat him to 2023 world championships gold. Not that the Norwegian sees the Briton as a rival.“I have never considered anyone to be my rival,” he says. “Because I’m always competing against myself. And I usually don’t look at the start list. Because it’s always going to be people that can threaten or can compromise my race, whatever.”But does it annoy him when some people suggest he doesn’t have a finishing kick in the 1500m? He takes a deep breath. “No, I think it’s just ignorance,” he says, before making an analogy worthy of Eric Cantona. “If you look out of the window, it’s white. You can see it snowing. But if you dive deeper, under the snow it’s grass. That’s how it is with performance. People draw conclusions on the factors that are actually visible.”At the 2023 WorldAthleticsChampionships he had a virus, he points out. While in Paris, he went off too fast and paid the price. The whole point of a race, he stresses, is to use your best strengths to win.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen is still disappointed to have finished fourth in the 1500m final behind Yared Nuguse, Josh Kerr and Cole Hocker at the Paris Olympics in 2024.Photograph: Paweł Kopczyński/Reuters“I just think it’s funny,” he says. “My worst fear is to start sprinting when people are already finished. I can’t imagine how stupid you must feel as an athlete if you’re actually starting to sprint when the race is over. You have to play your cards right, so that you can time your effort so that you are the first to the finish.”He points to the French athlete Jimmy Gressier, whowon the world 10,000m titlein Tokyo last year. “He is a good runner. But because he’s a strength-endurance runner, he’s not very fast. Yet the whole point, especially in a championships, is about who can reach 400m to go with the most energy left. And in the 10k in Tokyo that was Jimmy.“You can argue that there was someone in that field who was faster than Jimmy. But they were struggling, because they didn’t have the same amount of energy left. And that’s the whole point.”Ingebrigtsen is just as outspoken when it comes to the state of his sport. He praises the Athletics Integrity Unit, calling it a “very good organisation”, but he wants far more funding made available to catch dopers. And, as someone who watches Formula One, he also wonders why track and field cannot do more to tap into its potential given he believes that it is far more exciting than F1.“The paradox is indescribable, because how can a sport that is so boring in reality be so entertaining for so many people?” he asks, “99.9% of people watching F1 don’t even know what the cars are. They probably don’t even know that there’s a battery inside the engines as well.”Ingebrigtsen certainly knows his way around a car. In his garage he has all sorts of vehicles, from sports cars to vintage motors. How many does he have? “That is a good question,” he replies. “I think if you start counting, that’s when you have an issue. So that’s why I don’t count.”View image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen’s other passion is cars, and he gathers with his friends once a week to talk and tinker with his large collection.Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianView image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen doesn’t count how many cars he has. ‘I think if you start counting, that’s when you have an issue.’Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBut Ingebrigtsen doesn’t just buy cars. He loves working on them. Every Wednesday he and his friends, some of whom are mechanics, get together. “We try to have a little bit of fun with it,” he says. “I’m 100% a petrolhead. And you see a lot of new people from a completely different side of society.”Is it also true that he spent $300,000 (£220,000) on Pokémon cards? “It’s been rounded up,” he says. “But I think I have a collecting gene. I tend to collect a lot of different things, which is not always good.”At this point Elisabeth, who is working on her laptop on the sofa, starts to smile. “No, it is not!”After our interview, Ingebrigtsen drives us to the farm about 10 minutes from his home that he reportedly bought for 12m Norwegian kroner (£900,000). For now it grows potatoes but, one day, Ingebrigtsen says he might rear Wagyu cows on his land.“There’s actually a guy close by who has done that,” he says. “But what’s so exciting about it is that you can grow whatever. You can have grapes, apple cider, vegetables, or animals. And Elisabeth, she’s grown up on a small farm with horses.”His mood is certainly lighter than this time last year, whenhe faced a court case against his father and former coach. It ended with Gjert being given a 15-day suspended sentence after being found guilty of hitting Jakob’s younger sister in the face with a wet towel. However, Gjert was acquitted of other charges, including those relating to physical and verbal abuse against Jakob, after the judge found there was reasonable doubt.Understandably, Ingebrigtsen doesn’t want to trawl over painful memories. Instead he is far happier talking about another family member, his 18-month‑old daughter, Filippa, marvelling at how quickly she is learning and growing.Has parenthood changed him? “No,” he says. “I think I’ve always had the capability of being a caring person, but not when I don’t want to be. As an athlete, it’s completely the opposite. I don’t allow myself to have those feelings and thoughts.”He accepts he is a loner, except when it comes to a small band of friends. “I am very much an introvert in general, but I am also very much an extrovert in an environment where I feel safe,” he says.Elisabeth concurs. “You do care about people, just a very small group of people,” she says. “That’s the difference.”View image in fullscreenIngebrigtsen says: ‘I know I can beat most of the world records from 1500m to the marathon.’Photograph: Marie von Krogh/The GuardianBut one thing is clear over the course of an interview that goes deep into a second hour: despite last year’s bump in the road, Ingebrigtsen’s ambitions haven’t changed. He wants to retire as the greatest distance runner in history. He says he is back running about 175-180km a week (108‑111 miles), far higher than most 1500m specialists, as he gears up for the summer.Does he ever take days off? “No, because if you have a day off, you lose 20-25km of running,” he replies. Of course he trained on Christmas Day. Twice, in fact.“I know I can beat most of the world records from 1500m to the marathon,” he says. “But it’s not easy. You really have to prioritise it, and you also have to find the right place and right time.“My 2025 season was a great setback in terms of my career. But I’m still highly motivated. Let’s say I can have 10 more years from now. If I can do that, then I think I have a good chance of reaching my ultimate goal.”And with that it is back to the treadmill for a second session of the day. Another hour of sweating and suffering. Another chance to fuel his burning obsession again.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

After stepping on the scale and registering at 135.5lb, the American fighter walked off the platform before losing consciousness and falling forward onto the stage floor.France taps out as G7 summit moved to avoid clash with White House UFC eventRead moreUFC staff and medical personnel quickly intervened, attending to Smotherman within seconds of the incident. He regained consciousness shortly afterward and was escorted away for further examination by physicians. The promotion has not released additional details regarding his condition.After the incident, Smotherman’s three-round bantamweight fight against Ricky Turcios was scrapped. The matchup had been scheduled for the preliminary portion of Saturday night’s card.All UFC fighters are required to officially weigh in the morning before competition, a process often associated with intense weight-cutting practices across the sport. Fighters then take part in a ceremonial weigh-in later in the day for fans and media, though Smotherman did not appear at Friday evening’s event.Smotherman entered the week with a professional record of 12-6 and was set to make his fourth appearance under the UFC banner. Turcios, a former winner of The Ultimate Fighter reality show, is now expected to be removed from the card entirely.Friday’s weigh-ins also saw complications elsewhere on the card. Former flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo came in over the bantamweight limit, as did flyweight Alex Perez, with both fighters fined 25% of their purses. Despite missing weight, their bouts are still expected to proceed as scheduled.Saturday’s UFC 324 event is headlined by a high-profile interim lightweight title fight between Liverpool’s Paddy Pimblett and Justin Gaethje, one of the promotion’s most anticipated matchups of the year.The incident involving Smotherman is the latest to renew scrutiny on weight-cutting practices in mixed martial arts, an issue the UFC has acknowledged but has yet to comprehensively reform.Explore more on these topicsUFCMMAUS sportsShareReuse this content"

It is an ambition that began more than a decade ago and is now close to being realized.The climb will be broadcast globally onSkyscraper Live, Netflix’s latest foray into live sports programming. The star of the 2019Oscar-winning documentary Free Soloinsists that climbing Taipei 101 will feel no different from any other of his ascents.‘It’s sort of the extreme’: Free Solo’s Alex Honnold on rock-climbing without ropesRead more“You walk up to the base, you hop on to the building, you climb all the way to the top,” Honnold said on his podcast, Climbing Gold. “No ropes. No gear. No margin of error.”The two-hour event will take place at 9am local time in Taipei on Saturday, or 8pm ET on Friday in the US, and has already generated both excitement and criticism.There is a long tradition in the US of live-broadcast daredevil feats, from Evel Knievel’s motorcycle jumps in the 1970s to Red Bull’s modern-day record attempts.Netflixis not breaking new ground with Honnold, but it is continuing its push into live sports, joining Apple, Amazon Prime and Alphabet’s YouTube in acquiring rights to major events.Last year, Netflixaired Christmas Day NFL gamesand theJake Paul v Anthony Joshuaboxing match. It is also set to broadcast Major League Baseball’s Home Run Derby and the2027 Fifa Women’s World Cup.“What their strategy has been so far is to eventize sports,” said Richard Deitsch, a journalist who has covered US sports media for more than two decades. “They’re looking for one-offs rather than large inventories.”He described Skyscraper Live as “sports adjacent”, designed to draw viewers to Netflix’s broader catalogue. “Sports drives audience,” Deitsch said. “You have to watch it live.”Even so, Deitsch argues that streamers have an ethical obligation to be transparent about risk. “They owe you honesty,” he said. “Here are the dangers. Let the audience know this is not 100% foolproof.”Netflix is disclosing those risks, but it is also selling them. Thousands of people are placing bets on Honnold’s fate and completion time on Polymarket, a cryptocurrency-based prediction market, where current odds suggest he will finish the climb in around 75 minutes.View image in fullscreenAlex Honnold, pictured in London in 2019.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThe Guardian understands that the live stream will carry a viewer-discretion advisory and run on a 10-second delay, allowing Netflix to cut the feed if necessary. Honnold will remain in constant communication with his camera crew and producers.Netflix is working with Plimsoll Productions and Secret Compass, both of which have previously collaborated with Honnold on high-stakes projects including Arctic Ascent in Greenland and The Devil’s Climb in Alaska. A small live audience has been invited to watch in Taipei, and an on-air panel – featuring elite climbers alongside a former ESPN anchor, a WWE champion and a Nasa engineer turned YouTuber – will contextualize the attempt.In recent days, Honnold has been spotted conducting rope-assisted test runs amid drizzle and the wail of ambulance sirens, with permission from the Taipei city government.The decision to livestream the 1,667ft (508m) ascent has sparked backlash froms some within the climbing community. Critics, including a Wall Street Journal columnist, have pointed to the high number of free-solo deaths and to Honnold’s role as a husband and father, branding the event “voyeuristic, ghoulish and irresponsible”.Concerns intensified afteran Alaskan climbing influencer died last yearin a fall that was livestreamed on TikTok. Saturday Night Live even skewered the ethics of Honnold’s climb ina recent cut-for-time sketch.At Long Dong, the sandstone “dragon caves” overlooking the Pacific Ocean northeast of Taipei and a popular climbing destination, amateur climber Chien Ai said he would not watch the live stream.“I don’t want to see something I’m not supposed to see,” he said. Instead, he plans to check news reports first and watch the replay only if Honnold succeeds.At a climbing gym in Taipei’s Zhonghe district, Yang Tse-hsiao, 41, a teacher who has climbed for six years, said he expects Honnold to succeed but still opposes the live stream.“I don’t understand why it has to be done this way, other than for commercial reasons,” he said. “If he falls, the price is huge.”His friend Chou Yen-shin, 61, who has climbed for 24 years, was less concerned. He believes Honnold would not attempt anything reckless and sees Skyscraper Live as a chance to raise Taiwan’s global profile.To the untrained eye, Taipei 101 looks forbidding. To climbers, its architecture offers predictability. The building’s distinctive “bamboo box” design features stacked segments with balconies every eight floors, providing regular opportunities to rest – akin to a multipitch rock climb.“One of the big differences between climbing a building and climbing rock is that there isn’t really a single hardest move,” Honnold told Netflix. Skyscrapers, he said, test endurance more than technical skill. “The challenge is the overall physicality. I don’t know how it’s going to feel.”The only person with comparable experience is Alain Robert, the 63-year-old French climber known as “Spiderman”, who climbed Taipei 101 on top rope in 2004. At the time, Robert was recovering from elbow surgery and faced high winds, rain and greasy holds on the unfinished structure.“I know Alex,” Robert said. “He has already planned his limits. There is not even a one-in-100-million chance that this will be his last climb.”Asked about the potential trauma of witnessing an accident, Robert shrugged. Wars, riots and coups are livestreamed every day, he said. “Death is part of life.”Dr Jamie Shapiro, a professor of sport and performance psychology at the University of Denver, said Honnold’s mental preparation – including visualisation and self-talk – would be crucial.“You can’t predict every challenge,” she said. “But you can trust your training and your competence. He has enough experience to stay composed if something unexpected happens.”Audiences, Shapiro added, are often drawn to moments of genuine risk. Watching an elite athlete attempt something impossible for the average person can inspire people to push themselves in positive ways.If weather conditions permit and he is not climbing outdoors at Long Dong, Chou plans to tune in.“Anyone who has climbed that long has a calm mind,” he said. “It will be a breakthrough.”Explore more on these topicsSportFree SoloRock climbingTaiwanAsia PacificNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He was optimistic, having been involved in the development of aFerrarifor the first time but acknowledged that a huge task lay ahead.“The 2026 season represents a huge challenge for everyone, probably the biggest regulation change I have experienced in my career,” he said. “Being involved from the very start in the development of such a ­different car has been a particularly fascinating challenge, working closely with the engineers to help define a clear direction for it.Storm brews over new F1 rules loopholes as Mercedes and Red Bull gain advantage | Giles RichardsRead more“It will be an extremely important year from a technical perspective, with the driver playing a central role in energy management, understanding the new systems and contributing to the car’s development.”The scale and complexity of what the teams are building, including entirely new engines split 50-50 between combustion and electrical energy and the use of active aerodynamics, was made strikingly clear on Friday when Williams, who finished fifth in the championship last season, announced they were not ready to take part in the first test in Barcelona, beginning on Monday.Williams said they would instead run a virtual test-track programme next week and expect to make the second test in Bahrain, but it is an inauspicious start to what will likely be a frenetic championship.Indeed, the Ferrari team principal, Fred ­Vasseur, emphasised that he expected the new cars to be developed at a furious rate as the season progresses and also highlighted how the drivers would have to adapt extensively to driving them.“The biggest challenge will include the integration of all the systems together, including the drivers, it will be a full reset for them on their approach,” he said. “They will have to change completely the way that they approach the weekend. Even the way of driving will probably be a bit different. This also for them will be a challenge and part of our job will be to give them the good tools to be at their maximum.”View image in fullscreenLewis Hamilton waves to fans after his test drive of the new car.Photograph: Antonio Calanni/APFerrari was one of the teams, alongside Audi and Honda, who had written to the FIA, the governing body, expressing concerns that Mercedes and Red Bull had gained an advantage in their engine design by using thermal expansion of components to increase their compression ratio. The row over the design will almost certainly now carry on into the season, after a meeting between engine manufacturers and the FIA on Thursday did not resolve the issue.The question over when the compression ratio is measured, currently when the car is “cold” and not running, against on track when thermal expansion can be exploited is central to the argument. However with no agreement reached – perhaps understandably from Mercedes and Red Bull – if they do have an advantage that might amount to as much as 0.3seconds a lap they will carry it into the start of the season.Enrico Gualtieri, the Ferrari power unit technical director, maintained that they remained in a dialogue with the FIA. “We are still discussing with them,” he said. “We are going to have an additional meeting in the next days. We are trusting them for managing the topic in the proper way, going through the procedures and the governance that is in place by regulation. We completely trust that the process could come in the next days and weeks.”Explore more on these topicsFormula One 2026Formula OneLewis HamiltonFerrariMotor sportnewsShareReuse this content"

He’s quick – 9.85sec for 100m – but his problem was he could only ever finish second: silver at the world indoors in 2014, silver at the world championships in 2022.When he didn’t even make the USA team for the 2023 world championships he realized that, at 29, he was losing the most important contest of all, the race against time.According to Monzavous “Rae” Edwards, a former elite sprinter and now gym owner in Dallas, Bracy-Williams’ frustrations would lead him to question whether the quest for 100m gold really does reward old-fashioned, honest hard work.Edwards claimed Bracy-Williams told him: “Everything I’ve done, I’ve done the right way … My entire life I’ve always been looked at as second best. I’ve never been given respect. Dog, there ain’t know way these boys are that much better than me.”With that nagging thought in autumn 2023, the lives of both Edwards and Bracy-Williams were about to take an alarming and unexpected turn that would ultimately lead to anti-doping investigators turning up at their respective doors.“We were having a conversation that had nothing to do about that [doping],” Edwards told the Guardian. “[But] everyone in track and field knows that I know who the person was supplying these people. When me and Marv were on the phone I cracked a joke. I was like: ‘I’ll get it, man.’ He was laughing like: ‘Give it to me, dog!’ It was literally a joke at first and next thing I know, it’s no longer a joke. By which I mean Marvin was like: ‘I’m going to try it.’ I take the responsibility for it … because it was a joke that I put in his head and I also gave him the loaded weapon…”Edwards was the man with the contact number to a female dealer who worked for an alleged steroid kingpin, Paul Askew, who has subsequently been charged in Ocala, Florida, with conspiracy to influence major international sport competition through doping. Askew has yet to enter a plea and is due to appear in court on 18 February.“Marv didn’t want to take drugs,” says Edwards, “Marv took drugs because he felt like he had to. The thing that I don’t like about our sport is that if you don’t take it, you don’t make it. When you have people who are taking it and you know they’re making it, then you’re almost leaving Marv without an option.”Yet while Bracy-Williams’ conclusion in Edwards’ view – that he needed to take steroids to compete seriously over 100m – was unremarkable, what happened next was unexpected. Not just that Bracy-Williams would test positive for testosterone in February 2024 but that someone in his inner circle betrayed him. The US Anti-Doping Agency confirmed: “After receiving credible information from a whistleblower in early 2024, Usada immediately opened an investigation which included collecting a targeted out-of-competition urine sample from Bracy-Williams.”Usada knew exactly when to test him to get its man based on informant information. “The only thing that got Marv caught is because Marv told [an associate about his doping]. They came and tested Marv the very next day [after taking testosterone]. Of course his levels were high,” said Edwards.In return for a reduced sentence, Bracy-Williams then agreed to cooperate with Usada to crack open the drug-dealing network that is thought to sustain many US sprinters. But he proved an unsuitable stooge, incurring another doping sanction even as he was providing Usada with assistance, this time missing three tests in a stipulated one-year period. The deal was off and last November, Usada announced that Bracy-Williams was banned for 45 months.But the rumor mill in US sprinting, with insiders clearly snitching on each other, continues to turn and threatens to bring US sprinting dominance down, with no one quite sure who has said what to whom.Edwards has named an insider whom Bracy-Williams claims to be the informant who tipped off Usada, though without corroborating evidence. “Marvin believed that [name redacted] was the one who told Usada what he was doing,” said Edwards.Rival sprinters will also want to know which names Bracy-Williams gave to authorities before his deal was pulled while Edwards is also threatening to talk.“I was gathering all this information [and] when I get enough information, I’m going to burn the whole of track and field down,” Edwards claims.The 12 months before his downfall in 2024 had been a season of change for Bracy-Williams. It wasn’t just that fateful decision to take banned drugs; he had also switched coaches to train with the USA’s most-controversial and successful sprint coach, Dennis Mitchell, recently named Nike Coach of the Year by US Track and Field.Mitchell certainly gets results. He coached Melissa Jefferson-Wooden to 100m and 200m gold at last year’s world championships and guided drug cheat and 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin to his 2017 world championship gold medal.Mitchell himself tested positive for testosterone in 1998 during his own sprint career, famously claiming the elevated levels were due to having sex four times with his wife the night before. He was banned for two years. He later testified under oath that his former coach Trevor Graham had injected him with banned human growth hormone. Gatlin was also banned for eight years, later reduced to four, after testing positive for testosterone while training under Graham in 2006 before switching to train with Mitchell when Graham received a life ban.While US Track and Field may be ready to laud Mitchell, the signs are that in the febrile atmosphere of recriminations in the sprint world, other leading lights are not so forgiving.Gabby Thomas, the Harvard graduate who was a triple gold medallist at the 2024 Olympics including individual gold over 200m, recently revealed that she had been “so naive” about her sport and wrote: “Doping coaches should be banned for life from coaching in the sport. Whether you were banned while competing as an athlete or caught distributing as a coach (for some, both). I don’t care ... If you train under a coach who is known for doping (once, twice, or even three times for some) you are complicit. That’s my stance.”Edwards is more candid about Mitchell. “You can’t just remove the cloud,” he says. “You failed [a dope test], you had athletes who failed … So you can’t just turn a blind eye to the image that Dennis has brought up [that Mitchell is a doper].”Mitchell’s lawyer Ryan J Stevens said: “Coach Mitchell is a different man than he was nearly 30 years ago. He’s committed to clean sport and strict compliance with anti-doping rules. He had absolutely no involvement in Mr. Bracy-Williams’ personal choices that resulted in his sanction. Coach Mitchell insists on transparency, accountability, and integrity in every aspect of his coaching.”The 2028 LA Olympics is now just over two years away and is expected to be an all-American triumph. But in the blue riband sprints event, where USA dominates, there may be more recriminations than gold medals as athlete turns on athlete.Edwards’ final thought is a chilling one for the drug testers. “I don’t think Marv’s situation has scared any coach or any athlete. I think Marv’s situation pretty much told the ones that are doing it we just got to be more careful.”The Guardian has contacted the Enhanced Games to put Edwards’ comments to Bracy-Williams but he has yet to respond.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsUsada (United States Anti-Doping Agency)Drugs in sportLA Olympic Games 2028US sportsShareReuse this content"

Paquetá, who is said to be nursing a minor back problem, was unavailable again forlast week’s win at Spursbut Nuno Espírito Santo’s struggling side coped without the Flamengo target. They called on Fernandes to dictate the flow in midfield and the diligent Portuguese did not disappoint. Fernandes moved the ball cleverly, picked up an assist and looked like that rarest of things: a smart signing from West Ham. They will need the 21-year-old, who joined from Southampton for £38m last summer, to shine again with Paquetá looking unlikely to return against high-flying Sunderland at the London Stadium.Jacob SteinbergWest Ham vSunderland, Saturday 12.30pm (all times GMT)2Frank still teetering on precipiceTottenham have had a galvanising effect on domestic opposition. Bournemouth had not won since October, and triumphed 3-2 early this month. West Ham had not won in the league since November and were 2-1 victors in north London on Saturday. Enter Burnley, whose last Premier League victory came in October and who have heldManchester Unitedand Liverpool so far in 2026. The “Dr Tottenham” meme has become hackneyed but Spurs’ ability to raise previously doomed opponents is beyond a joke. Tuesday’s victory over Borussia Dortmund was a fig leaf that followed a Sunday and Monday of speculation over Thomas Frank’s future. That Frank remains in charge speaks to a confused picture behind the scenes. At least, some fans have said with gritted teeth and no little irony, Daniel Levy was decisive when it came to sacking managers. Should Scott Parker triumph against his former club then the regime that ousted Levy will surely have its hand forced.John BrewinBurnley v Tottenham, Saturday 3pmView image in fullscreenThomas Frank’s midweek success against Dortmund could be a brief reprieve.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/Reuters3Brighton want Baleba back at his bestCarlos Baleba did not find it easy during the first half of the season. The Brighton midfielder was targeted by Manchester United last summer and the noise seemed to unsettle him. Fabian Hürzeler felt Baleba was distracted. The 22-year-old was not the same player after excelling last season. Hauled off during home games against Brentford and West Ham, Baleba needed to reset when he went to represent Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations. Cameroon’s head coach, David Pagou, talked about working on Baleba’s mentality. Brighton will hope to reap the benefits. Baleba returned as a substitute duringMonday’s draw with Bournemouthand is in contention to start Saturday’s trip to Fulham.JSFulham v Brighton, Saturday 3pm4Guéhi urgently needed by stunned CityBefore last weekend’s trip to Manchester United, Saturday’s visit of Wolves appeared a formality for Manchester City. Buta 2-0 loss at Old Traffordwas followed byTuesday’s shock Champions League defeat at Bodø/Glimtand, with Rob Edwards’ men unbeaten in their past five games, the outcome now feels uncertain. Pep Guardiola’s side should still win but they should have done, too, in Norway. Instead, City were schooled by Kjetil Knutsen’s men on a freezing night to forget in the Arctic Circle. Yet with Marc Guéhi in line to make his City debut and Antoine Semenyo, who is not in the Champions League squad, probably returning, if the bottom side do gain a positive result then Guardiola’s team will stay mired in a mini-crisis.Jamie JacksonManchester City v Wolves, Saturday 3pm5Reds’ Slot revival fails to convinceLast season, it took two goals from Mohamed Salah and real defensive rigour for Liverpool to triumph atBournemouth. Andoni Iraola’s team had already beaten Arsenal and Manchester City at home. To say the picture has changed at both clubs since then is to put it mildly, not least in the status of Salah. His return at Marseille showed he had recovered a modicum of confidence while playing for Egypt at Afcon, though the scratchiness of his prior club form was also in evidence. Liverpool’s 13-game unbeaten run has not convinced many and last Sunday featured a club briefing that countered unfounded speculation Arne Slot was for the chop. Any change, should it come, is unlikely before the summer and Iraola would still be a leading contender. If his team’s slide has affected a previously sky-high reputation, the sale of players such as Semenyo offers plenty of mitigation.JBBournemouth vLiverpool, Saturday 5.30pmView image in fullscreenLiverpool need Mohamed Salah to undergo a post-Afcon revival.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters6Changed fortunes for Bees and ForestWhile Nottingham Forestbeat Brentford 3-1on the opening day of the season, that feels like a long time ago now. Nuno Espírito Santo was still Forest manager, cheerfully embarking on a first European campaign since 1995-96. Keith Andrews, in his first season as a head coach, was widely tipped to lead his side to relegation after the departures of Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo. Both sides have gone on to confound expectations: Forest are in 17th, but hoping to extend their short unbeaten league run to three matches. Brentford, 10 places and 11 points above them, can dare to dream of European football despitedefeat at Chelsea last time out. It will be little comfort to Forest fans to recall the sides’ last meeting given two of their goals were scored by the absent Chris Wood, who has not been able to add to his league tally owing largely to injury. Brentford’s scorer that day? Igor Thiago, who now has 17 goals in 23 appearances.Will MageeBrentford vNottingham Forest, Sunday 2pm7Sarr must inspire crumbling PalaceThere’s been a meme doing the rounds on social media over the past few weeks with a picture of the Crystal Palace in all its pomp and another after the building was destroyed by a fire in 1936. “Crystal Palace FC before and after Ismaïla Sarr went to Afcon,” reads the caption. It’s a good summary of how dramatically things have changed at Selhurst Park since the Senegal forward made his last club appearance, against Manchester City on 14 December. Back then, Palace were fifth, Marc Guéhi was the captain and Oliver Glasner was apparently still undecided whether he would remain at the club next season. Sarr returned this week with his second Afcon winners’ medal after thedramatic final on Sundayto find his club down in 13th having failed to win any of their past 10 games in all competitions. Guéhi has already gone and Glasner will be on his way in the summer – if his uneasy truce with Steve Parish can last. At least the Austrian manager will be able to call on one of his most consistent performers when Chelsea arrive on Sunday, even if it may be asking too much for Sarr to turn things around by himself.Ed AaronsCrystal Palace v Chelsea, Sunday 2pm8Newcastle and Villa eye big prizeMight Newcastle be distracted by Wednesday’s impending Champions League trip to Paris Saint-Germain? Will Aston Villa be fatigued following Thursday night’s Europa League visit to Fenerbahce? How should Eddie Howe compensate for the likely absence of his injured captain, Bruno Guimarães? Given Howe knows Unai Emery was Newcastle’s first choice to become their new manager after the club’s Saudi Arabia-led takeover in 2021, does he have an extra incentive to outwit his counterpart? Are Villa extra-motivated bylast weekend’s surprise home defeat to Everton? So many questions surround this match but one thing is clear: the outcome will help determine qualification for next season’s Champions League and that represents a priority for both clubs. Villa are third with 43 points and Newcastle eighth on 33. But Emery knows his team’s advantage can be easily eroded, while Howe is encouraged that Newcastle remain only three points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool.Louise TaylorNewcastle vAston Villa, Sunday 2pmView image in fullscreenNewcastle will miss Bruno Guimarães if he is unavailable for the visit of Aston Villa.Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images/Allstar9Arsenal attack sharp for United’s visitA few weeks ago it seemed that Arsenal’s challenge for silverware would be severely undermined by their mounting injury list, even after spending more than £250m on new players in the summer. But with Gabriel Jesus – thetwo-goal hero against Interon Tuesday night – and Kai Havertz back to provide competition up front for Viktor Gyökeres, suddenly Mikel Arteta has quality back-up options in every position. The only potential weakness is at the back, with Piero Hincapié and Riccardo Calafiori still sidelined, although Cristhian Mosquera’s excellent performance against Inter in his first game since injuring his ankle against Brentford at the start of December greatly encouraged Arteta. The Spain Under-21s defender wasn’t due to return for another two weeks and the Arsenal manager has praised the club’s medical department for nursing him back to health so quickly. “They’ve done incredibly well with him to work every single hour to give him the chance to play,” said Arteta.EAArsenal v Manchester United, Sunday 4.30pm10Calvert-Lewin can return with prideIt felt like the right time for Dominic Calvert-Lewin and Everton to part company last summer, with both parties needing a fresh start, although the split was not that clearcut. Everton would have extended the striker’s contract but for wage demands they felt were excessive given his injury record. Leaving on a free transfer may cost Calvert-Lewin a decent reception when he faces his former club for the first time, but others will recognise his part in keeping Everton in thePremier League. The new stadium and a more front-footed approach from David Moyes’s team – when his most creative talents are available – may prompt Calvert-Lewin to ponder what might have been. But the same applies to Everton. Moyes remains desperate for a forward who can lead the line and finish to the level that a rejuvenated Calvert-Lewin has shown at Leeds. With nine Premier League goals in his first season with Daniel Farke’s side, the 28-year-old has scored more than Thierno Barry and Beto combined and can rightly return to Merseyside with his chest out.Andy HunterEverton v Leeds, Monday 8pmPosTeamPGDPts1Arsenal2226502Man City2224433Aston Villa228434Liverpool224365Man Utd226356Chelsea2212347Brentford225338Newcastle225339Sunderland2203310Everton22-13211Fulham22-13112Brighton2233013Crystal Palace22-22814Tottenham Hotspur2222715AFC Bournemouth22-62716Leeds22-72517Nottm Forest22-132218West Ham22-201719Burnley22-191420Wolverhampton22-268Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueTen things to look out for this weekendWest Ham UnitedSunderlandBurnleyTottenham HotspurFulhamBrighton & Hove AlbionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why are their set pieces so effective and can they be stopped?Niall McVeighFri 23 Jan 2026 15.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 17.00 ESTShareSet pieces are dominating the Premier League this season, with almost 30% of goals coming from corners, free-kicks, penalties or long throws. The leaders,Arsenal, are kings of the dead ball, scoring 17 of their 40 league goals from set pieces (including penalties). But what makes Mikel Arteta’s side so effective in these areas, and what can opponents do to stop them? The data provides some answers.Rice and Saka in the swingArsenal have scored 19 goals from corners in all competitions this season. Much of the credit for that goes to their primary corner takers, Declan Rice and Bukayo Saka. Taking corners from the left with his right foot, Rice has created eight goals, compared with five from Saka, who offers left-foot deliveries from the right. The vast majority of Arsenal’s corners (81%) are in-swinging, and statistically more likely to lead to a goal than out-swinging deliveries. Arteta learned the ropes under Pep Guardiola, but whereas the Manchester City manager has generally favoured out-swinging or short corners to maintain possession, his former assistant has opted for a more aggressive stance.Rice, Gabriel and Saka are Arsenal’s most potent set piece playersGetting it in the mixer …Arsenal’s use of set pieces is grounded in old-school methods. There is nothing particularly sophisticated about the pattern of corner deliveries; about three-quarters are aimed squarely at the six-yard box. While not a giant side – they are 15th in the league in terms of average height – Arsenal have assembled a fleet of tall, imposing defensive players. At least three of Arteta’s back four are usually involved at corners, with William Saliba often tasked with disrupting the goalkeeper – as he did successfully forthe winning goal at Old Traffordin August, scored by Riccardo Calafiori. The then United manager, Ruben Amorim, took issue, claiming Arsenal are “allowed to do a lot of things at the corners – we need to do the same”.View image in fullscreenManchester United keeper Altay Bayindir can only part-punch the ball under a challenge from William Saliba and it leads to Arsenal’s winning goal at Old Trafford in August.Photograph: Conor Molloy/ProSports/Shutterstock… but also mixing it upWhile launching balls directly towards leaping centre-backs is an effective strategy, some variety is needed to keep it that way. Arsenal’s set-piece coach, Nicolas Jover, curates the finer details. The system is not reliant on Rice and Saka –Martin Ødegaard, Eberechi Eze and Noni Madueke have created goals from corners this season – and whoever delivers dead balls into the six-yard box is encouraged to mix things up. There is a fairly even spread between deliveries into the middle (37%), near post (23%) and far post (15%) – even more so in terms of where the goals are scored (10 central, eight at the near post, and six at the far post).Arsenal’s set-piece goals have mostly come from central areasHeavy rotationWhile the defining image of Arsenal’s set-piece domination may be Gabriel Magalhães towering over defenders at the far post, the league leaders are not reliant on any one player to finish the job. Gabriel has four goals from dead balls this season but 11 of his teammates have also scored from a set piece, including free-kicks and penalties. This also points to another factor: Arsenal players’ movement off the ball. A group of three players will usually make a run from the far post across the six-yard box, creating confusion over where the ball will end up. One such example came in the Champions League win over Bayern Munich, withJurriën Timber heading home.Gabriel has been Arsenal’s top scorer from set-pieces this seasonControlling the chaosBy shifting players’ starting positions, pressuring the goalkeeper and varying the direction of deliveries, Arsenal can create a level of chaos that is advantageous. Arteta’s side have scored seven goals from a knock-down, flick-on or goalmouth scramble after a set piece this season. Leandro Trossard’s winner at Fulham was created by Gabriel flicking Saka’s delivery to the far post, where the Belgian was unmarked. Trossard turned provider in this week’s victory over Inter: hisheader aimed back across goalclipped the bar and fell for Gabriel Jesus to score. The panic that Arsenal create in defences has also led to two converted penalties and four own goals, with the Wolves keeper Sam Johnstone andBrighton’s Giorginio Rutterfinding their heads scrambled in matches at the Emirates Stadium last month.View image in fullscreenBrighton’s Georginio Rutter (right) flicks a header into his own net for Arsenal’s second goal of the game at the Emirates in December.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PACounter balanceArsenal’s aggressive approach to set pieces should, in theory, leave the defence exposed to counterattacks, with both centre-backs and a full-back usually deep in the opposing area. But they have avoided that completely, conceding only 14 league goals all season – with onlyErling Haaland’s opener at the Emiratesa definitive counterattacking goal. Defending corners, Arsenal’s opponents crowd the box to try to counter the danger, reducing their chances of breaking away. If they do get the ball upfield, they come up against one of the league’s hardest-running sides – tracking back quickly and cohesively even when 2-0 up in stoppage time.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

It’s a risky approach, but one that Premier League sides may have to take to find a flaw in this finely tuned goalscoring machine. It could be about to get even worse for opposing defences, too. Arteta’s squad areworking with a long-throw specialist, Thomas Grønnemark, to add another dimension to their set-piece prowess.Explore more on these topicsArsenalFootball tacticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Optimism was somewhat checked by controversy, however, following the allegations surrounding Thomas Partey and Arsenal’s decision to offer the midfielder a new contract.Manchester UnitedRuben Amorim’s first full campaign in charge promised much after a summer in which three new attackers had been signed – Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko. However, the lack of any midfield arrivals alongside lingering concerns about the head coach’s rigid tactical approach meant supporters were also somewhat apprehensive.What happened …Manchester United 0-1 ArsenalRiccardo Calafiori scored the only goal of a largely drab contest, the Italian nodding in a Declan Rice corner at the far post to set in a motion the defining trend of Arsenal’s season so far. United had once again lost at Old Trafford but in delivering an encouraging performance, cohesive as well as committed, there was a clear sense of things coming together under Amorim.View image in fullscreenRiccardo Calafiori scores the only goal as Arsenal win at Old Trafford.Photograph: Dave Thompson/APWhere are they now?ArsenalDreaming of a first title since 2004 after finding themselves seven points clear with less than half the season remaining. This surely has to be Arsenal’s season, given the respective shortcomings of their main rivals and their formidable and now largely fit squad. There has also been talk of a quadruple, which while highly unlikely cannot be ruled out given the various strengths of Arteta’s side, most notably in defence and at set pieces.Manchester UnitedWith Michael Carrick again in interim charge after a falling-out between Amorim and United’s hierarchy, most notably the sporting director, Jason Wilcox, had made the Portuguese’s position untenable. Carrick’s task is clear: raise spirits while making a push for the top four, and he has started with a bang withvictory in a Manchester derby. The former midfielder also has a clear run of things given United are out of both cup competitions, as well as not competing in Europe.Bournemouth v LiverpoolStart-of-season shape:BournemouthAn excellent 2024-25 campaign had, rather inevitably, led to the south-coast club’s best and brightest talents being slowly but surely picked off by bigger clubs. Dean Huijsen, Illia Zabarnyi and Milos Kerkez all departed in the off-season, the last joining the team Andoni Iraola’s men were scheduled to face on the opening day.LiverpoolThe sudden death of Diogo Jota in early July meant thePremier Leaguechampions were in a state of mourning. Excitement about a new season had been tempered, albeit an eye-catching summer outlay, headlined by the £116m arrival of Florian Wirtz and expected to soon include Alexander Isak, had supporters in high expectation regarding what lay ahead.What happened …Liverpool 4-2 BournemouthA Friday night thriller in which Liverpool took a 2-0 lead, with their first goal scored by Hugo Ekitiké, another summer arrival, only to be pegged back to 2-2 by a double from Antoine Semenyo, his second goal a stunning solo effort. The visitors appeared to have secured a draw only for Federico Chiesa and Mohamed Salah to score late on for the hosts. Cue joy and relief inside Anfield.View image in fullscreenFederico Chiesa (left) and Mohamed Salah scored late to deny Bournemouth at Anfield.Photograph: Ian Hodgson/APWhere are they now?BournemouthIn 15th amid a season that has been relentlessly difficult. That is little surprise given the loss of key players, with Semenyo the latest to depart in a £62.5m move to Manchester City at the start of the month. There have still been flashes of excellence from Iraola’s side, with Alex Scott, Eli Kroupi and Evanilson regularly catching the eye. That could, of course, well be a problem for Bournemouth come the opening of the next summer transfer window.LiverpoolNowhere close to defending their title after a collapse in which Arne Slot’s side lost nine out of 12 games in all competitions. The Dutchman has stemmed the bleeding but his side are performing with little cohesion and conviction amid a series of setbacks, including a serious injury to Isak just before Christmas. And, before that, there wasthatoutburst by Salah. Nonetheless, they sit fourth and retain what it takes to have strong runs in the FA Cup and Champions League.Brentford v Nottingham ForestStart-of-season shape:BrentfordA mess, on paper at least. Thomas Frank, Mbuemo, Christian Nørgaard and Mark Flekken all gone, Yoane Wissa on strike, and the set-piece coach promoted to manager. Few knew what to expect, but most were tipping a serious struggle for Keith Andrews and his side. The return from long-term injury of Igor Thiago, previously the club’s the record signing, was one source of positivity, at least.Nottingham ForestFans were anxious mid-summer, seeing Anthony Elanga sold and Morgan Gibbs-White flirt with Spurs. But some dynamism from the owner changed the mood: Evangelos Marinakis convinced Gibbs-White to stay, secured acontroversial elevation to the Europa League, and added a series of new faces late on, including the £36m Bologna winger Dan Ndoye. Optimism was high.What happened …Nottingham Forest 3-1 Brentford. The visitors were duly overrun, three down at the break to goals from Chris Wood, Ndoye on debut and Gibbs-White. “We will learn a lot from that 45 minutes, especially me,” said Andrews. A goal from Thiago, his first for the club, was one consolation. For Nuno Espírito Santo it was evidence his players were ready to kick on. “I just want to go home and celebrate. It’s a beautiful start.”View image in fullscreenDan Ndoye’s career at the City Ground got off to a flying start when he headed home the second Forest goal in their 3-1 victory over Brentford.Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PAWhere are they now?BrentfordSeventh in the table, Thiago is second behind Erling Haaland in the top scorers list, and the new signings Jordan Henderson and Caoimhín Kelleher are excelling. “The hinges could have come off the door in the summer because of all the changes,” said Andrews. “But I was well aware of the values of the club, the humility, the way we worked. When you do that and work hard collectively, there’s only one outcome.”Nottingham ForestSo much for the beautiful start. Nuno was sacked after three games for going public on his testy relationship with Marinakis. The owner then hired Ange Postecoglou, sacked him a month later, and turned to Sean Dyche instead. Forest sit 17th, five points above the relegation places. There are signs of life – awin at 18th-placed West Hamand adraw with Arsenalshowed fighting spirit – butthe display at Bragawas feeble.Burnley v TottenhamStart-of-season shape:BurnleyAfter a four-season run of yo-yoing, the target was simple: stick it out. The club’s big strength in the promotion season was a defence which conceded just 16 goals in 46 games, but the key components James Trafford and CJ Egan-Riley departed, as did the captain, Josh Brownhill. Scott Parker added experience in Kyle Walker and Axel Tuanzebe. Up front, much would depend on £20m Armando Broja.TottenhamNot even the Europa League trophy could save Postecoglou from his 17th-place finish, via 22 defeats. Daniel Levy picked Frank to replace him, preferring the Dane over Iraola and Marco Silva. Son Heung-min left for the US, but Mohammed Kudus, Mathys Tel and João Palhinha arrived, with reports of a deal close for Eberechi Eze, too. The mood: cautiously upbeat.What happened …Tottenham 3-0 Burnley. A dream start for Frank as Kudus teed up two goals for Richarlison, the second a stunning scissor-kick. Brennan Johnson hit the third. Parker, meanwhile, was left to reflect on “the ruthlessness of the Premier League … We’ve got a huge challenge ahead of us, but it’s one we are going to embrace.”View image in fullscreenTottenham’s Richarlison unleashes his acrobatic effort against Burnley.Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?Burnley19th, on a 13-game winless run, with Broja having scored once. A spell of seven straight defeats in November and December led to boos from fans which, said Parker, “broke my heart … It was only four months ago that I was standing on the balcony in the town centre and all of us were celebrating.” Buta fine point won at Anfieldlast time out showed spirit. Eight points from the last safe spot, but not buried yet.TottenhamThe positivity did not last. Eze signed for Arsenal and, despite a solid start, Frank’s injury-hit side have now won just twice in the last 13, sit 14th in the table andlost 2-1 to West Hamin their last league game. The pressure on the new manager’s position has reached Postecoglou levels. But could their stylish, surprise2-0 Champions League win against Borussia Dortmundon Tuesday be a turning point?Crystal Palace v ChelseaStart-of-season shape:Crystal PalaceOliver Glasner’s side began the campaign with fresh silverware to their name after beating Liverpool to the Community Shield. There were few ins and outs before the opener, albeit Eze was widely expected to be on his way to Tottenham.ChelseaEnzo Maresca’s side started the season as – technically – the best team on the planet having won the first iteration of Fifa’s expanded Club World Cup. There was also once again a hive of transfer activity at Stamford Bridge, with João Pedro and Jamie Gittens among those arriving and Noni Madueke and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall among those departingWhat happened …Chelsea 0-0 Crystal PalaceThe hosts delivered an uninspiring performance and were fortunate not to lose after Eze saw a firmly hit free-kick ruled out by a somewhat pedantic video assistant referee intervention, with Marc Guéhi penalised for straying within a metre of the Chelsea wall as he grappled with Moisés Caicedo. Palace were the better team and, justifiably, felt hard done by.View image in fullscreenEberechi Eze had a free-kick strike ruled out at Chelsea due to a harsh VAR ruling which stated that Marc Guéhi of Crystal Palace was standing too close to the Chelsea wall.Photograph: Catherine Ivill/AMA/Getty ImagesWhere are they now?Crystal PalaceIn a state of turmoil and decline. Eze joined Arsenal shortly after the season started with Guéhi also moving, toManchester City, this week; two blows that led to Glasner accusing the club’s board of “abandoning” the team after confirming he will leave Palace in the summer, when his contract expires. He may well go before then, leaving behind a team in mid-table and seeking to progress in the Conference League.ChelseaManaged by Liam Rosenior after Maresca was sacked on New Year’s Day following a falling-out with the club’s hierarchy that reared its head in the shape of comments made by the Italian after a 2-0 victory overEvertonin December. Qualification for the Champions League – and from the Champions League league phrase – remains achievable for the new man in charge, albeit both are far from certain.Everton v LeedsStart-of-season shape:EvertonA first summer under new owners, The Friedkin Group, meant Everton were notable spenders in the market, yet it was a loan deal that had supporters most excited. Jack Grealish’s arrival from Manchester City very much pointed towards an exciting and ambitious campaign ahead for David Moyes’s team.LeedsThere was much excitement surrounding Daniel Farke’s side after promotion back to the Premier League and a summer of notable spending. Eight new players had arrived at the club, including the imposing German midfielder Anton Stach from Hoffenheim and, intriguingly, Dominic Calvert-Lewin on a free transfer.What happened …Leeds 1-0 EvertonElland Road rocked on the first Monday night of the campaign and the majority of those in attendance were rewarded for their backing with a win. Lukas Nmecha, another summer arrival, scored the only goal of the game, converting an 84th-minute penalty awarded for a handball by James Tarkowski that the visitors deemed to be a hugely unfair call.View image in fullscreenLukas Nmecha reacts after scoring the decisive late penalty for Leeds against Everton.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?EvertonSlap-bang in mid-table. Moyes’s men are 10th having displayed curious form throughout the campaign – woeful home losses and excellent away wins sprinkled alongside frustrating and/or dull draws. What’s for sure is that this will not be another season defined by a relegation battle, albeit it will be one in which Everton once again fail to win a trophy.LeedsIn 16th and very much looking up after a turnaround in performances and results sparked by a change of system – from 4-1-4-1 to 3-5-2 – by Farke. The German has gone from dead man walking to the toast of West Yorkshire, helped in sizable apart by Calvert-Lewin’s prowess in front of goal. A fourth-round trip to Birmingham also offers Leeds the very real prospect of extending their run in the FA Cup.Fulham v BrightonStart-of-season shape:FulhamThe west London’s club’s transfer dealings had been incredibly quiet in the buildup to the opening weekend, with the only addition to Silva’s ranks being the 34-year-old reserve goalkeeper Benjamin Lecomte from Montpellier.BrightonA busy summer of transfer activity featured about £70m spent on eight new additions, including Charalampos Kostoulas from Olympiakos and Maxim De Cuyper from Club Brugge, while a host of players also departed, no one more notable than João Pedro, who joined Chelsea for £60m in early July.What happened …Brighton 1-1 FulhamFabian Hürzeler’s side started the season very much how they had performed throughout the previous one – by giving up a lead. Matt O’Riley had put the hosts in front via a 55th-minute penalty before Rodrigo Muniz converted a Harry Wilson corner deep in stoppage time to give the visitors something to take with them from the south coast.View image in fullscreenRodrigo Muniz claims a point for Fulham at Brighton.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersWhere are they now?FulhamOne place and one point ahead of Brighton in 11th, which feels right given their mix of results this season. In their last four games alone, Silva’s side have won two, drawn one and lost one. Fulham also have a tricky-looking FA Cup fourth-round tie, travelling to a Stoke team firmly pushing for promotion from the Championship.BrightonSitting 12th feels right for a team whose form has been mixed throughout the season and could very much go either way between now and the end of the season. There could be a decent run in the FA Cup but for that to happenLiverpoolwill have to be beaten at Anfield in the fourth round. Such an outcome is unlikely but by no means impossible.Manchester City v WolvesStart-of-season shape:Manchester CityAfter finishing a distant third and losing the FA Cup final, a reset. Pep Guardiola overhauled his staff and reshaped the squad with signings including Rayan Aït-Nouri, Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and the goalkeeper Trafford. Plenty of focus too, on managing Rodri’s comeback from long-term knee injury. “It’s difficult but he’s desperate to play,” said Guardiola. “We need his ambition, his personality, his quality.”WolvesThe target was no repeat of 2024-25’s nightmarish start: nine points from their first 16 games and Gary O’Neil sacked. Vítor Pereira replaced him and turned it round, and approached his first full season in bullish mood. But losing Cunha, Aït-Nouri and Nélson Semedo left the squad looking depleted during a winless, frustrating pre-season. Hopes were high, though, for the new arrival Jhon Arias.What happened …Wolves 0-4 Manchester City. A vintage City display headlined by two goals from Haaland and a superb Reijnders debut. For Wolves, Marshall Munetsi had an effort ruled out for offside, but that was as close as they came to making an impact. Pereira looked for the positives, though. “I didn’t lose my smile because each mistake that we committed, they punished us with a goal. I will take good things from the game.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland on his knees after scoring Manchester City’s third against Wolves.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAWhere are they now?Manchester CityAfter beating Wolves they lost the next two – but it seemed like a blip. By the end of November they were second, and set off on a six-game winning run. But 2026 has been bruising: no league wins in four,defeat in a Manchester derby, and a3-1 humiliation at Bodø/Glimt. Rodri has laboured; Haaland likewise. Guardiola: “We have the ­feeling that everything is going wrong in many details. We have to try to change.”WolvesAdrift, via a familiar opening few months: eight defeats in their first 10 league games, with Pereira sacked in November. Rob Edwards, the new manager, then lost the next eight. Arias has underwhelmed and last season’s key scorer, Jørgen Strand Larsen, has misfired and looks set to leave. They are, though, unbeaten in the last four, including astirring 3-0 win over relegation rivals West Ham. So … maybe?Newcastle v Aston VillaStart-of-season shape:NewcastleAn Isak-shaped cloud hung heavy over the entire club going into the opening day. Eddie Howe’s star striker was refusing to play as part of his attempt to force a move to Liverpool but was going nowhere until the champions met Newcastle’s £150m valuation. Attempts to lure Wissa from Brentford were also proving difficult.Aston VillaThe mood around Unai Emery’s side was not great given the previous campaign had ended with them being pipped to Champions League qualification by the team they were facing at Villa Park and a summer in which profitability and sustainability rules meant they could not spend more than €5m net.What happened …Aston Villa 0-0 NewcastleAmid chants of “There’s only one greedy bastard” from their fans, Newcastle delivered a united, defiant display but one that highlighted their lack of cutting edge without Isak, with Anthony Gordon largely ineffective as their central striker. Villa were ultimately happy with a point given they had been reduced to 10 men after Ezri Konsa’s sending-off on 66 minutes.View image in fullscreenAston Villa’s Ezri Konsa fouls Newcastle’s Anthony Gordon, earning an opening-day red card.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersWhere are they now?NewcastleIn eighth on the back of very good home form and very poor away form. Nick Woltemade – Isak’s replacement – has blown hot and cold, as has Wissa following his eventual arrival and recovery from injury. Howe’s men are well placed to qualify for the Champions League playoffs and are still in the Carabao Cup and FA Cup, albeit a semi-final exit from the former is likely.Aston VillaFirmly ensconced in third on the back of 11 successive wins at Villa Park, a run brought to an end by defeat to Everton last weekend. They could still win the title but almost certainly will not. Decent runs in the FA Cup and Europa League should not be ruled out, however, especially if Morgan Rogers continues to deliver eye-catching displays between now and May.West Ham v SunderlandStart-of-season shape:West HamWould this be the real start of the Graham Potter era, his first full season after replacing Julen Lopetegui in January? Or would it be more of the same? Potter brought in a sports psychologist and pre-season signs looked fairly positive, despite Kudus departing to Spurs. Hopes were high for the new left wing-back El Hadji Malick Diouf, and for Niclas Füllkrug to come good.SunderlandNo lack of ambition: £132m on 11 signings, with arrivals including Roma’s Enzo Le Fée, the Paraguay defender Omar Alderete, Arsenal old boy Granit Xhaka and the £30m midfielder Habib Diarra. The departed Jobe Bellingham was a loss, though, and doubters wondered whether the manager, Régis Le Bris, could blend so many new faces into a cohesive top-flight unit.What happened …Sunderland 3-0 West Ham. The hosts fielded seven of their new signings, but old faces made the difference: Eliezer Mayenda and Dan Ballard put them two up, before Wilson Isidor rounded it off in added time. For Potter and West Ham fans, it was a bleak start. “We have to learn the lesson that it’s difficult to win matches,” he said. “It’s one game but we have to bounce back. We have to be better. We have to make it happen.”View image in fullscreenSunderland fans celebrate Wilson Isidor’s goal to cap their win over West Ham.Photograph: Getty Images/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhere are they now?West HamPotter lasted until last September, with his side 19th. Nuno has them 18th, including a run of 10 games without a win, and no clean sheets in any of his 17 league games so far.A 2-1 win at Spurslast time out showed spirit, but the mood remains toxic, with fans still protesting against the board. The £27.5m striker Füllkrug, meanwhile, wasloaned out this month, after three goals in 29 appearances.SunderlandLe Bris did find that blend. Sunderland sit ninth, three points off Liverpool in fourth, having beaten Chelsea away and Newcastle at home, and held Arsenal. Noah Sadiki and Nordi Mukiele have excelled, with Xhaka outstanding in the middle. They are resilient, too, winning 16 points from losing positions so far – second only to Aston Villa, and the most by a promoted side since West Brom in 2010-11.Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueAston VillaNewcastle UnitedBrighton & Hove AlbionFulhamChelseaCrystal PalacefeaturesShareReuse this content"

A2-1 defeat at the Stadium of Lightmade it 10 games without a victory under the Austrian, who had confirmed before the game that hewould be leaving in the summer.Then and now: what has changed since the opening Premier League games?Read moreParishdecided against sacking Glasnerover his outburst and the 51-year-old is hoping the return of Ismaïla Sarr from the Africa Cup of Nations and Daniel Muñoz from injury can help to lift spirits after a difficult fortnight. “I was quite emotional after the game and I think it shows how much the players, how much Crystal Palace means to me,” Glasner said.“I agreed one year ago in February to sell Marc. It’s all about timing and replacement. That was the whole situation. I know that Crystal Palace will always sell players if they have big offers from other clubs. But it was just the situation, telling the team 28 hours before a Premier League game that the captain is leaving. This was my feeling at that moment and this is what I tried to express. I know it feels like criticism, but for me it was just telling the feelings, the emotions I had, the team had.”He added: “I had a very long dinner with Steve this week and we talked about this situation. Not to sell Marc, it’s the timing and the possible replacement. This was the situation I wanted to explain and the talk was a very good talk for both of us. But nothing changed what I said at the press conference before the Sunderland game, when I said I will give my best to play a great season. Steve and I are 100% committed that we will do our best to have a great rest of the season, a great four months together.“Dani Muñoz came back at the beginning of the week. Ismaïla Sarr came back as an Afcon winner from Senegal. Now we are preparing for the rest of the season. It was a thunderstorm, but always after a thunderstorm the sun is shining.”Glasner also denied Jean-Philippe Mateta had submitted a transfer request, with Aston Villa and Juventusinterested in signing the strikerthis month, and said Mateta would start against Chelsea on Sunday. “To be very clear, he didn’t hand in a transfer request, and we have no bid received right now,” said Glasner. “I think with every player there is a price where a club says: ‘OK, we agree to a deal.’ But again, no bid came in, and he didn’t hand in a transfer request, so he will play tomorrow.”Ed Aarons2.Frank eyeing European union after Tel troubleThomas Frank has called on Uefa to increase Champions League squad sizes after cutting Mathys Tel from Tottenham’s European roster for the second time this season. Tel was dropped for the midweekwin over Borussia Dortmundto enable Dominic Solanke’s return from injury, and will not be available for next week’s final league stage game at Eintracht Frankfurt, where a win would guarantee Spurs a spot in the last 16.The 20-year-old French forward was omitted from Tottenham’s Champions League list in September because a lack of homegrown players meant Frank was unable to name a full squad of 25, but a new rule meant he was handed a reprieve in December after an injury to Solanke and played against Slavia Prague. With Solanke fit, Frank was forced to choose between the two for Tottenham’s final two games of the league phase.Clubs qualifying for the knockout stages can make three changes to their squad before 5 February, but not beyond the 25-man limit for A-list players born before 2004. If a club has fewer than eight homegrown players, their squad size is reduced accordingly. Uefa’s squad rules were introduced almost 20 years ago and Frank feels they should be updated to reflect an expanded Champions League schedule.“It’s something that Uefa need to look into to modernise those rules in general,” the head coach said. “When they made the rules we had six group games, now we have eight. Before, we had no games in January, and a lot of the group stage was done after four games. Now with the new format every team needs to fight until the end.“We also have gone up from three to five substitutions, which means you use more players. For the Euros and the World Cup we have bigger squads. This is something that we need to look into that would have helped the situation with Mathys. Also, with the changes we can do after January, it’s only three players. I can’t see why that shouldn’t be more. Why can’t you change during the season if you have injuries?”Frank said Tottenham’s co-sporting director, Johan Lange, had raised the issue at Premier League level, with a number of clubs in agreement and planning to propose a change at a meeting of Uefa’s club competitions committee. If endorsed there the proposal would go to a vote of Uefa’s executive committee.Lucas Bergvall has had ankle surgery and is expected to be out for up to three months.Matt Hughes3.Rosenior believes Palmer will make World CupLiam Rosenior has backed Cole Palmer to make England’s World Cup squad if the Chelsea playmaker returns to full fitness and hits top form. Palmer has missed much of the season with a persistent groin problem, remains unable to play three full games a week and faces a battle to force his way into Thomas Tuchel’s plans this summer. He missedChelsea’s win over Pafoson Wednesday and his struggle to build momentum could count against him given England’s embarrassment of riches in attacking midfield.However, Rosenior has the 23-year-old available for Sunday’s trip to Crystal Palace and is confident Palmer’s fortunes will improve before Tuchel names his 26-man World Cup squad. “The reality for Cole is that if he performs at his level, he will be in,” Chelsea’s head coach said. “It’s very simple. If he performs at his natural level, when he is fit, I’ve got no doubts at all that everything he wants in his career will come for him. Our job in the short term is to get him into the place where he can go and enjoy himself on the pitch.”Palmer scored a penalty duringChelsea’s win against Brentfordlast weekend but looked frustrated for much of the game. Speculation that he is unhappy in London and wants to return to Manchester has mounted this week. But Rosenior attributed the former Manchester City attacker’s frustrated demeanour against Brentford to pain preventing him from performing at his best.“A fully fit Cole, firing, I wouldn’t change him for any player in world football in his position,” Rosenior said. “My job is to support him. Not just me. The staff, the medical team, the players. To make sure he can not feel frustrated. It’s good he’s frustrated because he wants to do well for the club. But I don’t want him to feel like he has to push himself to the point of pain, when we’re in January. That’s crazy. So I want to look after him. I’ve had great conversations with him so far, and I will continue to look after him.”View image in fullscreenCole Palmer has endured the toughest season of his career.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersChelsea have been fined £150,000 after a bottle was thrown at the Aston Villa bench at Stamford Bridge last month. The incident occurred afterVilla’s 2-1 winand led to a complaint from the club. The Football Association has found Chelsea guilty of failing to ensure their “players and/or other relevant personnel around the technical area did not behave in an improper and/or provocative and/or abusive way after the final whistle”.Stuart Attwell, the referee, told the FA’s independent regulatory commission that he was told after full time of someone on Chelsea’s bench throwing a plastic bottle in the direction of Villa’s dugout. Chelsea admitted the charge, although the investigation was unable to identify the individual responsible. The club and the FA analysed footage showing the bottle being thrown from the home bench.Jacob Steinberg4.Carrick backs Mainoo as key to United’s futureMichael Carrick has backed Kobbie Mainoo, saying the academy graduate is vital to maintain the foundations of Manchester United. Carrick gave the 20-year-old a first Premier League start of the season in lastSaturday’s 2-0 win over Manchester City, the midfielder impressing after previously falling out of favour under Ruben Amorim. The interim manager believes Mainoo is the prime example of the type of player who is crucial to United’s future.“I’ve really enjoyed working with Kobbie,” said Carrick. “I’ve known him since he was young. This club needs young players coming through and being the foundation for understanding what the club means – not just for the players or the squad, but for the club and for the supporters. It’s something that we need to grasp and we need to keep building on. Kobbie’s a prime example, to come through so quickly and have his rapid rise is impressive.”Mainoo joined United when he was six, and made his debut at 17 in a 3-0 EFL Cup win over Charlton in January 2023. He scored in the following season’s2-1 FA Cup final victory against Manchester Cityand started for England in that summer’s2-1 Euro 2024 final defeat by Spain.Carrick said: “To impact those big games at such a young age shows an awful lot of quality in terms of the character and to be able to handle it. Part of a career is a few ups and downs and sometimes it goes in different trajectories. But I think we’ve seen last week what Kobbie can bring. It was great [against City]. He’s quite straight-faced and he doesn’t give you an awful lot, but you could see the way he played and he expressed himself. He was enjoying himself and to see him like that was great.”Carrick has been appointed only until the end of the season, and it is unclear if his input on strengthening the squad will be considered. “Looking too far down the track hasn’t happened just yet – I think it’s been the initial thoughts of what’s happening now,” he said. “The important thing for me is any decision I make or my staff make or the club make – it’s not short-term, not just to get through to the end of the season.“I’ve got responsibility for whatever happens next for the club to make sure it is in a good place and moving forward. So, as time goes on I’m sure I’ll be part of it and we’ll work our way through it.”Jamie Jackson5.Haaland doesn’t have to say sorry – GuardiolaPep Guardiola has defended Erling Haaland, saying the striker has nothing to apologise for amid a poor run in front of goal. The Norwegian has scored once in his past eight Manchester City appearances and said sorry for not finding the net inTuesday’s defeat at Bodø/Glimtin the Champions League.City host bottom-placed Wolves on Saturday, seeking a result to re-energise their season, and hope to get Haaland back in form. Guardiola’s side are winless in four Premier League games,convincingly defeated by Manchester United last weekafter three straight draws. Haaland has scored 39 goals in 36 matches for City and Norway this season despite the relatively barren patch in which his only goal has come from a penalty.“He [doesn’t have] to apologise,” Guardiola said. “He has to do his best and he is trying. When the team doesn’t win it doesn’t belong to one player. It is for everyone. You only apologise to yourself if you didn’t give everything but it is not necessary.”View image in fullscreenErling Haaland has scored only once in his past eight games.Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images/ReutersAnother playerbelow their best is Rodri, who was sent off against Bodø, having had numerous injuries over the past 14 months. A cruciate ligament injury forced him to miss most of last season and muscle problems have since limited his playing time. “Eleven months injured, give him time,” Guardiola said. “He remains the best, he needs time to recover.”City begin the weekend second, seven points behind the leaders, Arsenal, whom Guardiola described as “the best team in the world right now”, adding: “In the Champions League, in the Premier League, look in [the] FA Cup, in Carabao Cup – it’s the best team right now. Hopefully we can be close and getting better, getting better and have the chance to catch them.”Marc Guéhi will make his debut after his £20m move from Crystal Palace and his fellow new signing Antoine Semenyo is available too. City’s manager is desperate to have a clean bill of health for the decisive part of the season. “We are in the semi-finals in the Carabao Cup, we are in the FA Cup [fourth round], and the league is a little bit away, especially with the strong team that we have in front of us. But at least we are there, qualified. When we arrive in February, March, all I ask is not the opponent, it is to have the team back. After that,” he said jokingly, “I swear, we will be there [at our best] … because we spent a lot of money.”Will Unwin6.Moyes reeling from Grealish blowDavid Moyes admitted it was a “big blow” to lose the on-loan winger Jack Grealish to a broken foot that has left a question mark over his immediate future at Everton. The Manchester City forward was injured in last weekend’swin at Aston Villaand diagnosed with a stress fracture after seeing a specialist, who will conduct further examinations before providing an estimate on how long he will be sidelined. Not only is it a setback for Everton, whose loan agreement includes a £50m option to buy, but for any hope the player had of making a late bid for the World Cup.“It’s not for me to give the timescales – we’ve not got it yet from the doctors – but he has a stress fracture in his foot, that’s all I can tell you,” said Moyes. “It’s a big blow because he’s been hugely important to us since the start of the season, he’s played a big part in the team.”Speculation this week suggested the layoff could be as long as three months, but Moyes added: “I wouldn’t say anything here at the moment. I wouldn’t speculate and I wouldn’t put any numbers to it.”PA Media7.Abraham on verge of Villa returnAston Villa are increasingly optimistic of re-signing Tammy Abraham as Unai Emery continues to reshape his squad with the club still competing on three fronts. Abraham is on loan at Besiktas from the Serie A side Roma. Emery has targeted an established No 9 this month to bolster his attack.The 28-year-old was on loan at Villa in 2018-19, when he scored 26 goals in 40 appearances on loan from Chelsea at the then Championship side. Abraham left Chelsea in 2021, joining Roma in a £34m deal. Villa are also prioritising a midfielder before the transfer window shuts. They are interested ina loan deal for Ruben Loftus-Cheekwith the key duo Boubacar Kamara and John McGinn both sidelined with knee injuries. It is feared Kamara could miss the rest of the season.Ben FisherExplore more on these topicsFootballThe talknewsShareReuse this content"

Since the Scotland international joined Liverpool from Hull in 2017 he has secured trophies including two Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and two Carabao Cups.Destiny Udogie is Spurs’s only Premier League-proven alternative to Spence at left-back, although the club on Thursday signed the 19-year-old Brazilian Souza from Santos.When Frank brought in Conor Gallagher this month he talked up the midfielder’s leadership qualities and the head coach feels Robertson would offer more help in that regard.Robertson was of interest to Atlético Madrid in the summer but a move did not materialise. The 31-year-old is eager to maximise his playing time before the World Cup, where he will captain Scotland. At Liverpool he has faced competition from Milos Kerkez after being an almost ever-present during last season’s title win.If Robertson departs, he will be leave a side who have drawn their past four Premier League games but Arne Slot says he has taken enjoyment from a season far more difficult than his first.Liverpool, who are at Bournemouth on Saturday, have lost six league matches, leaving them fourth, 14 points behind the leaders, Arsenal. Last season they lost only four times. Problems have included injuries and Slot’s attempt to integrate four signings.“I do enjoy it – but I do enjoy winning,” Slot said. “Winning is the one you enjoy most. The second thing is making players better. The third thing and the nice part of the job is being creative and getting a gameplan with the players you have available and make it as difficult as you can for the opposition … Maybe you enjoy winning a little bit more when you have been losing. We have felt the pain and hurt of losing so we are enjoying it.”Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowLiverpoolTottenham HotspurnewsShareReuse this content"

Despite being only 21, her undeniable natural talent and eye‑catching career have propelled her into the headlines ever since her hometown club, Angel City, made her the first pick in the 2023 National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) draft.The past few months, however, have provided the USA international with a different challenge altogether. Ahigh-profile deadline day moveto the English champions, Chelsea, in September meant leaving her family and the comforts of Los Angeles and testing herself overseas.Trinity Rodman stays in NWSL, signing record contract with SpiritRead more“Since I was little, I have looked up to clubs like Chelsea and Barcelona,” she says. “I feel like they are some of the biggest teams in the world. I’ve always wanted to eventually play in Europe and play on a team like Chelsea so when I got the opportunity, I couldn’t say no.“We all want to win but especially here at Chelsea, there’s a standard of winning already. I feel like it’s kind of similar to the US team so it’s not something I’m not used to but it’s really cool to be a part of, especially at club level.”It was not a decision she took lightly. Playing for Angel City was “a dream come true” and a real family affair. Her younger sister Gisele signed shortly afterwards, while her family were able to come to every game and it was something her national team manager, Emma Hayes, raised when discussing the potential move overseas.“She asked me: ‘What are you going to do without Gisele?’ And I was like: ‘I don’t know but I think I should [go].’ She said that she was going to support me in anything I decide to do but just to make sure that it was the right decision for me. That was a helpful conversation in understanding and clearing my mind. She asked the right questions.”Thompson cuts a relaxed figure at the club’s Cobham training facility as she continues to adjust to her new environment.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thompson celebrates scoring against West Ham with Johanna Rytting Kaneryd. ‘Just being around world-class players is amazing,’ she says.Photograph: Paul Childs/Action Images/Reuters“I kind of think of this as like going away for college like all my friends did,” she says. “I didn’t, so this is me kind of growing up and having to leave the home … I’ve learned that I relied on my parents a lot. They did a lot of things for me that I didn’t even realise. If I needed anything I could just call them and they would fix it. I’m learning to be more responsible and I feel like that’s good for me for when I’m older.“Living in a different place without my family is completely different from anything I’ve experienced before. It’s a lot colder here. The city is very different from LA too. So, there has been a little bit to adjust to but my teammates have helped me so much. Being able to be with [USWNT teammates] Naomi [Girma] and Cat [Macário] too has been really helpful.”On the pitch the change has appeared seamless. After making her Chelsea debut against Aston Villa in September, her first goal followed shortly after, at Stamford Bridgeagainst Paris FC in the Champions League– something she did not expect to happen “for six months or something” – and she has become a regular starter under Sonia Bompastor.“Sonia teaches me a lot,” she says. “I feel like she’s really a players’ manager. Knowing that it’s hard moving to a different country, I think she just wants me to feel integrated with the team. On the field, learning about mentality is something she talks about a lot and always being aggressive and going forward. She talks about our ambitions for the year and just setting the standard and winning a lot of trophies.”Thompson already feels she has learned a lot about her game as she adapts. “The style of play is just a little bit different,” she says. “In the NWSL, I feel more like we are in transition a lot … Here you play so many different teams with different styles. Especially being able to play in Champions League, you play teams from like Spain and Italy and you experience different philosophies of soccer and tactics.“I feel like I’ve had to learn a lot about my game because I’ve been adjusting so much. With that comes different things that I have to think about that I didn’t have to before … I have a lot of growth to do.”“Just being around world‑class players is amazing. I feel like I would just get better even if I wasn’t playing. Being around so many amazing players that just teach me different things every day is really cool.”View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thompson admits: ‘I don’t think I really understood the history of the England culture of it all.

Her first was memorable: she scored a sensational opener in a1-1 draw at the Emirates Stadiumin November.“I was in awe of how many people were there and I could hear everything,” she recalls. “It was really cool. Just being able to play at the Emirates was crazy. It’s always going to be a rivalry when two really good teams face each other, but I don’t think I really understood the history of the England culture of it all.

The instant proceedings are also brought in breach of the covenant not to sue.”Dudfield says he is owed $17.5m (£13.1m).The dispute has shone a light on the largely hidden operations and vast sums of money that power one of the world’s most successful betting operations.Bloom is the majority shareholder and chair of the Premier League club Brighton and has made his fortune from gambling.Dudfield, a professional gambler who used to work for Bloom, introduced his former boss to Cottrell. He is pursuing a case against Bloom and his syndicate, claiming that he is owed potentially millions of pounds from an arrangement they reached in which bets were placed for Bloom through Cottrell’s accountsIn the 17-page response to Dudfield’s claims, Bloom says: “It was an express term of the agreement that Mr Cottrell would allow Mr Bloom to place bets on a certain gambling account in Mr Cottrell’s name, described by Mr Cottrell as a ‘hedging account’ which he held with [the gambling platform] Sportsbet.io.”The syndicate was entitled to a 60% share, and Dudfield and Cottrell 40% between them. Dudfield and Cottrell were entitled to 7% and 33% respectively, the document says.It alleges Bloom’s syndicatemade millions of dollars from betting using accounts in the name of Cottrell; $3.7m in net winnings from August to December 2022.In his claim filed last year, Dudfield alleges he thought the arrangement had ended at the end of 2022 because he believed Cottrell had ended his ties with Bloom’s syndicate.But Bloom’s defence says the syndicate continued to place bets through Cottrell up until October 2025, garnering another $2.4m in net winnings. It also claims Dudfield had no agreement for any fee or commission for business between him and Cottrell after 2022, and that if Dudfield is owed any money, it is for Cottrell to pay him.Another key point of contention between Dudfield and Bloom appears to be over whether or not the agreement with Dudfield, Cottrell and Bloom covered a wide range of Cottrell’s betting accounts.Just one account belonging to Cottrell was used before Dudfield “cashed out”, according to Bloom’s court document. Five others were used by Bloom only afterwards and he denies these include an alleged account at the online betting platform stake.com.The court document confirms that multiple apparent third parties were used by Bloom’s syndicate to place bets through “exotic accounts”. But there was no “standard practice” for how they operated and they were not referred to as “secret”, according to the defence.Bloom does not admit the syndicate is “secretive”, but confirms it keeps “information barriers” between departments and those who place bets at Starlizard Consulting, which operates the syndicate, according to the document. It is “generally successful” but that it generates £600m a year – a claim made by Dudfield – is an “exaggeration”, the defence says.Bloom’s defence does not address some of the allegations, including claims that footballers and businessmen were used as frontmen for the betting syndicate.Bloom’s defence notes that in 2018, after Dudfield left employment at Starlizard Consulting Limited but before the agreement involving Cottrell, he was given £405,000 to settle a debt, which was set against his share of future winnings from the syndicate, which amounted only to £102,000.Membership of the syndicate was a perk sometimes given to employees, though there are also non-employee members, according to the defence.Bloom agreed via Ian McAleavy, an employee at StarLizard, to enter into a new agreement with Dudfield in 2022, after he introduced him to Cottrell.High-profile, successful gamblers can find themselves effectively shut out of betting sites because of the scale and frequency of the bets they place. This means “whales” are often deployed to place bets on their behalf. As someone known for high-stakes betting, Cottrell has the profile of a “whale”.Still, Bloom did not require so-called “exotic accounts” that used other people’s identities, and much of his betting does not “involve the use of such accounts”, according to the court document.Lawyers acting for Cottrell said when approached last year about Dudfield’s legal action: “Our client is not a party to those proceedings but considers it would be inappropriate for him to comment on them in the media.”Dudfield and Bloom declined to comment on the ongoing legal proceedings.Explore more on these topicsBrighton & Hove AlbionSport bettingGamblingnewsShareReuse this content"

The Fifa head honcho spent Sunday in Rabatlooking slightly sheepishas he stood alongside Morocco’s Prince Moulay Rachid. After trying his best not to hand the Afcon trophy to Senegal’s players, Big G moved front and centre again to console Brahim Díaz and present him with the award for theworst penalty ever takentournament’s top scorer. Having reassured Díaz that, as president of Fifa, he makes colossal errors of judgment all the time and nobody seems to mind, Infantino then jetted back to his Alpine lair to check on the chances of Morocco and Senegal meeting at the Geopolitics World Cup.Speaking of the GWC, the usual petty gripes of extortionate ticket prices, inefficient transport links anda state-sponsored hostile environmentin the USA USA USA had to take a back seat this week. With Donald Trumpthreateningto forcefully annex Greenland – the Danish-owned territory that gave the football world Jesper Grønkjær – Uefa suits meeting in Budapest were forced to pause a particularly lavish buffet todiscuss a response. The spectre of a European boycott loomed briefly on the horizon, before Trumpapparently lost interestin the whole idea. Still, Fifa kept curiously silent, havingproduced a statement on Sundaybacking the award of its peace prize to Trump despite his emerging enthusiasm forinvading other countries.Infantino’s relationship with European football’sgrands fromagescould best be described as uneasy. Several delegates walked out whenhe turned up late for his own annual congress in May, after some very public hobnobbing with Trump and Middle East leaders. With 16 European teams taking part at the GWC,an appearance on home turf in Davoslooked like a good opportunity to smooth things over. Infantino is a true disruptor at heart and instead decided the time was right to take a few swings. As part of a largely irrelevant defence of a Human Rights World Cup with “virtually no incidents” in 2022, Infantino added: “For the first time in history, no Brit was arrested during a World Cup. Imagine!” It’s the kind of comment that will bristle even staunch “stick to football” England fans, who might be inclined to respondin the Self-Righteous style. Oi, Infantino! We admire your ability to cosy up to autocrats and oligarchs the world over, but your barely disguised disdain for match-going fans is a step too far! And besides, we’re pretty sure no British fans were arrested at USA 94.“It was a party, and the next one will be exactly the same,” Infantino Pitbulled, referring to a tournament that contributed towardsat least 6,500 migrant workerslosing their lives. On the GWC, he added: “The tickets are not cheap … I was hammered because of the prices,” suddenly sounding like a cowboy builder with no control of his overheads. “And the main critics were from Germany and England, of course.” Those Europeans, with their rich football heritage and fan-led initiatives to keep the gilded, hollowed-out soul of the game from floating entirely away from its roots. Fans of Senegal, Africa’s new champions, could face months of jumping through hoops just to get into the USA USA USA. Where is the gratitude? The Football Supporters’ Association was quick to hit back at Infantino’s latest outburst in a concise statement. “While we’ve got Mr Infantino’s attention, we’d like to point out that rather than making cheap jokes about our fans, he should concentrate on making cheap tickets.” They’re right, of course, but we won’t hold our breath.QUOTE OF THE DAY“I kind of think of this as like going away for college like all my friends did … living in a different place without my family is completely different from anything I’ve experienced before.

This is why I cover the sportFri 23 Jan 2026 08.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.39 ESTShareThere’s an old pennant hanging on the wall of my office here in Washington DC, tucked between a poster of indoor soccer legend Steve Zungul and a photo of Pelé riding a horse. “Soccer,” it reads, “the sport of the 80s.”For a century or so, soccer was always the sport of the next decade. Clear-thinking businesspeople tried everything to sell it to Americans, but soccer was always considered too foreign and exotic, an activity best practiced and consumed by outsiders. Even in the mid-80s, when I started playing, it was still very muchothered.It’s what drew me to the sport in the first place.Later, as an angsty teenager living in Spain, watching Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona sides rewired my brain in the same way Nirvana’s Nevermind did. When I came home to Tennessee a year later, in 1993, there was no top flight to speak of in the United States. I spent my time watching the Nashville Metros of the old A-League with about 75 other weirdos. It was a carnival of misfits, and I was in heaven.Yet I still wanted the sport to break through, and there was hope on the horizon, in the form of the 1994 World Cup. That tournament finally thrust soccer fully into the American public consciousness, and the game has continued to grow since then. Americans wake up in the wee hours to watch games from abroad and are finally warming up to their own version of the sport, as well.When I started writing about soccer in the early 2010s, I loved doing stories that were floating around in the ether, more closely related to the culture, history and sociology of the sport than the matches themselves. I couldn’t help but think that, If I’d been writing about baseball or American football, most of those stories would have already been written.Yet I’ve found over the years that there are seemingly unlimited stories to be told about American soccer, past and present alike. The game here and abroad touches so many parts of American society – politics, business, culture and so on. These are things that demand serious coverage … and less-serious coverage as well.After all, we’re only a half-century removed from that moment that Pelé took the field on horseback.Pablo joins the Guardian as part of ourongoing expansioncovering soccer in the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The head coach also ­welcomes back George Furbank, who has struggled with calf and arm injuries recently and has not played for England since November 2024.A clutch of players including Fin Smith, Ollie Lawrence, Fin Baxter, Tom Roebuck and Ben Curry will head to next week’s warm weather training camp in Girona for rehabilitation but it remains to be seen whether they will be fit to face Wales at Twickenham for England’s opener on 7 February.Trips to Murrayfield and Rome follow, either side of the visit of Ireland to Twickenham, but despite England’s poor record in the tournament of late, Borthwick has told his players to put themselves on course for the title in Paris on the final weekend, calling on supporters to cross the Channel in their droves.Quick GuideMcCall to step down as Saracens director of rugbyShowSaracens have announced Mark McCall will step down as director of rugby at the end of the season, with Brendan Venter  to return for the 2026-27 campaign.Following 15 seasons in the job, McCall will remain as technical adviser and join the board. The South African Venter will return to a position he first held in 2009, having then recruited McCall as first-team coach, before switching to a part-time role as technical adviser, with Saracens going on to success domestically and in Europe.McCall said: \"I am immensely proud of what we have achieved at Saracens and grateful for the opportunity to have led the rugby programme for so long.\"I feel the time is right for change, while still remaining deeply involved in the club I care so much about. I am really looking forward to supporting Brendan and contributing in a way that helps Saracens continue to move forward.\"Saracens said the  changes will provide a \"sense of continuity and collaboration\" as the club moves into its \"next chapter\".Venter said: \"I am incredibly proud to once again lead the rugby programme. Mark's continued involvement was key to me accepting the appointment.\"PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“We met a couple of weeks ago and we talked about theSix NationsChampionship. We know it’s tight, we know there’s lots of good teams in it,” said Borthwick. “We also know the last seven Six Nations Championships have gone down to the last round of fixtures and we talked about that as a team.“On 14 March in Paris, we want to be in a position entering that game where we can achieve what we’re all aiming to achieve. That’s what we want. We want England fans flooding across the Channel to Paris to come and watch the team in a massive encounter in the final round with the opportunity to achieve what we want. We also know that the only way you get there is by ensuring each of you take each step one at a time and get our preparation right for the start of the tournament.”Borthwick has also called on his players to relish the added expectation that comes with a winning run that dates back to last February. “The first thing I’d like to say about that is I think it is brilliant that people are talking in that way about this England team,” he added. “They can see the development of the team and they can see the talent that’s in the team and they can see the potential that’s in it. I think we’re nowhere near ­maxing out the potential.“We have players in there with huge amounts of talent, and whilst we’re still reasonably low on experience at Test level, as they get used to Test rugby their growth is going to be enormous. I’m really pleased at how the players are embracing how we want to play, and taking the game on. I want them to attack this tournament, come in with a mindset to play brave and attack.”Quick GuideEngland's Six Nations squadShowForwards:Ollie Chessum (Leicester , 30 caps), Arthur Clark (Gloucester, 1 cap), Alex Coles (Northampton, 14 caps), Luke Cowan-Dickie (Sale, 53 caps), Chandler Cunningham-South (Harlequins, 20 caps), Tom Curry (Sale, 65 caps), Theo Dan (Saracens, 20 caps), Trevor Davison (Northampton, 3 caps), Ben Earl (Saracens, 46 caps), Greg Fisilau (Exeter, uncapped), Ellis Genge (Bristol, 75 caps), Jamie George (Saracens, 105 caps), Joe Heyes (Leicester, 17 caps), Maro Itoje (Saracens, 97 caps) – captain, Emmanuel Iyogun (Northampton, uncapped), Guy Pepper (Bath, 7 caps), Henry Pollock (Northampton, 5 caps), Bevan Rodd (Sale, 10 caps), Vilikesa Sela (Bath, uncapped), Sam Underhill (Bath, 45 caps)Backs:Henry Arundell (Bath, 11 caps), Seb Atkinson (Gloucester, 2 caps)Elliot Daly (Saracens, 74 caps), Fraser Dingwall (Northampton, 7 caps), Immanuel Feyi-Waboso (Exeter, 13 caps), George Ford (Sale, 105 caps), Tommy Freeman (Northampton, 22 caps), George Furbank (Northampton, 14 caps), Alex Mitchell (Northampton, 27 caps), Cadan Murley (Harlequins, 4 caps) , Max Ojomoh (Bath, 2 caps), Henry Slade (Exeter, 74 caps), Marcus Smith (Harlequins, 46 caps), Ben Spencer (Bath, 14 caps), Freddie Steward (Leicester, 41 caps), Jack van Poortvliet (Leicester, 21 caps)Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Sela’s inclusion in a training squad for the first time comes after injuries to Will Stuart and Asher Opoku-Fordjour. Trevor Davison, who has three caps, is also included as is his Northampton teammate Iyogun with doubts over Baxter’s availability in the early part of the tournament. Such injury disruption to the front row threatens to blunt the impact of Borthwick’s “Pom Squad”, used with such impressive effect during the autumn internationals.Asked if he will have to tweak his strategy for replacements, Borthwick said: “Possibly. You deal with each of those situations on their own merits. We have also got plenty of depth in other positions and playing experience. That decision, I have talked at length about what we need to do in how there are so many Test matches that are within a score of each other in that final part of the game. So that’ll be a decision around the experienced front-row forwards.”Explore more on these topicsEngland rugby union teamSteve BorthwickSix Nations 2026Six NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

The Australian defeated Frances Tiafoe in a spectacular three sets on Friday night, 6-3, 6-4, 7-5, to again reach the last 16 at his home grand slam.There he will meet Alexander Bublik, the dangerous 10th seed who came back to beat the Australian twice in high-profile matches last year. They were two of a series of agonising, frontrunning defeats that tainted De Minaur’s 2025 season, including one at the ATP Finals against Lorenzo Musetti that prompted him to admit he had become“quite dark”.Full-throttle Norrie overpowered again by Zverev to end British singles hopesRead moreAgainst Tiafoe though, there was no late turnaround, even if the American was unfortunate in a tight third set. De Minaur relied on his canny ability to stay in points others would give up on, and a penetrating backhand that made the American’s forehand ill. “It was a hell of a battle, so huge respect to him,” the Australian said. “I played some of my best tennis in the tournament for two and a half sets, and he just lifted it when he needed it.”Despite 40 unforced errors – 12 more than the Australian – Tiafoe helped entertain the near-capacity Rod Laver Arena crowd. At one stage he fell to the court, having lost another see-sawing rally. Hand outstretched, he asked a ballgirl for assistance. With a struggle and a smile she helped him up, as the crowd roared delight.De Minaur’s victory means he has reached the last 16 at Melbourne Park for five consecutive years. He is the second Australian man in the open era – after John Newcombe, who did eight in a row in the 1960s and 1970s – to achieve the feat. “I’m in a position where I want more, and I’m going to be pushing for that,” De Minaur said.That would mean victory over a player who has become his nemesis. Bublik won 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 at Roland Garros in May, prompting De Minaur to say:“I have to adapt and make sure it doesn’t happen again.”It did, at the Paris Masters in October, when the Russian-born player – who switched allegiances to Kazakhstan as a 19-year-old, citing a lack of support in his homeland – won 6-7 (5), 6-4, 7-5.Bublik was still playing late on Friday night when De Minaur was speaking to the press, preventing the Australian from having to divulge his thoughts on the Kazakhstani maverick, one of the tour’s entertainers. This is a man who once said he hated the sport, and credits a spontaneous Las Vegas road trip for his breakthrough 2025. Finishing his match against Tomás Martín Etcheverry close to midnight, Bublik, however, was asked about De Minaur. “He’s a local hero, he’s a great player, we’ve shared a lot of matches together and I can’t wait to step on to the court with him,” he said.View image in fullscreenAlexander Bublik is in the world’s top 10 after an excellent season in 2025.Photograph: Lukas Coch/EPAThe Kazakhstani’s cavalier attitude offers a counterpoint to De Minaur’s wholesome, Weet-Bix kid approach. Before those two defeats last year, De Minaur had beaten the 28-year-old – whose deft touch belies his near 2m (6ft 6in) frame – three times. Those came before Bublik’s recent rise up the rankings, however, which meant he graduated to the world’s top 10 for the first time this month.“I matured a bit,” Bublik said, explaining his rise to the on-court announcer. “And I really like being home to be honest, and I realised quickly when I dropped in ranking if I play well and make a lot of points in few events, I can have more weeks off.” He grinned as he said it, with the same twinkle in the eye that led to him once hitting six underarm serves in a single game (no, not match).The Australian does not have a 230km/h (142mph) serve, and he looks at the game in a different way. “I have been always one to let my tennis do the talking, and I have always found it quite tough to have that confidence if the results aren’t there,” he said.“I know some players have the ability to not be affected by results, but for me, in terms of confidence, it was quite hard for me to really believe in myself unless I got those results. As the years have gone on, I have had those results.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Alex de MinaurAustralia sportAustralian OpenTennisnewsShareReuse this content"

Rather than easing into a long best-of-five-sets match, he played at full throttle from the beginning, pulverising forehands and forcing himself inside the baseline at all costs. He worked through every shot in his arsenal, frequently sweeping forward to the net. He punctuated each small victory with booming cries of “Allez”.In tennis, however, matchups are king and past battles between Norrie andAlexander Zverevhad already illustrated how the German’s game is built to outlast and overpower his British opponent. Their seventh meeting produced one of their most high-quality matches but the result was no different as Zverev, the third seed, secured a tough 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victory over the 26th seed to advance to the fourth round.Victoria Mboko wins tense third-round tussle to set up Sabalenka showdownRead moreNorrie, the last British singles player in the tournament, departs Australia with another solid grand slam showing despite his defeat. He has enjoyed a successful 12 months at the top tournaments, winning every match he has been expected to win. Only the best players in the world have been able to defeat him in the past four majors:Carlos Alcaraz at Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic at the French and US Opens, and now Zverev in Melbourne. For all the grit, discipline and spirit he showcases every time he steps on the court, ­Norrie lacks the firepower to consistently beat the top names.This matchup is particularly reflective of those struggles. Zverev entered John Cain Arena with six wins and no defeats against Norrie and theirspectacular fourth-round match here in 2024, which Zverev won in a fifth set tie-break after four hours of spectacular, uncharacteristic net rushing from the left-hander, was the only occasion Norrie had won a set against the German. Every other meeting had taken a similar route, with Zverev matching Norrie’s physicality and eventually overpowering him with his far greater serve and ball speed.One of the 30-year-old’s most admirable qualities is his self-awareness. He takes pride in the attritional style of play that has earned him so much success. However, he also understood that far more would be required against Zverev. Instead of futilely attempting to grind the ­German down, he tried his best to break through his defences. He approached the net 40 times, continually attacked his forehand and mixed in numerous drop shots.Norrie played well, but not well enough to turn the tables on one of his most difficult opponents. Still, he believes that this result will serve him well: “I think it’s another bit of experience to push yourself in those moments, third round of a grand slam against one of the best players in the world,” he said. “I think I just need to get better. There’s nothing else, but I know I can hang with him for two hours 30 and I dropped after that. They’re used to playing at that level for long periods of time. So I think that’s how I see it, so I can take a lot of confidence from that.View image in fullscreenCameron Norrie threw everything he had at Alex Zverev but lost in four sets.Photograph: Joel Carrett/EPA“But how can I sustain that for longer? For him, I think it’s normal, and for me I’m feeling like I’m pushing, pushing, pushing. Then I drop a little bit, and then, boom, it’s match done very quickly. It’s a lot of credit to him, but I think I can take a lot from this match and a lot of confidence from getting through a couple of tough matches.”Norrie was understandably in good spirits when he emerged after the match. Life is good. Nine months ago, he was ranked 91st and desperately struggling to find any confidence.At the beginning of this long ­season, he sits at No 25 in the live rankings, feeling confident about his game and enjoying his time on the court, even in defeat. He has plenty of room to improve and the potential to continue rising, particularly if he performs more consistently at the smaller events. The challenge ahead is exciting.“I can’t be any more happy where I am,” he said. “It will always be nice to be higher, but I think the most ­important thing is I’m healthy, I’m feeling confident, I have a great team, there’s no stress anywhere else in my life.“So I’m enjoying everything, and I think that’s so much fun to come to these slams, play these matches, and just compete as hard as I can. I’m looking forward to the year, and I want to keep going out there and playing matches like this where I can push myself and challenge these guys.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian Open 2026Alexander ZverevAustralian OpenTennisAustralia sportnewsShareReuse this content"

The former Masters champion could prevail this weekend in the Dubai Desert Classic and see a decent chunk of the $1.5m (£1.1m) first prize duly handed back to the DP World Tour in fines. Reed has joked that it will not be particularly easy for him to make a profit on this tour during 2026. Indeed, he basically starts his season in the red.Reed’s membership of the DP World and LIV circuits leads to sanctions from the former every time he tees up on the latter. He lost an appeal over that situation in 2023 yet, unlike some others, opted to keep playing on what was once theEuropean Tour. Reed’s position is further affected by the general understanding that LIV would no longer pay fines on behalf of its members from the end of 2025.“It is a really fluid one depending on how much it [the fine] is because it also depends where the event is,” Reed said. “There are so many different factors that go into it. Trying to wrap your head around all of it, it’s confusing. I’d rather just tee it up and play; and if costs me this, that, whatever, I’ll go play.Hatton dismisses LIV tension with McIlroy as talk in Dubai focuses on wines not finesRead more“We haven’t played an event yet that we would be fined so we don’t know really what it entails for this year. If it happens to be where I’m being fined and having to pay fines to play out here, so be it. I’m not going to allow that to deter me from showing support and playing on this tour. Play well and it offsets.”So far, so good on that front. Reed’s second round of 66 at the Emirates Club placed him at the summit of the leaderboard, nine under par, one clear of Andy Sullivan. Reed has previous for being at the centre of drama in Dubai; he infamously threw a tee peg at Rory McIlroy herethree years agobefore being edged out for the title by the Northern Irishman.“I guess I need to put my hand out, break the ice,” said Reed before a smile which implied devilment. “Or maybe he needs to throw one at me.”McIlroy’s 69 meant he comfortably survived for the weekend at two under. A further 36 holes will be useful to the Masters champion, who has looked well short of his best in the opening half of this tournament.Given McIlroy’s specialism at this course and the potential for him to make an early Saturday run, the gap to Reed is far from insurmountable.“I think I came from 10 behind a couple of years ago to win,” McIlroy said. “I’m seven back at the minute. If I go out there tomorrow, maybe in slightly better conditions in the morning and post a low one, then I’ll be right in the mix come Sunday. ”Tyrrell Hatton matched McIlroy’s round-two score to leap to five under. Reed’s LIV teammate Dustin Johnson missed the cut. Danny Willett, who had opened with a 76, withdrew before the start of Friday’s play.Explore more on these topicsEuropean TourGolfUS sportsLIV Golf SeriesnewsShareReuse this content"

        "Content": "12h ago08.44 ESTTumaini CarayolCameron Norrie did what he could. Rather than easing into a long best-of-five-sets match, he played at full throttle from the beginning by launching into forehands and forcing himself inside the baseline at all cost. He worked through every shot in his arsenal, frequently sweeping forward to the net. He punctuated each small victory with booming cries of “allez”.In tennis, however, match-ups are king and the past meetings between Norrie and Alexander Zverev have already illustrated how the German’s game is built to outlast and overpower the Briton. This seventh meeting between them ended no differently as Zverev, the third seed,secured a tough 7-5, 4-6, 6-3, 6-1 victoryover the 26th seed to advance to the fourth round of the Australian Open.Despite the defeat, Norrie departs Australia with another solid grand slam showing. He has enjoyed some of his best form at the elite tournaments over the past year, winning every match he has entered the court as favourite. He has been defeated by top players in each of the four majors, withCarlos Alcaraz defeating him at Wimbledon, Novak Djokovic doing so at the French Open and US Open, and now Zverev following on in Melbourne. For all the grit, discipline and spirit he showcases every time he steps on the court, Norrie has simply lacked the weapons to consistently trouble the top players over the best-of-five-set matches.Full-throttle Norrie overpowered again by Zverev to end British singles hopesRead moreShare"

This is why I do what I doFri 23 Jan 2026 08.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.39 ESTShareWhen I was a kid, I was drawn to stories that involved a good treasure hunt.Favorite movie:National Treasure, the 2004 Nicolas Cage classic. Favorite book series:The 39 Clues. Favorite puzzle: a word search. Dream book project: a hunt for a treasure hidden across Olympic host cities – and naturally, a companion series involving World Cup stadiums. (There’s still time!)Today, my favorite part of journalism is the same thing: the search. For the story that’s sitting in an unexpected place. The story that’s buried behind the story. The story you can only see whenlooking through a new lens.The projects I’ve most enjoyed working on are those that emerge from small details, the gems waiting inside box scores or game notes – the players with demanding side jobs; the book that’s taken over the locker room; the uniform details that fans obsess over.Indeed, the world of sports is what those treasure hunters would probably term a target-rich environment. But I’d say that soccer is the richest of all of the climes. The stories around soccer – the history, the crowds, the cultures, the songs, the individuality, its worldwide scope – are all so ample and ever-changing. I fell in love with what happened off the field before I understood much of what happened on it. (I know now.)The subtle, intricate details of the game pair nicely with spending hours rifling through pages of transcriptions to pick out the best quotes. The near-nonstop fixture list demands similarly relentless focus, writing outline upon outline. I’d imagine that scoring a goal feels something like when you finally find the right way to sequence paragraphs in a story, making everything click into place. It’s probably no surprise I was drawn to editing.The search for stories remains exciting, and it’s a never ending one: for what’s new, for what’s next, for what’s hiding beneath all of it.Ella joins the Guardian as part of ourongoing expansioncovering soccer in the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

The supreme court upheld the law in January 2025, but on Trump’s first day in office, he signed an executive order postponing the ban.He has since repeatedly continued to delay its enforcement while the US, the company and potential American partners were negotiating over an agreement.In September, Trump signed anotherexecutive order, which outlined a plan for US investors to take over the majority of the company’s operations and for the new version of TikTok to be controlled by a seven-member, majority-American board of directors of cybersecurity and national security experts.Adam Presser, who previously served as TikTok’s general manager and global head of operations and trust & safety, would serve as CEO of the new venture, the company said on Thursday.The US joint venture is overseen by a seven-member board of directors, including executives fromOracle, Silver Lake and MGX, a senior advisor to TPG, and Shou Zi Chew, TikTok’s chief executive.The US entity will “operate under defined safeguards that protect national security through comprehensive data protections, algorithm security, content moderation, and software assurances for US users”, the announcement said. The content recommendation algorithm will beretrained, tested and updated based on US user data, the firm added.A White House official said the Chinese and US governments had signed off on the deal. A Chinese embassy spokesperson told Politico his country’s “position on TikTok has been consistent and clear” and that he had “no new information to share at the moment”.In aposton social media Thursday night, Trump thanked China’s president, Xi Jinping, “for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal”. “I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok! It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice,” the president wrote.Concerns from US lawmakers and officials about TikTok center around user data security, with fears thatthe Chinese government could use the platform to harvest datafrom American users, claims which the company has repeatedly denied.The legislation passed in 2024 under Joe Biden barred ByteDance from retaining operational ties with a US TikTok venture, but the law gave the president authority to decide if a deal complies with its requirements.The threat of a ban had caused widespread backlash in the US from influencers and creators who depend on the app.Silver Lake, Oracle and MGX will each hold 15% in the new venture, the company said. The investment firm of Michael Dell, the billionairefounderof Dell Technologies, is also an investor.Under the arrangement, Oracle will oversee the algorithm that recommends videos in US users. The system will be retrained using US data to “ensure the content feed is free from outside manipulation”, Chew said.China will retain control of the algorithm, with the country’s cybersecurity regulator previously saying it had agreed that any TikTok US deal would include “licensing … and other intellectual property rights”.This article was amended on 23 January 2026 to clarify that the new board includes a senior advisor to TPG, not a current TPG executive.Explore more on these topicsTikTokOraclePrivate equitySoftwarenewsShareReuse this content"

We don’t know how to make it inclusive. Wake up, AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting ahead of it,” she said.Much of the debate at the annual meeting of the business and political elite in the Swiss ski resort this week has been hijacked byDonald Trump’s on-off tariff threatsover the future of Greenland.But many delegates were also keen to highlight the risks and benefits of AI. Christy Hoffman, general secretary of the UNI global union, told the Guardian: “It’s just a basic premise that the point of AI, on the business side, is to increase productivity, therefore lower costs – which will be cutting jobs.”“I think it’s time to come to terms with that disruption – and how to manage that disruption,” she said, calling for the productivity benefits to be distributed fairly across the economy.“We want to share in the gains. We’re not going to stop AI, nor do we want to even try – but we don’t want it to just roll over us.” She called on employers to discuss the role of AI tools with workers and their representatives before introducing them.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Microsoft chief executive, Satya Nadella, warned that AI could lose its “social permission” to compete for resources such as energy, for example, if it failed to generate benefits beyond a few powerful tech firms – such as the rapid development of effective new drugs.Georgieva was speaking on a panel alongside the president of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde, who warned that the AI boom could be hampered by growing mistrust between rival economies, as the US throws up tariff barriers.“We are dependent on each other,” she said, pointing out that AI was capital intensive, energy intensive and data intensive. If countries did not work cooperatively and “define the new rules of the game,” she said, there would be less capital and less data. “We are in a bind, lets face it,” she said.Lagarde also sounded the alarm about widening global inequality, highlighting the “disparity that is getting deeper and bigger”.Earlier in the week at Davos, the Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, urged delegates to face up to a permanent “rupture” in the global economic order, and band together in the face of erratic US trade policy.But Lagarde said she was less gloomy. “I’m not exactly on the same page as Mark,” she said. “I’m not sure that we should be talking about rupture. I think we should be talking about alternatives.”Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)Work & careersComputingEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Reuters has also reported that SpaceX is seeking to raise $25bn from what would be one of the biggest ever global listings if it goes ahead.The year of the ‘hectocorn’: the $100bn tech companies that could float in 2026Read moreLast year Musk, the world’s richest man with a $690bn fortune, said SpaceX’s annual revenue would be $15.5bn, with $1.1bn of that coming from contracts with Nasa, the US space agency. SpaceX generates revenues from deploying reusable rockets for missions such as launching satellites and restocking the International Space Station. It also operates the Starlink broadband service.Reports of SpaceX’s flotation plans come amid expectations of a bumper year for US tech listings. OpenAI,the developer of ChatGPT, and AI rival Anthropic are among the startups that are the focus of IPO speculation, with reported valuations of $1tn and $350bn respectively. Thepotential IPOshave been dubbed “hectocorns” – businesses worth more than $100bn.Neil Wilson, an analyst at Saxo Capital Markets, said Musk’s ambitions to colonise Mars were the “headline grabber” for SpaceX, but investors will pay more attention to growth plans, such as putting solar farms anddatacentres into orbit.Referring to a potential OpenAI IPO, Wilson added: “SpaceX is going to garner a lot of attention but it’s going to be a real test for these AIIPOs. If OpenAI does IPO then it’s a litmus test for the entire sector – can we really hang our hats on a startup? Do the figures add up?“The stock market has been riding the AI wave for two years and faces a stern test of resilience with some monster IPOs that will define whether this was a bubble or not.”Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan declined to comment.

But over the last two weeks, the people who live here have felt even more isolated after they were left without a way of communicating with the outside world as aresult of Storm Goretti.“I think people feel let down, angry, failed,” said Mark Pugh, an audiobook producer, who has spent more hours than he would care to tot up carefully picking his way out of Cucurrian and sitting in his car in a layby to find a mobile signal good enough to work from. “This storm has shown thatCornwallisn’t resilient enough. A lot is promised, but not enough is delivered.”Goretti brought down thousands of power, phone and broadband lines andcaused countless trees to fall, including one thatcrushed the caravan of 50-year-old James Southey and killed him.For days, manyhundreds of people were left without power, water or both, but while those services have been restored, communication links in some places remain down a fortnight on. In a world where reliable online connections are needed for everything from health consultations to banking, it makes life very difficult.View image in fullscreenFrom left: Rona Cowls, Elaine Claxton and Mark Pugh, who felt forgotten after being left without broadband, a landline and mobile signal.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The Guardian“It’s like we’re forgotten,” said Elaine Claxton, 70, an actor, as she pointed to the wires still broken and dangling next to a giant fallen tree on the lane leading to her home in Cucurrian. She has no broadband, no landline and the mobile signal is unreliable at best. Staying in touch with frail family members a few miles away has been fraught.Her sister, Shelley Claxton, 63, an animal trainer, said places such as Cucurrian were resilient. “When you’re as remote as we are, you have to be, but I think this storm shows us we need to do something different. Nature is whipping up more and more storms and we need to find ways of adapting to that.”On the Lizard peninsula, the southernmost point of the British mainland, Sam Kirby, 53, described how the communication breakdown led to difficulties in working as a digital marketing consultant and in her volunteer role as a coastguard rescue officer.View image in fullscreenSam Kirby’s home in Porthoustock, Cornwall, was damaged by Storm Goretti earlier this month.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianHer old-style copper landline meant the coastguard station officer could – just about – contact her by phone, but without broadband, working was challenging.“I had to go full digital nomad, which included time working in a supermarket car park with the car heater on, in the library, and basically perching anywhere I could to find wifi,” she said.“We’re constantly being told by those pushing Cornwall as a place to work that we’ve got to trade nationally or internationally, that we have the best broadband in the country, that we’re a booming digital economy. It’s hard to boom digitally when you can’t even get a text message out.”Kirby and the people of Cucurrian are angry thatOpenreach, which builds and maintains the UK’s largest broadband network, has not restored services more quickly.There is concern that the continuing switch from copper phone lines to full-fibre broadband makes them more vulnerable. “If this happens again next year, we won’t even have the copper landline so won’t have any link out at all,” said Kirby.View image in fullscreenThe remains of a tree that knocked through someone’s roof in Goldsithney, Cornwall, during the storm.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianIt is not just remote communities that have been hit. Karen Bennett, 72, lives close to Penzance town centre but a pine tree brought down a pole there, cutting off her broadband.A new pole has been put up but the broadband hasn’t returned, making her work as chair of the twinning association forging links between Penzance and the French town of Concarneau difficult. “We’ve had to find ways of working around it,” she said. “It’s frustrating. We still don’t know when the broadband will be back.”These are interesting political and cultural times in Cornwall. The UK government has indicated that it willexplore a bespoke devolution deal for Cornwall, possibly giving it more control over transport, housing and economic development.‘It has destroyed years of work’: Cornish beauty spot loses 80% of its trees to Storm GorettiRead moreThis week the Cornish language – Kernewek – was officially recognisedunder part three of the European charter for regional or minority languages, which gives it greater protection and status.But the loss of power, water and the continuing communications issues have made many Cornish people question whether the rest of the UK cares enough about the far-west of Britain, when it is not holidaying or visiting second homes there.Loveday Jenkin, a leading member of the political partyMebyon Kernow, which campaigns for greater self-government for Cornwall, said Goretti had exposed weaknesses in its infrastructure.“It shows Cornwall should have more devolved resilience money,” Jenkin said. “People want to treat Cornwall as a holiday playground. They need to recognise that there are people on the ground who have to manage it but don’t have the money.”Jenkin spoke as yet another storm, named Ingrid by the Portuguese national weather service,brought in strong winds and heavy rainon Friday. “I think UK government needs to recognise Cornwall as the canary in the coalmine in relation to climate change,” Jenkin said. “There will be more storms coming.”View image in fullscreenThe remains of a fallen tree in Goldsithney which also blocked a road.Photograph: Jonny Weeks/The GuardianOpenreach said it could not put a figure on how many people in Cornwall were still without broadband and rejected the idea that the switch to fibre made the county more vulnerable, arguing the outages were largely down to trees falling on overhead wires or taking down poles, which affected the copper and fibre network.A spokesperson said: “Storm Goretti has caused the worst impact to our network in Cornwall in recent memory and as soon as it was safe to do so, we’ve had teams of engineers working round the clock to repair the extensive damage.“We have managed to reconnect thousands of homes and businesses, but there is more to do and we know how frustrating that is. Unfortunately, the reality is that this type of repair work – closing roads, replacing poles and overhead cables – is complex and time-consuming.”The recovery will take a long time. Alasdair Moore, the head of estate and gardens on Tresco, one of the Isles of Scilly, which lies 30 miles (48km) off the mainland and was battered by 99mph gusts during Goretti, said the effect was devastating.Trees fell, houses were damaged and the water supply interrupted. “The scale of the clear-up is huge,” said Moore. “It will be ongoing for a few years but the way the community and the team has responded has been magnificent.”Moore said remote communities such as those huddled on Scilly and west Cornwall always got on with it and came good. “Dealing with gales is very much part of this place’s history,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCornwallExtreme weatherBroadbandInternetUK weatherfeaturesShareReuse this content"

We’re predicted to grow 1.5% this year. That is not enough.”He highlighted the recent decision to allowthe £26bn state-owned British Business Bankto buy equity stakes in companies, including the announcement last week of a £25m investment in the energy supplierOctopus’s software spin-off, Kraken.“The most potential in our economy, in the short and medium term, is scale-up companies,” Kyle said. “I was at Octopus yesterday. They’re now employing 1,500 people in their head office in London alone.“We can find other companies that are on that kind of trajectory and we can expedite their growth. Then it will create thousands of new jobs, and it will create enormous amounts of wealth, which will recycle through the economy in a really fast way.”“I am betting big. And I am picking winners,” he added. “It’s more activist. And there will be things that don’t work out, sure. But to have a healthy economy, failure leads to success.”This week’s summit in the Swiss ski resort has been overshadowed by Donald Trump’s threatto slap tariffs on eight European countriesif they stood in the way of his hopes of annexing Greenland.The presidentbacked away from the ideaof punitive import taxes on Wednesday evening, after discussions with the secretary general of Nato, Mark Rutte, but several leaders in the Swiss ski resort have said the global economic order has irrevocably changed.Kyle insisted international uncertainty was no reason not to press ahead with Labour’s agenda, highlighting the prospects of a “wave of opportunity that technology and life sciences and all these huge, huge, positive waves of innovation are going to present to us”.He said: “If we are too intimidated by the global challenges, if we are too distracted by domestic political to and fro, then we will take our eye off the ball, and we will miss the opportunity of a lifetime, and that means real things to real people.View image in fullscreenWhile technology secretary, Peter Kyle said he was a regular user of ChatGPT.Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA“There will be kids growing up like me that will not end up becoming successful like I have. It’ll be communities that, at the moment, are poor, and they will never have a hope of becoming prosperous. And I won’t stand for it. I would literally do anything. And if that means betting [on] winners, and getting it wrong from time to time, I’ll take it.”Announcing the beefing up of the government’s “global talent taskforce” in his department, the business secretary suggested that the UK hoped to capitalise on the instability unleashed by Trump’s policies to help it attract jobs and investment.“I will suck the best talent in from wherever it exists, and talent goes both ways across the Atlantic. And I want to make sure that we have a good balance in that because for too long it’s been in one direction,” he said.Highlighting the need to attract innovators in particular, Kyle added: “America is being disruptive with tariffs, but America isn’t the most friendly place for scientific endeavour in any case at the moment. Do the maths and add up where we’re going with this. We are going out there and we’re saying: ‘Actually, we have one of the best regulatory environments in the world for life sciences, and across the board.’”Keir Starmer has taken a tough line on migration – despitepushback from some quarters in the party– promising to reduce it and condemning Boris Johnson’s administration for what the prime minister has called an “open borders experiment”.But Kyle said he did not think public scepticism about migration extended to wealthy entrepreneurs. “People are deeply concerned about the immigration system we inherited, and the asylum system, which was overwhelmed, and was poorly administered by the Tories, and therefore broken,” he said.“I’ve never had anybody that says that people with a lot of money to invest in our country, who want to come here and create jobs, create businesses, shouldn’t be coming to do so.”He added: “I have a taskforce that’s doing this, embedded in our global network. We can offer the world’s most talented a bespoke package to come to the UK swiftly, to embed, and then, of course, be part of a funding landscape that is bountiful.”The 55-year-old MP for Hove and Portslade has been business secretary since Starmer’sSeptember reshuffle, replacing Jonathan Reynolds, who had done the job for several years in opposition.Kyle is politically close to the health secretary, Wes Streeting – who has beenrepeatedly mooted as a potential challenger to Starmer– but has been scrupulously loyal to the prime minister in public.Earlier this week, the business secretary rejected the suggestion that the UK try to negotiate a customs union with the EU, for which Streeting has signalled his support, telling the FT: “I think at the moment it would be foolish to slip towards what would be simple solutions.”Kyle has dyslexia and left his state school “without any usable” qualifications, as he has put it. He made his way to university aged 25, and went on to secure a PhD, then worked in the charity sector before entering politics.UK government borrowing falls to £11.6bn in DecemberRead moreIn his previous job of technology secretary, he was forced to defend his closeness to powerful tech companies. He is a regular user of the chatbot ChatGPT and an evangelist for the opportunities offered by the technology – and is often seen in the casual garb favoured by “tech bros”.Soon after taking on his current role, Kyle struck a deal with business groups and trade unions towater down the implementation of Labour’s Employment Rights Act, introducing a six-month probation period before the promised “day-tone rights” come into force.He has continued to work closely with his successor and friend, Liz Kendall, and said he has insisted the connecting door that blocked the corridor between their two offices be opened up.Asked whether AI would cause mass layoffs as companies decide they can manage without entry-level staff – a hot topic at Davos – Kyle said: “People are anxious and it’s going to be painful and difficult because change is always painful and difficult.”Kyle said Labour was ready to intervene to ensure the adoption of AI was less painful for poorer communities than the deindustrialisation of the 1980s, which cast a long shadow.He said: “Waves of industrial change have always gone badly when governments stand on the sidelines and are not participants. And I will not allow that to happen.“As tech secretary I was negotiating deals for investment in digital infrastructure, insisting it happened in poorer parts of the country. I’m the gatekeeper into our country for a lot of investors. And if they want to come and benefit from our country, then they can contribute to it as well.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic growth (GDP)Davos 2026Peter KyleDavosLabourAI (artificial intelligence)Octopus EnergyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) held around a quarter of the country and many critical resources – but were forced out of much of it within days. Though the SDF has effectively agreed to dissolution in principle, it has not shown it will do so in practice: a worrying sign for a fragile truce. A peaceful resolution is in everyone’s interests. Forcible integration by Damascus would risk breeding insurgency.The US relied upon the SDF in the battle against Islamic State. But Donald Trump hasembraced “attractive, tough” Mr Sharaa– a former jihadist who had a $10m US bounty on his head until late 2024. The US administration became increasingly frustrated at the SDF’s failure to implement last spring’s agreement to integration into the new army, apparently due to internal divisions. Tom Barrack, the US special envoy to Syria and ambassador to Turkey,wrotethis week that the rationale for partnership with the SDF had “largely expired” because Damascus was ready to take over security responsibilities.If the US has turned its back on the SDF, the second abandonment in this crisis is the western failure to deal with the tens of thousands of suspected IS members and their familiesheld in previously SDF-run prison camps such as al-Hawl– including their own nationals. The EU says that alleged breakouts are of “paramount concern”. In a country already struggling to recover from decades of Assad family dictatorship and years of civil war, which sawbrutal sectarian violenceinvolving government or allied forces last year,the risks are immense– and extend beyond the region.The US says it is transferring up to 7,000 of the most hardened fighters to detention in Iraq. Whatever they have done, they should be protected from torture, forced confession and execution. Women are reported to be among the most fanatical inmates, and to have raised their children accordingly. But years of dire conditions,without serious investment in deradicalisation, have increased the dangers they pose to others. Some of the foreign nationals held – like Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she left the UK to join IS – werestripped of their citizenship. But the British state cannot so easily shed its responsibility. Because countries hoped the issue would remain someone else’s, the threat has only grown. These detainees should be repatriated and dealt with by their own governments.Whatever the security capacity of the Syrian state – and Mr Sharaa’s forces went after IS as rivals before targeting them as an insurgent group – the country’s long-term prospects will be bleak without a brighter political horizon. That means inclusivity, dialogue, transitional justice and elections. Damascus has rightly reaffirmed the language and cultural rights ofKurdsin recent days, but shows little sign of tolerating political organisation by minorities which might threaten the centralised rule that it seeks.The volatility of Syria’s situation highlights the shamefulness of a third abandonment: Europe’s treatment of Syrians who managed to escape the country. While the country’s future remains in grave question, Austria and others are nowpushing for their repatriationto a place that will take an estimated $200bn to reconstruct, where their safety and rights remain fragile at best. Those governments must think again.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

If this creates a new western alliance against him, all to the goodFri 23 Jan 2026 11.28 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 12.56 ESTShareThe temptation is strong to hope that the storm has passed. To believe that a week that began with a US threat to seize a European territory, whether by force or extortion, has ended with thepromise of negotiationand therefore a return to normality. But that is a dangerous delusion. There can be no return to normality. The world we thought we knew has gone. The only question now is what takes its place – a question that will affect us all, that is full of danger and that, perhaps unexpectedly, also carries a whisper of hope.Forget thatDonald Trumpeventually backed down from his threats to conquer Greenland, re-holstering the economic gun he had put to the head of all those countries who stood in his way, the UK among them. The fact that he made the threat at all confirmed what should have been obvious since he returned to office a year ago: that, under him, the US has become an unreliable ally, if not an actual foe of its one-time friends.That much was spelled out in ways both gross and insulting. In the second category comes his latest remark that Nato allies were “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan, a despicable affront to the families of the 457 British service personnel and their comrades from across the alliance who gave their lives in that conflict.In the first category was the unveiling of his latest venture: having earlier told the Norwegian prime minister, who hefalsely accusedof denying him a Nobel medal, that he was becoming bored of peace, he came to Davos to launch his “board of peace”. Trump is the one book you can judge by its cover, and so the new body’s logo said it all: asone wit observed, it was basically the UN badge “except dipped in gold and edited so the world only includes America”.That captured the essential points: that the “board of peace” is an attempt to supplant and monetise the post-1945 international architecture, replacing the UN with a Mar-a-Lago-style members’ club wherea permanent seat costs $1bnand decision-making power lies in the hands of Trump himself, even after his presidential term expires. That Vladimir Putin has been invited, andMark Carney shut out, tells you all you need to know.For a while, the US’s allies comforted themselves with the belief that Trump was an aberration who would one day be gone, allowing the old ways to resume. That delusion has also been shattered. When Trump still seemed determined to make good on hisGreenlandthreats, there was no sign of anyone or anything inside the US that would stop him. Over these last 12 months, Trump has demonstrated that the formal restraints designed to hold a US president in check are easily swept away. And if it can happen once, it can happen again. Which means it is not just Trump who is an unreliable ally. Sadly, it is the US itself.There are some immediate lessons to learn from all this. The first is that Trump keeps going unless and until he meets resistance. His former adviser Steve Bannon told the Atlantic this week that Team Trump’s strategy in all areas is “maximalist”, to go as far as they can until someone stops them. Trump’s Greenland moves prompted a stock market plunge and domestic disapproval –86% of Americans opposedan armed conquest of the island – but it also brought a united front and serious economic counter-threats from Europe. Europeans stood up and Trump backed down.That points to a more enduring and essential lesson for longtime friends of the US. They cannot be in a position of such dependency on the US – whether economic or military – that they have to give in to its demands. For explaining that simple point so starkly, Carney was rewarded witha standing ovationin Davos followinga speechthat may come to stand as the defining text of this period. “The old order is not coming back,” the Canadian prime minister said. “We shouldn’t mourn it. Nostalgia is not a strategy.”What Carney called for, and what the moment demands, is a new arrangement, a new formation. The “middle powers”, the nations of the democratic west outside the US, do not have passively to accept that the old world of “institutions and rules” has been replaced by a new world of “strongmen and deals”,as the former head of MI6 phrases it. Instead of competing with each other to be the most accommodating of the US hegemon, flattering the Oval Office emperor in the hope of being spared his wrath, they can, says Carney, “combine to create a third path”.What would that look like? The obvious shape is a new constellation of the European Union plus the UK plus Canada, both an economic bloc with heft and a security alliance with muscle. Ultimately, it would aim to provide a positive answer to the question that has loomed this last year especially: could Europe defend Ukraine, and itself, without the US? At present, the cold, hard answer to that question is no. Volodymyr Zelenskyy was not wrong to say that today’s Europe “remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers,” one that “looks lost, trying to convince the US president to change [when] he will not change”.So the goal is nothing less than a new alliance of western democracies no longer dependent on the US for their own defence. It cannot happen overnight; it might take a decade or more to achieve. But, as the former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told me this week, it would be “a major dereliction of duty if we don’t do the work now” to reach that goal.Because it will take time, it means there can be no sudden breaks from the US. As long as allies remain reliant on US protection, the likes of Keir Starmer will have to keep smiling as he shakes Trump’s hand. The Nato vehicle will have to stay on the road, even as its most powerful member keeps slashing the tyres. But all the while, a newly conceived grouping, perhaps presented innocuously as a mere “European arm of Nato”, will be consolidating and gaining strength.The unavoidable key to this plan is vastly increased defence spending. That will remould the politics of all those countries who have enjoyed a peace dividend since the end of the cold war, one that freed them to spend less on guns and more on schools and hospitals. And it will reshape the decades-old debate over Britain’s relationship with Europe. Both parties will surely have to move, as Britain ditches its Brexit delusions and the EU grants Britain something closer to frictionless trade in return for the serious contribution the UK will be making to Europe’s defence.There are opportunities here, including for Starmer. He can present manifesto-breaking tax rises as a matter of national security. He can present closer ties to Europe the same way. He can leave Nigel Farage marooned on the wrong side of public opinion, fanboy to the man who insulted Britain’s war dead. Starmer can cast Reform as the party in thrall to Trump, and Reform’s opponents as the true defenders of Britain’s sovereignty and independence.The world we knew is dying, slain by the would-be emperor on the Potomac. But something else became visible this week: a new world waiting to be born.Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS foreign policyOpinionDonald TrumpGreenlandEuropeNatocommentShareReuse this content"

Major cities such as Los Angeles, Chicago and New York were identified as primary targets. The stated goal was to keep communities “safe and free from illegal alien crime, conflict, and chaos”. Federal agents rapidly became a part of many residents’ everyday lives.No stable state can protect its borders, public order and the legitimate interests of its citizens without immigration law and effective enforcement mechanisms.The question is not whether the state has the right to enforce the law. The question is how themannerof enforcement shapes everyday life, feelings of safety and social trust. Do all forms of enforcement necessarily produce security, or do some of them – unintentionally – turn social fear into a lasting condition?A few days after the statement was released, I received a brief but urgent message from a colleague at Georgetown University Law Center. He warned that ICE agents were expected to be widely present across Washington DC, and that the likelihood of detentions was high. The advice was clear and practical: “Stay home. Don’t go out.”The question is not whether the state has the right to enforce the law. The question is how the manner of enforcement shapes everyday lifeThis warning was neither exaggerated nor emotional. It was a professional, precautionary recommendation of the kind that has become increasingly routine for many people in recent months. This subtle shift – from exceptional emergencies to the everyday management of fear – marks the point at which law enforcement moves beyond the legal domain and becomes a structuring force in daily life.From a sociological perspective, fear is not just a personal feeling – it’s a social reality. When people shape their behavior not based on direct experience but on the constant possibility of intervention, fear becomes part of the everyday. In this situation, arrests don’t need to happen daily; just knowing that somethingmighthappen is enough to change how people act.At this point, immigration enforcement goes beyond geographic borders. A knock on the door is no longer just a knock. Contacting a government office is no longer an ordinary administrative act. For certain groups and in certain spaces, these signals take on new meanings – meanings mixed with caution, silence and anxiety.Migration studies have long described this condition as “living on alert”: existing under the shadow of a possibility that is always there. The result is a series of small but ongoing behavioral changes: going out less, avoiding public offices, reporting problems less often and participating less in civic life. Each change alone may seem minor, but together they slowly wear down the social fabric.For example, imagine a family with a child in school. After hearing reports about immigration officers in the neighborhood, parents may go out less themselves or not allow their child to go outside even for simple errands or trips to the park. Contacting the school to follow up on educational issues may be delayed, and over time, the family’s participation in school and community activities decreases. This simple example shows how fear can shape everyday behavior and social relationships in real ways.Children of the Afghanistan diaspora in the United States are among the first to bear the psychological burden of heightened immigration scrutiny and the pervasive climate of fear, because they are deeply embedded in US schools and communities while remaining legally and emotionally tethered to parents whose immigration status is often uncertain, placing them at the frontline of family anxiety and instability. According to the 2024 American Community Survey, approximately46.6% of people in households from the Afghanistan diaspora in the U S– nearly 100,000 individuals – are children, many of whom were born in the US or arrived at a very young age. For these children, fear does not originate solely from home or family; news about ICE activities and rumors of mass deportations quickly circulates among peers and within school settings. Even without direct encounters with authorities, children absorb anxieties transmitted through classmates’ conversations and school-based chatter, leading to defensive behaviors such as speaking less, withdrawing from classroom participation and attempting to remain invisible. These experiences manifest in sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating and declining academic performance, while also undermining trust in institutions and weakening their sense of social belonging. The normalization of fear in social and educational environments threatens both long-term social integration and the resilience of the next generation.This pattern doesn’t just affect undocumented immigrants. Mixed-status families – where some members are citizens and some are not – show how fear spreads. Even a legally protected citizen adjusts their daily life with caution and self-censorship. Fear travels through social ties, not passports.In recent months, I’ve repeatedly heard friends from Afghanistan in the US describe how their American friends – people with no immigration concerns – have warned them to “be extra careful these days” or “call me immediately if the police stop you”. These are neither political statements nor exaggerations. They show how fear has entered everyday language of care and solidarity. Here, fear is no longer just an individual experience or a legal condition; it becomes a shared social reality that reshapes human relationships.For the Afghanistan diaspora and other Middle Eastern communities, fear has long been part of daily life, especially because of ICE’s presence and activities. Everyday routines, commuting, school participation and even simple social interactions are quietly shaped by the possibility of encounters with immigration authorities.When an Afghan immigrant wasaccused of shootingtwo US national guard members – killing one – the incident did more than make headlines; it intensified collective anxiety and reinforced the everyday caution already driven by immigration enforcement. In the days and weeks following the event, I observed increased silence, hesitation and worry among members of the diaspora. Many feared the allegations against one individual could be unfairly generalized to the entire community. In everyday conversations, there was concern that they might again be labeled a “security threat”.It must be emphasized that this act of violence was unethical and inhumane. The Afghanistan diaspora consists of people who have already endured war, displacement and the loss of home and security. The actions of one person cannot and should not define the moral character of an entire community that has suffered so much.But in this environment, daily life – accents, appearance, travel routes, even ordinary jokes – becomes a matter of calculation. Fear, amplified by the logic of generalization and by the structures of enforcement, turns everyday existence into a constant state of vigilance and anxiety.A common mistake is to see the current situation as simply an “immigration issue.” What is happening is a quiet redefinition of social belonging. Social belonging refers to the sense that individuals are part of a community, living alongside others and entitled to participate in society without fear or discrimination. When certain people or groups are considered “suspicious” or “outside” by default, this sense of belonging gradually erodes.In such an environment, the logic of unfair generalization and labeling can extend to race, social class, accent, appearance and even visible signs of poverty or difference. The question is no longer merely who is at risk of deportation or restriction; it is who is allowed to live an ordinary life with security and a sense of belonging.The issue is not the existence of the law, but how the law is experienced in society. Law enforcement is not just an administrative or security process; it is a social practice that can either build trust or make fear permanent. When fear becomes routine, it not only shapes behavior but also reshapes trust and social cohesion, undermining the very foundations of community life.This piece deliberately avoids policy recommendations – not out of caution, but because until we clearly see and name the problem, any solution will remain shallow. The final question is simple, but not comforting: does a society truly become safer when part of its population learns to live in constant fear and when that fear becomes an unspoken rule of everyday life?Abdul Wahid Gulrani is a political sociologist from Afghanistan, whose work focuses on migration, gender and national security.

This is why I do what I doFri 23 Jan 2026 08.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.39 ESTShareWhen I was a kid, I was drawn to stories that involved a good treasure hunt.Favorite movie:National Treasure, the 2004 Nicolas Cage classic. Favorite book series:The 39 Clues. Favorite puzzle: a word search. Dream book project: a hunt for a treasure hidden across Olympic host cities – and naturally, a companion series involving World Cup stadiums. (There’s still time!)Today, my favorite part of journalism is the same thing: the search. For the story that’s sitting in an unexpected place. The story that’s buried behind the story. The story you can only see whenlooking through a new lens.The projects I’ve most enjoyed working on are those that emerge from small details, the gems waiting inside box scores or game notes – the players with demanding side jobs; the book that’s taken over the locker room; the uniform details that fans obsess over.Indeed, the world of sports is what those treasure hunters would probably term a target-rich environment. But I’d say that soccer is the richest of all of the climes. The stories around soccer – the history, the crowds, the cultures, the songs, the individuality, its worldwide scope – are all so ample and ever-changing. I fell in love with what happened off the field before I understood much of what happened on it. (I know now.)The subtle, intricate details of the game pair nicely with spending hours rifling through pages of transcriptions to pick out the best quotes. The near-nonstop fixture list demands similarly relentless focus, writing outline upon outline. I’d imagine that scoring a goal feels something like when you finally find the right way to sequence paragraphs in a story, making everything click into place. It’s probably no surprise I was drawn to editing.The search for stories remains exciting, and it’s a never ending one: for what’s new, for what’s next, for what’s hiding beneath all of it.Ella joins the Guardian as part of ourongoing expansioncovering soccer in the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

This is why I cover the sportFri 23 Jan 2026 08.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.39 ESTShareAs the shootout loomed to close the 1999 Women’s World Cup, millions of US women’s national team fans fought their nerves. But at our family’s watch party in central Minnesota, nobody doubted the USWNT’s chances.My relatives – all soccer fans – were fixated upon the action as each second passed, as is the nature of a soccer family like mine. As extra time progressed, they reassured me, aged five, that our team was in control. I wasn’t exactly locked in to the match – it was summer in Minnesota, and my brother and sister had our own ball to kick around – but I clearly remember my family’s confidence in that moment.It didn’t stem from a bullish belief in the penalty placement of stars like Mia Hamm and Brandi Chastain. The reason was on (or at least somewhat near) the goalline.A decade before Briana Scurry started in goal at the Rose Bowl, she was a decorated high school athlete thwarting would-be goal scorers across the state of Minnesota. Among her adversaries was a team backstopped by my aunt and coached by my grandpa. Those matchups left a lasting impression – to them, Scurry was synonymous with inevitability. There was no goalkeeper they’d rather have in that situation than their former foe.That match has long since been iconified through a pair of photos. Yes, there’s the shot of Chastain’s victory cry with her right hand clutching her jersey. There’s also the freeze-frame showing Scurry making the decisive save off of China’s Liu Ying. The sport’s biggest stage saw my aunt’s on-field adversary become a national hero, and my lifelong obsession with the sport was born.When we think about the moments that hooked us on this sport, they aren’t cold collections of proper nouns and statistics. They’re stories, with protagonists and challenges and emotion and perhaps a bit of creative license. Soccer is among humanity’s great creations, a rare activity that’s open to people of all backgrounds. If you’re reading this, I’m sure you have your own origin story at the ready.I fell for this sport because of its storytelling potential as much as the action itself. It’s why I’m grateful to do what I do for a living, now at an outlet that rewards a reader’s curiosity like nobody else in the landscape.Jeff joins the Guardian as part of ourongoing expansioncovering soccer in the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

This is why I cover the sportFri 23 Jan 2026 08.11 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.39 ESTShareThere’s an old pennant hanging on the wall of my office here in Washington DC, tucked between a poster of indoor soccer legend Steve Zungul and a photo of Pelé riding a horse. “Soccer,” it reads, “the sport of the 80s.”For a century or so, soccer was always the sport of the next decade. Clear-thinking businesspeople tried everything to sell it to Americans, but soccer was always considered too foreign and exotic, an activity best practiced and consumed by outsiders. Even in the mid-80s, when I started playing, it was still very muchothered.It’s what drew me to the sport in the first place.Later, as an angsty teenager living in Spain, watching Johan Cruyff’s Barcelona sides rewired my brain in the same way Nirvana’s Nevermind did. When I came home to Tennessee a year later, in 1993, there was no top flight to speak of in the United States. I spent my time watching the Nashville Metros of the old A-League with about 75 other weirdos. It was a carnival of misfits, and I was in heaven.Yet I still wanted the sport to break through, and there was hope on the horizon, in the form of the 1994 World Cup. That tournament finally thrust soccer fully into the American public consciousness, and the game has continued to grow since then. Americans wake up in the wee hours to watch games from abroad and are finally warming up to their own version of the sport, as well.When I started writing about soccer in the early 2010s, I loved doing stories that were floating around in the ether, more closely related to the culture, history and sociology of the sport than the matches themselves. I couldn’t help but think that, If I’d been writing about baseball or American football, most of those stories would have already been written.Yet I’ve found over the years that there are seemingly unlimited stories to be told about American soccer, past and present alike. The game here and abroad touches so many parts of American society – politics, business, culture and so on. These are things that demand serious coverage … and less-serious coverage as well.After all, we’re only a half-century removed from that moment that Pelé took the field on horseback.Pablo joins the Guardian as part of ourongoing expansioncovering soccer in the United States ahead of the 2026 World Cup.

Within hours of her death, Trump smeared Good on Truth Social, saying that the 37-year-old mother of three belonged to “aRadical Left Movementof Violence and Hate” and that she “viciously ran overthe ICE officer”. Trump added, “It is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital.”What Trump said was light years from what we saw. Videos show that Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who killed Good, not onlywasn’t knocked overby her SUV, but walked away after he shot her three times.With that false version of events, Trump sought to send a message to officials throughout his administration that they should badmouth Good and defend Ross to the hilt. Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary, rushed to malign Goodas a rioter and domestic terrorist, while Vice-President JD Vance denounced her as a“deranged leftist”.What ICE is doing on US streets looks terrifying, but don’t forget: it could happen anywhere | Nesrine MalikRead moreTrump’s outrageous assaults on the truth bring to mind a memorable line from comedian Richard Pryor:“Ya gonna believe me or your lyin’ eyes?”In his standup act, that was Pryor’s response to his mad-as-hell wife after she discovered him in bed with another woman. Like other brazen demagogues, Trump seems to believe he has a magical power to persuade us not to believe what our eyes are telling us.Take inflation. In recent months, Trump, whovowed to reduce prices on day one, has said there was“no inflation”, that all grocery prices were“falling rapidly”and that“every price is down”. But anyone can see that there’s still inflation. It’srunning at 2.7%,only slightly below what it was when Biden left office, a rate that Trump derided as way too high.Anyone who goes shopping can see that many grocery prices have risen. According to the government’slatest inflation report, many food prices have gone down, but, overall, food prices rose by 3.1% over the past year. Coffee prices jumped 19.8%, beef and veal 16.4%, sugar 6.9%, and fish and seafood 4.4%. Not only that, food prices jumped sharply in December by 0.7%, the largest monthly increase in over three years.It’s not only grocery prices that have climbed. Hardware rose 5.4%, furniture and bedding 3.6%, and electricity 6.7%, even though candidate Trump promised Americans that he wouldchop electricity prices in halfwithin 12 months.Or take gasoline prices. In last month’s primetime speech from the White House, Trump said gasoline prices had fallento $1.99 “in much of the country”. But that’s not what tens of millions of Americans are seeing. More than 70 million Americans live in states where the average price is over $3 a gallon and theaverage price nationwide is more than $2.80per gallon.When Trump gets criticized for doing little to reduce healthcare prices, he often boasts about persuadingseveral pharmaceutical companies to reduce priceson some of their prescription drugs. But then Trump leaps into fantasy land, variously saying he has cut prescription drug prices by500% or 600%or by1,300% or 1,400%,even by2,000% or 3,000%. Those numbers sound impressive, but anyone with eyes and sixth-grade math skills will realize that Trump is seeking to wow them with absurdities. If the price of a $150 prescription drug is cut by 100%, that means its price will be zero. But Trump’s talk of cuts of 500% or 2,000% makes one wonder how this self-described “stable genius” ever got a degree from Wharton business school.It’s easy to come up with a long list of Trump’s outlandish falsehoods, with him essentially saying, as the Marx Brothers also did in their 1933 film, Duck Soup, “Who ya gonna believe, me or your own eyes?”Trump has preposterously asserted thatUkraine started its warwith Russia. In his eagerness to deploy troops, he claimed that Portland, Oregon, was “burning to the ground”. (Portland is still here.) Trump once insisted that BarackObama had founded the terrorist organization Islamic State. Trump’s White House blames the Capitolpolice for instigating the violenceon January 6.Explanations abound for why Trump tells such fantastical falsehoods. Sometimes he doesn’t have a grip on the facts. Over the years, he’s gotten accustomed to spouting anything he likes because he lives in a bubble in which his underlings don’t dare challenge his untruths. Trump knows that his lies and falsehoods infuriate his foes, and his Maga base loves to see him “owning the libs” that way.A better explanation, I believe, is that Trump is convinced that lying, that providing alternate facts, has worked marvelously for him as a political strategy. (Plus, he knows that many in the rightwing media will happily parrot his lies.) Trump is no doubt convinced his lie thatHaitian immigrants in Ohio eat people’s petshelped get him elected. He has also pushed the colossal lie that he, not Joe Biden, won the 2020 election, and millions of Trump’s Maga followers have bought that lie. (But polls showthatAmericans haven’t swallowedTrump’s lies that there’s “no inflation” and that “every price is down”.)Trump often seems to be following the “big lie” strategy the Nazis used during the 1930s. Keep telling and retelling big lies in the hope that people will eventually believe them.In her 1951 book, The Origins of Totalitarianism, the political theorist Hannah Arendt captured what political strategies like Trump’s – of maintaining a constant firehose of falsehoods – are all about. Arendt wrote:“The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced Communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (and the distinction between true and false) no longer exists.”The danger is acute in an upside-down world where people can’t distinguish between truth and lies, between fact and fiction. That greatly increases the chances that a self-promoting demagogue who spouts hundreds of lies will win election over a truth-teller who is sincere about serving the nation.Right now, it’s obvious that there is another big danger when prominent politicians flood the world with falsehoods. Seeing how Trump and his administration have vigorously backed Ross, often with lies and deceptions, other ICE agents will grow convinced and confident that they can act with impunity, that even if they kill someone without justification, theTrump administrationwill rush to defend them 1,000%, if need be, with lies, and they won’t face any accountability.Steven Greenhouse is a journalist and author, focusing on labour and the workplace, as well as economic and legal issuesExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)Trump administrationUS economyMinnesota ICE shootingUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Now we’re living his sinister dramaAdam PriceThe only positive of this stranger-than-fiction scenario is that Greenland and Denmark stand more united than everAdam Price is the creator of the TV series BorgenFri 23 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 11.35 ESTShareAs a writer of political fiction for many years, including four seasons of my TV series Borgen, I find myself in the strangest of landscapes watchingDonald Trumpdesperately wanting Greenland like a spoilt child who has never heard the word “no”.We dedicated an episode to Greenland in the first season in 2010 and then it became the main setting for thefourth seasonin 2022. Our focus on this former colony of Denmark, and its amazing Indigenous people, was motivated by one big factor. For political drama I always look for stories with emotion, and the old colonial tale of Denmark and Greenland is full of it.The modern history of that complex relationship began in 1721, when the priest Hans Egede, with permission from the Danish King Frederik IV, founded a mission and trading station in southernGreenland. The indigenous Inuit people were welcomed into the realm of Christ either voluntarily or by force. Egede remains a controversial figure in Greenland even still, and with good reason. A huge statue of him that sits on a hill just outside the island’s capital, Nuuk, was vandalised in 2020 with the slogan “Decolonize”.Greenland was formally made an equal part of the Kingdom of Denmark in our constitution of 1953. But more than a decade earlier, during the second world war, Greenland had become a strategic hotspot for the United States, which needed a place to refuel its heavy bombers en route to Europe. Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany and the daring Danish ambassador to the US, Henrik Kauffmann, acting on his own,signed an agreementon behalf of the Danish king giving the Americans military access to Greenland. In 1951, during the cold war, the American need for even bigger bases was secured in a treaty that is still in existence. Basically, it means the Americans can build as many bases in Greenland as they want.View image in fullscreenA funeral scene in Ilulissat, Greenland, from the final series of Borgen in 2022.Photograph: Mike Kollöffel/NetflixIn 1953 the Americans decided to build their biggest base yet, Thule airbase (later renamed Pituffik space base) in a harsh northern area of Greenland that was home to the old Inuit settlement of Uummannaq. Again, the Inuit people were given an ultimatum: move immediately or we will move you by force.In the 1950s and 60s Thule airbase had more than 10,000 personnel and B-52 bombers were landing and taking off constantly. This posed a new challenge for the American-Danish-Greenlandic relationship.Denmarkwould not allow nuclear weapons on Danish soil but pragmatically decided that, if we refrained from asking the Americans whether the B-52s were carrying nuclear bombs they wouldn’t have to disappoint us with the truth.This wilful ignorance ended in 1968 when a B-52crashed near Thule airbaseand four nuclear bombs rolled out on the ice. This became yet another scandal in the difficult relationship between the superpower that is the US, its loyal ally the kingdom of Denmark, and Greenland, the world’s biggest island with a tiny population – currently about 57, 000 people.Greenlandgained home rule in 1979and finally in 2009 theAct on Greenland Self-Governmentwas passed by the Danish parliament, acknowledging that Greenland ultimately belongs to the Greenlandic people and that they should decide their own fate as an autonomous part of the kingdom.This law was the primary source of inspiration for Power & Glory, the final season of Borgen, as the legislation deals with dividing the income from Greenland’s natural resources between the Danish and Greenlandic peoples. In my story, a huge oil find close to the pristine ice-fjord of Ilulissat on the west coast of Greenland (one of the most popular tourist sites on the island) ends up as a geopolitical nightmare for Borgen’s main character, Birgitte Nyborg, Denmark’s fictional foreign minister. The oil company behind the discovery is first believed to be Canadian but turns out to be Russian; later on we learn it is actually Chinese. Of course, we know that such an oil find would be considered critical infrastructure by the US, which would be highly critical of it falling into Chinese ownership. This puts Denmark in the difficult position of a little brother who must follow orders, and in the process demand that Greenland does what it is told – thus reopening the old colonial wounds yet again.We really tried to create a dramatic plot that would seem credible yet take the Arctic tension further than had been done before. And we find ourselves completely overtaken by the theatre of the absurd played out by the Trump administration.Had I ever suggested a storyline involving an American president who becomes obsessed by the thought of owning Greenland, to the extent that he is willing to sacrifice Nato and use mob methods to bully allies into compliance, I would have been laughed out of any pitching session.Now we are living this nightmare. Listening toTrump’s rant in Davosdid not make us feel much safer.It is bizarre how accustomed we have become to a US president who openly lies, distorts facts and is utterly ignorant about history. (Leaving aside that heconfused Iceland with Greenlandin his speech.) Trump claimed that Europeans alone benefit from Nato and said he doubted anyone would come to the aid of the US. Yet the only country that has ever called for help invoking Nato’sArticle 5is the US after 9/11. Europe immediately responded. Denmark, along with the UK and other Nato allies, sent troops to Afghanistan. Denmark lost more soldiers per head than any other country in the coalition apart from the US. How utterly insulting for the families, still mourning their dead, to hear the ingratitude of a US president so ignorant of their loss.View image in fullscreenGreenlandic leaders negotiate with the Danish government in the final season of BorgenPhotograph: Mike Kollöffel/Netflix / Mike KollöffelIn Greenland, people are genuinely afraid of the madness coming out of the White House. So are the Danes. But if anything good has come out of this, it is that Danish and the Greenlandic people stand more united than ever. Danes fully support Greenlanders’ right to Greenland and to decide their own destiny.In Davos, Trump ruled out military action in Greenland, sure, andcalled offhis outrageous tariff threats as part of somevague “deal”, with Mark Rutte, the secretary general of Nato, reportedly involving a renegotiation of the 1951 treaty between the US and Denmark. The devil’s advocate might ask: how can “Daddy” Trump and the ever pleasing Rutte even negotiate theframeworkof a “deal” involving the US military presence in Greenlandwithout the participation of Greenland and Denmark? It almost reminds me of Trump meeting Putin todiscuss peace in Ukrainewithout inviting Zelenskyy.But maybe these theatrics arejust part of the new Trumpian “art of the deal”, where a more sinister scheme is really at play. Could Europe’s defence of Ukraine become the hostage in a mad game of power Monopoly, where the unity of Nato is at stake and ownership of Greenland is the ultimate reward? I certainly hope not. But this could be my dystopian pitch for how the nightmarish story develops. Please let me be laughed out of the pitching session one more time.Adam Price is a Danish screenwriter, executive producer and the creator of the TV series BorgenExplore more on these topicsGreenlandOpinionDonald TrumpDenmarkTelevisionEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

The lesson for Europe: strongmen understand only strengthNathalie TocciWith conflict averted for now, European leaders will be tempted to retreat to their comfort zone of cowardice. But the next crisis will soon be hereFri 23 Jan 2026 06.06 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 11.30 ESTShareDonald Trump’s climbdown, after days of escalation during which he had refused to rule out amilitary attack to annex Greenland, was spectacular. In his Davos speech, Trump repeated his desire to own Greenland, claiming that you cannot defend what you do not own, only to then announce that he would not conquer the Arctic island by force. Hours later, he claimed that he had reached an unspecified deal on Greenland, and would therefore refrain from imposing additional tariffs on those European countries that had had the audacity to participate in a joint military exercise in Greenland at Denmark’s invitation.We know neither the details of the framework agreement reached by Trump and the Nato secretary general, Mark Rutte, nor whether it carries any weight, given the US president’s fickleness. But it appears that the deal,while open to discussing Arctic security, mineral rights and possibly even the sovereignty of US bases,preserves Greenland’s sovereigntywithin the Kingdom of Denmark. In short, this has been a remarkable U-turn.There are several possible explanations for this reversal. Discomfort among Republicans and the American public at the prospect of attacking a Nato ally,turbulence in global marketsand Rutte’s sycophancy are all possibilities. Domestic pressures in the US may have played a role, but they were not yet strong enough to fully explain the sudden about-face.Rutte’s servility is certainly appreciated by Trump, but it is unlikely to have dissuaded him from his ambition to leave a mark as the first president to have expanded US territory since the late 1950s. The markets’ decline offers a more plausible explanation. This is not the first time: Trump’s abrupt retreat on trade after hisbombastic “liberation day” last springcoincided with a market freefall and China’s refusal to back down, ready to retaliate tit for tat in the trade war.Yet the markets do not care whether Greenland belongs to Denmark or the US, nor do they lose sleep over violations of international law. WhenTrump attacked Venezuelawithout even seeking a UN security council resolution, the market response was muted. Nor were markets rattled when, shortly after, the US threatened another war on Iran.The markets reacted negatively this time, as they did in spring 2025, becauseEuropesignalled it would not be a pushover once again.Everyone knows that Europe does not hold the same cards as China in its dealings with the US, and that the US can hurt Europe more than the other way around. But Europe does have some leverage. Even the hint of using it, therefore reopening the prospect of a trade war, sent shivers through markets, pushing Trump to step back from the brink.The lesson for Europeans is clear. For a year, they tried to mollify, seduce and appease Trump. They offered himgilt-framed birth certificates, broke protocol to sendroyal invitations,played golf with himand sent sycophantic text messages. They accepted a terrible trade deal andagreed to raise defence spending to 5%of GDP, knowing many countries would never meet that target. They did so to buy time, hoping to induce Trump to side with them on Ukraine and remain committed to European security.But Trump has humiliated Ukrainians and mocked Europeans, stubbornly refusing to exert any pressure on Vladimir Putin. Yes, the US still sells weapons to Europeans, who then channel them to Ukraine. More recently, it has opened the door to providing security guarantees to Kyiv in a postwar scenario. But US military support for Ukraine has dwindled, and any security guarantees are hypothetical, given that a ceasefire is not in sight.Moreover, what is the value of any agreement signed with Trump if he can tear it up at any moment, as he has already demonstrated with trade? Europeanstacitly condonedTrump’s illegal war on Iran and were ambiguous about his equally illegal attack on Venezuela. In return, they received the threat of Greenland’s annexation. The US president could not have been more candid in Davos when he stated thatno one defends what they don’t own. If anyone still had any doubt about his commitment to Nato, there wentarticle 5 on collective defence,thrown out the window.Europe’s year of genuflection has been a spectacular failure. But something is changing. Europeans have stood firm onGreenland. European leaders, individually and collectively, spoke out in solidarity with Denmark and in support of its sovereignty. A group of European countries sent troops to Greenland for a joint military exercise. Most EU countries, with the exception of Hungary and Bulgaria, have shunned Trump’s “board of peace”.The European parliament suspended ratification of the EU-US trade deal on tariffs, and EU institutions began debating possible retaliatory measures should the US proceed with economic coercion. These include counter-tariffs worth just under €100bn, and the use of the EU’s most powerful trade weapon, the anti-coercion instrument, to limit access to the European single market or impose other measures aimed at curbing the ability of US firms to invest in Europe.All this remains hypothetical, given the US climbdown. We cannot know for certain whether the EU has the stamina to follow through if US economic coercion were actually ramped up. And it is highly likely that, if the EU did retaliate, it would do so incrementally, seeking consensus and always offering an off-ramp. In other words, the EU would continue to act in a quintessentially European way.But the lesson Europeans should draw from this latest episode of the Trump show is that the firmness they have tentatively displayed works far better than the subordination they attempted over the past year. The temperature has been lowered, so the risk is that European leaders will revert to their comfort zone of cowardice and inaction. But the calm will not last long, and when the next transatlantic crisis erupts, they should remember that Trump, like any strongman, understands strength and strength alone.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsEuropean UnionOpinionGreenlandDonald TrumpEuropeTariffsUS foreign policycommentShareReuse this content"

Undoubtedly, we saw this in the heroes, both in and out of uniform, who ran into harm’s way to protect us from terror. We saw it too in the outpouring ofgrief and solidarityin the wake of the horrific event.No reasonable person wishes for such a dark time to fall on our community again, but should it do so, we have the persistent hope that in such times we will have the light of the individual and collective Australian response to guide us.This greatness deserves to be matched by our political leadership. Australia deserves a government and principled opposition that reflects their courage, capacity and imagination at such difficult times. Instead, our political leadership has fallen short of this at a state and federal level. The Albanese government has undermined our democracy, community cohesion and trust by enacting laws that erode key democratic principles instead of defending our values and way of life in the face of terror.Children cook meals for needy and mourners lay wreaths for Bondi attack victims on national day of mourningRead moreWhen first proposed, it was clear thatthe federal government’s hate speech laws– which were intended to deal with hate in our community – represented a very significant risk to freedoms of political communication, speech, association and religion. We cannot have peace in our community without all of these.The conduct of the inquiry that followed the introduction of the laws, a mere three days for consultation, was an exercise in bad faith that prevented civil society from providing legitimate criticisms of our government’s proposals. This breach of trust was not corrected because the government reneged on some of the controversial components of the laws touching on speech and religion. Especially, when without any substantive consultation, it proposed more regressive laws with respect to political communication and association, and in agreement with theCoalition.At a time when we look in horror at the abuse of executive power and federal law enforcement by the Trump administration in the US, the Albanese government has expanded the executive power of the home affairs minister, Asio and the Australian federal police to decide which groups are considered hate groups under the legislation.What is worse, so vague and ill-conceived are these laws that Australia’s leading lawyer – the attorney general, Michelle Rowland – could not readily explain what conduct the laws captured when pressed to do so, including whether protestersexpressing criticismof actions of the Israeli government would potentially fall foul of the laws.We cannot have criminal laws on our books that the community does not understand. This sort of ambiguous expansion of executive power without reasonable checks and balances only undermines the rule of law. No one wants more hate in our community, but without the rule of law and responsible government the divisions that drive hate in our community will only grow.Timothy Roberts is the president of the NSW Council for Civil LibertiesExplore more on these topicsAustralian politicsOpinionBondi beach terror attackLabor partyCoalitioncommentShareReuse this content"

And once at the beach, whether or not to go into the water.But now I think that saying is no longer true. You can regret a swim -deeply,if you are attacked by a shark.Thefour shark attacks in 48 hoursin New South Wales this week have put a state full of water lovers on edge.Tonot go inon these beautiful January days, with the water sparkling and inviting and the air warm, feels deeply counterintuitive.Bondi beach’s golden light can never be extinguished. It has always returned from its darkest days | Brigid DelaneyRead moreInstead all sorts of bargains and contortions are made on the shore. Would it be alright if I just went in to my knees? Or what about swimming in the middle of the day? How about if the water is clear and it didn’t rain overnight? What if there are other people in the water? What if the area is netted?It feels as though we’re all teetering on the edge of the shore this week.As well as theattacks dominating the news, there are the stories of near misses, the Reddit threads about shark hunters along the NSW coast, footage of a 200kg bull sharkhanging over the side of a dingy at Camp Cove(it appears to have four rows of teeth!), a viral video ofschool rowers on the Parramatta Rivermetres away from an apparent bull shark breaching, and reports of a shark at Sydney’s Coogee beach, which cleared the water.Statistically the chances of getting killed by a shark areless than being killed by a kangaroo. But they fall to zero if you don’t get in the water.To go into the water this week inSydneyfeels like Russian roulette.This has been a year (and it’s only January) where the natural world is striking back.Our summer has so far been characterised by harsh and sudden natural events – aflash flood in Lorneand Wye River that submerged and swept away cars and caravans. Andbushfires, also in Victoria, that “were unlike anything seen before in speed, scale and destruction”.Likewise, the four shark attacks in a matter of days is another sudden shock to humans, whose relationship with nature has long been out of balance.Yet shark attacks in Australia are still rare events, averaging around 20 incidents with injuries annually, far fewer than drownings or road fatalities, but data shows a rising trend in recent years.View image in fullscreenA warning sign at Shark beach, in Sydney’s Nielsen Park, on 19 January after a 12-year-old boy was bitten by a bull shark nearby.Photograph: Sitthixay Ditthavong/EPAThe Taronga Conservation Society Australia told the ABC the average number of shark bite incidents recorded annually over a decade hasincreased every 10 yearssince the 1950s.In the 2020s, an average of 27 bites were recorded each year, and at least three incidents on average were fatal, the data showed.In 2025, there were fewer shark injuries but aslightly higher number of fatalitiescompared with the decade average.We suffer more in imagination than reality, said the ancient Stoic philosopher Seneca. But if you are a beachgoer in Sydney this week, even these relatively reassuring stats, and being rational about the risk of a swim, can’t completely quell the fear, particularly if it feels close by.I live on Sydney Harbour, where one of my goals is to properly learn to standup paddleboard without falling in with an enormous splash. But I haven’t dared risk it since my neighbour was mauled by a shark out the front of our building.Four shark attacks in 48 hours leave Australian surfer Matt more afraid of local beaches than world’s biggest wavesRead moreAnd a decade before that, on a beautiful, sparkling day in Byron Bay, I walked to the water’s edge to swim, wondering why no one else was in the ocean, only to look down the shore and see a tent set up with emergency services attending to a man who wasattacked by a sharkand later died.Perhaps part of our cultural fear of sharks is that attacks happen in the context of relief and pleasure. Relief from the heat, from ordinary life on land, and the pleasure of catching a wave, of being submerged in cool, refreshing water.The water is such a huge part of living in Sydney, and why many of us come here from other parts of the country or the world.Take the water away and you have some interesting birds, good food and national parks – but not much that would distinguish it from a city anywhere else.The water defines life here – from how we spend our leisure time, to our hobbies, to the organising principle of our social and economic systems.View image in fullscreenBeachgoers walk past warning signs at Queenscliff beach in Sydney on Tuesday after a spate of shark attacks.Photograph: Jeremy Piper/ReutersThe “good life” in Sydney for many is being able to access the water whenever you want. And it is access to water that has been the flashpoint for social issues –such as the Cronulla riots.Memories of this sharky summer will fade, and confidence will return – until the next spate of attacks. But perhaps the answer to saving lives and limbs, while also quelling the fear of getting in the water, is to have more information available about whether it’s safe to swim.While I knew to avoid swimming at dawn and dusk in the harbour, until this week, I did not know that brackish water, splashes and storms attracted sharks closer in.Just like we can check a weather app and know if the UV is going to be high that day, or if there’s going to be a total fire ban, perhaps we should also have some sort of public warning when it’s likely to be sharky.Brigid Delaney is the author of the philosophical novelThe Seeker and the Sage(Allen and Unwin)Explore more on these topicsSharksOpinionSydneyOceansNew South WalesMarine lifeWildlifecommentShareReuse this content"

We somehow have to make this more fun than immersing ourselves in the remorselessly petty mathematical dynamics of Labour’s national executive committee (NEC).So here goes: movie-wise, before Pirates of the Caribbean, Johnny Depp used to embody a desirable scarcity model. As a cultural asset he was high-prestige, low-supply, and every rudderless director thought that if only the mysterious Johnny was at the helm of their project, then everything would be rosy. He was different, he was cool, he was hyper-selective, he withheld himself, he didn’t dress like the others, he wasn’t your multiplex guy. And he was, crucially,not available. But Pirates of the Caribbean changed all that and it changed Johnny Depp. After the unexpected mega-success of that film, the actor made himself available, and his aura evaporated. He made the conscious leap to middle-of-the-road A-listery and his cultural premium collapsed. Johnny Depp and his basic eyeliner were in everything, from franchises to mass-market fantasies to a couple of grim court cases with his ex-wife (obviously, Andy hasn’t been involved in even the metaphorical version of the last one, though Burnham v Starmer could be quite the rubbernecking spectacle). And honestly, most of it was highly indifferent. There was suddenly a lot less to him than had met the eye. Availability torched his cachet.It’s an old cycle. Scarcity gives you an aura, which gives you cultural leverage, but once the leverage has been deployed, you are no longer scarce and you lose the aura. These days, Johnny Depp has been cast out of the multiplex. Riyadh might be the only place he can open a movie, given he’s been reduced to alucrative bromancewith Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman. As Vanity Fair hilariously had it: “Both men knew how it felt to suddenly go from golden boy to outcast.”Sticking with this metaphor, mainly to avoid talking about Labour’s endlessly excruciating internal politics for another paragraph, if Andy Burnham does contrive a return to Westminster to challenge Keir Starmer, he’ll flop harder than Depp’s outing inThe Lone Ranger. And that thing really bombed. The whole point of Andy Burnham, the memoji-headed king over the water, is that he’s over the water. Labour members want him but they can’t have him. He’s like an illicit desire, a thing they yearn for because they can’t possess it, that’s going to instantly seem less appealing the second they land him. Then, once again, the eyes will wander.But will they land him? That’s the other part of the drama currently gripping Labour, because there’s nothing else to think about in this quiet and settled world. By way of a recap, the Gorton and Denton MPAndrew Gwynne is stepping down. You know when someone literally puts bits of doctor’s notes in his resignation letter that there’s going to be some other stuff you’ve forgotten about the story, so I thank Andrew for the inadvertent reminder that he was actually sacked as a minister and suspended after having been found to have sent various dodgy WhatsApp messages about constituents and other voters. Anyway, medically, he can’t carry on … which might open up a seat for Burnham, who might ride south from Manchester to Westminster on a criminally overpriced train ticket, and challenge Keir Starmer for Labour’s leadership. It is ON!But is it actually? It all depends on Labour’s ruling body, the NEC. Over the years, many of you might have felt simply unable to face trying to understand how this impenetrable politburo works. So to summarise: the NEC is a thing that anyLabourleader who wants to do anything has to have “sewn up”, even though that leader will then be stopped from doing the things they want to do by the parliamentary Labour party, currently a 148-seat majority brute force of myopic self-interest, even though most of them are going to lose their seats in the next election so might actually deign to think about big-picture national interest and growth rather than themselves for two fricking minutes.I hope that covers any gaps. The NEC is the entity that must give Burnham permission to resign as mayor of Greater Manchester and subsequently to stand as an MP, and current indications are thatKeir Starmerhas it sufficiently sewn up that it’ll block this one way or another. Even if it doesn’t, alternative branches of future history are available. For instance: Burnham resigns as mayor of Greater Manchester, fights seat, loses to Reform. Or fights seat, while the mayoralty is expensively lost to Reform. Or even, fights seat but gets Boaty McBoatfaced by the Greens. Meanwhile, in most of the scenarios, the bond markets – which you’ll remember Andy is not keen on us being “in hock to” – have a little wobble every time his name is mentioned. In the circuitously reached event he wins the top job, they have a mega-wobble.Perennially frustrated by his name being linked with a leadership tilt, Burnham spent the hours after Gwynne’s resignation defusing this latest blow-up … no, hang on. Yesterday he could be found in the Guardian, convenientlyexpanding on his political philosophy. It’s no longer just a little bit of nationalisation and a little bit of wealth taxes. It’s also something called “Manchesterism” – which, spoiler alert, is also not going to even touch the sides of the UK’s deep problems.As for how this plays out … For now, Burnham is able to bask in the happy worldview of every metro mayor: that everything good that happens is because of them, and everything bad that happens is because of Westminster. Is this the moment for our self-styled indie star to go mainstream? Never underestimate the Labour party’s ability to make a spectacular flop, of course – but I can’t help feeling that Andy would be better off watching this movie rather than starring in it.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And honestly, thank God for Rachel – the terrifyingly ruthless saviour of this seriesStuart HeritageFri 23 Jan 2026 17.33 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 19.03 ESTShareBit of a damp squib, this year’s Traitors. At its best, it was still able to skim the preposterously giddy heights of previous series, but I spent a lot of the run living with the growing realisation that the cracks in the format are starting to show.One major culprit, as always, has been the mid-episode challenge; a slab of filler designed to kill any trace of intrigue, like a version of 12 Angry Men where the jurors get up halfway through to spend 20 minutes swanning around in a park. Nor did the new raft of tweaks amount to much, with the reveal of the Secret Traitor coming far too early, and the secret connections (Judy and Roxy, Ellie and Ross) fizzling out without resolution.However, the biggest accusation to level atThe Traitorsis that it is a show designed to reward the dull. There have been some spectacular participants this year – James was baffling, Harriet was explosive, Fiona somehow managed to be both at once – but they all got banished the instant they demonstrated any tangible signs of personality. Instead, the final five contestants were two traitors and a handful of people who couldn’t have said more than 500 words between them all series. It didn’t look great.After James was banished by chance in a cliffhanger from the previous episode, we were left with Jade (whose default characteristic was defensive), Faraaz (who was mute, then tantalisingly perceptive, then mute again), Jack (who suddenly made himself known three episodes ago, like a Star Trek redshirt) and the two remaining traitors.They were Stephen, who was passive and fond of big collars, and Rachel. And, honestly, thank God for Rachel. She was, of course, the figure who managed to bend the show’s entire gravity field around her. This was the woman responsible for turning The Traitors into – if you’ll allow me to quote Logan Roy – a fight for a knife in the mud.For better or worse, Rachel’s machinations meant that this year’s entire series was cast in her image. It, and she, was ruthless to a terrifying extent. Even in the final her plotting remained in overdrive, as she worked overtime to convince anyone who would listen that Jade was a bad egg.View image in fullscreenThe final five: Faraaz, Rachel, Stephen, Jade and Jack on The Traitors.Photograph: BBC/Studio Lambert/Paul ChappellsAnd while this is a terrible trait for a human being, it’s a great one for a reality TV contestant. Rachel’s innate untrustworthiness meant that we were kept on the hook right to the very end. All along she had promised Stephen that they would operate as a team, but who in their right mind would believe anything she said?Luckily, for her at least, she was murderously effective at dispatching the competition. Poor Jade – unfairly vilified since episode one – was banished and fled the room in tears. Poor Faraaz followed, only realising what had happened in the post-banishment interview. And then the traitors ganged up on Jack, at which point it was game over.The traitors had won, and Rachel and Stephen split the £95,750 loot. Tellingly, the other finalists didn’t join them at the end. This was possibly because they felt too betrayed by the people they thought were their friends. The moral of the story? It’s easy to cheat your way to the top. What a very 2026 lesson to learn.View image in fullscreenThe moral of the story? It’s easy to cheat your way to the top. Claudia with Stephen and Rachel.Photograph: Paul Chappells/Studio Lambert/BBC/PAFor all the show’s flaws, the endgame is still quite effectively stressful. Objectively none of the finalists deserved the money – they were either too useless or too duplicitous – but the final 15 minutes made for a properly sweaty watch. I once watched a man put his head inside a crocodile’s mouth, and watching Stephen fret over how much trust he could put in Rachel in those final seconds was a roughly equivalent spectacle.Hopefully we’ll see some of the other contestants again. James seemed to treat the show as an audition for a bizarre unmade CBeebies show about a vomiting gardener, so hopefully he’ll get his shot. I’ll be interested to see what Jade is like when she isn’t being crushed by ennui. And Stephen, I’m sure, will soon be available to hire for parties as a sort of walking reaction gif.More than anything, though, this year’s Traitors made me nostalgic for the more innocent celebrity version, where everyone was too worried about their reputations to become as debilitatingly bloodthirsty as this lot. An uneven series saved (but only just) by an excellent finale.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

The UK had been facing its first nomination-less year inthe acting categories since 1986.But the Sinners star was joined by a fellow cast member, Lewisham-born,Delroy Lindo, who will also be representing Britain on the big night on 15 March.The actor, who was born in south London in 1952, wasa surprise pickin the best supporting actor category, edging out supposed sure thing Paul Mescal and helping to take Sinners toa record 16-nod haul.View image in fullscreenSouth London star … Delroy Lindo at the annual Movies for Grownups awards in Beverly Hills this month.Photograph: Maarten De Boer/Getty Images for AARPLindo was reportedly as taken aback as the rest of the industry. In bed in Los Angeles on Thursday morning, he was rung by his son and told the news. “Really? Are you for real?” he asked, before looking at his phone and finding 179 messages confirming it.In Ryan Coogler’s box office hit, Lindo plays Delta Slim, a blues man who ends up barricaded in a Mississippi juke joint fighting back vampires while dealing with the looming spectre of Jim Crow racism. For many, it represented the perfect role for an African American cultural grandee, but the reality is more nuanced: Lindo is a child ofthe Black Atlantic.Unlike Mosaku who can stillquote a Greggs menu and has a strong Mancunian twang, Lindo has no hint of a London accent after leaving the capital for the US as a teenager.His first film role was as an army sergeant in the follow up to American Graffiti, 1979’s unimaginatively named and critically panned,More American Graffiti, shot while he was still in acting school.But it was his first ever acting role as one of the three kings in a primary school nativity play in south London that gave him the acting bug. A teacher praised Lindo, who was the only black child in his school, telling others in the cast “to do it like Delroy does it”.That is one of the few positive memories Lindo has of a country that, when he left, was getting to grips with rising support for far-right groups including the National Front and overtly racist political posturing from Enoch Powell, whose 1968 Rivers of Blood speech wasdirected at families like the Lindos.He recalled when he heard about the murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993, “it did not surprise me,” he said. “Given incidents that happened to me there.”Perhaps unsurprisingly, Lindo often describes his own relationship to the UK as “complicated”. His Jamaican parents emigrated as part of the Windrush generation but it was only after he left Britain as a teenager that he learned about Black British history via books such as Peter Fryer’s landmark historyStaying Powerand the work of academics, includingStuart HallandPaul Gilroy.He was disturbed by theWindrush scandal, calling it “disgusting and enraging”, adding that “British racism is every bit as virulent and violent as American racism”. Speaking to the Guardian in 2020, Lindo said that he became conscious of the fact many components of the black British experience that have not been explored. “I’m curious to unpack those stories,” he said. “I have an intense interest in the Windrush period, because my mom was part of that.”His research had a purpose: he’s also crafted a screenplay based on his mother’s time in England, although he doesn’t have a rose-tinted memory of his time in the UK. “Everything I have achieved in my life has come as a result of leaving England,” he said. “I could never in a trillion years have had this career in England. Never.”View image in fullscreen‘From memorable face to belated leading man’ … Lindo opposite Denzel Washington in Malcolm X.Photograph: AJ Pics/AlamyA look at his CV and it’s fair to say he has a point. Lindo’s filmography is peppered with the kind of roles black British actors plying their trade in the UK could only dream of in the 1980s and 1990s.An accomplished stage actor, Lindo made his Broadway debut alongside Danny Glover in apartheid-era dramaMaster Harold … and the Boys. He got the chance because James Earl Jones, for whom he was understudying, had to go to Hollywood to finish some voice work for Star Wars.Lindo managed to marry a stage career with mainstream successes, such as roles in the Elmore Leonard adaptationGet Shortyand the action movieGone in 60 Seconds, where he starred alongside Nicolas Cage and Vinnie Jones.But it’s his relationship withSpike Leethat he is best known for. He has been described as Lee’s “secret weapon” and the relationship with the director has “levelled him up from memorable face to belated leading man,” in the opinion of one critic, who argued he creates “characters no one else in the Lee orbit would have been right to play”.He was a strong contender for an Oscar nod in 2020, for his performance in Lee’sDa 5 Bloods, where he played an African American Vietnam veteran who returns to the country to lay old ghosts to rest. But he was ultimatelyfrozen out(the Sinners recognition is his first Oscar nomination).View image in fullscreenCritically lauded … Lindo with Alfre Woodard, centre, in 1994’s Crooklyn.Photograph: David Lee/Rex/ShutterstockThat was his fourth collaboration with Lee, and the relationship has arguably produced his best – or certainly most critically lauded – work. Da 5 Bloods followed the trio of films he made in the 90s. He played a menacing criminal mentor inMalcolm X, then followed that with a performance as a struggling father in Crooklyn, before playing another bellicose drug boss in Lee’s haunting adaptation of Richard Price’s Clockers.When the Guardian interviewed Lindo in 2000 to mark the release of Gone in 60 Seconds, Lindo was asked what irked him most about Hollywood. “I wish there were more adherence paid to the body of one’s work,” he said. “I always feel that people only remember the last thing that I did, and that’s unfortunate.”Perhaps on Sunday 15 March when Hollywood pays homage to its stars, Lindo will hope the voters do focus on the last thing he did and take the chance to give an Oscar to one of the industry’s most consistent talents.Explore more on these topicsFilmDelroy LindoSinnersOscarsBritish identity and societyWindrush scandalCommonwealth immigrationnewsShareReuse this content"

Proximity to France? Easy landing beaches beneath the cliffs? The lively arts scene?Probably – pending new archaeological finds – the first two, yet there’s little doubt that this bit of Thanet has long been hopping. Van Gogh, Turner, Pugin, Tissot and Sambourne wielded brushes on its streets. Dickens everyone already knows about, but other local scribblers include Anthony Buckeridge, Russell HobanandFrank Muir.Sir Moses Montefiore transformed one area of town into a glorious slice of Georgian Jewish splendour; the brainchildren of other mad and sublime architects are dotted all about. The harbourside Home for Smack Boys, a charitable home for orphans and fishing apprentices, is the best church I know.Granted, there was a bit of a cultural lull through the 80s, 90s and 00s, which is when I knew the town best. My family are from Flora Road, and I spent every holiday there, then even more time when my grandmother was ill. She died in 2005, the year after Ukip set up their first office-cum-gift shop on nearby King Street. But the advent of a high-speed rail link in 2008 turned things around and the subsequent gentrification has been colossal. There’s a proper, credible music venue now, plus an amazing record store, wild museums (obsolete computers, pinball machines), book sales in shipping containers and endless grassroots activity.The point about Ramsgate though is that it has soul and salt in its bones. Even without the hip additions, it is a place for wild skies and big thoughts. There is no place I love more. Except perhaps Broadstairs: a short walk along the coast, with better rock pools and nicer ice-cream.Catherine ShoardLetchmore Heath, HertfordshireFor sheer density of cultural significance per square foot, surely nowhere deserves the title more than theHertfordshirevillage where I was born, Letchmore Heath. This pretty, chocolate-boxy place, with its pond, pub and village green on which morris dancers disport themselves, is a short drive from Elstree Studios and is often used for film and TV shoots. Most notably, the 1960 cult sci-fi movie Village of the Damned was shot there (based on John Wyndham’s novel The Midwich Cuckoos), in which the village’s women mysteriously give birth to a weird clutch of blond-haired, dead-eyed children: the advance party of a conquering alien master race. All of the village’s sweetly picturesque sights assumed an eerie dimension after that.My oldest friend, the novelist Joanna Briscoe – with whom I had playdates in the village when we were four years old – wrote a fascinating thriller set there calledTouched, inspired by the film. But these somewhat sinister associations were redeemed in 1973 when George Harrison bought the local manor house, then called Piggott’s Manor – around the time he was working on his album Living in the Material World – renamed itBhaktivedanta Manorand donated it to the Hare Krishna movement as a place of spiritual calm and enlightenment; there is now a George Harrison Garden dedicated to his memory in the grounds.Peter BradshawFalmouth, CornwallView image in fullscreen‘Putting Cornwall back on the touring map’ … Venezuelan calypso musicians performing at the Cornish Bank in Falmouth, Cornwall.Photograph: Hugh R Hastings/Getty ImagesSt Ives may seem the more obvious choice to represent Cornwall, but the north coast town has beencompromised by overtourism, greedily trading on its reputation as a 20th-century artistic haven. Ironically, that’s shut out most contemporary artists from being able to make work there. Plus, St Ives’s creative identity was largely imposed on it by outsiders, save Peter Lanyon and Alfred Wallis.No, better beautiful cobbled Falmouth, which by way of cultural history has the sun-dappled, softly horny expressionism of 19th-century painter Henry Scott Tuke, and the first ever polytechnic society, which is still going strong today. It was the hub of the Cornish wrestling scene; more modern sporting duels includethe annual worm-charming championships. Today, it has festivals celebrating sea shanties, oysters, beer and boats, as well as the indie music festival Wanderfal, spanning the seaside town’s many choice venues – chiefly the Cornish Bank, which organises the fest. Since opening in 2020, the Cornish Bank has put Cornwallback on the touring mapas well as cultivating local culture such as theCeltic club night Klub Nos Lowenand much-needed queer events.There are multiple anarchic theatre companies including Miracle and Near-ta, the art school is still going strong, and at pub-cum-bookshop Beerwolf you can drink cheap ale and buy cheap books (a self-perpetuating combination). The many free gardens are fertile glades, and in the face of shuttering nightclubs across the nation, the inglorious sticky carpets of Club I (sadly not owned by Steve “Phil Mitchell” McFadden, as persistent local rumours would have it) turn 60 next year. Plus, you may spot Aphex Twin in the pub. What more could you want?Laura SnapesAbergavenny, MonmouthshireView image in fullscreen‘A border-town story worth telling’ … here. Abergavenny in Monmouthshire.Photograph: Graham Hunt/AlamyMy home town now for nearly a decade, Abergavenny – Aber to lots of us – is where the radical magic of the Welsh borders meets the might of the Welsh valleys. We have what is thought to be the only surviving wooden Jesse in the world – a huge 15th-centuryreligious figure carved from an oak tree, in St Mary’s Priory – and a secret 17th-century Catholic chapel in Plas Gunter Mansion. Our town schooled the groundbreaking working-class academic and novelist Raymond Williams, and our women were instrumental in the Greenham Common peace marches.There have been recent explosions in culture here, too. Alongside our well-known food festival, the arts organisation Peak Cymru has funded and (literally) platformed up-and-coming artists at its train station HQ, while talks and exhibitions have lit up theArtShop & Chapel. Forward-thinking independent booksellers Book-ish, the Abergavenny writing festival and the Abergavenny arts festival have celebrated and encouraged local creativity, while Black Mountain Jazz run Jazz Katz, a great monthly improvisation group for young people, alongside hosting gigs. The recently refurbished Borough theatre and the Melville Centre also bubble with potential as venues. Add one of the oldest amateur symphony orchestras in the UK and an award-winning brass band, and there’s a border-town story worth telling here.Jude RogersFolkestone, KentView image in fullscreen‘Art and creativity are closely woven into Folkestone’ … Folkestone triennial festival in Kent.Photograph: Andrew Aitchison/In Pictures/Getty ImagesFolkestone is the UK’s best and largest open-air art gallery, with 91 artworks situated across the town, many of them accompanied by views across the Channel. The best are in dialogue with that body of water: Yoko Ono beaming out the words “Earth peace” towards France in morse code from a lighthouse-like lamp; Christian Boltanski’s The Whispers playing recordings of letters to and from first world war soldiers at low volume as you sit on a bench looking out to sea.The artworks, along with more that come and go with theFolkestone triennialarts festival, were commissioned by Creative Folkestone, which also bought up 90-odd buildings in the town centre to provide affordable spaces for creatives. As with any arts-led regeneration, there is a certain amount of paternalism. But this was a less lumpen scheme than in say, Bilbao, Spain, or indeed Margate around the Kent coast, where galleries were plonked down like blobs of honeycomb for tourist-sophisticates to buzz around then fly away. Folkestone’s grassroots music is also nurtured with festivals such as Compass, nights such as IYKYK and venues such as Speedway, and there are festivals for everything from documentary film to south-Asian zine culture. Art and creativity are closely woven into Folkestone, rather than just draped over one part of it.Ben Beaumont-ThomasPortobello, EdinburghView image in fullscreen‘Like herring gulls to a fine chippy, we come for the culture’ … Portobello in Edinburgh.Photograph: Iain Masterton/AlamyTwenty years ago, when I moved to Edinburgh, folk went to Porty for the beach, the pistachio-green railings and faded Victorian vibes. The 2-mile stretch of golden sands, along with the bitter winds whipping off the North Sea, made for a bracing walk along the prom. Now, like herring gulls to a fine chippy, we come for the culture. ToPortobello Books, one of the best independent bookshops in Scotland, whose legendary events programme last year alone included Ocean Vuong, Jacqueline Wilson and Kit de Waal. To the newly regenerated historic town hall, which is continuing to grow its events programme – I recently chaired Nicola Sturgeon there.The council library is brilliant and comes into its own every October during Portobello book festival. Last year, I took my daughter to Porty’s annual Art Walk, in which residents open up their homes to show work by contemporary artists, which is as eccentric and delightful as it sounds. Porty Pride is growing year on year into a grassroots community festival to rivalEdinburghand Glasgow’s Pride festivals. Climate-focused community action is powerful in Porty, and often dovetails with the burgeoning art and food scenes. If none of that’s your jam, there’s always the forbearing line of wild swimmers, mostly middle-aged women at the end of their rope, bobbing year-round in the sea, which in Porty is a culture all of its own.Chitra RamaswamyHalifax, West YorkshireView image in fullscreen‘The Shoreditch of the north’ … Jim Kerr of Simple Minds at the Piece Hall in Halifax in 2025.Photograph: Andrew Benge/Getty ImagesA few years ago, BBC Radio 6 Music dubbed Halifax “the Shoreditch of the north” after the former mill town’s unlikely metamorphosis into a hipster haven to rival the east-London hotspot. Although residents cringed at the comparison, the town has a huge cultural imprint. The 18th-century cloth hallthe Piece Hallhas been transformed into a world-class outdoor venue hosting the likes of Paul Weller and Boygenius, while the former 19th-century carpet manufacturing complex Dean Clough now hosts a theatre and one of the largest private art galleries in the UK.The music scene most recently added dreamy indie types the Orielles to an impressive lineage stretching from thrash metallers Paradise Lost to Dubstar’s Sarah Blackwood; The Grayston Unity has emerged as a key northern grassroots hub, while the reunited Stone Roses’ warmup show here a few years back had the Victoria theatre’s balcony literally bouncing.Lately, the town’s Victorian architecture and breathtaking Calder valley landscapes painted by Turner and immortalised by Ted Hughes have provided locations for several TV series, including Shane Meadows’s The Gallows Pole and Huddersfield-born Sally Wainwright’s smashes Happy Valley, Gentleman Jack and (obviously) Last Tango in Halifax. The Piece Hall was even blown up in the Marvel miniseries Secret Invasion … but, luckily, only fictionally.Dave SimpsonTell us your own nominationYou can tell us your choice for the first UK town of culture using this form.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

The resulting public scrutiny was painful, she says, but it was the ideal grounding to step into the shoes of presidential widow Mary LincolnFri 23 Jan 2026 08.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.06 ESTShareBathed in the fluorescent glow of a rehearsal studio on the south bank of the Thames, Keala Settle is embodying a woman redefining herself in the court of public opinion. Cast as former first lady Mary Lincoln inMrs President, a sombre and haunting stage production that begins a six-week run at London’s Charing Cross theatre this month, she grapples with the turbulent inner world of Abraham Lincoln’s wife, vilified by the media and eager to rewrite herself in the eyes of the US after her husband’s assassination and the civil war.As an actor, and woman, Settle – known globally for her performance inThe Greatest Showmanas bearded lady Lettie Lutz – is also done with being what people tell her to be. It has, she explains, taken 10 years to reach this point. But her own encounters with celebrity and grief were the ideal preparation for this psychological drama. “This role – I jumped at it. I’ve never related to anything so closely.”The 75-minute play meets Lincoln on an anguished journey of self-discovery in the studio of Mathew Brady (Hal Fowler), forefather of photojournalism and celebrity portraiture. Their encounter – resulting in a historic portrait – is imagined by writer John Ransom Phillips and Olivier-nominated director Bronagh Lagan.View image in fullscreenBitter fruit … Keala Settle as Mary Lincoln.Photograph: Michael WharleyIt is starkly different fromOh Mary!, the Tony-winning, darkly comic Broadway hit that characterises the same first lady as a drunk wannabe cabaret star in the leadup to her husband’s death, but arrives in the West End, by curious coincidence, at the same time. In Mrs President, though, Settle, 50, hopes that audiences “will see both myself and Mary in a brand new light”. In her case, she hopes they will understand “I’m absolutely going to be who I’m going to be and it will not fit anyone’s mould”, she says.The message bears more than a passing resemblance to the one at the heart of The Greatest Showman and Settle’s showstopping solo This Is Me, which rocketed her into the cultural canon, won best original song at the Golden Globes and received an Oscar nomination in 2018.Both this role and that of Mary Lincoln reflect Settle’s own journey to self acceptance. Her Oldham-born father, David, was on a Mormon mission to New Zealand when he met her mother, Susanne; the two had Settle, the first of five children, in Hawaii, later moving to French-speaking Louisiana. As a result, Settle felt she was existing in “two different worlds”.“I would come home and it would be: we’re learning Māori alphabet and music andTītī tōrea stick game; then we’d go outside and have to find another identity because this identity was not for outside.”Settle always wanted to act but also “sang anything and everything” and constantly sought the affection of her recording artist mother, who pushed her down the same path. “I was supposed to be the singer, I had a sister who was supposed to be the doctor, a brother who was supposed to be a lawyer … I think that was the plight of the culture that my mum was raised in and probably not far from the church teachings she believed in.”I welcome being afraid. I’m looking for projects that internally make my bum twitch but I know I needSettle’s instinct was to fight against it. This “un-mothering” was another thing that attracted her to the part of Mary Lincoln, who was six when her mother died. Settle’s own mother died a decade ago. “There were similarities for me because my mother was so hell-bent. It was really awkward for me to have someone who I trusted or was supposed to trust, at least, shove me in front of people non-stop,” she remembers.She was shaped by her many cultural influences and this will to shirk the identity her mother imposed. “That literally is who I am. On top of it were these two people who came from completely different aspects of the world.” In Louisiana, she remembers how people looked at her parents: “Because my mother was a different shade than my father, that played a massive part in what we all saw and sponged up.”Settle’s parents didn’t want their children to sound like them, yet she watched Fawlty Towers and Are You Being Served? on cable and “always had a British accent”. It is strongly British today (Settle lives in Brighton), carrying hints of Pacific heritage. “Everyone in our communities, wherever we were, referred to my dad as Mr Bean.”View image in fullscreenThis Is Me time … Keala Settle in The Greatest Showman.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/AllstarSettle’s career has taken her around the world performing in some of the last decade’s most acclaimed musicals. She was nominated for a Tony for her 2013 Broadway debut as Norma Valverde in Hands on a Hardbody; in 2015, she played the original Becky in Waitress–her mother died on the show’s opening night in Massachusetts. Other credits include Les Misérables and Hairspray and she sang backup for Gladys Knight in Las Vegas. Settle made her West End debut in &Juliet, then Sister Act, and more recently appeared as Miss Coddle, the headmistress of Shiz University, in the movie adaptations of Wicked.The Greatest Showman, in 2017, was a turning point. “Working on the production of Showman was a dream come true. I never clocked a dream like that.” She describes it as “a gift”. Even so, she struggled with the aftermath. Having never done am-dram or regional theatre, she says, “I was very fortunate to jump [to such a big role] but what my soul craved was the connection of all that stuff that everyone else had been through.”The upshot was that “when I did Showman I was not ready”. An emotionally charged rehearsal of This Is Me,four months after her mother’s death, went viral but Settle “could not watch it for probably longer than five seconds. I saw myself as a five-year-old girl who had not yet been looked after because four months prior her mother had passed. Her whole world that had told her what to do, where to go, and the reason she went into this industry to piss that woman off was gone. So what do you do now?”The movie grossed a reported $435m at the box office worldwide and brought Settle global recognition, but she never wanted celebrity, where others “hold the cards, therefore you are what they tell you to be”. Pushing against that can be portrayed, she says “as mania, and the humans that are most susceptible to that misjudged view happen to be women”. She finds parallels, once again, in the public scrutiny faced by Lincoln.After The Greatest Showman’s fevered release, things got tougher still. Settle suffered a mini-stroke and had 10-hour double bypass brain surgery just a week before the Oscars, where she would perform in a gown fitted from her hospital bed. She was diagnosed with Moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder. “That was a disease that I had no idea I had, that just happened to be fed by what was happening.”View image in fullscreenKeala Settle in rehearsals for Mrs President.Photograph: Pamela RaithSettle’s diagnosis underscored the sense that she was pushing herself too far. “I’m used to ‘Give, give, give, and when you’re dead, keep giving’. That’s when I went: OK, I’ve got to look after myself.” In the eight years since, the work she has done to process all that she has experienced has left Settle with an appetite for projects that instil a healthy amount of fear. I ask if being afraid is something she now … “welcomes”, she answers before I’ve even had the chance to finish the question.But didn’t she always welcome it? “Oh my God no. Ran from it. Ran, drank, boozed, pills, all of it.” Today, she says, “I’m looking for projects that internally make my bum twitch but I know I need.”Creatively, the rare turn from musicals to drama was something she had craved. Without music, she says, “you have to work 10 zillion times as hard to find the tools to make that kind of impact because music has its own healing powers.”Did she have to go through Showman and all that came before and after to get to this play? “Yes,” she gasps, her eyes tearful. “There’s no way I could do this had I not gone through all of that. I wouldn’t understand it. It’s horrifying but also empowering that I can understand every bit of this story and still have the grace not only for that woman but also for myself, so that whoever comes to see it can step back and say: ‘Hey, it’s not this – it’sthis.’”Which brings us back to the seismic impact of This Is Me. “As much as I sang this song as a character, the way that I leadmylife is something a lot of people can’t cope with because it’s not their version of me.” She says this is exactly what Mary Lincoln was going through: “‘We see you as the grieving mother, you’re the maniac, you’re this and you’re that.’”And Settle says, of both herself and Lincoln: “She takes all of it back by saying: ‘You’re right. I hope you enjoyed the show because I survived it.’”Mrs Presidentis at Charing Cross theatre, London, to 8 March.Explore more on these topicsStagefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Its star and writer-director Mona Fastvold talk fear, bonding – and not needing an OscarFri 23 Jan 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Fri 23 Jan 2026 08.07 ESTShareNot many actors take an interest in the audience’s aftercare. When it comes to The Testament of Ann Lee, however,Amanda Seyfriedis hands-on. “Did you watch it with someone you could talk to?” she asks, tilting her head sympathetically, then dipping her full-beam headlight eyes and giving a worried look when I admit that I saw it alone. “It’s nice to process it with somebody else.”Her concern is understandable. Whatever feelings the film provokes, indifference will not be among them. Heady and rapturous, this is an all-round odd duck of a movie, the sort of go-for-broke phantasmagoria – an 18th-century musical biopic complete with feverish visions and levitating – that was once typical of Lars von Trier or Bruno Dumont. I confess I didn’t know exactly what to make of it, but I knew I had been through a singular experience. Its director, Mona Fastvold, seated beside Seyfried on a sofa in a London hotel room, looks delighted. “That’s my favourite sort of feeling,” she says.Fastvold co-wrote the screenplay with her partner, Brady Corbet; their previous collaborations include last year’s Oscar-winning dramaThe Brutalist, which Corbet directed. (The couple also perform second-unit directing duties on one another’s movies.) Like that film,The Testament of Ann Leeis an immigrant story, though in this case a factual one. Seyfried gives a fearless, fever-pitch performance as Lee, the illiterate daughter of a Mancunian blacksmith, who in 1758 fell in with the Shaking Quakers, a religious group so-called because of the ecstatically shaking, trembling dances by which adherents responded to the infusion of God’s spirit. This was accompanied by soaring song and panted, rhythmic incantations; for the film, the British composerDaniel Blumberg, who won an Oscar for his score for The Brutalist, has rousingly adapted real Shaker hymns and spirituals.View image in fullscreen‘There was a lot of repetitive movement, using my body in a way that I’ve never done before’ … Amanda Seyfried.Photograph: Giulia ParmigianiIn 1774, Lee and her fellow Shakers brought the religion to the US, built a village in Albany County, New York and preached their gospel of pacifism, equality of race and gender – and celibacy. Just as there is an austere beauty to the minimalist furniture that the Shakers made, such as ladder-back chairs with woven seats, so other elements of their lives were similarly pared back. “No one can love God while following the lust of the flesh,” Lee tells the disgruntled husband who fathered her four children, each of whom died in infancy. Her maternal agony escalated her religious devotion. “She decided to mother the world,” says Fastvold.Aside from their vanilla-coloured hair, she and Seyfried are a study in contrasts today. The 40-year-old Pennsylvania-born actor, wearing a black dress with a white collar, is relaxed enough to stretch out her bare legs, plonking her black-shoed feet on the coffee table. As she talks, she gestures expansively. Fastvold, 44, barely moves: the Norwegian former dancer is perched on the edge of the sofa with her hands clasped in her lap. Her outfit is giving Star Trek: a boxy, stiff-shouldered charcoal felt top from which ribbed grey sleeves protrude. Together, actor and director resemble a high-spirited student and her reserved but loyal governess.View image in fullscreenSeyfried (centre) in the titular role of The Testament of Ann Lee.Photograph: BFA/AlamyBoth are singing from the same hymn sheet on how they hope viewers will approach the film. Introducing an American Film Institute screening last year, Seyfried told the audience: “Don’t be afraid to laugh: it’s absurd at moments and that’s what makes it special.” Fastvold agrees: “It’s operatic,” she says now. “Sometimes it’s very serious, and sometimes it doesn’t take itself seriously at all. You don’t want to make fun of anyone, but at the same time we can’t be full-on devout Shakers. It’s not like we’re trying to convert people.”Fastvold stumbled on Ann Lee’s story while researching her previous film, the 19th-century lesbian dramaThe World to Come. The question hanging over the new picture, as with any period work, is: why tell this story today? “The more I found out, the more I felt I needed it now more than ever. We need to think about leadership in a different way. Leaders around the world are leading from a place of fear and intimidation, which is the opposite of Ann Lee. She led from a place of nurturing, mothering and equality.”Fastvold met Seyfried when she was directing three episodes of the 2023 seriesThe Crowded Room, in which the actor played an investigator grilling a suspected gunman (Tom Holland); they worked together again last year on the missing-person miniseriesLong Bright River. In between, she gave Seyfried the Ann Lee script and offered her the lead. The story goes that her instant response was: “I know the way in.”“Youdidsay that,” says Fastvold, beaming proudly at her star. “But you also said, ‘Maybe you should cast someone British. Maybe you shouldn’t trust me.’ You had all these excuses. It was sort of gracious – like you wanted what was best for me and the film.”What was the way in that Seyfried had identified? “I was holding on to Ann’s unadulterated passion and devotion,” she says. “I can understand how someone can be brought to their knees in that way, and how delicious and attractive that is to people who need something to believe in.”Undercutting her confidence was something else: “Fear.” She hadn’t been this afraid of a role since playing Marion Davies, mistress of the media baron William Randolph Hearst, in David Fincher’s Citizen Kane-adjacent dramaMank. “Anything that feels far away from the contemporary-ness of the world scares me. Which makes it a thousand times more worthwhile.”Mank went swimmingly: Seyfried’s joyful performance stole the movie and brought her an Oscar nomination. There may be any number of reasons why she hasn’t received one for playing Ann Lee. The movie itself is intoxicating once you submit, but not everyone will. An anonymous Academy voter recentlytoldVariety that Seyfried was “astounding … I haven’t seen a better performance this year”, but admitted they “didn’t really like the movie”.I’d work on my Mancunian accent in my trailer by watching videos of Maxine PeakePerhaps her outspokenness has also counted against her this time. Last year, she distinguished herself spectacularly by refusing to row back on her description of the murdered far-right activist Charlie Kirk as “hateful” in an Instagram comment. ShetoldWho What Wear: “I’m not fucking apologising for that.” In her own statement, she addressed the importance of nuance: “I can get angry about misogyny and racist rhetoric and ALSO very much agree that Charlie Kirk’s murder was absolutely disturbing and deplorable in every way imaginable.”Shortly after that controversy, her name seemed to stop appearing among the five performers predicted to receive a best actress Oscar nomination this year. Could it be that the Academy feared another social media-related uproar in that category after last year’sscandalover reactionary tweets by Karla Sofía Gascón, star of Emilia Pérez? Seyfried needn’t care. “I’ve gotten this far without an Oscar,” shetoldthe New Yorker this month. “Why would I need one now?” She is, as she has said, “sitting pretty” after the success of her loopy thrillerThe Housemaid, in which she co-stars with Sydney Sweeney. With that and The Testament of Ann Lee, she has multiplex and arthouse all sewn up.As a trained singer, she has starred in musicals before, but The Testament of Ann Lee was infinitely more demanding than Mamma Mia! or Les Misérables. “It’s so technical: the choreography, the live singing, the Manchester accent. I was spinning so many plates.” Long before filming began, her preparation was already under way. “While I was on other jobs, I’d work on my Mancunian accent in my trailer by watching videos of Maxine Peake.” Celia Rowlson-Hall’s choreography also put mighty demands on her. “There was a lot of repetitive movement, using my body in a way that I’ve never done before. It becomes this full-bodied expression of your devotion. I was this vessel. It was exciting and scary and fucking great!” To decompress after a day of rhythmic pounding and lurching and swaying in 18th-century costume, she would “listen to something ridiculously separate like Backstreet Boys”.View image in fullscreenSeyfried and Lewis Pullman as Ann and William Lee.Photograph: Capital Pictures/AlamyMuch of the film was shot in Hungary, on a bustling set: Fastvold encouraged her cast and crew to bring their children along, too. Once most of the families had departed, the two women became roomies for the final stretch. “I made her move into my apartment,” Seyfried says. “It was very cosy.”“I wanted to!” Fastvold protests. “The sweet thing was that we had both been working and taking care of our children, but once I moved in with Amanda …” She turns to address her directly: “You were doing little things to take care of me. I’d done my laundry, then gone out location scouting on a Sunday, and when I came home my socks had been balled up and placed in my closet. I nearly cried. Brady’s very nurturing and he makes the best sandwich ever. But at the same time, there was something about living with this very maternal person that was amazing.” It has set a high bar for the future. “Now I’ll ask all my leading ladies, ‘How do you feel about folding laundry?’”The nourishment flowed both ways. “I would wake up and you’d have the French press, the beautiful music playing, a candle going,” Seyfried recalls. “We went to the spa and you brought your little shot list. Mona’s so funny. She gets ready for work and she has her cute handkerchief. I was, like, ‘My God, she’s an angel from heaven!’” Not the sort of stories you hear from a Michael Bay set.Fastvold and Corbet have an 11-year-old daughter, Ada, while Seyfried and her husband, Thomas Sadoski, have a son and daughter, both under 10. Corbet made a point of singling out a tearful Ada in the audience at the Golden Globes last year when he won the best director prize. Fastvold says: “Early on, when my daughter was young, she would say, ‘Why do you have to go off and make a film and be away from me? Why can’t you be a teacher?’ My instinct was to say, ‘I have to go out and make money for us.’ Then I realised that’s not the right thing to say. What I should say is, ‘I’m going to leave you because I really want to do this job. I’m so excited to do it. And I am going to miss you, but I’m going to have such a fun time.’ And she accepted it in a totally different way. She didn’t feel that I was being forced to leave her.”Amanda’s very free. She needs to not have any filter, I think, to access all the places she needs to go in her workSeyfried likes to let her children see her vulnerability. “The other day, I told my daughter, ‘I’m sad because right now I’m tired and I’m travelling away from you, and I miss you.’ But she knows that what I’m doing right now is important for me. Of course, she also knows I’m going to pick stuff up for her. She’ll get stationery, she’ll get plushies …”Both women have been extravagant in their praise for one another while promoting The Testament of Ann Lee, but two adjectives have leapt out: Fastvold has admiringly labelled her star “a little mad”, while Seyfried has plumped for “brave”. Would they care to elaborate? Fastvold clarifies her remark: “Mad in a playful way. The best of us are, I think. What I mean is, Amanda’s very free. She needs to not have any filter, I think, to access all the places she needs to go in her work.”As for the bravery part: “You don’t care about the rules,” Seyfried tells Fastvold. “You don’t care if something is hard to do. You absolutely stay on your own path. Look, you directed a fucking Shaker musical set in the 1770s about a woman no one’s ever heard of. And it premiered atVenice!”It sounds almost Ann Lee-like. Does that mean there is an autobiographical dimension to the film? Fastvold smiles bashfully. “Isn’t there always?” she says.The Testament of Ann Lee is in UK cinemas from 20 February.Explore more on these topicsFilmAmanda SeyfriedDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsReligioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

It took a bit longer to work out the word “Parlophone”.My favourite book growing upSister Vincent taught primary six in St Joseph’s, Inverness, and was a discerning reader with very good taste, plus the kind of literary moral rectitude that meant she removed Enid Blyton from the class library because she believed Blyton’s books were written by a factory of writers. In 1972 she and I had a passionate argument when the class was choosing a book to be read out loud to us and I championed Charlotte’s Web by EB White, with which I was in love. Sister Vincent put her foot down. “No. Because animals speak in it, and in reality animals don’t speak.” I recently reread it for the first time since I was nine, and it moved me to tears. What a fine book, about all sorts of language, injustice, imaginative power and friendship versus life’s tough realities. Terrific. Radiant. Humble.The book that changed me as a teenagerLiz Lochhead’s Memo for Spring. One evening when I was 16 I babysat for our marvel of an English teacher at Inverness High School, Ann McKay. Raiding her bookshelves I found a book so slim it had no spine, just hinges, and was by a woman who was young, Scottish and a poet (at this point in time a rare combination). The poems in it were so good, gripping and clear, written in a kind of Scottish English I knew was close to my own, but I’d never read in any book. I read it twice through that evening then Ann lent me it for a week. It filled me with excitement and hope.The writer who changed my mindSee above. Liz Lochhead. She changed what was possible – for so many of us.The books that made me want to be a writerReading certain writers does this for me on a continual basis. Muriel Spark. Toni Morrison. Morrison’s oeuvre is a sustained and courageous masterclass in how the aliveness in writing shifts the energy in life, and Spark’s Loitering with Intent, like all her books, will never fail to send me on my way rejoicing.Theauthor IrereadA lot of Simone de Beauvoir’s writing came into affordable paperback translation when I was in my very early 20s. Back then I read everything I could get. Recently I’ve loved re-encountering her fiction. I think her novels are outstanding, especially Les Belles Images (1966), a coruscating postwar satire on the performance of happiness. Also, I never stop rereading Ovid’s Metamorphoses, a book that’ll always remind its readers to stay fluid and adaptable regardless of crazed changing times.The book I could never read againNever say never. I promise I’ll try Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre and Villette again, just not right now, OK?The writers I discovered later in lifeVladimir Nabokov. What sheer shining joy. Fyodor Dostoevsky. Where have I been all the years? Henry James. I read The Golden Bowl in the garden one summer not long ago and found myself running down our garden path shouting out loud to my partner: “Sarah! Sarah! The golden bowl is broken!”The book I am currently readingLiadan Ní Chuinn, Every One Still Here. These stories about Ireland and recent history face up to the truth of lives in a way that very little new writing I’ve read does. In doing this they change and recharge the potential of the short story form. Two have already become some of my favourite stories ever.My comfort readThe Summer Book by Tove Jansson. A piece of perfection composed of loss, light, clarity and good nature – a book so trim that it fits easily in the pocket of a jacket yet contains much of everything in life that really matters.Glyph by Ali Smith is published by Hamish Hamilton.

His well-earned confidence means that rather than fill the gap between 2022’s Harry’s House and last week’s announcement of his fourth album – the confusingly-titled Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally – with various one-off releases, spurious anniversary variants or curated social media moments, Styles basically disappeared. In fact, the only sliver of excitement for his fanbase to grab on to came last September when he ran the Berlin marathon in avery respectable 2hr 59min.Having endured the music industry at the height of its #content-heavy obsession in One Direction, there’s something old-fashioned about Styles’ absence between album eras. That’s unlikely to be accidental: since launching his solo career with 2017’s muted, 1970s soft-rock-indebted self-titled debut, Styles has cast himself as a cross-generational throwback beamed into the present, albeit one sporting fashion choices that rile gender conformists. Each album has arrived with a list of influences more akin to the lineup on the Old Grey Whistle Test than the current TikTok algorithms, while 2019’s Fine Line, Styles told us, was crafted under the influence of those vintage psychedelics, magic mushrooms.On the surface, Kiss All the Time. Disco, Occasionally, with its cover image of Styles sporting oversized 70s glasses under a suspended disco ball, seems to continue the theme. Even lead single Aperture’s length, 5min 11sec – long enough to trouble anyone whose attention span has been eroded by social media – feels out of step with modern pop’s brevity.But things have changed. His last comeback single, As It Was, was tightly wound and metronomic, reflecting its nervy lyrics, but the dancefloor-leaning Aperture is much looser. Opening with a minimalist electronic pulse and pretty, oscillating riff, it takes its time to fully emerge from the nightclub smoke, Styles’ lightly filtered voice slurring lyrics about drinks going straight to his knees. What starts out as a skeletal, LCD Soundsystem-lite throb soon starts to build layers, but with nary a softly stroked guitar in sight. Instead, electronic textures bleed in from the song’s edges before a sunlit pre-chorus blossoms into the chorus itself – the chant of “We belong together”, a very Styles call for unity. Expect it to sound amazing ricocheting around a stadium this summer.Musically, Styles is still tinkering in the past, only the references are a little more recent. Aperture has the feel of the early 2010s and bands such as Vampire Weekend, Yeasayer and MGMT, where electronic music mixed with elements of psych, prog and pop; it is also evocative of the 00s techno-pop released on Cologne’s Kompakt label. Lyrically, however, Styles plays it quite straight. Talking about the forthcoming album on Radio 2, he said he used his downtime to go out clubbing more, to be in a crowd rather than playing to one, and at times Aperture has a slight goes-to-Berlin-once feel; people are elevating, others are “going on clean”, light is being let in, and suddenly everyone around him is his best friend. But there’s also something endearing in that, too. By the song’s excellent bridge, as some lovely house-y pianos play out, Styles suddenly sounds a bit lost; “I wanna know what safe is” he sings, before adding, “I don’t know these spaces.”Unsure whether it’s coming (up) or going (down), Aperture grapples for a happy medium and finds its own safe space. While it’s not quite daring enough to scare his fanbase, the shift in direction still feels bold for one of pop’s few good male stars. That confidence remains undented.Explore more on these topicsHarry StylesPop and rockDance musicreviewsShareReuse this content"

His uncertain fate plays out in the present-day imagination of an unnamed curator of unspecified gender, who has been employed by the palace to dress some of its rooms for public viewing in the wake of an undescribed personal tragedy.It’s likely that you’ll either be utterly intrigued or deeply put off by that summary of poet Rebecca Perry’s debut novel, May We Feed the King, a highly wrought puzzle-box of a book which deliberately wrongfoots the reader at every turn. However, the intrigued will find that it richly rewards those who approach it with curiosity – just not in the ways we as readers (and as interpreters of stories in any form) have been trained to expect.The book opens directly into the airless and unemotional life of the Curator as they visit the historic house to take up a new commission. “When you see a replica feast scene in the great hall of an old building, I am the person who placed the pomegranates beside the pie, and for very good reason,” they explain. We are initiated into a world in which historically accurate foodstuffs can be ordered online – “a half oyster shell, the exposed flesh shining as if with the freshest brine, is £31.25 for a single piece” – and begin to understand one of the most striking things about this novel: its insistence upon detail, its utter specificity, set against a deliberate lack of specificity regarding the larger details that the reader’s mind naturally itches to fill in. We are told everything – and nothing at all.Soon, the Curator meets the Archivist, keeper of the medieval palace’s historical records, and in those records finds mention of the brief reign of a king whose life the Curator will draw on to create their historical scenes. We are not told exactly what the records show, but the Curator does report their reaction: “It’s important to say that I cried, I wept, when I saw it. What a reduction of a life.” Although third in line, and temperamentally unsuited to rule, it seems that this king assumed the throne reluctantly after the death of both his brothers, then refused to govern. At this point, the narrative slips into the world of the King, his Queen, his hated Chief Adviser, a loyal young Attendant and the wider world of the court, the novel swallowing up the Curator and we readers like a mirrored jewel box and holding us there, dazzled by the richness of its details and, like the King, quite unable to find our way out.It is as though we are the ghosts as we creep around the palace, trying to interpret momentous events from the few clues left behindPerry’s poetry has been shortlisted for the TS Eliot prize. She has also published an essay in book form about trampolining – growing up, she competed nationally and internationally – and it doesn’t feel like a stretch to point out that in this book the views we are granted are often brief and strangely tilted, never quite stable. May We Feed the King is made up of glimpses of scenes from odd angles and perspectives, with confounding reflections, shadows and movements: rooms seen through windows or from doorways, conversations half heard. It is as though we, not the long-dead courtiers, are the ghosts, as we creep around the palace peering into its rooms dressed in careful set-pieces, trying to interpret complex and momentous events from the few clues left behind.The King is given ultimate power – he can start wars, launch fleets, have subjects killed at a word – and yet its exercise requires total personal surrender: “the King sees an apple he would like to pick and someone is called to free it from the branch”. His growing misery is that of someone raised as a subject who has objecthood forced upon him, and we sympathise with his quiet and then not-so-quiet rebellion as he seeks to escape his plight. More widely, the novel asks us to admit that we can know almost nothing about history, or even about the lives of people with whom we live contemporaneously. To read May We Feed the King is to be richly entertained but forced to sit with frustration: we want clues, we want certainty, we want a story about the King that makes sense, and Perry withholds it, instead making us watch our own minds scrabble about, compulsively putting together the scattered pieces of the past.Towards the end of the book we are returned to the present day and the world of the Curator as they dress the scenes and invite the public in to view their work. “His great gift to us,” they tell the assembled audience, speaking of the King, “– or at least it has been a gift to me – is the very lack of an ending, that could drive a historian mad. What a great – pardon my language – ‘fuck you’ to everyone who tries to manhandle ambiguity into order, to knock out the air.” And then they release the crowds into the rooms with a final instruction that made me wonder if my two close readings of the book were sufficient, if in fact there might have been a clue that I’d missed: “Listen for everything and, above all, pay attention.”Melissa Harrison’s fourth novel, The Given World, will be published by Hutchinson Heinemann in May.

The pain of mothers separated from their children, of children sobbing for their mothers, of adults who have never moved on from the trauma of their youth, and of young people who are forced to live out the conflicts of their elders. Lara Feigel casts her net across history and fiction, reportage and memoir, and while her research is undeniably impressive and her candour moving, at times she struggles to create a narrative that can hold all these tales of anguish together.The book begins with a woman flinging herself fully clothed into a river and then restlessly walking on, swimming again, walking again. This is French novelist George Sand, driven to desperate anxiety as she waits to go into court to fight for the right to custody of her children. But almost immediately the story flicks away to Feigel’s own custody battle, and then back into the early 19th century, with Caroline Norton’s sons being taken away in a carriage in the rain by their father.Norton was the extraordinary woman who seemed to be able to transmute the pain of separation into progress. Because of her courageous campaigning, women won basic rights over their own property and children. Her tale can be read as a harbinger of hope, but it is also shot through with tragedy, including the death of one of her boys during their enforced estrangement.Feigel shows how children are still being caused unnecessary pain by both parents and lawyersAnd given the way Norton’s story is framed here, it becomes impossible to hold on to any sense of progress. We step quickly from 19th-century London back into the maelstrom of Sand’s domestic life, and see how prejudice towards independent women that worked against Norton in England were also present in France. From there we switch to the United States, where poor Elizabeth Packard, who disagreed with her husband’s religious views, was forced away from her children and into an insane asylum. And then a jump cut to 2008, watching Britney Spears being incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital without her beloved children.Feigel meets Edna O’Brien for an interview and finds her “hollow-eyed with pain after a sleepless night”. O’Brien did eventually win custody of her sons, but during their conversation the two writer mothers acknowledge the pain of their struggles with such honesty that it overcomes them. “We cry, both of us, talking about the promises we made that we could not keep; promises extracted that we believed in just about enough to make … what to do when you have a little boy crying in bed unable to sleep?”The book could have ended there, in a shared moment that seems to sum up what happens when the irresistible forces of women’s liberation come up against the immovable objects of children’s needs, patriarchal reflexes, lawyers’ arguments and ex-spouses’ anger. Instead, we flick away again to the US, and into Alice Walker’s experiences of trying to share the care of her daughter with her husband after their divorce. Their arrangement was deeply resented by the daughter, Rebecca Walker, and Feigel takes this as evidence of the “curdling of the dreams of 1960s liberal progress”.By this point it has become horribly clear to the reader that there is little, if any, sense of forward movement to be found in these stories. In the epilogue, Feigel shows through contemporary courtrooms and documents how children are still being caused unnecessary pain by both parents and lawyers. Here, new voices and characters spring to life, each demanding empathy and outrage, but the presentation feels too rushed to do justice to their compelling tales.Feigel tries to end the book on an upbeat note: “Perhaps,” she writes, “we can imagine a version of modernity that isn’t flummoxed by motherhood, where emancipation and care can coexist; perhaps we can imagine a version of the legal system that gives children genuine agency.” Given the stories she has told, such hope feels thin and fragile indeed.Custody: The Secret History of Mothers by Lara Feigel is published by William Collins (£25).

Beginning in 2027, the festival willmove to Boulder, Colorado, after a multi-year selection process that many assumed would end in Salt Lake City.Utah’s largest city, a mere 30 miles from the festival center, has long hosted extra Sundance events and served as its transit center. It’s a rapidly growing metropolitan area, a mecca for outdoor enthusiasts, a major US city – and, according to a new documentary that opened this year’s festival, facing an imminent ecological crisis.Sundance 2026: the 10 films not to miss at this year’s festivalRead moreThe Lake, directed by Abby Ellis, details theprecipitous decline of the Great Salt Lake, an “environmental nuclear bomb” that threatens the health of the region’s 2.8 million residents. Scientists have warned that the lake, the largest saline lake in the western hemisphere, may fully disappear within a matter of years, leaving a region home to over more than 80% of the state’s population susceptible to toxic dust from the exposed lake bed, unless drastic action is taken to curb water diversion. The lake, often called “America’s Dead Sea” (though it is, in fact, four times larger than its counterpart in the Middle East), hit arecord low in 2022, having lost 73% of its water and 60% of its surface area from excess diversion for agriculture and other water use.To continue on such a path “is absolute insanity”, says Ben Abbott, anecologistat Brigham Young University, in the film. “I don’t think people realize how close to the edge we are.”The new film warns, in no uncertain terms, that going over the edge would spell catastrophe for the state’s public health, environment and economy.Toxic dust clouds laden with mercury, arsenic and selenium from the desiccated lakebed would increase pollution for a city whose air quality is already worse than Los Angeles, provoking a respiratory and other cancer-related issues. Birdlife and recreation on the lake, already disappearing with its surface area – now less than 1,000 square miles, down from three times that in the 1980s – would vanish completely. The lake’s disappearance would inflict billions of dollars of economic damage on the region, imperil the lucrative extraction of minerals from the lakebed, and threaten ski conditions at the numerous resorts in the nearby mountains (including the slopes of Park City, looming over the film’s premiere).View image in fullscreenOlof Wood walks across reef-like structures called microbialites, exposed by receding waters at the Great Salt Lake.Photograph: Rick Bowmer/APThree years ago, Abbott, along with more than 30 other scientists,co-authoredareportwarning that absent major intervention, the 11,000-year-old Great Salt Lake would disappear within five years. The film opens in that dire warning’s present – salt-streaked expanses of mud where there was once waist-deep water, parched graveyards of pelican carcasses where there were once thousand-strong colonies – and its aftermath, as advocates urge the Utah state government to attempt a “rescue without precedent”. No saline lake on Earth has been successfully restored from structural decline.Great Salt Lake’s retreat poses a major fear: poisonous dust cloudsRead moreAbbott and fellow scientists point to three ominous comparisons for Utah’s famous inland sea: California’s Owens Lake, which became one of theworst sources of dust pollution in the USafter its water sources were rerouted to Los Angeles a century prior; Iran’s Lake Urmia, whichdevolvedfrom turquoise tourist destination to toxic, heat-magnifying salt bed in a less than five years; and chiefly the Aral Sea, once the world’s fourth largest lake, which stretched between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan before Soviet irrigation projectsstarved it to death, leaving shattered local economies, ship graveyards,large areas of salted sandand numeroushealth problemsin its dusty wake.Accepting the dire significance of the Salt Lake data in the age of fake news is one matter; reaching consensus on what to do about it is another. The film traces different approaches to governance and advocacy – most rooted, as with many issues in Mormon-majority Utah, in religious faith. Abbott, microbiologist Bonnie Baxter and atmospheric scientist Kevin Perry – all intimately familiar with the collapsing ecosystem and the toxic dust bowl taking its place – call for a radical overhaul of the state’s water use, which diverts more than 80% of the lake’s natural inflow to agriculture, primarily for water-intensive crops such as alfalfa and hay; state officials such as Brian Steed,appointedby the state’s Republican governor, Spencer Cox, as the first Great Salt Lake commissioner, pursues a more moderate approach, seeking compromise with farmers whose livelihoods depend on water access in the nation’s second-driest state, and who feel as though they’vebecome the scapegoat for the lake’s decline.View image in fullscreenA still from The Lake by Abby Ellis, an official selection of the 2026 Sundance festival.Photograph: Courtesy of Sundance InstituteSteed’s office makes incremental process on money to buy water back from farmers, yet the changes required to save the lake are so massive, and the straits so dire, that, as Abbott tells him, “winning slowly is losing”.The documentary, whichrecentlypicked up Leonardo DiCaprio as an executive producer, includes footage from a roundtable with legislators, researchers and advocates,convenedby governor Cox last September, thatpublicly prioritized restorationof the lake and dedicated $200m of philanthropic funds to the cause. A new charter set 2034 – the same year Salt Lake will once again host the Winter Olympics – as thetarget datefor “reaching healthier lake levels and showcasing Utah’s pioneer spirit on a global stage”.In the meantime, the Great Salt Lake, and the many whose lives revolve around it, remain in a precarious position. The Sundance film festival may be leaving Utah (at least, for 10 years), but The Lake maintains a hopeful eye on the region’s future, should the charter’s proposals continue as planned. Saving the Great Salt Lake “is not an impossible order”, Steed says. “This is not something that we have to sit around and puzzle about. We have an opportunity in front of us.”The Lake is screening at the Sundance film festival and is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2026UtahDocumentary filmsClimate crisisfeaturesShareReuse this content"

For good reason:Luke Norris’s play is a harrowing portrait of pregnancy and grief, plumbing the depths of sorrow within a marriage. But it is not only that. It is funny and profound, intense without ever becoming overwrought.The play follows a thirtysomething couple who remain unnamed, just like their baby, as they navigate loss. Their relationship seems to feed off a sparky kind of contrariness. She (Rosie Sheehy) is clever, ferocious, always up for a fight. He (Robert Aramayo) is gentler, using humour – and poetry, even in the face of her jeering – to soften her edges. Their dialogue sounds like a contact sport – ricocheting, fast and furious – while they wait for the results of their 20-week ultrasound scan in the first scene.View image in fullscreenSparky …  Robert Aramayo and Rosie Sheehy.Photograph: Johan PerssonThe news is painful, we realise in the following scene. Terrible choices have to be made around the birth of their baby. Sheehy and Aramayo give explosive performances, matching each other’s intensity in different ways. This story is so dark (“Are we at the bottom yet?” he asks her) but you do not want to miss a second of it.Directed by Jeremy Herrin, the play change gears from savage to tender, devastating to humorous, and is self-assured in showing us the shape of grief. Norris, better known as an actor, distinguished himself as a writer withGoodbye to All That, which was staged upstairs at the Royal Court in 2012. This confirms his talent as a playwright of depth and flair.Plot twists bring shock and dread, but alongside this there is both whimsy and deep rumination on mortality, including a mystical element that skirts around dreams and other worlds and existences.It is strikingly staged, with blackouts between scenes. Grace Smart’s set design changes at speed in the dark, a new milieu emerging out of it suddenly – the couple’s bedroom or would-be nursery taking the place of a hospital room, with dazzling lighting byJessica Hung Han Yun.The couple’s fights are visceral, speaking the unspeakable. “Sometimes I hate you,” she says, and he wishes her dead. But through the tears and angry, unreasonable charges they hurl at each other, the love endures. This is a tear-jerker with 100% heart, 0% sentimentality. What a start to theRoyal Court’s 70th anniversary season. What an emotional tour de force.AtRoyal Court theatre, London, until 21 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreRoyal Court theatrePregnancyParents and parentingFamilyreviewsShareReuse this content"

She’s been remade as a feminist icon – a woman driven to extremes, and even incarcerated, by a society and a husband who couldn’t cope with her creativity. Some have tried, too, to capture the Fitzgeralds’ melodramatic marriage on stage (such as in the Craig Revel Horwood-directed Beautiful and Damned in the West End in 2004), with limited success. This latest attempt, with music and lyrics by actor Hannah Corneau, is directed by Michael Greif, the man behind the original Broadway productions ofRentandDear Evan Hansen.He has, unsurprisingly, assembled a cast that can pour plenty of vocal bravura into Corneau’s largely poppy score. We follow the well-worn trajectory of the Fitzgeralds’ ascent and decline from Jazz Age fame through the lens of their daughter Scottie as she wanders through their archive (book-lovers will ache over Shankho Chaudhuri’s set of shelves and stacks). The framing is as little explored as the rest of the show’s ideas – why is Scottie there in the first place? – but does allow for a moving performance from Lauren Ward, as she interacts with her parents at various ages.View image in fullscreenBook-lovers’ delight … Shankho Chaudhuri’s set for Beautiful Little Fool.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBetween Mona Mansour’s book and Corneau’s corny and repetitive lyrics (“Trust is a funny thing / You have it one day and then it’s gone”) we never get more than a superficial drawing of the central couple. There’s no sense here of why they were so dazzling, or darkly troubled. David Hunter works to bring out F Scott’s mix of arrogance and insecurity, Amy Parker – who stepped in for Corneau on opening night – belts out Zelda’s emotions as a wall of lights bursts suddenly behind her, and there’s some tender romance to their Alabama meeting in One Night in July.But no melodies linger from the many ballads, and there is no sense of the spark or wit of these two wordsmiths colliding beyond a single waspish argument on the Riviera. The show steadfastly ignores Zelda’s mental health issues for the sake of its sudden, damn-the-patriarchy climax. Still, there’s not long to wait for the next Zelda musical –The Fitzgeralds of St Paulis scheduled for a New York launch this spring.AtSouthwark Playhouse Borough, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMusicalsF Scott FitzgeraldSouthwark PlayhousereviewsShareReuse this content"

His music is a kind of lo-fi but densely produced R&B, but his setup here is the stuff of electronic prog rock, with soundboards and decks, a vast array of synthesisers, a live kit, electric guitar and bass, a violin and backing vocals. That ambition is matched by the setlist: 21 songs in two hours played in quick succession.Opening with Big Mike’s, Another Baby! and Many Times, the new sandwiched with the old, Dijon plays the bedroom R&B of his debut album Absolutely with the experimental pop mindset of Baby. He blends influences to the point of whiplash: Scratching is King Krule meets Simon and Garfunkel, emphasised by a live banjo and tambourine.View image in fullscreenUnabashed in their passion … Dijon and his extensive band.Photograph: Laura Rose/The GuardianA run of seven songs in the middle – including The Dress – starts to feel mundane, with the exception of an Appalachian-sounding jig sung and played on violin by Sam Amidon following Annie. But after (Referee), smoke carpets the stage and the lights dim: the first real use of stagecraft. The guitarists take up synth pads, creating an eerie, futurist soundscape that swells and collapses in grungy chords: despite the instrumentation, this music is earthy and deep, and, on Rewind, passionate to the point of anger. The performance wakes up: TV Blues and Talk Down feature industrial sounds as rhythmic devices, phased and filtered without consistent hi-hat rhythms, forming an oozing, glutted sonic atmosphere.Yamaha, Automatic and Kindalove close the show like the end of a 1980s prom, mirrorball lights illuminating the starry-eyed crowd. But then a clarinettist plays over the encore track Rodeo Clown, the noise diminishing until all we hear is the voice of Dijon, lit by a single spotlight, in the now-familiar silhouette of him hanging off his mic.

The Dutch-British musician previously recorded as Someone, creating three albums in dream-pop shades, but her fourth – a rawer, richer affair, made alone in rural France – digs into ancestry, mortality and memory.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for The Lighthouse by Tessa Rose Jackson.The Lighthouse begins with its title track. Strums of perfect fifths, low moans of woodwind and thundering rumbles of percussion frame a journey towards a beacon at “high tide on a lonesome wind”. The death of one of Jackson’s two mothers when she was a teenager informs her lyrics here and elsewhere: in The Bricks That Make the Building, a sweet, psych-folk jewel which meditates on “the earth that feeds the garden / The breath that helps the child sing” and Gently Now, which begins in soft clouds of birdsong, then tackles how growing older can cosset the process of grief. Her approach to the subject is inquisitive, poetic and refreshing.Poppier production buoys this album’s spry limbs. Fear Bangs the Drum and Wild Geese play like confident cousins of singles by This Is the Kit or Aldous Harding, while Built to Collide, driven forward by percussive violin shivers and pacy drums, is catnip for radio. Jackson’s voice, assured but never smug, is captivating too, floating between delicacy and spirited sprechgesang. It’s most potent in simpler songs such as the piano-led Grace Notes, the final track Prizefighter, and the beautiful By Morning, led by an opening guitar melody that arrives like a Paul Simon classic. It’s a luminous rebirth.Also out this monthProduced by Philip Weinrobe (Big Thief, Adrianne Lenker), the fourth album by Irish folk bandYe Vagabonds, All Tied Together (River Lea), thrums with slow-burning, moving songs. Arresting characters pop out of the mists frequently, such as the “troubled teens and drag queens” of On Sitric Road, youths “swimming in a river of smoke and serotonin” in The Flood, and Mayfly’s “grey-eyed” Mary, who smiled when she didn’t think she was being watched, “like she had nothing left to hide”.Adam Weikert’s To Whom Ourselves We Owe (self-released) is an engagingly gutsy and noisy exploration of traditional songs: Farewell to the Green Man makes merry with a practice chanter and Thai gongs, while Greensleeves gets transported to eerie, barren landscapes on a musical saw. If you fancy even wilder boundary-pushing,Nomad War MachineandSusan Alcorn’s Contra Madre (self-released) mix the late pedal steel player’s talents, thrillingly, with death metal.Explore more on these topicsFolk musicFolk album of the monthreviewsShareReuse this content"

But a few songs into her new album, Vacancy, she makes it eminently clear that tradition and wildness can coexist, with fabulously sparky results: on Under the Moon, she describes a lover as “vicious / Like a werewolf / When you’re in it” and proceeds to howl “moooooooooon” as if she is in an old creature feature.View image in fullscreenVacancy, Lennox’s third album, is far and away her most fun, and if it isn’t quite as ingratiating as her 2022 Age/Sex/Location, it makes up for it with canny lyrics and an airy, open sound. Cool Down is a reggae/R&B hybrid that practically feels as if it is made ofaerogel, and which pairs its summery lightness with witty lyrics telling a guy to chill out. On Mobbin in DC, she pairs lounge-singer coolness with withering come-ons (“You know where I be / This ain’t calculus / No ChatGPT”), while the strutting Horoscope, with its hook of “That boy put the ho’ in ‘horoscope’,” is as surefire a future viral hit as I’ve ever heard.Much has been made of Lennox’s struggles in the industry – she has faced harassment from radio DJs and fought publicly with past labels – but the sheer ease with which she performs on Vacancy suggests there’s plenty of road ahead.Explore more on these topicsMusicR&Balbum reviewsShareReuse this content"

Their latest single Dance the Pain Away is the year’s first true banger, a dazzling sad-pop production that bursts through the January gloom, thrusts a spritzer in your hand and drags you to the dancefloor.The LA-based duo of Michelle Buzz and Lance Shipp know their way around a classic pop structure. Between them they’ve co-written for Katy Perry, Kylie Minogue, Britney Spears and Calvin Harris, but writing for established and relatively vanilla acts pushed their own work to the other end of the spectrum. They favour maximalism: the orchestra hit, thunderous stadium drums and lyrics that emote wildly in every direction.They may look as though they’ve been thrift shopping in every era since the 1700s, but their sound is distinctly mid-80s Britain, filled with the ghosts of West End Girls’ wavy synths, Smalltown Boy’s winding bass, Erasure’s knack for soaring crescendos. Yet none of their seven singles to date sound like a rip off: more a series of love letters. You do have to concede theycouldbe a label team’s meticulously constructed answer toChappell Roan, right down to the Elizabeth I eyebrows. But there are some things you can’t fake: these songs are as thrilling to hear as their saucy dress-up-box visuals are to watch.Kate SolomonThis week’s best new tracksView image in fullscreenWendy Eisenberg.Photograph: Eleanor PetryWendy Eisenberg – Meaning BusinessEver curious, nuanced and compassionate, the experimental New York guitarist strikes into new territory: straight-up countrified beauty, where jubilant fiddle meets Jason Molina-ish flashes of darkness as they contemplate identity’s impermanence.LSRemember Sports – NevermindFor anyone missing the crunchier side of Waxahatchee – or wanting more of what she did withSnocaps– this Philly band make perfectly wistful, twangy barnburners designed to tickle your indie-rock pleasure centres.LSAsake x Wizkid – IskolodoTwo of the biggest stars in African pop combine for a new EP, and Iskolodo is a highlight: a featherlight blend of classic Afrobeat, jazz piano, amapiano bass, ghostly salsa samples and gentle melodic chatter from the pair.BBTCharlotte Plank – Crybby BluePlank is one of the best vocalists in British dance; her Chemical Fashion was a great underrated gem of 2025.

For the 150th anniversary of the composer’s birth, the Heritage label has brushed off this 1980 BBC live broadcast from the Royal Albert Hall under Danish conductor Ole Schmidt, the fourth recording of the complete work to enter the catalogue.View image in fullscreenThe artwork for Havergal Brian: The Gothic.Written over eight years and completed in 1927, the work was inspired by the magnificence and eccentricities of the gothic age, Brian’s idiosyncratic response ranging from guileless melody to wickedly complex polyphony. The 35-minute part one is a persuasive three-movement symphony all on its own, but it’s the challenging, hour-long setting of the Te Deum that demands the listener’s concentrated attention. Influences include Bruckner, Berlioz and Sibelius.Schmidt marshals his 158 orchestral players and 560-strong chorus with a ringmaster’s assurance, the solo quartet crowned bythe late Jane Manning’s soaring soprano. Like Martyn Brabbins, who remains supreme in this work, he actually manages to “do” something with the piece, rather than merely keep matters under control. Sound is occasionally congested, but the conductor’s stimulating choices make this a fine alternative to Ondrej Lenárd’s Slovak account. John Pickard’s sleeve notes are illuminating.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicLondon Symphony OrchestrareviewsShareReuse this content"

Mary is not so much humble as devoted to her baby. The infant too shows need for her. It’s a heart-wrenching moment of real life and recognisable experience. This Venetian work was painted at a time when Italian artists were pioneering a new sensitivity to gestures and expression, giving art unprecedented emotional power. The cooler, more distant and regal figures of early medieval art were giving way to psychological acuteness and passionate drama.

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.No? If the “Great Chieftan o’ the Puddin-race” were that delicious, we’d all be eating it all the time, surely? And yet Burns’Address to a Haggisis enticing enough to dispel any such doubts justoncea year. I especially like the bit about slitting it open so the bright entrails spill out: “And then, O what a glorious sight / Warm-reekin, rich!”The poem is, really, an argument against culinary snobbery, and in favour of a sensuous appreciation of the here and now. So it’s strange how, when it comes to scotch whisky – the traditional accompaniment to Burns Night feasting – something approaching the opposite attitude prevails. It wasn’t so long ago that single malt scotch – “as noble a product of Scotland as any burgundy or champagne is of France,” asthe Highlands writer Neil Gunnhad it – was, like haggis, little appreciated outside Scotland. However, over the past few decades, the style has rebounded so successfully that single malt (that is, whisky produced from malted barley in one distillery) is almost a luxury marque in itself. When Tom Hiddleston’s agent poses as a sleazy investor inThe Night Manager,this is the drink he demands. Distilleries such as theMacallanhave meanwhile leaned into the premium market with fashion collabs and elaborate packaging. Prices have inflated. Snobbery, too. And, along the way, a certain Burnsian gusto has been lost.Happily, a counter-trend is taking root, towards making Scotch fun and, dare I say it, affordable again. If you’re interested in liquid as opposed to label, I’d recommend seeking out independent bottlers – smaller operators who buy up casks from distilleries and age them in their own warehouses (with a bit of judicious Googling, it’s not so hard to figure out which prestigious distillery the liquidactuallycomes from, either). Indeed, it was these independent bottlers who helped create the demand for single malts in the days when distilleries mostly concentrated on blends.Then again, what’s wrong with blended whisky? For most of the 20th century, the most revered whiskies were blends of grain and malt from all corners of Scotland. The American John Glaser helped to revive interest in the category with hisCompass Box brand, newly available in Waitrose, and one of its early releases was pointedly calledThis Is Not a Luxury Whisky. Even more pointedly, Compass Box published the full recipe online, incurring the wrath ofthe Scotch Whisky Associationin the process.The point is, Scotch is a wonderful thing upon which “to deliberate thoughtfully”, as Gunn had it. But it’s also pretty fun just necking it with mates, lobbing it into a shaker or, my personal fave, mixing it with coconut water (try it!). There’s plenty to keep you going, all year round.Four great modern scotchesCompass Box Orchard House£42 (700ml) Waitrose, 46%. A cheerful whisky!

True to its origins, my version uses salted butter, with an added pinch of flaky salt to sharpen the flavour. It also takes a small detour from tradition: a slick of marmalade brings a fragrant bitterness, while a handful of ground almonds softens the overall richness and lends a tender crumb. The result is still buttery and luxurious, but with a brighter, more aromatic edge.Breton butter cake with marmaladeBrief stints in the freezer help firm up the dough between layers, making it easier to spread the marmalade without disturbing the base.Prep5 minCook1 hr 15 minFreeze30 minServes10-12For the butter cake180g room-temperature salted butter, plus extra for greasing150g caster sugarFinely grated zest of 1 orangeSeeds from ½ vanilla bean pod4 large egg yolks200g plain flour60g ground almonds½ tsp flaky sea salt160g marmaladeFor the glaze1 egg yolk1 tsp milk or creamA pinch of saltGrease the base and sides of a 20cm round cake tin with a removable base. Put the butter, sugar, orange zest and vanilla in the bowl of an electric mixer, then beat with the paddle on medium speed for about two minutes, until creamy. Add the egg yolks one at a time, beating to incorporate each one fully before adding the next.Sift the flour into a small bowl, then stir in the ground almonds and salt. With the mixer on low, add these dry ingredients in three or four instalments to the wet ingredients in the mixer until it comes together into a dough that’s somewhere between a cake batter and cookie dough.Spread half the dough (about 300g) evenly over the base of the cake tin (a small offset spatula would be useful here), then freeze for 15 minutes, or until just firm.Dollop the marmalade on top of the frozen dough, then spread it out into an even layer, leaving a 1cm border all around. Freeze again for 15 minutes, then carefully place spoonfuls of the remaining batter on top. Spread these out into an even layer that completely covers the marmalade, then put in the fridge.Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/350F/gas 4. When the oven is at temperature, make the glaze. Beat the egg yolk, milk (or cream) and salt in a small bowl, then brush evenly over the top of the cake. Score a cross-hatch pattern on top by dragging a fork across the surface: start with three sets of parallel lines, then rotate the tin slightly and repeat.Bake for 45 minutes, until golden brown and shiny on top. Transfer to a rack to cool, then release the cake from the tin. Cut into small slices and serve with strong coffee.Explore more on these topicsCakeThe sweet spotFoodFrench food and drinkDessertBakingFruitEggsrecipesShareReuse this content"

I’m pretty particular about citrus shelf life, too, so always squeeze it fresh and never keep it overnight or, heaven forbid, even longer.BumblebeeServes1For the honey and ginger syrup20g gingerAbout 40ml English honey– ideally one that’s local to youFor the drink10ml honey and ginger syrup– see above and method20ml fresh lemon juice40ml London dry gin– we useHayman’s1 thick slice lemon(about ½cm thick), to garnishFirst make the syrup. Soak the ginger in just enough cold water to cover (this softens the skin and makes it easier to peel), then drain, peel with a teaspoon and slice into fairly thin coins. Blend with 20ml water, then strain through a fine sieve, ideally lined with muslin. Measure the resulting ginger liquid (you should end up with about 40ml), then add equal parts honey and stir to dissolve.To build the drink, put the syrup and lemon juice in a shaker half-filled with ice, add the gin and shake as hard as you can.
