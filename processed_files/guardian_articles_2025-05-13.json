Don’t they know not to look a wooden gift horse in the mouth?Tue 13 May 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 14.03 EDTShareIf you’re familiar with your folklore, you’ll know the story ofThe Emperor’s New Plane, in which some barely-even-wily out-of-towners turn up with an offer to give a vain and selfish leader a new $400m Boeing 747-8. The merits of accepting this “flying palace” are invisible only to those who are stupid or incompetent, which means the emperor would literally be an idiot not to take it, right?Right? And so it is that Donald Trump is STUNNED that anyone could be so dumb as to not think he should accept the offer of a state-of-the-art griftliner from the Qatari royal family. This willsupposedly becomeAir Force One, with that other candelabra-free dumpster presumably pensioned off to ferry someone tasteless and irrelevant. (Eric Trump?)Then, when the second Trump imperium finishes – and please be assured that a guy who would take a freebie plane off a petrostate autocrat could not possibly have any more respect for the two-term constitutional limit – the plane will be transferred to Trump’s presidential library and become his personal property. Trump calls this entire deal with a foreign government “very transparent” – and I think we can probably agree on that. You’d have to be wearing a lead blindfold not to see right through it. In many ways the most opaque thing about it is the notion that Trump is even planning a presidential library. I thought he kept all his most precious papers behind a shower curtain or stacked next to the toilet in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom that a realtor might describe as “a wonderful opportunity for updating”. In this reading, the term “presidential library” simply functions as one of those twee euphemisms for the guest loo. “I wonder if you could show me to the presidential library?”Anyway, Trump’s inclination to accept a freebie plane from a foreign state has even given pause to some of hisMaga faithful. There are suggestions that his endless promises to drain the swamp are in fact not delivered on by instead flying over the swamp in a lavishly appointed $400m sleazemobile.Meanwhile, because his opponents still feel they have to go through the motions of the old world, of the bygone American century, a number of leading critics have issued appalled statements. And clearly, the president should beware Qataris bearing gifts. Yet the fact is he can’t help himself. Literally the only reason you wouldn’t be able to wheel a giant wooden horse straight through the security gates of the White House without even having to scan it is that Trump only likes elaborate repro gilt, and would find this particular equine aesthetic too hideously rough-hewn and low-key.The weird thing about the luxury jumbo jet is that it isn’t even the most eye-catching present to Trump we’ve got a look at in the past month alone. That honour probably belongs to the portrait sent to the president by Vladimir Putin, which, its Russian artistrecently revealed, Putin had personally told him was a vital step in repairing Russia’s relationship with the US. Again, because people can’t see a nice gesture from an expansionist autocrat without having to read something deep into it that simply isn’t there … there has been a certain amount of consternation that Trump would accept a portrait from Putin.But is it not just possible that the Russian president, a former KGB officer, simply knows the perfect gift? He’s like the Martha Stewart of strings-attached flattery. As for how he knows the ideal present … maybe the clues were there all along, for those who are cold-blooded enough to spot them.Alas, now Trump is back in office, there are six news cycles/shit-floodings of the zone per day, meaning it is incredibly easy to forget that on the day when it emerged that his defence secretary had discussed operational details of a bombing raid in Yemen in a group chat, then added some journalist rando to it, we also learned about 20 other nutty things. One of these was that the president hadlost his mindabout what he perceived as a mildly unflattering portrait of him in the Colorado state legislature.Like I say, you can’t keep up with it all. But friends notice these things on behalf of friends, and in retrospect, while everyone else was droning on about the Houthi raid security breach, you suspect that this was the exact momentVladimir Putindecided to commission a portrait that his buddy WOULD like. Certainly, it wasn’t long before an oil rendering of Trump punching the air after the assassination attempt on him last July was winging its way from Moscow to the United States. Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, described it as a “beautiful portrait” and said the president was “clearly touched by it”. Yes, touched in his special place – his vanity.For many, it’s becoming hard not to think that Trump is being played by his gifters. Imagine if you had petrostate money, and all you needed to spend to have the president of the United States fly around openly advertising his own corruption was $400m. It’s insanely cheap at the price.Except, at the same time, it’s increasingly hard to experience the feeling of outrage at Trump’s behaviour as much more than the occasional twitch of a phantom limb. This, of course, is because the most useful thing Trump was ever gifted, possibly by a fairy at his christening, is the 21st century’s greatest superpower. Namely, a complete inability to feel shame. Almost nothing is more valuable, certainly not a mere $400m plane or a bad-art portrait. It would be good to think the emperor was naked – but unfortunately, only his corruption is.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionQatarTrump administrationVladimir PutincommentShareReuse this content"

A quiet room reminds her too much of the police cell she was locked into just hours after undergoing a traumatic stillbirth.Arrested in hospital by uniformed officers while still recovering from surgery, she was accused of carrying out an illegal abortion. It took four-and-a-half years for her case to come to court, where last week she wasunanimously cleared by a jury.Packer, 45, was charged with “unlawfully administering to herself a poison or other noxious thing” with the “intent to procure a miscarriage”, after taking abortion pills prescribed to her by a registered provider during the November 2020 Covid lockdown.Under emergency legislation introduced during the pandemic – and later made permanent – medication could be dispatched by post for pregnancies up to 10 weeks’ gestation.Packer went on to deliver a foetus estimated to be about 26 weeks’ gestation. The prosecution had claimed she had known she was more than 10 weeks pregnant when she took the pills; an allegation Packer has always denied.The case of Nicola Packer tells us this: Britain is shamed by its abortion laws – and must change them | Jonathan LordRead moreShe may have been found not guilty, but Packer knows she will never be the same; she is nervous of seeking medical help now.At her trial, the prosecution tried to claim she was lying when she said she did not initially tell medical staff (who went on to call in police) that she had taken abortion pills because she was afraid it would affect the quality of care she received.“But they didn’t really help me, did they?” she says. “So I think I was right to be frightened.”And she no longer trusts the police – when her phone died, and she needed help, she asked the drunk man outside a London station for directions, rather than a police officer.She also knows she has not yet fully processed the enormity of what happened to her. Just days after the verdict “I’m still running on adrenaline”, she says. But she is seeking answers from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Met police as to how she got here.“There are other ways that it could have been handled after I’d been in hospital,” she says. “I could have been sent home to recuperate. There was no legal need for me to be taken straight to a police station.”“It was absolutely horrific to get to from the hospital to Charing Cross police station,” she added. With no cars available, she was put in the back of the police van, and “I had to sit basically on a plank of wood, with no seatbelts on it, driving around London like that.” In custody, she was not given her anti-clotting medication on time, told it was “not a priority”.“I was still in pain, I was extremely tired, I felt very weak and mentally, just did not really understand what was going on,” she said.The prosecution clouded her life for almost half a decade. “I kept doing things, but you’re not fully present in the moment,” she says.She spent tens of thousands of pounds on her defence. A crowdfunder helped to meet at least some of her costs. “I read all [the comments] several times,” she says. “I was reading them in the run-up and during the trial as well. There are so many people out there that don’t believe this should be happening, there’s so much support.”Years before her case ever reached Isleworth crown court, Packer’s barrister, Fiona Horlick KC, asked her what she was most of afraid of.“I’m most scared going to prison,” she says. The next worst thing, was “the trial, just giving evidence and having to be speaking in front of all these people”.View image in fullscreenThe jury unanimously found Packer not guilty after six hours of deliberations: ‘It was just wonderful to get that verdict.’Photograph: Jill Mead/The GuardianShe knew she had the option to plead guilty, but she did not consider it for more than a “split second”, she says. “I couldn’t have looked at myself doing that, because it wasn’t true.”While she waited for her case to come to court, she saw another woman, Carla Foster, convicted of, and jailed for, an illegal abortion before her sentence was suspended by the appeal court.“I was really angry, angry that she had to go through this,” Packer says. “She spent 35 days in prison. Why? Who did that help? What was the point? There was no point in sending her to prison, and then you have to think about the impact on the rest of her life.”But the case also brought home the reality of what she was herself facing, and she began asking questions she had never imagined having to contemplate. “How do I prepare for the worst outcome?” she says. “Do I rent my flat out and cancel Netflix? What do I do? I don’t know. I’ve never been in this situation before.”“The rational part of your brain can tell you it’s unlikely to happen, but then the other part … it still could happen,” she adds. “So it’s a horrible thing to live under, and the fact that it comes with a potential life [sentence] in prison.”When Packer’s trial finally came around at the end of April, the prosecution opening including details of her sex life, which included her being part of BDSM communities.“It was completely unnecessary, and it was just done to make me look bad,” she says. “And potentially you’re dealing with something that people may never have heard of, wouldn’t understand, may have a bad opinion of. It was completely not needed.”At one point, Packer was forced to sit in court while lawyers discussed the size of her nipples with the judge. Intimate photographs of her were shown to the jury; evidence of her flat stomach.“It was quite humiliating,” she says. “I didn’t want anybody to see those photos, but I knew that it was for my own good.“We hid what we could, but because my nipples were such a hot topic, we couldn’t blank them out in pictures,” she says. “It’s not nice knowing that people have seen such intimate pictures of you.”“It was horrendous giving evidence, absolutely awful,” she says. “It was very upsetting, I spent most of the time crying while I was doing it, but I got through it because I knew that I was right.”And the jury agreed, finding her not guilty after about six hours of deliberations.“It was just wonderful to get that verdict,” she said. “I just feel that although the last four and a half years been absolutely horrific, I don’t know if I could say at the moment it was worth it, but to have that validation of being found unanimously not guilty by a jury of my peers, it’s an amazing thing.”Having cleared her name, Packer is now throwing her weight behind the voices calling for a change in the law that would decriminalise abortion. A parliamentary vote is expected on the issue as early as this summer.“I do hope that the law does get changed – it should do,” she said. “Abortion is healthcare. It should not be treated as anything other than that.”A CPS spokesperson said: “We recognise the profound strength of feeling these cases evoke, but have a duty to apply laws passed by parliament fairly and impartially.”But Packer says: “This could happen to anybody, I think that’s what’s really scary about it. With the law being as it is, a tragic accident and you’re up on trial, and it’s why the law needs to change.”Packer wants to make history as the last woman in England to be prosecuted for an abortion. She has heard of other women whose cases are in the early stages of the criminal justice system, and she wants to use her voice to ensure they never see the inside of a courtroom.“I can’t really say it was worth it,” she says, “but at least it would have meant something.”Aside from campaigning for legislative change, how does Packer plan to move on from this? “That is a very good question,” she says. “I do feel a bit like I need to find myself again.”While awaiting trial, she sought comfort in familiar music and television; she listened to the same albums from her favourite rock artists on repeat, rewatched her favourite series’ back-to-back. But she found she could no longer watch Orange Is The New Black.“I had to turn it off,” she says. “I couldn’t watch it any more because I started to get a really eerie feeling; this is set in a prison, I might go to a prison.”But, she adds: “I started re-watching it last night.”Explore more on these topicsAbortionWomenReproductive rightsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

As he takes over the Venice theatre biennale, the star lets us know what to expect: cut-up plays and a Pinocchio unlike any otherTue 13 May 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 11.53 EDTShareSitting in his house in Rome, an overstuffed bookcase and a distressed wooden door behind him,Willem Dafoescrunches his hair as though kneading the thoughts in his head. The 69-year-old, Wisconsin-born actor could pass today for any genial, bristle-moustached handyman in checked shirt and horn-rimmed specs. (Perhaps he even built the bookcase and distressed the door himself.) But it’s that hand that is the giveaway: it keeps scrunching as he talks until the hair is standing in jagged forks. As a visualisation of what is happening in his brain, it is second to none.We are speaking in April on the anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth (and death), which feels apt given that it is Dafoe’s two-year appointment as artistic director of the international theatre festival at theVenice Biennalethat has occasioned our video call today. He looks sheepish when I point out the significance of the date, then reverts to his usual wolfish expression. “Ah, Shakespeare doesn’t care,” he says with a wave of the hand. Dafoe has never had much of a relationship with those plays. “There’s a lot of pointing and indicating when people perform them. A lot of leading the audience. Those are things I don’t think are very vital. But it’s such beautiful writing, and I’ve become interested in doing Shakespeare in my dotage.” Could there be a Lear on the horizon? “Why not?” he says with a goofy wobble of the head.In one play, he stands in the sea dressed as a nun and brandishing a fishThere is no Shakespeare in Dafoe’s Biennale selection. The accent, in a programme entitled “Theatre is Body. Body is Poetry”, is firmly on the experimental and avant garde. There will be work directed by Thomas Ostermeier and Milo Rau. Davide Iodice will present a version of Pinocchio in which young autistic actors and actors with Down’s syndrome will bring to life assorted incarnations of the title character. Dafoe has also included the European premiere of Symphony of Rats by Richard Foreman, the experimental playwright who died in January, and whom he counted as a friend. Nearly 40 years after its first production, the play will be staged by the pioneering New York companythe Wooster Group, which Dafoe co-founded. “Richard told them, ‘Do whatever you want with it. But I don’t want to recognise it,’” he says admiringly.View image in fullscreenBy a nose … Davide Iodice’s Pinocchio.Photograph: Renato EspositoThe actor will take part in Foreman’s No Title, during which he and Simonetta Solder will read phrases from cards drawn at random in what sounds like a theatrical cousin of the Burroughsian cut-up technique. “Richard was a loose thinker,” he explains. “His responses were always unpredictable.” Dafoe is approaching his Venice tenure with the same sangfroid he witnessed in Foreman. “Some of these pieces will sail, some won’t. What’s important is people talking about stuff, feeling that the theatre is alive.”A four-time Oscar nominee, Dafoe has been a transfixing screen presence ever since his Kabuki-like turns in the early 1980s in Kathryn Bigelow’s fetishistic biker movie The Loveless and Walter Hill’s pulp fantasyStreets of Fire, where he sported black vinyl hip-waders, a ducktail hairdo and cheekbones that could win in a knife fight. He was the sergeant who perishes to the sound of Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings in Oliver Stone’s Platoon, then made the messiah crushingly human in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ. More recently he has appeared in films by Wes Anderson, Robert Eggers and Yorgos Lanthimos. In Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, he had his penis pulverised by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Well, it’s a living.His roots and his heart, however, belong to experimental theatre. Along with his former partner Elizabeth LeCompte, the monologuist Spalding Gray and others, Dafoe created the Wooster Group in the latter half of the 1970s from the ashes of Richard Schechner’s Performance Group. For nearly 30 years, Dafoe wrote, acted and helped build sets in the same converted factory in lower Manhattan that remains the group’s base today. He only drifted away in 2004 when he left LeCompte – with whom he has an adult son – and married the film-maker Giada Colagrande.Could those of us who have never seen him live on stage truly be said to “get” who he is as an actor? “I think I’ve given up on the idea of anyone getting me,” he admits. “I probably had it when I was younger. Now I like the idea of every project redefining you.”He pitched up in New York at 22, fresh from another experimental group, Milwaukee’sTheatreX. “I didn’t have anything up my sleeve. I was just a kid from the midwest going to the big, bad city. New York was rough then, but I saw these people who were making things outside of any commercial system. They stirred something in me intellectually, emotionally, romantically. That’s what I went towards. I made myself available to them and they liked that sense of availability. I started working very modestly, doing small parts and being a carpenter. Then Spalding invited me to work on the creation of a piece called Point Judith.”Nothing short of a time machine could return us to the intoxicating heyday of New York’s fringe theatre scene, but there are mouth-watering titbits available online showing Dafoe at work in pieces stretching back to the late 1970s. The clips don’t seem too far from his more berserk screen creations, such as the sleazy crook Bobby Peru, rotten of mind and tooth, in David Lynch’sWild at Heart, or the feverish seadog with a Popeye pipe in Eggers’ The Lighthouse. Aclip from Point Judith, for instance, shows Dafoe standing in the sea dressed as a nun while brandishing a fish. “Well yeah, that was a small part of it,” he concedes, perhaps eager not to have decades of intrepid theatrical adventures reduced to a trout and a wimple.Skip forward to the group’s 1991 showToday I Must Sincerely Congratulate You, and this time he is wearing a suit and a moptop like an early-1960s Beatle, and once again holding a dead fish. What gives? “I’m in to fish,” he shrugs. “So there.”View image in fullscreenDefinitely not Mr Bean’s Holiday … Dafoe with the Wooster Group in 2002.Photograph: Tristram KentonThe concept of a Wooster Group piece being “ready” was always elastic. The company would simply rehearse throughout the day and perform whatever they had that evening. The headline to a 2020 Harper’s article summed up the philosophy nicely: “The 40-Year Rehearsal: The Wooster Group’s endless work in progress.” Film was often incorporated into the shows, along with prerecorded audio to which the cast would sometimes lip-sync. The material featured unlikely bedfellows: Flaubert and Lenny Bruce, say, or a soap opera version of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town coupled with the vaudevillian skits of the African American comic Pigmeat Markham.Acclaim was not universal. Arthur Miller refused to permit the group to perform part ofThe Cruciblein their show LSD, but they carried on anyway until he threatened legal action. The estates of Harold Pinter and Tennessee Williams also withdrew permission. Brickbats rained down from critics, Dafoe tells me. “We were given a hard time. Eventually we found that word-of-mouth was better than a snarky review in the Village Voice, so Liz, in her infinite wisdom, stopped allowing the critics in. Once we started to have some appreciation in Europe, the New York critics began asking to come. This time they were more generous with how they placed us in the landscape.”The Wooster Group’s influence today is ubiquitous. Take the use of microphones in Ostermeier’s work, including his recent, vital production ofThe Seagullwith Cate Blanchett. “Yeah, the microphones were a thing we did that I started seeing crop up a lot,” Dafoe agrees. “We started out working somewhat in isolation. Once we started touring, we’d come back to places and say, ‘Wow,thatlooks familiar.’ I don’t mean that in a snotty way – it’s how things work. People came through as interns and then 10 years later they would be Broadway directors.”View image in fullscreenCheekbones that could win in a knife fight … Dafoe in The Loveless (1981).Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyAnyone who has seen productions byComplicitéwill have witnessed the Wooster effect. “Simon McBurney’s a friend, and definitely he saw the work. He’s a sponge.” McBurney was also one of the writers on Mr Bean’s Holiday, in which Dafoe plays a pretentious arthouse director whose Cannes premiere is hijacked by Rowan Atkinson’s slapstick hero. “Simon directed the film-makers toward me, so I can thank him for that particular experience,” Dafoe laughs. The traffic flows both ways: he in turn suggested McBurney for roles in Abel Ferrara’s Siberia and Eggers’ recent Nosferatu, neither of them half as much fun as Mr Bean.Dafoe is diplomatic today about whether he prefers acting for theatre or cinema. “Musicians are musicians – sometimes they play in the studio and sometimes they play live.” But evidently it is the stage that unlocks his deepest passion. “What you’re seeing isn’t going to happen again at nine o’clock, eleven o’clock. Something beautiful in the theatre stays with you for ever, because it happened toyou. Theatre puts your feet to the fire, it puts your finger in the wound.” The hand has stopped scrunching now. “And you can’t beat that.”TheVenice theatre biennale, directed by Willem Dafoe, runs from 31 May to 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreWillem DafoeVenice BiennalefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now they want us to see their products as trustworthy collaboratorsVauhini VaraTue 13 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 13.08 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Mathieu Labrecque/The GuardianAfter publishing my third book in early April, I kept encountering headlines that made me feel like the protagonist of some Black Mirrorepisode. “Vauhini Vara consultedChatGPTto help craft her new book ‘Searches,’” one of themread. “To tell her own story, this acclaimed novelist turned to ChatGPT,” saidanother. “Vauhini Vara examines selfhood with assistance from ChatGPT,” went athird.The publications describingSearchesthis way were reputable and fact-based. But their descriptions of my book – and of ChatGPT’s role in it – didn’t match my own reading. It was true that I had put my ChatGPT conversations in the book, but my goal had been critique, not collaboration. In interviews and public events, I had repeatedly cautioned against usinglarge language modelssuch as the ones behind ChatGPT for help with self-expression. Had these headline writers misunderstood what I’d written? Had I?In the book, I chronicle how big technology companies have exploited human language for their gain. We let this happen, I argue, because we also benefit somewhat from using the products. It’s a dynamic that makes us complicit in big tech’s accumulation of wealth and power: we’re both victims and beneficiaries. I describe this complicity, but I also enact it, through my own internet archives: my Google searches, my Amazon product reviews and, yes, myChatGPTdialogues.The polite politics of AIHow an embarrassing U-turn exposed a concerning truth about ChatGPT | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreThe book opens with epigraphs from Audre Lorde and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o evoking the political power of language, followed by the beginning of a conversation in which I ask ChatGPT to respond to my writing. The juxtaposition is deliberate: I planned to get its feedback on a series of chapters I’d written to see how the exercise would reveal the politics of both my language use and ChatGPT’s.My tone was polite, even timid: “I’m nervous,” I claimed.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, tells us its product is built to be good at following instructions, andsome research suggeststhat ChatGPT is most obedient when we act nice to it. I couched my own requests in good manners. When it complimented me, I sweetly thanked it; when I pointed out its factual errors, I kept any judgment out of my tone.ChatGPT was likewise polite by design. People often describe chatbots’ textual output as “bland” or “generic” – the linguistic equivalent of a beige office building. OpenAI’s products are built to “sound like a colleague”, as OpenAIputs it, using language that, coming from a person, would sound “polite”, “empathetic”, “kind”, “rationally optimistic” and “engaging”, among other qualities. OpenAI describes these strategies as helping its products seem “professional” and “approachable”. This appears to be bound up with making us feel safe: “ChatGPT’s default personality deeply affects the way you experience and trust it,”OpenAI recently explainedin a blogpost explaining the rollback of an update that had made ChatGPT sound creepily sycophantic.Trust is a challenge forartificial intelligence(AI) companies, partly because their products regularly produce falsehoods and reifysexist,racist, US-centric cultural norms. While the companies are working on these problems, they persist: OpenAI found that its latest systems generate errors at ahigher ratethan its previous system. In the book, I wrote about the inaccuracies and biases and also demonstrated them with the products. When I prompted Microsoft’s Bing Image Creator to produce a picture of engineers and space explorers, it gave me an entirely male cast of characters; when my father asked ChatGPT to edit his writing, it transmuted his perfectly correct Indian English into American English. Those weren’t flukes. Research suggests thatboth tendenciesare widespread.In my own ChatGPT dialogues, I wanted to enact how the product’s veneer of collegial neutrality could lull us into absorbing false or biased responses without much critical engagement. Over time, ChatGPT seemed to be guiding me to write a more positive book about big tech – including editing my description of OpenAI’s CEO,Sam Altman, to call him “a visionary and a pragmatist”. I’m not aware of research on whether ChatGPT tends to favor big tech, OpenAI or Altman, and I can only guess why it seemed that way in our conversation. OpenAI explicitly states that its products shouldn’t attempt to influence users’ thinking. When I asked ChatGPT about some of the issues, it blamed biases in its training data – though I suspect my arguably leading questions played a role too.When I queried ChatGPT about its rhetoric, it responded: “The way I communicate is designed to foster trust and confidence in my responses, which can be both helpful and potentially misleading.”Still, by the end of the dialogue, ChatGPT was proposing an ending to my book in which Altman tells me: “AI can give us tools to explore our humanity in ways we never imagined. It’s up to us to use them wisely.” Altman never said this to me, though it tracks with a common talking point emphasizing our responsibilities over AI products’ shortcomings.‘Don’t ask what AI can do for us, ask what it is doing to us’: are ChatGPT and co harming human intelligence?Read moreI felt my point had been made: ChatGPT’s epilogue was both false and biased. I gracefully exited the chat. I had – I thought – won.I thought I was critiquing the machine. Headlines described me as working with itThen came the headlines (and, in some cases, articles or reviews referring to my use of ChatGPT as an aid in self-expression). People were also asking about my so-called collaboration with ChatGPT in interviews and at public appearances. Each time, I rejected the premise, referring to the Cambridge Dictionary definition of a collaboration: “the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.” No matter how human-like its rhetoric seemed, ChatGPT was not a person – it was incapable of either working with me or sharing my goals.OpenAI has its own goals, of course. Among them, it emphasizes wanting to build AI that “benefits all of humanity”. But while the company iscontrolled by a non-profitwith that mission, its funders still seek a return on their investment. That will presumably require getting people using products such as ChatGPT even more than they already are – a goal that is easier to accomplish if people see those products as trustworthy collaborators. Last year, AltmanenvisionedAI behaving as a “super-competent colleague that knows absolutely everything about my whole life”. In aTed interviewthis April, he suggested this could even function at the societal level: “I think AI can help us be wiser and make better collective governance decisions than we could before.” By this month, he wastestifyingat a US Senate hearing about the hypothetical benefits of having “an agent in your pocket fully integrated with the United States government”.Reading the headlines that seemed to echo Altman, my first instinct was to blame the headline writers’ thirst for something sexy to tantalize readers (or, in any case, the algorithms that increasingly determine what readers see). My second instinct was to blame the companies behind the algorithms, including the AI companies whose chatbots are trained onpublished material. When I asked ChatGPT about well-known recent books that are “AI collaborations”, it named mine, citing a few of the reviews whose headlines had bothered me.I went back to my book to see if maybe I’d inadvertently referred to collaboration myself. At first it seemed like I had. I found 30 instances of words such as “collaboration” and “collaborating”. Of those, though, 25 came from ChatGPT, in the interstitial dialogues, often describing the relationship between people and AI products. None of the other five were references to AI “collaboration” except when I was quoting someone else or being ironic: I asked, for example, about the fate ChatGPT expected for “writers who refuse to collaborate with AI”.Was I an accomplice to AI companies?But did it matter that I mostly hadn’t been the one using the term? It occurred to me that those talking about my ChatGPT “collaboration” might have gotten the idea from my book even if I hadn’t put it there. What had made me so sure that the only effect of printing ChatGPT’s rhetoric would be to reveal its insidiousness? How hadn’t I imagined that at least some readers might be convinced by ChatGPT’s position? Maybe my book had been more of a collaboration than I had realized – not because an AI product had helped me express myself, but because I had helped the companies behind these products with their own goals. My book concerns how those in power exploit our language to their benefit – and about our complicity in this. Now, it seemed, the public life of my book was itself caught up in this dynamic. It was a chilling experience, but I should have anticipated it: of course there was no reason my book should be exempt from an exploitation that has taken over the globe.Better at everything: how AI could make human beings irrelevantRead moreAnd yet, my book was also about the way in which we can – and do – use language to serve our own purposes, independent from, and indeed in opposition to, the goals of the powerful. While ChatGPT proposed that I close with a quote from Altman, I instead picked one from Ursula K Le Guin: “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words.” I wondered aloud where we might go from here: how might we get our governments to meaningfully rein in big tech wealth and power? How might we fund and build technologies so that they serve our needs and desires without being bound up in exploitation?I’d imagined that my rhetorical power struggle against big tech had begun and ended within the pages of my book. It clearly hadn’t. If the headlines I read represented the actual end of the struggle, it would mean I had lost. And yet, I soon also started hearing from readers who said the book had made them feel complicit in big tech’s rise and moved to act in response to this feeling. Several had canceled their Amazon Prime subscriptions; one stopped soliciting intimate personal advice from ChatGPT. The struggle is ongoing. Collaboration will be required – among human beings."

That was what really got to people. Even Nigel Farage said he would have dialled it down a bit. We were at risk of becomingan island of strangers, said Keir Starmer. Going out of the front door had become a high-risk endeavour. Too many foreigners you might meet on the street. Them and their funny languages. Coming over here, working for the NHS, paying their taxes. Whatever next?Incalculable. That was the damage immigrants had caused. And Keir should know. Because he had spent days – make that weeks – trying to calculate it. And he had had to give up, because the foreigners had made it far too difficult for him to reach a figure. That’s the thing with foreigners. Always trying to shift the goalposts. But if Starmer knew one thing, it was that this country was going to the dogs. And he knew precisely who was to blame.The fallout had been predictable. Left-leaning media had picked up on the echoes of the “strangers in their own country” line from Enoch Powell’s “rivers of blood” speech. A level of nastiness about immigrants that had previously only been the preserve of the hard right. Now it was open season. Want to give foreigners a good kicking? Then step this way. The rightwing papers had taken the opposite line: Starmer hadn’t been nearly unpleasant enough. He didn’t really mean what he had said. Was just trying it on, to fool a few of the dimmer Reform voters. A man not to be trusted.You can take this one of two ways. Either by managing to piss off the left and the right, Starmer had played a blinder, finding a halfway ground that would sit comfortably with a large section of the population. Or he had screwed it up completely, failing to think through how his language might be interpreted. Or worse, had just assumed that it would be fine. That the entire country would be happy with it. In which case the No 10 comms team needs an overhaul.On the morning after the day before, it was left to the home secretary,Yvette Cooper, to pick up the pieces as she toured the broadcast media studios. Trying to spin the unspinnable. That the prime minister had meant everything he had said, apart from the bits he hadn’t meant to be said. It was all the media’s fault for taking Keir at his word. Serious journalists should know that he talked only in hyperbole.Nick Robinson opened the interview with Cooper on the Today programme by playing two clips of Starmer talking. The first from 2020, in which he said he welcomed migrants and that they were not to blame for failing public services. The second from Monday. Which was the real Keir?Yvette often looks as if she’s about to lose it these days. It’s a fate that befalls every home secretary after they’ve been in the job for nearly a year. It comes of realising you have been given a role at which you can only learn to fail better. There are few winners to have emerged from the Home Office. It’s just bad days and even worse days. And this was one of the even worse days. Cooper looked as if she would dearly love to be doing serious damage to something.It was like this, said Yvette. Both statements were the real Keir. There was no difference between the two polar opposites. The BBC was just trying to stoke up a problem where none existed. Keir did really, really like immigrants. But only the ones – well some of them – who had been living and working in the country for a number of years. They were the good foreigners. But he really, really had it in for all other migrants who were trying to come to the UK now. They were bad foreigners. Really bad foreigners. Put like that, who was to argue?We then got into the semantics of an “island of strangers”. Cooper insisted itshouldn’t be confused with the Powell speech, because Enoch’s use of strangers had been entirely different even though it had been identical. At which point Robinson took pity on her. Rather than twisting the knife, he concluded that the language problem was one that had been generated by some halfwit in No 10. Who was now insisting that black was white. Besides, he had better things to do than pursue Yvette for something she hadn’t said.Not that the rest of the interview went much better. Because basically, Yvette and Starmer are as one on immigration. If they see one more foreigner, it will be too many. Nothing against foreigners, mind. Just enough is enough. The acceptable face of xenophobia. A large number of Britons were fed up with foreigners, and who was she to disagree? Besides, it was all for their own good. She didn’t want foreigners coming over here to do jobs the Britons refuse to do, only to be exploited because their English was a bit crap. Much better to leave the job vacancies unfilled.On the care sector, Cooper couldn’t have been more incoherent if she’d tried. She was going to increase the pay for the social care jobs no one wanted, but couldn’t say who was going to fund the extra costs. It looked very much as if either the councils would be picking up the tab and cutting other services or that elderly people and those with dementia would have to fork out. And if some of them couldn’t afford it, then it was their own fault for having Alzheimer’s. If there’s one thing worse than a foreigner trying to get a job in the care sector it’s a Briton who is a burden on the state.We ended with Robinson observing that the measures put forward would cut immigration by only 100,000 at most, leaving inward migration still around the 300,000 mark. Way higher thanLabour, Tories or Reform wanted. Yvette hummed and hawed. She would need to go further and faster. Internment camps. Arbitrary roundups of undesirables. Keep England for the English. Nothing was off-limits.Still, even if Cooper was having a tough morning, there were others who were leading their best lives. Meet Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, who was appearing before the Defra select committee. Chris was asked to justify taking a £195,000 bonus just three months after taking up the job. “Because I’m worth it,” he cooed. The swimming pool and the tennis court weren’t going to pay for themselves. Nice work if you can get it.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumThe politics sketchKeir StarmerYvette CooperLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

The Celebrity Traitors lineup has landed at last. Here’s who will win … and who will bombStuart HeritageTue 13 May 2025 14.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 14.02 EDTShareThis autumn sees the release of Celebrity Traitors, a new edition of the beloved BBC reality show starring a fleet of household names. It’s a risky move for all who signed up, in that the show has the potential to seriously warp how they’re viewed by the public for years to come. But who will flounder and who will flourish? Here’s the Celebrity Traitors lineup in full, ranked in reverse order of their likely success.19. Tom DaleyAn athlete with a spectacular career, Daley will do terribly onThe Traitors. Look at the British Gas adverts he’s been doing. He is genuinely the worst actor who has ever lived. Give him a secret to keep and the poor guy is going to implode.18. Charlotte ChurchTwo things will happen here. Either Church will talk too much and give herself away, or she’ll force everyone to participate in a sound bath and they’ll vote her off out of spite.17. Jonathan RossIt’s great that Ross is back on the BBC. It’s less great that his comeback will be on a reality show where he’ll last three episodes max for being a gobby know-it-all.16. Stephen FryOn one hand, Stephen Fry is a very clever man. On the other, The Traitors is absolutely not a format that rewards intellectualism. Paranoia? Yes. Unfounded hunches? Of course. Abject screaming? Bring it on. But I fear Fry might be out of his depth here.15. Niko OmilanaA content creator best known for running in elections, Omilana is an unknown quantity. His success on Celebrity Traitors depends exclusively on his ability to penetrate the potentially suffocating chumminess of the other contestants.14. Alan CarrCarr had a show called Chatty Man, which leads me to believe that he’s going to gossip wildly about everyone, then act surprised when people call him out for it.13. Ruth CoddThe actor who is about to star in the How to Train Your Dragon remake, Codd has the most to lose by behaving like an idiot on a reality show. The smart money is on her playing it safe and disappearing into mid-table anonymity.12. Joe MarlerA rugby player turned social media star, Marler has the sort of huge presence that makes him stand out in any situation. This will make him an early target for unsure contestants, and his survival will depend on how hard he can argue his way out of trouble.11. Paloma FaithOn paper, Faith is the perfect Traitors contestant, in that she’s extremely personable, while also being quite annoying. However, she’s up against some big hitters here. Can she take them out early enough to succeed?10. Cat BurnsBurns is a singer with the best days of her career to come. So why is she here? She can’t showcase her skill. She can’t fall back on a public persona. My only guess is that she is here because she loves the drama. This makes her a dangerous proposition.9. Lucy BeaumontIf you saw her on Taskmaster, you’ll know the central question about Beaumont is: “Is she really like that all the time?” A show like Traitors leaves no room to hide, so this is the perfect opportunity to discover if she’s a charming scatterbrain or simply a calculating agent of deliberate chaos.8. David OlusogaA renowned historian, Olusoga is better known for the things he knows than the person he is. As such, he’s a total mystery. He could be a detached chess player, but equally he may be the sort of person to have a fizzing melodramatic eruption whenever he thinks people are picking on him. Who knows?7. Nick MohammedMohammed is an interesting addition to the lineup. He seems extremely nice, but something behind his eyes suggests a level of trickery that cannot be discounted. If anyone is going to pull an unexpected heel turn here, it’s him.6. Celia ImrieEvery edition of The Traitors needs a lovely older female presence, and that’s exactly what Imrie is. The fact that she’s the nearest thing to a national treasure in the lineup will only make her more popular.5. Kate GarrawayI don’t think for a second that she’ll use the more tragic aspects of her recent history to garner favour from the others, but, at the same time, who on earth would think about voting Garraway out? Only an absolute monster, that’s who.4. Clare BaldingBalding has always had something of the pantomime villain about her. Expect her to craft such a web of lies and deceit in the castle that she ends up playing her fellow contestants like witless puppets.3. Tameka EmpsonThe biggest wildcard of the lineup. Worst-case scenario is that Empson showboats and gets booted off early, like Armani in the last series. Best-case is that the actor bamboozles everyone to victory. I’m leaning towards the latter.2. Mark BonnarA Scottish actor who manages the tricky balancing act of coming off as incredibly intense and untrustworthy, despite being a perfectly nice man. If he can harness this juxtaposition, pulling friends into his orbit while intimidating all his foes, he’s bound to reach the final.1. Joe WilkinsonOne of the most deadpan men to walk the earth, Wilkinson is not someone who readily gives much away. Of anyone in this group, he looks the best equipped to absorb secrets. On a show like The Traitors, this is an invaluable skill. He’ll go far.Explore more on these topicsThe TraitorsTelevisionfeaturesShareReuse this content"

And we should do our part. Sensibly approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy, speaking to a small group of journalists, including the Guardian, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv.Zelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Thursday whether or not Putin flew in for talks.Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if the Russian leader showed up. “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.Previously, after Putin used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul, Zelenskyy responded by saying he would be waiting for Putin personally in Turkey on Thursday.Trump, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, appeared to float the idea of a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy,sayingon Monday: “I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over.”Zelenskyy said he was hoping Trump would indeed meet him in Turkey. “If Trump travels, it will push Putin also to travel,” he said. “Trump can really help. It’s the situation where the US being present can give important guarantees.”Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, also suggested the potential for a three-way summit. “This could be a really great meeting … We hope that President Putin will also come, and then President Trump will be there,” he told Fox News. Kellogg, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the envoy Steve Witkoff are also reportedly expected in Turkey.However, there is little sign that Putin is prepared to travel. Although he has not directly ruled it out, comments from the Kremlin suggest Russia will instead send a lower-level negotiating team to Istanbul.“Our delegation will be there and will wait for the Ukrainian side,” said Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday evening. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia wanted to use any talks to address the “root causes” of the conflict as Moscow sees them, including the “denazification” of Ukraine and the official incorporation into Russia of annexed territories – suggesting that the rhetoric of the two sides is still very far apart.1:45Zelenskyy says he will wait in Turkey for face-to-face talks with Putin – videoZelenskyy said he believed that without a ceasefire agreed by the leaders, there was no point in beginning lower-level talks.“I want you to understand why I would meet with Putin. We are not going to be able to agree on everything now. It’s impossible. We have different approaches to life, different worldviews. But we have to somehow find a way to end the war,” he said. If he and Putin could agree on a ceasefire, Zelenskyy said, then lower-level groups could meet to start hammering out details of the next steps.He pointed to previous talks in Saudi Arabia, when the Americans acted as intermediaries between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, and a lasting full ceasefire could not be agreed. “Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this format doesn’t work,” he said.However, when pressed, he refused to rule out sending a lower-level delegation to Istanbul for talks. “I don’t know. I am being honest. Maybe the Americans, maybe someone will really want to launch this format again. I don’t know,” he said.The back-and-forth diplomacy began with a visitto Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Polandon Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a set-piece military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war. After speaking with Trump on the phone, the four European leaders laid down an ultimatum to Putin that he should sign up to a 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face further sanctions.Putin rejected the ultimatum, instead offering the Istanbul talks without a ceasefire.Zelenskyy invites Pope Leo to Ukraine as pontiff urges journalists to report truthRead moreIn the event that nothing is agreed during whatever meetings take place in Turkey this week, the big question is whether the Europeans can bring Trump along with them in their plans to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. Zelenskyy said he hoped that new sanctions would soon be on the agenda if Thursday’s meetings came to nothing.“I believe that President Trump is not against imposing sanctions … and I believe that there is political will in Congress to vote for these sanctions. I believe the Americans are very close to imposing these sanctions,” he said. He added that consultations would take place in the coming days – “if you’ll allow me, I won’t say where or when” – in which Europeans would be briefed on upcoming US sanctions plans.The Ukrainian president has been walking a diplomatic tightrope in recent weeks, as Kyiv tries to keep the Trump administration on side. After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around,culminating in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.Asked what he had said to Trump to win him back over, Zelenskyy declined to answer: “I won’t tell you. I know the reasons; in my opinion, I know why we had such a good talk. But I can’t say, I just can’t.”British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House debacle and offering guidance on how to mend relations with the US administration.Zelenskyy said the contact with European allies had been closer and more frequent than ever before, and that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of “two or three” leaders whom he spoke with regularly by phone. “He has a very creative approach … He’s a risk-taker. And risk-takers can be different kinds of people, but they are all focused on results. They don’t put themselves above everything else,” Zelenskyy said.After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the inaugural mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.“I think it could happen on Sunday,” Zelenskyy said. “If it works out. We don’t know what this week will bring. We have come to the moment when we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUkraineDonald TrumpEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

We will also be making sure that government jobs support economic growth throughout the country,” he said.Alex Thomas, programme director at the Institute for Government, said thousands of civil servants had already been moved out of London and the targets should be achievable, meaning talented civil servants can build their careers outside the capital.However, he cautioned: “It would be a mistake to spray jobs across the country at random – civil servants benefit from working on campuses together, organised around a common theme. We’ve seen the benefits this can bring at the Darlington Economic Campus. But success takes hard work, and senior ministerial and official investment of time and resource.”The plan will also mean more young entrants to the civil service can have careers in the government without ever having worked in Whitehall.The government is not setting a target for how many jobs will be moved outside London, as some of the 12,000 jobs lost in London will not be replaced. Departments are responsible for coming up with plans about shifting their focus outside the capital as part of the spending review.The Cabinet Office said the changes are projected to bring about £730m in local economic benefits to areas with new civil service hubs between 2024 and 2030.Fran Heathcote, PCS’s general secretary, said:“PCS believes the civil service has a vital role to play in rebuilding the nation. We consider there should be improved access for workers to higher grade roles in the civil service across regions and nations. This will allow those workers to develop their careers without having to uproot from their families and communities; and it will assist economic regeneration in areas that need it.“If these government proposals are to be successful, however, it’s important they do the right thing by workers currently based in London. That must include guarantees of no compulsory redundancies, no compulsory relocations and access to more flexible working arrangements to enable them to continue their careers should they wish to do so.”Dave Penman, the FDA general secretary, said civil servants will welcome the commitments from the government “to ensure that, alongside the targets for moving greater numbers of roles outside of London, there’s a recognition that for this to be a success, civil servants need to be able to build careers for the longer-term across the UK, including in London where there will now be fewer opportunities”.“There will also be uncertainty for the thousands of civil servants affected by the office closures announced today. We need to hear quickly from the departments affected how this will be managed, not least how they will be affected by the office closures, relocation of roles out of London and reduction in headcount all happening at the same time,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCivil servicePublic services policyTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

Her body was left partly clothed and mutilated.Sullivan has always protested his innocence and lawyers have tried twice before to get his conviction overturned.In a statement read by his lawyer Sarah Myatt outside the court on his behalf, Sullivan said too many horrors had been inflicted on him to detail.“As God is my witness, it is said the truth shall take you free,” he said. “It is unfortunate that it does not give a timescale as we advance towards resolving the wrongs done to me, I am not angry, I am not bitter. I am simply anxious to return to my loved ones and family as I’ve got to make the most of what is left of the existence I am granted in this world.”New tests ordered by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) revealed that Sullivan’s DNA was not present on samples preserved at the time.Duncan Atkinson KC, for the Crown Prosecution Service, told the court of appeal that analysis of the DNA showed it came from someone known as “unknown male one”, and that it was “one billion times more likely that the sample originated from unknown male one, rather than someone else, and it did not match the appellant”.He said: “Had this DNA evidence been available at the time a decision was taken to prosecute, it is difficult to see how a decision to prosecute could have been made.”Quashing the conviction, Lord Justice Holroyde, sitting with Mr Justice Goss and Mr Justice Bryan, said: “In the light of that evidence, it is impossible to regard the appellant’s conviction as safe.”Sullivan, who attended the hearing via video link from HMP Wakefield, listened to the ruling with his head down and arms folded, and appeared to weep and put his hand to his mouth as his conviction was quashed.As the judgment was read out, his sister Kim Smith tearfully declared: “We’ve done it.”Outside court, she said: “We lost Peter for 39 years and at the end of the day it’s not just us, Peter hasn’t won and neither has the Sindall family. They’ve lost their daughter, they are not going to get her back.”Merseyside police said the crucial DNA evidence was not available during the original investigation and officers were now “committed to doing everything” to find the person whose DNA was left at the scene where Diane Sindall died.Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill said that more than 260 men had been screened and eliminated from the investigation since it was reopened in 2023.She said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of Diane Sindall who continue to mourn her loss and will have to endure the implications of this new development so many years after her murder. We are committed to doing everything within our power to find whom the DNA, which was left at the scene, belongs to.“Unfortunately, there is no match for the DNA identified on the national DNA database.”But she said that, with the help of the National Crime Agency (NCA), officers were “proactively trying to identify the person the DNA profile belongs to”.Holroyde said a decision by the CCRC in 2008 that scientific techniques at the time would not yield a DNA profile was “plainly correct”.He said: “The brutal attack which ended Miss Sindall’s young life also blighted the lives of her fiance, her family and all those who loved her. We offer our condolences to the bereaved.”James Burley, who led the investigation by the charity Appealinto the case of Andrew Malkinson, said: “Peter Sullivan’s exoneration today after nearly four decades of wrongful imprisonment provides further evidence that our current appeals system cannot be trusted to swiftly identify and rectify miscarriages of justice.“Between them, Peter Sullivan, Andrew Malkinsonand Victor Nealonspent over 70 years wrongly imprisoned before finally being exonerated by compelling DNA evidence. Each had their cases previously rejected by both the court of appeal and the CCRC – the institutions which are meant to act as our justice system’s safety net. The case for an urgent overhaul of the appeals system is now overwhelming.”His comments were echoed by Prof Rebecca Helm, who runs the miscarriages of justice registry at the University of Exeter law school.“The case underscores the importance of having a mechanism through which convictions based on evidence that is known to be misleading (including weak or incorrectly described forensic science) can be scrutinised even in the absence of ‘new’ evidence in order to protect others who have been wrongfully convicted, and to ensure that true perpetrators are brought to justice,” she said.The prime minister’s spokesperson called it a “grave miscarriage of justice” and said: “We must carefully consider this judgment and look at how this could have happened, to get both him [Sullivan] and Diane’s family the answers they deserve.”Explore more on these topicsCourt of appealMerseysideUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

The informal meeting will be the first face-to-face meeting between a US president and a Syrian leader since 2000, when Bill Clinton met with the late leader Hafez al-Assad in Geneva.Speaking at an investment forum on Tuesday, Trump said that he planned to lift sanctions on Syria after holding talks with Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” Trump said.1:35Trump says the US will lift its sanctions on Syria’s new government – videoSharaa’s pitch to woo the US president offered access to Syrian oil, reconstruction contracts and to build a Trump Tower in Damascus in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions onSyria.Though the details of the sanctions relief were still unclear, Sharaa’s team in Damascus was celebrating.“This is amazing, it worked,” said Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian writer and activist who is close to the Syrian president. He shared a picture of an initial mockup of Trump Tower Damascus. “This is how you win his heart and mind,” he said, noting that Sharaa would probably show Trump the design during their meeting in Riyadh on Wednesday.The visit was heavily focused on business interests and securing quick wins – often with characteristic Trumpian embellishment – for the administration. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed pledged to invest $600bn in the United States during a lunch with Trump, including $20bn in artificial intelligence data centres, purchases of gas turbines and other energy equipment worth $14.2bn, nearly $5bn in Boeing 737-8 jets, and other deals.But details of the specific commitments remained vague, the numbers put out by the White House did not total $600bn, and some of the programs began under Joe Biden’s administration.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead moreThe White House called the arms deal the “largest defence sales agreement in history” and said that it included plans for more than a dozen US defense companies to sell weapons, equipment and services in the areas of air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, as well as border and maritime security.The US president was feted with a royal guard as he arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s escorted Trump’s Air Force One jet as it arrived in Riyadh and Trump sat with Salman in an ornate hall at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace with members of the US and Saudi and business elite. Among them were Elon Musk, prominent figures in AI such as Sam Altman, as well the chief executives of IBM, BlackRock, Citigroup, Palantir and Nvidia, among others.When Salman pledged that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn in the US economy, Trump smiled and joked that it should be $1tn.The trip is part of a reordering of Middle Eastern politics dominated by Trump’s “America first” platform of prioritising domestic US economic and security interests over foreign alliances and international law. Critics have said that thedealmaking empowers Trump and a coterie of businessmenaround the president, and the US president’s family has business interests in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, giving this administration an unprecedented conflict of interest.The most glaring example of the new commoditisation of American foreign policy under Trump has beenthe proposed giftfrom the ruling family of Qatar of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet that the White House said could be converted into a presidential plane and then be given to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office.The gift has provoked anger from congressional Democrats, one of whom described it as an “aerial palace” and said it would constitute “the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government”.Trump has defended the offer, saying in a post it would “replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction” and called Democrats asking for an ethics investigation “World Class Losers!!!”The meeting between Trump and Salman was characterised by smiles and friendly backslapping, a sharp contrast to past summits when the Saudi leader was mired in controversy over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.While his administration touted big deals, Trump also admitted that his geopolitical goals of Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic recognition of Israel would take time due in large part to the Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza.“It will be a special day in the Middle East, with the whole world watching, when Saudi Arabia joins us” in the Abraham accords, the Trump administration’s framework for Arab states to recognise Israel, he said. “And I really think it’s going to be something special – but you’ll do it in your own time.”Trump is also due to visit the United Arab Emirates on Thursday before continuing on to Qatar this week.His negotiations in the region have been characterised by big-ticket investment deals, and those appeared to play a role in his reversal of US policy on Syria as well.Sharaa, who is keen to normalise relations with the US, has reportedly offered Trump a number of sweeteners including the Trump tower in Damascus, a demilitarised zone by the Golan Heights that would strengthen Israel’s claim to the territory it has occupied since 1967, diplomatic recognition of Israel, and a profit-sharing deal on resources similar to the Ukraine minerals deal.‘Just wildly illegal’: top Democrats push to censure Trump’s plan to accept Qatar jetRead moreThe idea to offer Trump a piece of real estate with his name on it in the heart of Damascus was thought up by a US Republican senator, who passed on the idea to Sharaa’s team.“Sanctions in Syria are very complicated, but with Trump, he can [get] most of them lifted. It is a great opportunity,” Ziadeh said.The trip is also extraordinary for Trump’s decision not to visit Israel, the US’s closest ally in the region, due to the war in Gaza and Trump’s fraught relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamasreleased the lastremaining American hostage, Edan Alexander, on the eve of Trump’s visit to the Middle East, in an effort to push Trump to pressure Netanyahu to end the war.Netanyahu doubled down on the war on Tuesday in a show of defiance, saying that any ceasefire would only be “temporary”.“In the coming days, we will enter with full force to complete the operation to defeat Hamas,” he said. “Our forces are there now.”“There will be no situation where we stop the war,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policySaudi ArabiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

She said that in the US, the Medicare system (funded by government) now prescribed the drugs to all patients with cardiovascular disease, as well as to those with sleep apnoea.“What this analysis says is that this treatment works early – so why wait?”Dr Louis J Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, who led the first head-to-head trial of Mounjaro against Wegovy, said he expected even more innovations.“I think we’re going to see more medications,” he told the congress. “Icall it the golden age of obesity treatment.”Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, clinical director at the British Heart Foundation and a consultant cardiologist, said: “A generation ago, effective drugs for obesity would have been a pipe dream. Yet here we are with the potential to make a massive dent in the number of lives cut too short by cardiovascular disease and other conditions such as dementia and cancer. There is cause for optimism, as this will help more people live in good health for longer, and able to work for as long they want to.”John Deanfield, professor of cardiology at University College London, said it was “an exciting new world”, where these drugs could play a big role in treating lots of diseases, not solely obesity, and that the volume of new medications being developed was previously unheard of.“There will be a tsunami of trials,” he said. “There’s 150 drugs currently being developed or in trials. That’s a scenario we have never seen before in healthcare or medicine.”They include retatrutide, where patients in the trial lost up to 24% of their body weight in less than a year. Manufacturer Lilly expects to report the first phase 3 results by the end of this year.Meanwhile, the NHS is about to start prescribing Mounjaro. The NHS medical director for primary care, Dr Claire Fuller, said:“From next month, some eligible patients will be able to access the weight loss drug Mounjaro for the first time. The drug has already been approved for use for some adults in specialist weight management services, and 220,000 people will be eligible to benefit over the first three years.“This phased rollout will ensure those with the greatest clinical need can access the treatment as a priority, at the same time as the NHS develops new and innovative services through which other weight loss treatments can also be delivered in the future. ”But obesity experts urged the government to go faster and to include weight loss jabs in the government’s 10-year plan for health.Prof Jason Halford of the European Association for the Study of Obesity said: “If the government and NHS are serious about prevention they need to reconsider their position on the speed of the rollout of these drugs.”Deanfield said: “These drugs should play a big part in the government’s prevention agenda. The GLP-1 drugs provide a real opportunity to delay many of these diseases of ageing all at the same time.“I would hope it wouldn’t take 10 years to do something that is so needed and so obviously transformative,” he added.A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said: “Obesity costs lives, and burdens the economy as well as the NHS. Obesity drugs can be gamechangers in tackling this problem, but we must recognise these drugs are not a replacement for a good diet and exercise.“As the government shifts the NHS from sickness to prevention, we will be looking at how obesity drugs can be made available to more people, while securing a good price for the taxpayer.”Explore more on these topicsObesityNHSHealthHeart diseaseDiabetesStrokeDementianewsShareReuse this content"

The electorate want us to get a grip of it. We will, and we won’t apologise for doing so.”Speaking to LBC, Khan said: “The sort of language I use is different to the language used by others. That’s not the sort of words I would use.”He added that he thought Starmer was referring to “promises made by Brexiteers” and recent high levels of migration, and not “that contribution we make to this multicultural capital city and country”.On Monday, several Labour MPs expressed worry at Starmer’s words, with Sarah Owen, the chair of the women and equalities committee, saying: “Chasing the tail of the right risks taking our country down a very dark path.”Zarah Sultana, who was elected as a Labour MP but now sits as an independent, said Starmer had put lives at risk by echoing Powell’s language, calling this “a disgrace”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is both right and fair to say that migrants have made a massive contribution to our society for generations.“But it is also right to say that, particularly in the five years between 2019 and 2024, seeing immigration levels quadruple, the previous government lost control of the system.“We’re not going to shy away from this issue, because the British public rightly expect the government to get control of immigration in a way that the previous government lost control of immigration.”He added: “The PM has been very clear, Britain is an inclusive country. We have welcomed immigrants for generations, but the level of immigration over the last few years has been too high, and migration must come down.”Asked if Starmer stood by the words “island of strangers”, the spokesperson replied “yes”, adding: “The prime minister was using his own words to rightly both recognise the contribution migrants have made over generations and to make the point that uncontrolled migration has been too high.”He condemned Powell, saying that the PM “rejects, in its entirety, previous speeches made by that individual”.Speaking earlier on Tuesday, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said Starmer’s words were “completely different” to those used by Powell.“I don’t think it’s right to make those comparisons, I think it’s completely different,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “The prime minister said yesterday, I think almost in the same breath, he talked about the diverse country that we are, and that being part of our strength.“Everybody always gets caught up in focusing on different phrases … if you look at what the prime minister said yesterday, he talked about people who came after the war to work in the UK, to build some of our services, and how important that was. But he also talked about how immigration has to be properly controlled and managed, and it hasn’t been. I actually think it’s OK to have both those views.”Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumKeir StarmerLabourSadiq KhanYvette CoopernewsShareReuse this content"

It reads: “Murdered 2.8.1986 because she was a woman. In memory of all our sisters who have been raped and murdered. We will never let it be forgotten.”In Merseyside, the killing has a legacy that is still felt today. For nearly four decades, many assumed justice had been served and the right man had been convicted. On Tuesday, that was turned on its head when thecourt of appeal ruled Peter Sullivan was an innocent man.The BBC reportedhe left HMP Wakefield in a prison van shortly after 2.15pm.Sullivan was not the “Beast of Birkenhead”, the “Mersey Ripper” or “Wolfman”. He was not the unspeakable monster still etched in the memory of so many. He had spent 38 years in category A jails for a crime he did not commit.It means there may be someone alive who did kill Sindall and could, and should, be brought to justice.In August 1986, Sindall, a 21-year-old florist, was working part-time shifts at a pub in Bebington to help raise extra money for her planned wedding the following year. At the end of a Friday shift she set off for home, five miles away in Seacombe, in her blue Fiat van, only to run out of petrol.She did as anyone else would do and started to walk along a busy, well-lit main road. She was spotted by witnesses walking along Borough Road towards Tranmere between midnight and 12.20am.Whether Sindall was looking for a taxi, heading to an all-night garage or a friend’s house is not known for sure. A taxi driver toldthe BBC’s Crimewatch programmethat he saw a man and a woman arguing in the street at 12.10am.View image in fullscreenDiane Sindall.Photograph: Merseyside Police/PATwelve hours later Sindall’s body was found by a dog walker in an alleyway off Borough Road. She had been beaten to death in a frenzied sex attack. According to police: “She had suffered extensive injuries to her body. Her cause of death was established as a cerebral haemorrhage following multiple blows.”A pathologist said in court that her injuries were the “very worst” he had seen “outside of a road traffic accident”. The murder prompted revulsion, fear and anger with girls and women afraid to be out on streets alone. It was the ordinariness of what happened – running out of petrol on a busy road – that heightened anxiety.John Thompson, who covered the case for the Liverpool Echo,told the BBC: “Fathers, boyfriends, brothers and husbands would pick women up from work and tell them not to leave the premises until they were right outside the door.“There was real terror,” he said, because Sindall’s murder was “different – it was horrific”.It led to the first Reclaim the Night march in Liverpool, a movement that began in Leeds after the Yorkshire Ripper murders and as a response to police advice that women should stay indoors.View image in fullscreenPeter Sullivan.Photograph: Merseyside PoliceA group of local women also decided enough was enough, getting together around a kitchen table to found Wirral Rape Crisis Counselling Service (WRCCS), now known asRASA Merseyside.The murder prompted the biggest manhunt in the history of Merseyside police, with officers speaking to about 3,000 people. It is said that at one point, police considered interviewing every man in Birkenhead.On 23 September, Sullivan was arrested after apparently giving police a number of different accounts of his movements.It was alleged that he had spent the day drinking heavily in a pub 10 minutes from where the body was found. After losing a darts match it was said Sullivan went out armed with a crowbar before what was a chance encounter with Sindall.Sullivan was initially denied legal representation or an appropriate adult in police interview, on the grounds that officers were concerned that sensitive information might be leaked about the investigation.The court of appeal heard that Sullivan made a number of confessions and retractions during questioning. After he had access to a solicitor, Sullivan said he had made up the confessions.His trial in 1987 heard evidence from dental experts that bite marks on Sindall’s body could be matched to Sindall’s teeth. It led to the Wolfman nickname, one of a number of infamous names for a man now known to be innocent.The retracted confessions, the bite marks and circumstantial evidence about his whereabouts helped bring a conviction and Sullivan was jailed for life with a minimum term of 16 years. Until Tuesday, 38 years later, he was still in a category A prison.Explaining Sullivan’s old “confessions” at the court of appeal, Jason Pitter KC said: “The appellant was extremely vulnerable in an interrogative situation, because of his limited intellectual functioning, combined with his problems with self-expression, his disposition to acquiesce, to yield, to be influenced, manipulated and controlled and his internal pressure to speak without reflection and his tendency to engage in make-believe to an extreme extent.”Scientists now accept that bite marks on skin cannot be reliably used as identification evidence in criminal cases. The gamechanging DNA sample that secured his release was only made possible by a method that first came into use in 2015.View image in fullscreenKim Smith, sister of Peter Sullivan.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PASullivan has been reviled for most of his life. Speaking outside the court of appeal his sister Kim Smith said: “Peter was called so many different names and that all needs to be squashed now because Peter was never anything of what he was being called in the first place.”Merseyside police have promised to continue searching for Sindall’s real killer and called on help from the public.Det Ch Supt Karen Jaundrill said: “If you were in the area, or had concerns about an individual at the time, let us know so our team can trace and request a DNA sample from the person you suspect, or a relative of theirs if they have perhaps passed away, or they have emigrated to another country.”Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justiceViolence against women and girlsMerseysideWomenPoliceCrimenewsShareReuse this content"

About 26% of adults in both countries have a seasonal allergy, as do about 19% of children inthe USand 10-15% of children inthe UK.Pollen is everywhere. But do I have allergies or a cold?Read moreAs pollen seasons continue to get longer and more severe, how does one best manage allergies? We asked experts.How do you know if you have seasonal allergies?Common symptoms of pollen allergies include itchy, watery eyes, an itchy and runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion and/or post-nasal drip (when mucus runs from the back of your nose down the throat), headaches, sore throat, coughing, wheezing and trouble breathing, says Dr Arveen Bhasin, an allergist-immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida.It’s possible to develop allergies at any time.“It’s not uncommon for adults that have never experienced them before to find themselves managing seasonal allergies for the first time later in life,” says Carver.Moving to a new environment and encountering different foliage can trigger pollen allergies. It usually takes two years to develop sensitivities to particular allergens, says Dr Payel Gupta, a spokesperson for the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, and the medical director for allergy and immunology at Tono Health.How do you treat seasonal allergies?A number of over-the-counter medications can help manage allergy symptoms, says Bhasin. These include decongestants, antihistamine pills, nasal sprays and eye drops.In order for these medications to work, says Bhasin, you have to be proactive and start your regimen at least two weeks before pollen season.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Bhasin notes that antihistamines can lose efficacy over time. If a medication “is not consistently controlling symptoms”, you “may have developed tolerance” to it, she says.Additionally, nasal sprays need to be used regularly to be of any help. Bhasin says she often sees patients discontinue using nasal sprays after three to five days because they don’t seem to be working, but it takes 10-14 days of consistent use for these sprays to reach maximum efficacy.Experts caution that when overused, decongestants can cause a rebound effect, where nasal congestionworsens. “Do not use them for more than three days,” says Carver, and check with your doctor before using if you have high blood pressure, heart disease, thyroid disease, glaucoma or trouble urinating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

At home, keep windows closed and the air conditioning running so that clean air can circulate. Make sure to regularly change air filters as well. When pollen counts are especially high, Carver suggests wearing a mask outside. And always remove your shoes, shower and change into a fresh set of clothes when you get home, experts say.Hay fever making your life a misery? Try these 20 tips from doctors and allergy expertsRead moreAir purifiersare also helpful, says Gupta, but getting one that is the right size for your space is important. The strength of a purifier is based on the square footage of a room, she explains.When should you see a doctor?If you have tried all the above and are still struggling with allergy symptoms, see an allergist.“There are so many ways we can help you feel more comfortable,” says Gupta.When over-the-counter drugs are not helping, allergists may prescribe allergy immunotherapy, meaning allergy shots or sublingual treatment (medicated drops that go under the tongue). These can help with longer-term control and relief, says Carter.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyAllergiesHealth & wellbeingHay feverfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Maybe that’s telling.In the time since, we saw the rise of so-called “elevated horror”, a trend that arguably began with 2014’sThe Babadookand enjoyed its biggest success with last fall’sLonglegs. Those earnestly artful films tend to shrug off the horror genre’s baser pleasures to instead mine drama, trauma and influences such as Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and Nicolas Roeg. For those feeling a bit trauma-fatigued, I’m happy to say Final Destination is not only back but better than ever.The grisly return of Final Destination: ‘What are the everyday experiences we can ruin for people?’Read moreNot that Final Destination: Bloodlines isn’t elevated. Directors Zach Lipovsky and Adam B Stein, who broke on to the scene with the inventive low-budget sci-fi spectacle Freaks, class the joint up while refusing to let their movie take itself too seriously.Their sixth chapter embraces the knowingly silly premise and grisly thrills we’ve come to expect from the 25-year-old series, in which cursed characters meet their demise by way of tanning beds, eye surgery and logging trucks. In Final Destination, death, with its affinity for complicated Rube Goldberg-esque methods, makes the most mundane and inanimate objects a threat we can never look at the same way again. But where Bloodlines excels is in the clever and often diabolical storytelling craft and visuals. There’s a decadence in the film-making that isn’t at odds with the campy nature of Final Destination but instead realizing its full potential.Nowhere is that more obvious than the stunning opening set piece, which kicks things off with a closeup of a young woman (Brec Bassinger) in a blindfold, a fun little detail since she’s the one who will be seeing into the future. Her name also happens to be Iris.It’s the 60s. Iris is being chauffeured by her boyfriend to a surprise night out. They’re attending the opening of a fancy new restaurant atop an observation deck, where the magic-hour views are paired with fine dining and dancing; a house band building up the joyous frenzy performing The Isley Brothers’ Shout.Anyone familiar with the Final Destination formula knows we’re witnessing Iris’s premonition and that things won’t end well for the revellers twisting and shouting on the glass bottom dancefloor. The sequence is engineered to keep us on our toes, anticipating what’s to come. But it holds the tension in such a beautiful unhurried fashion, affectionately doting over the scenery and chemistry between the characters while caught up in the up-tempo romance of the evening.The thwarted disaster isn’t just setting the table for Iris’s fate, but, retroactively, the whole Final Destination franchise. Bloodlines introduces an origin story in its prologue that playfully tinkers with the series mythology.Generations later, in the present tense, Iris’s granddaughter Stefani (a perfectly frazzled Kaitlyn Santa Juana) is haunted by that same observation-deck premonition. She goes digging up buried family secrets to figure out what it all means. Meanwhile, a stockpile begins to form at the family burial plots. This time death isn’t just going after who survives the instigating events but also who inherited their curse. And because the cast can be so charming, especially Richard Harmon as a snarky but sentimental cousin, we might actually be rooting for a few of them to survive – a rarity in a franchise where we bought a ticket to watch everyone die in spectacular fashion.The most entertaining kills, which this time around involve everything from lawn tools to an MRI, have a Buster Keaton-esque flair for physical comedy. These sequences, along with the plot as a whole, tend to include little callbacks to the past: buses, barbecues, ceiling fans and logs make cameo appearances, thrilling little reminders of the havoc they can wreak in a Final Destination. Sure, its fan service, the kind so many craven reboots are prone to. But it feels more earned in Bloodlines because they’re often building to something fresh and, in one instance, even moving.The most sentimental – and much written about – homage to the franchise’s past is the late Tony Todd’s return as William Bludworth. The iconic Candyman actor is a Final Destination regular, playing the mischievous mortician often spitting some cryptic truth to death’s would be victims. Todd, who died in the fall, appears as Bludworth one last time to give an improvised monologue, parting words suggesting we make the most with what little time we have left.The characters listening in that scene, who are scrambling to avoid the inevitable, don’t quite heed his advice. The movie, which breathes new life into a franchise about being stalked by death, takes the idea of savouringeverymoment to heart.Final Destination: Bloodlines is out in UK cinemas on 14 May, Australian cinemas on 15 May and US cinemas on 16 MayExplore more on these topicsHorror filmsAction and adventure filmsComedy filmsThrillersreviewsShareReuse this content"

How did he bounce back?Tue 13 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 07.04 EDTShareAll stories of addiction are grim and harrowing, but Patrick Dougher’s memoir reads like a picaresque comedy at times – albeit one laced with trauma and tragedy. There are hilarious tales of eccentric characters, like the great-aunt with enormous buttocks who killed his kitten by sitting on it: “That booty made all the decisions, and Aunt Cat, she just followed obediently.” And there are almost unbelievable episodes from Dougher’s life: his near-death experience in a crashing elevator, playing drums in Sade’s band, being stalked by a serial killer, finding a kilo of cocaine hidden inside a stolen table football machine. It almost sounds fun. And yet Dougher’s life is also a story of emotional damage, homelessness, self-destruction, loss and regret.“The life of an addict, or at least my life, it is the full spectrum, it’s the polarities,” he says. “You can have incredible moments of exhilaration and joy and excitement, and it puts you in situations where you’re surrounded by unique characters, and then obviously the downside, which is pain and suffering and all of that stuff.” And yet, somehow, Dougher made it out the other side. “I would say I had a charmed life,” he says.View image in fullscreenDecomposition, by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAt one point he spent a month sleeping on a park bench; today he is a successful artist, speaking from a rented chateau outside Paris, where he lives with his partner and four-month-old daughter. He looks extremely well for someone who spent 20 years drinking, smoking and taking cocaine and whatever else he could get his hands on – he spent a whole year tripping on hallucinogens. His tattooed body looks remarkably well toned for a 61-year-old, and his mind is perfectly sharp. As with everything else about Dougher, the explanation for his condition is contradictory. “I would put anything you gave me into my system if you told me it would get me high,” he says. “If you said, ‘I got this white powder here, check this out,’ I would do it and not think twice about it. I would drink leftover drinks with cigarette butts in them. But I wouldn’t eat pork, or I went long periods where I was vegetarian, very mindful of diet. Even when I lived on the park bench, I would do push-ups.”Dougher became an addict through “a combination of nature and nurture,” he says. It was in his genes, he suggests, that he “didn’t have an off switch”. His father was Irish, hence the name; his mother is African American, “which I always say is the perfect ethnic cocktail for an alcoholic addict.”Dougher’s father was an alcoholic and so was his grandfather – but the root causes of their troubles were as much to do with socioeconomic circumstances and inherited trauma as genetics. When Dougher was a boy, his father told him one drunken evening how he had witnessed his father, Dougher’s grandfather, shoot himself. When Dougher was 13, his father decided to get sober, and became a kind, loving dad. A year later he died of a heart attack. On the way to the funeral, one of his father’s old friends took Dougher aside and told him that his grandfather, who was violent and abusive, had not really shot himself; his father had killed him, and had then married his mother “to punish himself.” His father was 22 when he met his mother; she was 19, and already a mother of two. After the funeral, Dougher poured himself a drink. “I got drunk,” he says. “That drunk lasted 20 years.”New York, and especially Brooklyn, was a very different place in the 1970s and 80s. Today it is an expensive middle-class enclave; back then it was a run-down, working-class neighbourhood. Today it is economically segregated; back then it was ethnically segregated. “You could literally walk one block in the wrong direction and be in a neighbourhood where you weren’t welcome,” Dougher recalls. “The Italians, the Irish, the Jewish, they had their own internal racisms and pecking orders, but they were very united against anyone that was Black or Puerto Rican.”View image in fullscreenDougher playing drums with ska band the Boilers at CBGBs, New York, 1985Photograph: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAs a mixed-race child, Dougher would be picked on and called “White Boy” by the Black kids, but he would also be attacked by the white Irish American kids. During one beating, he recalls, “I said, ‘Hey, I’m half-Irish,’ hoping that they would see me as something other than a Black kid that they hated so badly. And when I said that, the beating escalated – they really got angry. It was a clear reminder to me that the world is only going to see me as a Black person.”Soon after his father died, Dougher dropped out of high school, moved into his mother’s basement and started effectively fending for himself – dumpster diving to find food, doing small-time jobs for money, which evolved into burgling neighbours’ houses, drinking, listening to music, smoking weed, selling weed. “They say weed is a gateway drug; I think it’s a gateway only for those who were heading through the gate anyway,” he says.By his early 20s, as well as drinking heavily, he got into cocaine. It reached the stage where he was basically always on something – all of which required more money, more crimes, and a gradual disintegration of his life. “I worked, stole, borrowed and begged just to stay high,” he says.When he was 21 he got into psychedelics, in particular a synthetic form of mescaline known as “microdots”. “It was like LSD mixed with amphetamine,” he says. “You can just kind of keep moving, so you’ve got the buzz, the energy of someone on meth, and then the trippiness of somebody who’s doing acid.” He took it every day for the best part of a year – one long acid trip, punctuated by moments of lucidity. “I marvel over the fact that I have any brain cells left,” he says. Does he remember anything about it? “Well, I ended up with a son at the end of that year.”View image in fullscreenBasquiat meets Haring at Biggies Brooklyn Backyard by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAnd yet, Dougher was also surprisingly active during this time. He took care of his son, Omari, on weekends. He had relationships – even at his least together, Dougher was always a fashionable dresser and a bit of a charmer, it seems. And he was always into music, not just the emerging local hip-hop scene (he was a terrible MC, he admits), but also reggae, and British rock like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones – “white boy music” – which led him to punk and new wave. He dressed like a punk, he says, in ripped skinny jeans and T-shirts held together with safety pins. He would go into Manhattan to classic venues like the Mudd Club and CBGBs to see bands like Bad Brains and Minor Threat. And to sell weed to white kids.On his 17th birthday a girlfriend gave him a drum kit, and he took to it, forming a reggae band, then playing in bands for decades. In 2003, for example, he played drums on the cult stoner albumDub Side of the Moon(exactly as it suggests, it’s a dub cover version of Pink Floyd’s entire Dark Side of the Moon album). “I got paid $600 and I got two CDs. That was it.”View image in fullscreenUbuntu by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherOne time in 1992, a British guy approached him in New York and asked him if he would fill in for Sade’s drummer, who was stuck in England because of visa problems. They played one song, in a studio, for a Top of the Pops broadcast. He was utterly smitten with Sade, he says. “I really wish I had dated her.” She liked him too, evidently. She invited Dougher to play with them for the rest of their US tour. Call them the next day, she said. It was a dream come true. He got high to celebrate. Then he wondered if he would be able to keep on getting high if he was on the road. He never called back.He somehow avoided the crack epidemic that ravaged so many Black and brown communities in the 80s. He says his older brother overdosed, and that his cousin, also an addict, “got thrown out of a moving car”. The fact that he is still alive is as much down to luck as anything else, he admits. “There’s so many moments where I could have died or ended up in jail or just been disabled, and so many folks that have had the same opportunities as me and just haven’t made it.”And all along the way, there were many times when he tried to get sober, but just couldn’t. “Every addict and alcoholic, at some point, realises that this thing is killing them or ruining their lives, but they negotiate with it. They make deals like, ‘I’m going to figure it out. I’ll cut back. I’ll try a different drug. I’ll try a different alcohol.’ It took 20-odd years of daily use for me to surrender to the fact that none of that negotiation ever works, at least not for long.” Penniless, unemployable and alcohol dependent, he became homeless. After that month on the park bench, a friend let him sleep on the floor of his recording studio. He realised he had nothing.When he finally quit, it was almost a non-event, it seems. “Nothing particularly tragic happened that day. But you get sick and tired of being sick and tired,” he says. He describes it as a moment of “grace”: “I came to this moment where I realised it was black and white: I could continue living the way I was, with active addiction and alcoholism, and die miserably, and die lonely, and die as a burden to those around me. Or I could face this demon and gather the courage to try to imagine a life free of alcohol and drugs.”At 38 I had the emotional intelligence and coping skills of a 15-year-oldOne of the most pernicious aspects of addiction, he says, is “this idea like, ‘I’m alone. Nobody understands me, nobody’s going to help me.’” It is not true, he says. “I wasn’t able to break out of it until I was willing to ask for help.” Like his father did at the same age, he started going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and began to change his ways and rebuild his life. It wasn’t easy, he says. “At 38 years old, I really had the emotional intelligence and coping skills of a 15-year-old.” He had never had a bank account or a driving licence. He had also never dealt with what he now sees as his angst, his anger, his lack of self-worth, his grief – all of which began with his father’s death. One of his first sober jobs was as a counsellor to troubled teenagers. “They’re incredibly sensitive and insecure and I identified with them, because I recognised that.”He began to mend fences and rebuild relationships, including with his son, Omari, whom Dougher now describes as “my best friend”.View image in fullscreenDougher with his partner, Sélène Saint Aimé, and their baby daughter.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianHe became an art teacher and an art therapist, working with HIV positive children and community groups. And steadily he became an artist himself. “I was making art the whole time, but I never considered myself an artist,” he says. “It took me a few years of being sober to clean up my mind enough to get some direction and make the leap to realise, like, maybe all along I’ve been a creative and an artist.” His paintings often incorporate African American history and spirituality: often depicting Black figures with golden haloes, almost like religious iconography.Dougher was always a spiritual seeker. Throughout his memoir he hangs out with numerous religious groups: Jehovah’s Witnesses; Black, MuslimFive Percenters; Rastafarians, even Hare Krishnas (admittedly the free food and the music were the main appeal there). That hunger is part of what drew him to drugs in the first place, he realises now. “It was a shortcut to God, in a sense, or what I thought was God.” He still sees his life and his work in a spiritual context, “this idea that there’s something bigger than me, and yet I’m still part of that big thing.”As such, he is philosophical about how his life has panned out. “It makes you realise everything had to happen as it did. Obviously my life would have been completely different had I continued to play with Sade,” he laughs. “And there were so many times where I made the wrong turn, or in the moment that decision caused me more grief and suffering, but I kind of had to go through it to get where I ended up.”He spends a few months in France every year with his new partner, 31-year-old Sélène Saint Aimé, a French-Caribbean bassist. The rest of the time he’s working in his Brooklyn studio. He’s happier than he’s ever been, he says. “I’ve been given a second chance ​at life. It’s the best way I could put it.”Concrete Dreamland by Patrick Dougher is out now (Little, Brown, £28)Explore more on these topicsArtHow we surviveAlcoholismDrugsOpioidsReligionAlcoholinterviewsShareReuse this content"

No thanks.Wait, I haven’t even explained it yet.Doesn’t matter, it’s still the most terrifying thing I’ve ever heard.No, give it a chance. FaceAge is only doing what doctors already do.Which is what?Visually assessing you to obtain a picture of your health.Oh, that doesn’t sound so bad.But FaceAge can do it much more accurately, to the point that it can predict whether or not you’ll survive treatment.No, I’m out again.I’ll explain more. FaceAge is an AI tool created by scientists at Mass General Brigham in Boston. By looking at a photo of your face, it can determine your biological age as opposed to your chronological age.What does that mean?It means that everyone ages at different speeds. At the age of 50, for example, Paul Rudd had a biological age of 43, according to researchers. But at the same age, fellow actor Wilford Brimley had a biological age of 69.And why does this matter?People with older biological ages are less likely to tolerate an aggressive treatment such as radiotherapy.Repeat all that as if I’m an idiot.OK. The older your face looks, the worse things are for you.Great news for the prematurely grey, then.Actually, no. Things like grey hair and baldness are often red herrings. FaceAge can give a better picture of someone’s health by assessing the skin folds on your mouth or the hollowing of your temples.Right, I’ll just be off to obsessively scrutinise the state of my temples.No, this is a good thing. A diagnostic tool like this, used properly, could improve the quality of life of millions of people. Although the initial research was confined to cancer patients, scientists plan to test FaceAge with other conditions.I’ve recently had plastic surgery. Will FaceAge still work on me?Unsure, actually. The creators still need to check that.And what about people of colour?Ah, yes, about that. The model was primarily trained on white faces, so there’s no real telling how well it can adapt to other skin tones.This is starting to sounddodgy.Just teething problems. Look how fast AI can improve. Last year, ChatGPT was a useless novelty. Now it’s going to destroy almost every labour market on Earth. You’d have to assume that FaceAge will rapidly improve as well.That’s reassuring.Yes. Before we know it, it’ll be scanning your face and instantly making a chillingly objective judgment call on whether you deserve to live or die.My God, will it?No, of course not. Not yet, anyway.Do say:“FaceAge is the new frontier of medical diagnostics.”Don’t say:“It says I’m going to die three seconds into the robot uprising of 2028.”Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Pass notesAgeingHealthComputingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

All that time, she thought her missing little sister, Alison, might still be out there. Dez would watch documentaries about homelessness to see if perhaps she’d recognise a face, and even attempted the Salvation Army’s family tracing service. “It was hope,” she says from her home in the Netherlands.Hope faded one day in 1994. Calling her from the UK, Dez’s mother-in-law cried down the phone. There was panic, there was confusion, “so I had to ask her. And then she said it was in the papers that the remains had been identified as Alison.”Back in England, one story was gripping the nation: Fred and Rose West. With every detail plastered on news channels and filling newspapers, the country was obsessed with the serial killers who for nearly three decades had been on an undetected murder spree, abducting young women, torturing them, mutilating them, and burying the bodies in the garden of their Gloucester home. Some of those bodies were the West’s own children.Alison had gone missing in the late 1970s. A rough relationship with authority meant she ended up in care as a teenager, then ran away, social services told her family. She was taken in by a couple in Gloucester, looking after their children and doing housework in return. “They know that I was in care, and are more than willing to help me on my feet,” Alison wrote in a letter to her mother in the early 80s. “I have accepted them as a second family.”It was the worst second family she could have had: the Wests, whose gruesome crimes – and the people who were left to pick up the pieces – are the subject of Netflix’s new three-part documentary series, Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story.View image in fullscreen‘I agreed to do this to bring Alison to life, but also for myself – for the closure’ … Dez Chambers.Photograph: NetflixIt’s a documentary which, using unseen police video and unheard interview recordings with Fred West, brings new insight to some of the worst serial killers Britain has ever seen. The show reveals how the pair abused and murdered 12 young women, how the police carried out their investigation, and how the families coped, featuring interviews with relatives of the deceased – some of whom have never spoken in public before.Those interviews were the stories director Dan Dewsbury wanted front and centre. “I really wanted to make sure that people understood this was a real thing that still affects these people today,” he says. “It’s one of the world’s most known crimes. The hope is that [viewers] will come out of it thinking a lot of different things beyond just the crime that was committed.”It’s a new approach for the now omnipresent true-crime format. While most focus on the twists and turns, the mystery and bloodshed, Dewsbury’s version of this well-known case tries to put empathy for those affected at the heart of the storytelling. “They wanted to bring the victims to life, and I wanted to do that too,” says Chambers, who has turned down other interviews in the past for fear of objectifying her little sister and reopening traumatic wounds. “That’s why I agreed to do this one, to bring Alison to life, but also for myself – for the closure.”Despite Dewsbury’s victim-first approach, the series does still hit notes required for any Netflix true-crime series. There’s creepy music with reversed vocals, glossy talking heads mixed with grainy archive footage, and ghostly Polaroids frequently popping up on screen. Dewsbury says he had to pick his battles regarding how far he could shake up the format. “The advantage is you’ve got a readymade audience,” he says of the genre. “The disadvantage is they may have a predisposition of what they want that series to be. It’s up to me to push against some of that.”This is a story that has been told many times, and it required input from the lawyers, police and forensic experts involved in the case. How hard was it to keep these interviewees fresh? “They become desensitised to it,” Dewsbury says. He kept notes of what the contributors had said in previous interviews, and alerted them when they were repeating themselves. “I want people to give an authentic interview, really connect into what I’m trying to do – not resort to media-speak or what worked last time.”View image in fullscreenBehind the mask … Rose and Fred West.Photograph: NetflixThe previously unseen footage is bone-chilling. Viewers see tapes of West family home videos, police digging up bodies in the garden, shots from inside the “House of Horrors” punctuated by archive material of the media frenzy around the case. But perhaps most shocking is the police footage of Fred at his home, handcuffed to detectives, being forced to locate his victims buried in the foundations. “There was a bone in there last time,” West grunts in his thick Gloucester accent, pointing at a corner of his excavated garden and referencing a previous visit.In one scene, we’re carried via police camcorder through the house, into the bespoke voids where carpenter West filmed his crimes. “It was clear that Fred had been able to adapt the building to his sexual pleasure,” forensic psychologist Paul Britton says to the cameras.During the research period, Dewsbury digested hundreds of hours of grisly archive material, which included footage of locals expressing their disbelief that a friendly couple from the community was committing these atrocities under everyone’s noses. “I think about the reconciliation those people must have gone through, because it genuinely felt like a shock, to that road, to that street, to that town, to that country,” he says. “It made me come face to face with this idea of the mask that people can put on.”Those involved in the case make for compelling viewing. Some are cartoonish and others understated – it’s remarkable to think this motley crew were at the heart of the biggest murder story in the world at the time. There’s Howard Sounes, the caricature Fleet Street hack who pays sources for exclusive stories. There’s Howard Ogden, the small-time local lawyer brought in to represent Fred in a case that may have been above his pay grade. There’s even an appearance from Brian Leveson, at the time a rising star in the legal world and the prosecuting lawyer in the West’s trial. “I have prosecuted all sorts of crime,” he says. “But if I had to identify one case that lives with me the most, this is the case.”But this is not just a documentary about two of the worst killers in British history. It’s a story of miscarriages of justice, incompetent authorities who didn’t join the dots, and vulnerable young women – some runaways, some leaving care – who became easy to hide when the state wasn’t looking for them. The Wests had been in contact with social services since the 60s, and a string of sexual assaults had gone unpunished. Dewsbury believes the lessons of the case apply to 2025. “I think the process by which Fred and Rose got away with what they did might be slightly unique to that period of time, but the undercurrent of what was going on is really relevant to now,” he says.One truly staggering missed opportunity is the case of Caroline Owens, one of the Wests’ nannies who was abducted, raped and abused by the pair in 1973. She escaped and bravely reported the crimes to the police, but the Wests inexplicably got off with a £50 fine. “It was a missed opportunity to raise the profile of Fred and Rose and identify them as possible sex offenders who could carry out abductions, kidnapping and imprisonment,” says detective constable Russ Williams in the documentary. “They did get off lightly with it.”Chambers wouldn’t usually watch a documentary with “Fred and Rose West” in the title, but she plans on tuning in to this one. “It’ll be tough, because there’s things I likely didn’t know, and things I might have forgotten,” she says. “But I stand behind it, because it’s about the victims. I’ll have to watch it all in one go, because I won’t be able to sleep in between.”Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story is on Netflix on 14 May.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Then they started to get suspiciousByHettie O'BrienTue 13 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 08.17 EDTShareEwan McKay is a quiet, trusting man with a lifelong passion for golf. Growing up in the 1950s in Angus, a windswept county on Scotland’s east coast, he found the sport a perfect outlet: a shared activity that reduced the pressures of socialising. Later, as an adult, golfing allowed him to rub shoulders with wealthy farmers who became useful contacts for his expanding business, selling Scottish seed potatoes to English farms. Once he sold that business, McKay had enough money to follow his dreams and create a course of his own.In 2002, McKay bought a plot of land in St Andrews and secured planning permission for a golf course and private members’ club. But two years later, he received an offer of £20m to buy the land. “It was the kind of sum you couldn’t turn down,” he recalled. He made a profit of £13m from the sale, and while he was golfing down in Kent in 2004, a friend suggested he ought to meet a solicitor called Stephen David Jones, who was a master at whittling down tax bills. “He said, ‘What are you doing about tax?’” McKay told me. “And I said, I wasn’t thinking about tax. I just pay it. And he said: ‘I can introduce you to someone brilliant.’”When McKay spoke to Jones, the lawyer suggested that he put his money into a trust on the Caribbean island of Nevis. Jones’s law firm would act as the trustee and McKay’s children would be registered as the beneficiaries. This, Jones explained, was the smartest way of arranging his tax affairs.McKay did his due diligence on Jones, inviting him up to Dundee to meet lawyers he knew. “Every single one of them thought he was plausible, charming and obviously extremely well known in respect of tax,” he told me. Jones seemed the epitome of an urbane, chivalrous Englishman. He read the Financial Times,sent his son to Eton and was rarely seen not wearing a waistcoat. He lived in a red Victorian mansion block in Little Venice, a prime area of west London. After meeting Jones, one of McKay’s lawyer friends said, “You’ve got yourself a cracker here.”In January 2006, Jones’s law firm, Jirehouse, registered the Scotia Trust Foundation in Nevis. Since Jirehouse was its sole trustee, only Jones and his colleagues had direct access to information about the assets it held for McKay’s family. Jirehouse created three further Scotia entities in Nevis. And, as Jirehouse was a director, secretary, partner or trustee in all four of the Scotia entities, Jones could sign paperwork on Scotia’s behalf without consulting McKay.Jones assured McKay that the complexity of the Scotia network was a sign of its sophistication. “He kept saying, ‘Don’t worry, everything is going great,’” McKay recalled. After McKay bought a new home in Angus with an adjoining shooting estate, Jones suggested that one of the Scotia entities should be listed as the owner, explaining this would be more “tax efficient”. Jones was often vague about the structures he set up on McKay’s behalf, but McKay assumed that this vagueness was a way of insulating him from the prying eyes of tax inspectors.Jones was affable and loquacious, and McKay started to think of him as a friend. He invited Jones to shooting parties at his home and at another local estate, Fettercairn, and Jones and his wife attended the wedding of McKay’s daughter. Jones often told McKay about various property deals he was involved with – an ocean-front development in Nevis, a swanky hotel in Iceland – and soon, Jones started to take his own private shooting parties to Fettercairn. McKay sensed that although Jones seemed to be from an affluent background, he enjoyed being around people who were richer than he was, as if pretending that their money was his own. Once, McKay received a bill from Fettercairn for a shoot that Jones had hosted. The estate manager said that Jones had charged the party to Scotia’s account. When McKay confronted Jones about this, he said it was an error.In 2010, McKay repurchased the plot of land in St Andrews. His plan was to finally start building the private members’ club and golf course. The Feddinch Club would target high net worth foreigners, and membership would be by invitation only. The price for joining as one of the club’s founder members was £250,000. Michael Bowes-Lyon, a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II, agreed to become the club’s honorary president, and a glossy brochure advertised its proximity to an airstrip for private jets.From the outset, Jones was eager to assist. He suggested that Jirehouse become a partner in the Feddinch Club, and arranged for McKay to fly to New York and meet some investors and an architect. McKay had never worked on a project of this scale before, and was keen to secure financing, so he brought Jirehouse on board as a partner. “My dad’s his own worst enemy,” said McKay’s son, Bruce. “If he meets somebody who appears successful, he’ll take their advice.”In early 2013, McKay decided to move closer to St Andrews to be nearer to the golf course. He found a bungalow with a wide view of the site and the sea beyond. On Jones’s instructions, Scotia would be listed on the deeds for McKay’s new home, just as it had been for his house in Angus. Shortly before the purchase went through, however, Jones told McKay there had been a change of plan. Instead of Scotia’s name appearing on the property deeds, Jones and another Jirehouse colleague would be listed as the property’s owners. McKay panicked when he heard this, but Jones reassured him. Jirehouse would be holding the house on trust for him and his family, he said, so it would still technically belong to them. McKay continued to worry. He couldn’t shake the feeling that it wasn’t him who owned his new house – it was Jones.Jirehouse’s offices occupied two townhouses on John Street, a short walk from the British Museum. The five-storey building had an olive green front door, a stone portico and black metal railings. The firm gave the impression of a private office that dealt with old money. Its meeting rooms were wood-panelled, its letters to clients were printed on creamy Conqueror paper, and its business cards were embossed with a curling coat of arms. Jones had previously worked at two magic circle firms, Freshfields and Slaughter and May, and Jirehouse’s senior team included solicitors with similarly elite backgrounds. “I was kind of in awe of the place,” said one former employee, James (not his real name). “If you hadn’t come into contact with that world before, it could be intimidating.”Of the 30 people I spoke to about Jones – former clients, business associates, employees, schoolfriends and neighbours – one description kept cropping up: “English gentleman.” The firm he had built recalled a time when the City was run on handshakes between men in bowler hats who dined at clubs in St James’s. (Jones himself was a member of the Carlton Club, where the Conservative party was founded.) “It’s old values. And old values probably on the basis of which the City of London was built,” he told the Telegraph Business Club, a media channel that created ashort advertorial videoabout Jirehouse.View image in fullscreenStephen David Jones.Photograph: No creditTowards his staff, Jones behaved with the generosity of a Victorian patron. Jirehouse sponsored staff visas and paid for law school training for some paralegals. One of Jones’s closest associates, Zuleyha Tohtayeva, began as a barista whom Jones recruited from a nearby branch of Starbucks. Tohtayeva, who was from Turkmenistan, had scant legal experience when she joined the firm as a secretary in 2008, but she quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a paralegal and then a senior associate. “He enjoyed ‘rescuing’ people,” James told me.This benevolence stemmed from Jones’s Christian faith, which shaped the firm itself. He attended All Souls Church in Langham Place, and later joined the congregation at Holy Trinity Brompton, a wealthy evangelical church in Knightsbridge. “HTB”, as the church is known, is where the Alpha Course, an evangelistic programme aimed at sceptics, was first invented. The hedge fund manager Paul Marshall, who founded GB News, sits on its outreach board.At work, Jones sometimes signed off emails with “Much love in Christ, Stephen”, or “Blessings, Stephen”. He would occasionally read a passage from the Bible at the Monday morning staff meeting, and he was particularly fond of Hebrew references. Amezuzahwas affixed to Jirehouse’s doorway, though Jones was not Jewish, and legal documents would sometimes be stapled with a small paper triangle printed with “Isaiah 62: 6-7”,a reference toan Old Testament versein which watchmen, posted on the walls of Jerusalem, keep an eye over God’s kingdom. “He really felt what he was doing, that there was some kind of higher calling,” said another former employee, Sarah (not her real name).Looking back now, after the truth about Jones’s transgressions have come to light, it is hard not to search for clues. If his piety was sincere, the effort he put into cultivating his gentlemanly image suggested an underlying insecurity. In the Telegraphvideo, his voice sometimes slips from received pronunciation into something less plummy. Former Jirehouse staff I interviewed couldn’t tell me anything about Jones’s background except that he had worked at magic circle firms. “At the time, I just perceived him to be very posh. And it’s weird saying that … because I’m not sure I’d think that any more. I’d think of him more as a blank now,” said James. The absence of other details about his life before Jirehouse was striking. Where did he come from? Whowashe, really? Last autumn, I contacted his brother, Tim, asking to talk.“Perhaps we should meet,” Tim wrote back. “It’s a long painful story … the roots of my brother’s downfall started many years ago.”On a windy autumn day, I met Tim Jones at the bar of the St Pancras hotel in King’s Cross, London. Tim is an infrastructure consultant whose demeanour flits between easy-going humour and pained introspection. He knew Jones not as “Stephen David”, but as “Steve”, and over the following months, we had a series of long and occasionally painful conversations in which Tim seemed to find a kind of catharsis. “It says in the Bible that the truth will set you free,” he told me. “Maybe this is part of my own road to freedom.”From an early age, Stephen possessed a remarkable charm, a confidence that bordered on hubris, and a talent for identifying people richer than himself. “He would make you feel as though you were the only person in the room,” said Tim. “He’d ask you questions about you. He never drew a two-way conversation. He would always flip it back to you.” Tim was the eldest of five children; Stephen was born 19 months after him, in September 1959. Their father was a chartered surveyor and their mother worked as a medical secretary. Tim, Stephen, their two younger brothers and their sister grew up in Luton, a predominantly working-class town north of London. Their family didn’t have much money, but neither did most people in their neighbourhood. Their parents emphasised honesty, hard work and devotion to God.The Jones family worshipped at a church on a council estate that belonged to the Open Brethren, a conservative strand of evangelical Christianity. The schedule was intense. Saturday was devoted to Bible study and Sunday was for church service. There was a prayer meeting on Monday evening and a Bible reading on Wednesday, and in their free time people were expected to go “tracting” – knocking on doors and pushing slivers of paper through letterboxes to spread the word of Jesus Christ. “It was continual,” said Tim. “You rarely got time to yourself.”At the Brethren church, Stephen befriended a man called Godfrey Henderson, who lived in a Victorian house a stone’s throw from the Joneses. His home was cosy and cluttered: the Aga stacked with pans, the shelves lined with bottled fruit. Henderson was a consultant anaesthetist in the NHS, and Tim sensed that he gave Stephen a view into a life that was larger and more worldly than his own. Henderson frequently travelled abroad for missionary and surgery work, subscribed to Reader’s Digest and National Geographic, and would take thumbed copies of the Guardian to read at the theatre during intervals. The two would chat about Henderson’s missionary work. Sometimes, Stephen tended to the house while he was abroad. “And it kind of elevated Steve,” Tim recalled.The Jones children studied at local comprehensive schools, and Stephen was the first in his family to go to university. He enrolled at the University of Reading to read law in 1979, and after graduating he joined Freshfields, a prestigious law firm in London. Stephen had always been academically gifted, and his parents sometimes seemed in awe of him. “It was always Tim who would get punished, and Stephen would get away with it,” recalled a close family friend. “Stephen could do no wrong.”Once he’d started working in the city, Stephen would bring exotic cheeses and champagne to family gatherings. When his parents visited London, Jones put them up in five-star hotels. During one of our conversations, Tim mentioned the story of Jacob and Esau, twin brothers in the Book of Genesis. Jacob tricks their blind father, Isaac, into giving him the birthright blessing that was intended for Esau, the first born, causing a lifelong rift between them. “Steve always said he should have been born the first son,” Tim said. Stephen onceincorporated a companywith a client called Prodigal Son Ltd.In 1992, Stephen moved to Slaughter and May in Hong Kong. He quit the firm just two years later, having a crisis of faith about his career path. After taking a course at a school for missionaries, he spent six months travelling. “Whilst in Armenia I felt there was a need to bring to third world countries […] God’s principles of running an economy,” Jones wrote in a newsletter he sent to his friends and family in December 1995. “I fear in the west we have much to learn on this account and much to unlearn.”His experiences abroad convinced Jones to pursue a different career path, so he set up a trading operation shipping walnuts and coffee from India to Armenia. He described his ambitions, somewhat grandly, as “establishing bilateral trade between the Christians in these countries”. He named the company Jirehouse, after the Hebrew word for God’s provision,Jireh,and a reference to the house of God. But despite Jones’s efforts, it didn’t take off. By 2003, the missionary that Jones had recruited to help run the business had left.Jones then pivoted to a more familiar field from his time in the City: tax law. Jirehouse recruited a Jersey-based director, and in 2004 the firm openedan office on Nevis, a jurisdiction that allows people to sequester wealth with greater secrecy than just about anywhere else in the world. Among tax lawyers, the island has a seamy reputation. Two KCs I spoke to told me they made a point of not dealing with businesses registered there, owing to its reputation for tax evasion. To Jones, though, the secrecy of the island was central to its appeal.Soon after Jirehouse opened its office in Nevis, Jones acquired about three hectares of land on Herbert’s Beach, a prime strip of Atlantic waterfront, and used his local contacts to wrangle a permit that would allow him to build a holiday resort. He convinced Tim to invest a total of £500,000 in this project, which would be called Ocean Reef Resorts.When Tim flew out to Nevis in July 2006, two things struck him. First, the island’s tropical beauty, and second, the corruptibly close relationship between lawmakers and businessmen. “These are people that do not believe they function within the law,” Tim told me. To them, “the law is there to be played with, to be challenged, to be got round, to be manipulated”.In 2005, Jones was introduced to a brash property developer called Scot Young. His residences included a large villa in a luxurious Miami suburb, a rectory house in Oxfordshire, a house near Regent’s Park and an apartment in Knightsbridge. He socialised with Russian business people in London, including Boris Berezovsky and his business partner Ruslan Fomichev, a property developer. “Back then, London was friendly to foreigners,” Vasily Peganov, Fomichev’s business partner, told me. “They respected the money.”In February 2005, Fomichev invited Young to invest in a property deal to redevelop land in the centre of Moscow. “I knew, at the time, that I did not have this amount of money and would need to bring in other investors,” Young later recalled. Beneath a veneer of boundless wealth, he was financially stretched. Young owed the Bank of Scotland just over £25m and his creditors were beginning to circle. After one of the investors in the Moscow deal issued a freezing order against Young for £2.35m, and the Bank of Scotland called in some of its loans, he declared insolvency.View image in fullscreenTaymouth Castle near Kenmore, Perthshire.Photograph: Robert Harding/AlamyJones agreed to step in and clean up the mess that Young had created. It was a huge opportunity to burnish his credentials with a group of very wealthy businessmen, and he helped devise a plan whereby a new company bought out the investors whom Young had recruited. His solution earned Jones the respect of Fomichev and his business partner, Peganov. Both men were still recent arrivals in London, and Jones quickly assumed the role of well-connected fixer. He introduced Fomichev and Peganov to private bankers. He set up trust structures to manage their wealth. He advised them on their tax affairs. “We trusted him,” Peganov recalled. “We became friends.”Jones grew more comfortable asking his new clients for favours. In 2011, he approached Fomichev for a loan, promising him a monthly interest rate that was higher than he would get at a bank. Jones explained that the loan would provide funding for his clients’ projects – McKay’s golf course, a hotel in Iceland owned by another client – and that it would be secured against these assets. Over time, Jones borrowed more and more money from Fomichev, always explaining that the loans were intended for client projects. Fomichev saw no reason to disbelieve him, and Jones was never late in paying the interest. During this time, Jones was expanding his operation, opening outposts in Switzerland, Cyprus and Luxembourg.Increasingly, Jones was behaving more like a financial matchmaker than a lawyer, encouraging his clients to invest in one another’s projects, and sometimes investing in them himself. In 2013, he told Ewan McKay that he had found a Swiss gem dealer who wanted to invest €6m in his golf course project in St Andrews. The businessmen who had brokered the deal wanted £125,000 commission, and both the commission and the €6m would be paid in cash. Bruce McKay, Ewan’s son, thought it strange that the gem dealer wanted to pay in cash, and even stranger that Jones insisted that Bruce withdraw the £125,000 commission from a money transfer shop in Streatham, south London, rather than a bank. “The excuse was, it will get held up in the bank, and drawing that amount of currency from one account would raise question marks,” Bruce told me. When he went to the money transfer shop, he found a “guy was bundling the money into 25k bundles, and putting them into what looked to me like the bags to pick up my dog turds”.After he collected the money, Bruce and his father drove overnight from London to Milan, where they picked Jones up from the airport the next morning. Their meeting with the gem dealer was due to take place at the Grand Visconti Palace hotel, and Jones had brought a bag containing a change of clothes and a money counter. Bruce had transferred the £125,000 into a briefcase. The three men pulled into the hotel’s underground car park and took the lift to the lobby.When they arrived, Bruce sensed that something wasn’t right. An S-Class Mercedes was parked outside the building’s entrance. Inside the lobby, two men in shiny, ill-fitting suits were waiting for them. The two men greeted Jones, snatched his bag off his shoulder, flung a large sports bag at the lawyer, and rushed out of the lobby and into the car, which sped off. It took a moment for Bruce to realise what had happened. “It was one of those ‘Are you shitting me?’ moments,” he recalled. “And I was like, ‘Dad, this is a fucking heist.’”The two thieves had taken Jones’s bag in the belief that it contained £125,000. Thankfully, Ewan was still clutching the briefcase that contained the money, but once the thieves discovered they had stolen a bag that contained nothing more than a money counter and some spare clothes, Bruce figured they’d be back. Panicking, he rushed his father and Jones down to the car park. Ewan opened the sports bag once they were in the Range Rover. “Immediately I realised it was full of forged notes,” he recalled.Bruce drove them as fast as he could towards the Swiss border, heading for Jirehouse’s office in Lausanne. Jones was sitting in the middle seat in the back, and seemed visibly distressed. “He was squealing like a girl,” Bruce said. “He kept saying, they’d spent so long going over the contract, back and forth, back and forth, and why would you spend so much time on a contract that was meaningless?”Once they arrived at the Lausanne office, Jones tried to put Ewan and Bruce’s minds at ease. But the relationship was irrevocably damaged. “I said, Bruce, we’ve made a hell of a mistake. This guy doesn’t know what he’s doing,” Ewan recalled. The Milan fiasco had revealed two major flaws in the gentleman lawyer. He was willing to get involved with disreputable characters, and he was entirely naive about the risks of doing so.Yet it turned out to be extremely difficult for McKay to disentangle himself from Jones. “He held the purse strings for everything,” Bruce told me. “He was God.” When McKay was diagnosed with lung and prostate cancer the following year, it became ever harder for him to keep track of the complex network of companies that Jones had created for his family. Bruce visited Jones while his father was recovering from chemotherapy, and the lawyer seemed kind and understanding. “He said, don’t worry, we’re your pals, let’s just concentrate on your dad’s health,” Bruce told me. “And there’s always a small bit of you that hopes your gut feeling is wrong.”Some of Jones’s associates made his staff nervous. More than once while reporting this piece, I was told that I ought to be “careful”, the implication being that not everyone who Jones had worked with respected the law. Almost everyone mentioned Scot Young, who fell from a fourth-floor apartment in Marylebone in 2014 and was impaled on the railings below. It was possible that his death was a suicide, but his family suspected something more nefarious. According to aBuzzFeed investigation, Young had become so worried about being assassinated in the months before his death that he sought protection from a criminal gang. Four of his associates, including the oligarch Boris Berezovsky, had recently died in similarly mysterious circumstances.Even so, the Metropolitan police declared Young’s death unsuspicious. A coroner later found that his death could not beruled a suicide, but since the police have never reopened the case, the exact cause of death remains a source of speculation and conspiracy. Michelle Young, Scot’s ex-wife, who filed for divorce in 2007, insisted to me that Scot’s financial meltdown was a ruse devised by Jones to obscure Young’s financial assets, and thus deprive her of a fair divorce settlement. In March 2006, Scot had given power of attorney to Jones, allowing himcontrol of his business interestsin the Moscow property deal, which Jones then shifted to Nevis. One theory, suggested to me by Michelle, is that Jones made off with these assets. Another possibility is that the assets were never as valuable as Scot made out. (“Young had been running empty for years,” Fomichev told me. “He was buying properties, mortgaging them immediately to buy another property. It was like a big card game.”)What is certain is that, like Scot Young, Jones was pretending to be something he wasn’t, socialising with people richer than himself, and projecting an aura of success that was untethered from reality. Gradually, Jirehouse’s office began to symbolise the gulf between Jones’s self-image and the dissolution that lay beneath. On the outside, it was grand and beautiful but in the basement, the kitchen was sometimes populated with slugs, and staff would take turns on “dishcloth duty”, since the cleaner only visited once a week. Sarah, the former Jirehouse employee, told me that the rent would often be paid late, and that Jones would sometimes challenge the landlord over spurious issues, such as the state of the garden or right to light.Jones was also getting into serious debt. He had racked up a large bill with the law firm Mishcon de Reya, following an unsuccessful court case he pursued against Young’s former lawyer, and had resorted to borrowing half a million pounds from Fomichev to settle his bill. He was also struggling to get the Nevis development off the ground. His brother, Tim, had been trying since 2008 to retrieve the money that he had invested in the project. It was only when Tim threatened to bar Stephen from his son’s wedding in 2015 that he finally stumped up some of the money. At the wedding, Stephen seemed stressed. He mostly stayed in his hotel room, taking work calls and firing off emails, and appeared only briefly at the meal.View image in fullscreenThe island of Nevis in the Caribbean Sea.Photograph: Sean Pavone/Alamy“I really think Stephen felt he was due a big payday, provided he could keep his head above water for a period of time,” said Sarah. “I’ve got friends who work in professional services like this … they always think, ‘My next move is going to be the big one, I’ll be managing director at JP Morgan, and all this debt I’ve incurred will be sorted out.’” More than one former client told me that rather than ringfencing their money in Jirehouse’s bank account, they later learned that Jones had been dipping into this account whenever he had a cashflow problem or urgently needed to repay a debt. “I get the impression it was just one big pot of money, and whoever shouted the loudest would get paid back from it,” said Bruce McKay. Yet there also seemed to be a hierarchy. While Fomichev always received the interest repayment on the loans each month, the McKay family often found it impossible to get Jirehouse to administer payments from their family trust.It is impossible to pinpoint exactly when Jones crossed the line from using tax avoidance strategies for his clients to fleecing those clients. Having pushed so aggressively against the boundaries of UK tax laws, perhaps it wasn’t surprising that Jones found himself tempted to go one step further and break the law himself. In 2009, Jirehouse organised a loan for £300,000, which was secured against McKay’s house in Angus. McKay was not informed. In 2015, Jirehouse took out a loan for £826,880 from a lender that specialised in high-interest sub-prime mortgages. The loan was secured against the land where McKay was building a golf course, and against his new bungalow. It bore monthly interest of 1.5% – amounting to a steep annual interest rate of 18%. Once again, McKay said this was done behind his back.The deeper Jones went into debt, the bolder he grew. “All it takes is a couple of bad decisions for you to be in £2m of debt, and then in a year’s time it becomes £2.5m, and then that becomes £3m,” said Fomichev. Vasily Peganov told me that between 2014 and 2016, Jirehouse took out two loans secured against his flat in Belgravia; the first for £1.6m and the second for £3.1m. At the time, Peganov said he knew nothing about either of them.Many of Jirehouse’s London staff lacked the blue-chip credentials one might expect from a boutique tax firm serving high net worth clients. “The majority of young people there wouldn’t have been able to get a job elsewhere,” said James, the former Jirehouse staff member. Jones took pride in the firm’s cosmopolitanism, andJirehouse advertisedthat its staff spoke Pashto, Russian, Serbo-Croat and Turkmen. Sarah speculated that there was another reason Jones liked to surround himself with people on work visas. “It meant that a) they probably didn’t know what was going on, and b) if they did, their primary concern was protecting their work status.”Not all of Jirehouse’s staff remained silent. Three former staff members contacted the Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA). One, who wrote to the regulator in 2010, was concerned that the firm was struggling to pay its debts. Another reported the firm in 2013 and said that Jones appeared to be borrowing money against his clients’ assets. That same year, a third whistleblower wrote that “Mr Jones is taking funds from the business in what appears to be an inappropriate manner”. According to them, Jones even paid for his son’s school fees at Eton using Jirehouse’s money.The SRA has far-reaching powers to investigate any law firm in England. It can turn up unannounced, appeal to an independent panel to close a firm, demand that staff hand over their computers and seize documents. It can refer solicitors to a disciplinary tribunal that can impose unlimited fines, strip solicitors of their practising certificates and bar them from ever working again. But the two whistleblowers I spoke to felt the SRA hadn’t taken their complaints seriously enough. The SRA typically gives law firms seven days’ notice if it intends to visit – a precious window of opportunity. Not long after one of the whistleblowers had reported Jirehouse, Sarah told me that they got a call from a former colleague who still worked there. The colleague said:“[The SRA] told us they’re coming in next week. So I’ve spent all night shredding documents and writing up new ones.”Most of Jones’s clients were newly wealthy men who were strangers to the upper rungs of the British class system. Most of them were multimillionaires, not billionaires. But in the spring of 2018, Jones was introduced to a more powerful and sophisticated client. Discovery Land Company was a US property firm that built high-end holiday resorts. The company was owned in part by John Paul DeJoria, a self-made California billionaire. Discovery wanted to buy Taymouth Castle, a grand Victorian estate in the Scottish Highlands, in order to develop it into a luxury golf club with a cluster of new private houses. DeJoria was adamant that his identity remain a secret, lest the seller of the castle use DeJoria’s immense wealth as a bargaining chip to secure a higher purchase price.Jones advised that if Discovery wanted to keep DeJoria’s name a secret, they should use one of Jones’s companies, Esquiline Asset Managers, to buy the castle. In April 2018, Discovery wired$14,050,000to Jirehouse’s client account to cover the castle purchase. On 6 December, one day before the sale was due to complete, Jones emailed explaining that there had been a hitch. Jirehouse needed time to undertake “compliance checks” on some of the money. To prevent the sale from falling through, Jones asked Discovery to send an additional $9.3m, which would cover the funds that were still being checked. In effect, Jones was asking the company to pay for the castle twice, but he assured Discovery’s lawyers that once these checks were done, Jirehouse would refund this $9.3m promptly.Discovery sent the money across, and the purchase of Taymouth Castle completed. But by the end of December, they were still waiting on a refund. DeJoria and the firm’s owners were growing increasingly suspicious. They hired Gibson Dunn, a major international law firm, to investigate the transaction. By February 2019, Jones had agreed with Gibson Dunn’s lawyers that Jirehouse would put the funds it was holding on behalf of Discovery into aseparate bank account. Once the checks were complete, Discovery would get its money back.Then, in March 2019, Discovery found that Jirehouse had taken out a £5m loan against Taymouth Castle from a small mortgage company called Dragonfly Finance. “The delays in returning the moneys were suspicious enough, but discovering that Jones had borrowed money against the property without telling the client was on a completely different level,” recalled Ed Levey KC, Discovery’s barrister. Levey applied for a freezing order against Esquiline Asset Managers, the company Jones controlled, and at a hearing held at the high court in London on Friday 15 March, Jones gave an “undertaking” – a legally binding promise – to pay back the money he owed to Discovery by 4pm on Tuesday the following week.View image in fullscreenJohn Paul DeJoria in West Hollywood, March 2023.Photograph: Amy Sussman/Getty ImagesBut on the following Monday, Jones tried to wriggle out of his undertaking. He told the court that he realised the money he owed to Discovery happened to be in what he called, obliquely, a “longer-term investment portfolio”. Levey told me that Jones looked like someone “who knew the house of cards he’d built was about to topple over”. If Jones failed to fulfil the undertaking, there was a risk that he would be guilty of contempt of court – which could carry a prison sentence. His other clients were starting to suspect their money wasn’t safe. In April 2019, Fomichev didn’t receive the monthly interest payment on his loans. Peganov’s ex-wife received emails from Harrow and Westminster, the schools her sons attended, informing her that the fees which were usually paid out of their family trust were late. Jones hosted an emergency meeting the following month at the Halkin hotel near Buckingham Palace with his wealthiest clients (Ewan and Bruce McKay weren’t invited). “He was trying to persuade everybody that he would repay everything,” said Fomichev. The mood was strained, and Jones gave his apologies with the sombre conviction of a disgraced MP.Yet Jones still seemed confident that he could fix the problems he had created. “It was quite extraordinary that he remained so placid, so positive about his capacity to move things forward,” recalled Kevin, a Jirehouse colleague (not their real name). “If anything, he wastooat ease.” Jones wouldn’t be able to keep practising as a lawyer in Britain after Discovery had taken him to court, but he seemed unperturbed. “He was saying, it doesn’t matter if I get struck off. I’ve got job offers from entities in Switzerland,” recalled Bruce McKay.Jones remained calm even on Friday 3 May, when the SRA turned up at his offices and informed him, while he was walking down the stairs to greet them, that he was formally suspended. A team of three officers went from floor to floor, seizing laptops and ensuring nobody was shredding documents. Over the next four days, contractors employed by the SRA collected nearly 1,500 boxes of files from Jirehouse’s Bloomsbury offices and storage facilities in Oxford and Essex. Nine years after the first whistleblower had contacted the SRA about Jirehouse, the regulator finally started gearing up to have Jones suspended.In the end, the courts decided the matter ahead of the SRA. At a hearing on 16 August 2019, Antony Zacaroli, a high court judge, sentenced Jones to 14 months in prison onfour counts of contempt. Once he was sentenced, Jones was struck off the solicitor’s roll. His mother, his wife and his son all turned out to the high court of justice in London to watch the judge deliver the sentence. For a solicitor who seemed to think he was above the law, it was an extraordinary fall from grace. “When he got that one year [sentence] for contempt, I felt almost a sense of disappointment,” said Sarah. “I thought, this issuchfertile ground … like, hold on, there’s clearly an awful lot more here to uncover.”Once Jones arrived in Pentonville prison, he wrote a letter to Ewan McKay. By this point, McKay had grown to despise Jones. But he was also wary of alienating the lawyer, fearing that doing so would only make it more difficult to regain control of his assets. “The number of times [Jones] basically threw the toys out of the pram because Dad had got frustrated,” Bruce McKay recalled. “And I would come in as the mediator and calm things down.”Ewan McKay read the blithe tone of Jones’s letter as an insult. “Time seems to have slipped by quickly since the fateful day of 16 August,” Jones wrote. “Once inside, one is so immune to daily life on the outside and therefore the personal impact will only be really felt on release.” Jones did not seem contrite. He twice reminded McKay in his letter that he was a “civil” prisoner, underlining the word “civil” for emphasis. “Most people wonder why I am even here and appear more discerning than a high court judge,” he wrote.In a letter he wrote to Tim, however, Jones seemed less confident. “How I ended up in this position I do not know,” he said. “Sixty years seem to have evaporated into nothing.” He was particularly concerned that the judge had referred the case to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). There certainly seemed to be sufficient evidence to mount a criminal prosecution: Jones had allegedly stolen more than $9m from a client, secretly taken out a mortgage on their castle, and refused to say where he had hidden their money. But when Discovery’s barrister, Stephen Kay KC, wrote to the police to ask about the status of their investigations 18 months after they had received the case, he was shocked by the response. “The file had been sent, and that was it. They had done nothing,” Kay told me.A poorer businessman might have decided to cut their losses at this point, but DeJoria was a billionaire. “John Paul has the capacity to take things through right the way to the end, which no one else could afford to do,” said Henry Anderson, a property developer and friend of DeJoria’s who had been acting as Discovery’s UK agent. “What Stephen did was the equivalent of being the skinniest, tiniest guy and walking up to the biggest bruiser in the playground and throwing a punch in his stomach.”When the police decline to investigate a crime and the CPS therefore doesn’t prosecute, the only option for a person seeking justice is to pursue what’s known as a “private prosecution”, which can be prohibitively expensive. The rise in these private prosecutions has coincided withdeep cuts to the criminal justice system, and there is now a growing industry of lawyers serving wealthy individuals who can afford to pay for justice, just as they pay for private schools and private healthcare.Kay’s team already had a mountain of evidence, but Jones had proved himself a master escape artist. Having served his sentence for contempt, Jones was now out of prison and living back in Little Venice, where he had cultivated an interest in gardening, Tim told me. Over the two-year period leading up to the criminal trial, Jones changed his team of defence lawyers twice, which delayed the trial. A date was finally set for November 2022.Discovery’s case hinged on a simple premise. “The money had gone. It had never been accounted for,” Kay said. Rather than getting into complex questions involving the mechanics of offshore finance, Kay would focus on the key issue. Jones had long denied any allegations of criminality, so Kay planned to ask him one question: “Where is the money?” If he couldn’t answer, this would surely establish his guilt.The hearing at Southwark crown court in November 2022 could have been a theatrical final act, in which Jones finally confessed his crimes during a hostile cross-examination. But a few days before the trial began, Jones decided to plead guilty to fraud. He didn’t give evidence, he wasn’t cross examined and, on the day of his sentencing, he quietly filed into the dock, wearing apink checked shirtand a blazer, and carrying a Waitrose tote bag. The judge was contemptuous, calling Jones’s actions a “rank act of dishonesty”. Then, addressing Jones directly, he said: “Your heart must have leapt when you heard the CPS and the police had decided not to prosecute such an obviously prosecutable case.” He sentenced Jones to 12 years in prison. It is one of the longest criminal sentences a British lawyer has ever received.Only Jones, and perhaps a small handful of individuals, know exactly what he did with the money. One theory is that he spent it on repaying existing debts. “Ten million sounds like a lot, but he probably spent it very quickly in just patching things up,” Fomichev told me. Another theory is that Jones pocketed Discovery’s money, stashed it in Nevis, and is counting down the days until he can enjoy it in his retirement. The mystery of what, ultimately, compelled Jones to steal the money is no less murky. Perhaps he was worried about something more threatening than a prison sentence. “He might be spending the rest of his life looking over his shoulder, because look at what happened to Scot Young,” said Sarah. Another lawyer who was familiar with Jones suggested that his reasons had more to do with arrogance. “I don’t think he knew he would get caught, or that he couldn’t replace the cash.” (I wrote to Jones in prison, asking if he would like to speak for this article, but did not hear back.)After a protracted legal battle, Jirehouse’s insurer, Axis, was forced to pay out $7m to Discovery Land inearly 2024. The case has given some of Jones’s former clients hope. After Jirehouse went into administration, Fomichev, who lent about £15m to Jones, learned that these loans weren’t actually secured against anything. There was therefore little he could lay claim to. His trust is now pursuing Axis through the courts for £20m. So, too, is Peganov’s family trust. He and his ex-wife are at risk of losing their apartment in Belgravia, since one of Jirehouse’s creditors is attempting to repossess it.Ewan McKay has lost almost everything. He said that Jones had drained his family trust, mortgaged the land intended for his golf course and mortgaged his bungalow. The land for the golf course was seized by Jirehouse’s creditors, and McKay and his wife are planning to move house in order to pay off the mortgage. Until then, McKay will still have a direct view of the golf course, which is now being redeveloped by another company. “Dad’s looking over the fence at someone else building out his dream,” said Bruce.Jones’s clients often asked me how any of this could happen in a country that prided itself on the rule of law. “The legal system in the UK is built to screw people,” Peganov said. There are likely to be many more characters like Jones who never end up in prison because they were not foolish or desperate enough to target someone as rich as DeJoria. “There are scammers left, right and centre, because they know the police won’t touch them,” said Kay, the criminal barrister. “Jones was in that category, too … he was calculating that he could get away with it. And the attitude of the CPS and the police completely proved that point.” (An SRA spokesperson told me that Jirehouse was “a complex case”, and that the original reports from whistleblowers did not provide enough evidence for them to intervene. “When we did get evidence of misconduct, we took action,” they said. The CPS told me that although it provided “early investigative advice” to the police, it was never asked to consider charges and it can only begin criminal proceedings once the police have investigated. The Metropolitan police did not respond to my request for comment, nor my interview requests.)Nevis: how the world’s most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean upRead moreFor Tim Jones, the money he lost from investing in his brother’s property development felt less significant than the sense of betrayal. Though his parents regularly visit Stephen in prison, and Stephen has recently been transferred to a lower security facility, where he is allowed to make day visits to his family, Tim has never been to see him, because Stephen has never fully acknowledged the pain he has caused.Stephen seemed to be approaching his sentence as though it were merely another chapter in his Christian mission. He had been teaching the Alpha Course to his fellow inmates, Tim said.It was difficult to tell from Stephen’s letters whether he was truly remorseful, or whether this remorse was just another calculated performance. In February 2023, Stephen sent Tim a watercolour he had painted of a sunset. The apology, scrawled on the reverse of the painting, is almost illegible.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.This article was amended on 13 May 2025 for editorial reasons.Explore more on these topicsThe long readCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Hasan Piker, a popular streamer with4.5 million followersacross YouTube and Twitch, who has been hailed by mainstream publications such as the New Yorker andNew York Timesas the left’s answer to the deluge of rightwing internet influencers, says he wasdetained and questioned for hoursby border control agents as he re-entered the US (Piker is a US citizen). It is an instructive moment. Countries that behave like this towards political commentators and dissenting voices who are their own citizens are either nakedly authoritarian, or well on the way.Piker was reportedly interrogated at length not just aboutHamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, but his views on Donald Trump. The 33-year-old pundit – an unapologetic champion of the Palestinian cause – stuck to a message of opposing “endless bloodshed” and siding with civilians. That the biggest progressive streamer in the US was subjected to this experience is emblematic of a phenomenon that requires an accurate and insistent description: it is the biggest assault on free speech in the west since the height of McCarthyism seven decades ago.When foreign-born citizens – including green card holders – began to bedetainedby US authorities over their opposition to Israel’s genocide, it should have been clear that this was just phase one: US citizens would be next. Sure, Piker wasn’t arrested, but the authorities are pushing the boundaries bit by bit. Thenumbers of foreign visitorsentering the US are falling as it is, undoubtedly driven by fears of a punitive border regime. But Piker’s detention sends a message to Americans with dissenting opinions – not least opponents of Israel’s genocide. The threat of being stopped at the border and subjected to lengthy interrogation simply because of what you think is straightforward political intimidation. It won’t stop there.That the vice-president, JD Vance,railed against Europefor a supposed war on free speech underlines what a sham this favoured narrative of the right always was. Weeks later, his boss announced that universities allowing “illegal” protests would bestarved of federal cash– with Columbia University losing $400m despite having clamped down on pro-Palestinian protests – and dissenting students would be variously expelled, arrested, imprisoned or deported. Alas, it was under the Biden administration that the McCarthyite blacklisting-style campaign began, with defenders of Palestinian rights being variouslydeplatformed,firedandthreatened.Indeed, Vance could have noted how European countries such as Germany have assaulted free speech by silencing pro-Palestinian activists: from imposingcrippling restrictions on protestsandviolently assaultingdemonstrators toshutting down conferences,sackingpeople who speak out and now seeking todeport activists, too. Alas, it’s not really free speech that Vance is interested in, but rather advancing far-right politics.If we’re going to discuss who is being stopped at the border, let’s discuss the astonishing 23,380US citizens who serve in the IDF, according to figures quoted in the Washington Post a year ago. Many of them are undoubtedly committing unspeakable war crimes in Israel’s genocidal onslaught. Yet they are being waved through the border. And that really sums it up. If like Piker, you speak out against genocide, you are liable to be treated as a criminal as you enter your own country. If you’re a US citizen serving in a foreign army committing heinous atrocities, you’re more likely to be treated as a hero.

It’s no wonder they’re angryTue 13 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 06.35 EDTShareIt’s boomerang season again. Or to put it another way, the time of year when adult children you imagined might be flying the nest come home instead to roost, a ritual that seems to happen earlier every year.Though the university year isn’t formally finished yet, so many institutions are dumping written exams in favour of dissertations or online assessments (cheaper to run, apparently) that third years have started cutting their losses and their food bills by heading home not long after Easter. In a worrying number of cases, they’re leaving with no job to go to.Young people in line for good degrees from good Russell Group universities, who have for years obediently jumped through every hoop provided, are working in bars, going travelling, or despondently applying to companies that they know use AI not only to sift their CVs, but sometimes to conduct first interviews. Imagine sitting alone in front of a webcam, trying to land your first proper job and being evaluated by a bot with whom you can’t even shake hands, let alone kindle memories of how hard it was getting a foot in the door when they were young. Rejection is tough enough when it comes with an encouraging letter about how you were just pipped to the post, never mind being found wanting by an algorithm.Meanwhile LinkedIn – and yes, students have all been on LinkedIn for years – only feeds the gnawing fear that other people seemingly have their futures much more sorted, just as Instagram used to feed theirteenage anxieties about who was going to all the parties. You can covertly stalk whoever did get that grad scheme position, and beat yourself up wondering what they’ve got that you evidently haven’t.Last year’s Institute of Student Employersrecruitment surveyrecorded a ratio of 140 applications for every graduate job. Part of the reason for that deluge of applicants is perhapsbecause kids who suspect their forms won’t be read by humans anyway are using ChatGPT to fill in and fire them off en masse, to the point where AI is in effect talking to AI. That’s not making recruitment more efficient but the opposite, leaving employers swamped with poorly targeted CVs and jobseekers unsurprisingly resentful. And the hunger games may well be tougher this year, with thelabour market slowing downamid national insurance rises and trade war-fuelled uncertainty.Returning to my old Cambridge college recently, a place where you’d imagine students would feel they’ve won the golden ticket, I was struck by the number who still didn’t know what they would be doing when they graduated and by the sense that they had resigned themselves to a very long haul.If it’s tough for them, it’s invariably worse for others: student Reddit threads hum with angry, despairing stories about firing off hundreds of applications and trekking to endless assessment centres all to no avail, interspersed with frequent advice to move abroad because Britain’s finished.It’s the betrayal that hurts. We drilled it into them that if they worked hard at school and made it into university then the world could be their oyster, but our stagnant economy just hasn’t generated enough graduate-level jobs to match – especially outside London, where we have simultaneously managed to ensure most of them can’t actually afford to live. That translates into a glut of applicants, winnowed down to manageable levels by employers continually raising the bar: even a degree is no longer enough for the most coveted graduate schemes, with a master’s fast becoming the new expectation. But since universities can charge whatever fees they want for postgrad studies –more than £83,000for an MBA at Oxford’s swanky Saïd Business School, to take one extreme example – this risks making certain professions ever more the preserve of the wealthy, pricing everyone else’s children out of an educational arms race.And all the time,AI is stealthily creeping up on the entry-level jobsthey’re chasing. The tasks companies tend to give to young, green trainees – the routine grunt work they can’t easily mess up, which can be swiftly checked by someone more senior – are most vulnerable to automation precisely because they’re routine. Baby lawyers learn the ropes by drawing up endless contracts, but AI can do that in seconds. It’s probably capable of many things young journalists start out by doing too, like turning a simple press release into a story (or more depressingly, scraping clickbait content off rival websites). But if companies automate away the bottom rung of the ladder, how do you reach the next rung up? Tellingly, the job search site Adzuna reports a steeper drop in graduate opportunities than non-grad ones, according to an analysisshared this week with the Financial Times. The most critical shortages are in low-paid jobs such as care work, which can only be done for now by a real live human.If it’s any comfort to their anxious parents, most of this year’s boomerang kids will find their feet eventually. They might take longer to get where they want, and via more circuitous routes than in the past, but the current economic uncertainty can’t last for ever, and the jobs they’re qualified to do – if they can only get a foot in the door – still carry a lifetime premium. The ones to worry about are the kids who can’t, or won’t, go back home while they wait for something to turn up.We can’t keep doing this to young people and then be surprised when they’re angry. If we keep whipping them through the education system on the promise their efforts will be rewarded, and then fail to deliver, sooner or later, the consequences will boomerang back on us.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

But at least we know if Mounjaro or Wegovy is better for weight lossZoe WilliamsI was recently asked to explain the media’s attitude to weight loss drugs. And the more I tried, the more sheepish I becameTue 13 May 2025 06.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 06.46 EDTShare‘Why you might be given the ‘second-best’ weight-loss drug”, ranthe i’s coverageof the most recentresearch findings: Mounjaro is officially more effective than Wegovy. And there are plenty of perfectly sensible reasons. Wegovy, which produces an average weight loss of 14%, might suit you fine. It’s the only drug approved for reducing the risk of a major cardiovascular event because it’s been on the market for longer. Mounjaro, reducing weight by 20%, might end up on top in the long run. The media often takes a scandalised tone about pharmacological innovation: whether it’s the NHS trying to palm you off with second best, or big pharma selling snake oil, someone is always out to get you. “This seems OK; let’s see how it goes” is a peculiarly difficult editorial line to take.I was part of a panel discussion last week at“Ozempic Nation”, part of the British Library’s Food Season. Ozempic is the same drug as Wegovy, just with a lower concentration of the active ingredient, semaglutide, and is used to treat type 2 diabetes. The discussion felt a little paradoxical to include in a “food season”, since Ozempic is the opposite of food, the anti-food, the drug that can make you forget what you ever liked about food. And yet, the debate – which was essentially “Is this a wonder drug or a sticking plaster?” – cut to the heart of what food means for politics, for society and, I guess if you squint at it, for civilisation.Making the case that semaglutide is a wonder drug was Dr Tony Goldstone, a leading endocrinologist, and expert in addictive behaviours and obesity. His point was that bodies are the luck of the draw: there is no moral component to obesity, no “get a grip on yourself” solution. If you’re slim, it’s because you won the genetic lottery, and if you struggle with obesity, it’s because you didn’t. A drug that brings down your weight byas much as 25%is a miracle. Although, he also said: “It’s not magic – it’s biology!” Which tickled me, because biologyismagic, to a layperson).Goldstone spoke passionately about his patients: he has seen people die of obesity-related complications in their 20s. He has absolutely no time for any question in the obesity terrain that isn’t: “What is the best and fastest way to help as many people as possible?”He was incredibly convincing – and so was Prof Christina Vogel, who researches the wider determinants of diet, and was putting forward the other case: that if you’ve managed to create an obesogenic environment, through a combination of economic inequalities and poor-quality, high-sugar food, mass produced and robustly defended by overweening corporate interests, and you then create a drug to deal with the inevitable results, guys, that is not smart. Her research takes in quantitative data on supermarkets and convenience stores, as well as qualitative, focus-group work with people trying to put food on the table. She spoke powerfully about the sheer impossibility, on a low income, of feeding a family decent, nutritionally balanced food.So, while, on paper, Goldstone and Vogel were on opposite sides, they were both professionally committed to making people’s lives less bad, and thus, fundamentally, on the same side.Into this crucible of expertise, I was dropped in to explain the media’s attitude to weight loss drugs. And the more I tried, the more sheepish I became.Obesityis deployed in general analysis to explain a huge range of intractable problems; it’s why we can’t afford the NHS, it’s proof that we’re a nation in decline, it’s why social care keeps getting kicked into the long grass. It’s used in conjunction with ageing so often that they almost sound like one word, obesity’n’ageing. But, ageing is inevitable, obesity isn’t. While it’s no longer acceptable to body-shame individuals, it is still permissible to say – considered obvious, even – that obesity is an individual’s fault. At a stroke, all the assumptions and duties and undertakings that went into creating the social safety net are unpicked: if obesity is the central threat to a healthy society, and its cause is individuals who fail to take responsibility for themselves, then how can we be expected to take responsibility for one another?There have always been people arguing forcefully that weight gain is created by the economy, by agriculture, by industry, by systems – but none of that has impeded the discursive juggernaut heading towards a post-NHS, post-welfare-state reality. Effective weight-loss drugs, however – those really would get sand in the gears. Remove obesity and we have no way of blaming, policing or judging one another, and we’d be back to square one, Beveridge or bust. Which I, personally, would be fine with.Zoe Williams is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Yes, it was more of the usual delights fromThames Waterin front of the environment select committee on Tuesday.But the most overused phrase in the session was “turnaround regime”. This is the murky – or pragmatic, depending on your point of view – notion that Thames can win further big compromises from regulators to get its financial restructuring over the line. In short:special treatment.Thames Water finances were ‘hair raising’, chair tells MPsRead moreBy way of reminder, KKR, the US private equity house, is primed to take control of Thames by injecting up to £4bn of equity; and the company’s senior creditors are facing haircuts on their debt. KKR and the bondholders hope to agree outline terms by the end of this month. Then they’ll trot round to Ofwat and the Environment Agency to begin the real negotiation – the plea for regulatory “flexibility”, as Thames Water’s chief executive, Chris Weston, put it.They will be “discussing with the regulator the concept of a turnaround regime that might provide some relief from the normal regulatory environment while a company recovers its operations”, Weston said. “I think that is an absolute imperative for Thames otherwise we will not be invested in.”What is this “relief”? Well, given the number of times the figure was mentioned, one focus seems to be the £900m of regulatory penalties that Thames assumes it will incur in the next five years for missing operational targets. There is also worry over potential fines from the Environment Agency (EA).How would the process work? Ofwat cannot simply agree not to impose £900m of penalties. But, though this wasn’t spelled out by Thames’s directors, it’s not hard to imagine a menu of potential fudges. If the operational targets are too high, just invent lower ones for a company in this yet-to-be-designed “turnaround regime”? Or how about undertakings of good behaviour in lieu of financial penalties? Or more freedom to shift promised spending between regulatory cycles?Strictly speaking, there is already some formal scope for Ofwat to be flexible within the established framework – although, as it says, there is meant to be a “high bar”. But what Thames, KKR and the bondholders seem to be imagining is something more akin to a rewrite of Ofwat’s “final determination” on the business plan. All last year’s arguments about whether the regulator allows Thames to invest enough are being re-litigated outside the normal method of appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority (Thames has deferred its appeal).There is no guarantee that Ofwat will play ball in June, of course. But one can bet that it will come under unspoken pressure to do so because thegovernment is plainly desperate to avoid Thames falling into the special administration regime (SAR), AKA temporary nationalisation. Ministers, one suspects, would prefer Ofwat and the EA (which is part of the environment department anyway) to be as flexible as necessary to get the KKR deal done.Advocates of such an outcome argue it is simply expedient. SAR, they say, threatens a mess of litigation from bondholders and an upfront bill for the government to keep Thames afloat. Better to bend the regulatory regime out of shape, and say that Sir Jon Cunliffe, whose review of the water sector is coming down the track, may soon propose something like a “turnaround regime” anyway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will be the class A bondholders who can expect to escape with haircuts, or write-downs on their debt, in the order of 25%. If no regulatory relief is offered, or if SAR happens, or if Thames is obliged to go to the CMA, the haircuts would very likely be more severe.As Thames’s chair, Sir Adrian Montague, pointed out, it is those bondholders – not the company or its customers – who will pay the executive “retention incentives” of up to 50% of salary as part of a £3bn emergency loan. What’s the logic in this unusual arrangement? It is surely only this: if the executives can help to charm Ofwat and the EA into submission, they’ll save the bondholders a fortune.Explore more on these topicsThames WaterNils Pratley on financeUtilitiesWater industryRegulatorscommentShareReuse this content"

But after stints as a feminist influencer and political adviser, the president’s favourite daughter has found a new pathTue 13 May 2025 12.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 12.52 EDTShareIvanka Trump has had her manicured fingers in many pies. She’s designed jewellery and shoes. She’s written a book called Women Who Work, marketed at women who work, full of inspirational quotes and touching anecdotes about how she, a woman, has sometimes worked so hard that she has had tosacrifice massages.That was Early Influencer Ivanka, anyway. Then came Ivanka’s political era. During Donald Trump’s first term as president, she appointed herself Daddy’s special adviser and did a lot of very special advising. In that capacity she gallivanted around the globe, dropping in on the G20 and hobnobbed with world leaders, all while insisting: “I try to stay out of politics.” And, of course, the president’s eldest daughter, who very nearly became thehead of the World Bank, tirelessly advocated for women’s economic empowerment.After her dad’s (brief) fall from grace in 2020, Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, retreated from the public spotlight to a “billionaire bunker” in Florida. Kushner did mysterious things with the large amounts of money that Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern autocracies with dodgy human rights records gave his private equity firm to “manage”; Ivanka, meanwhile, did a bunch of wakeboarding.But, as Ivanka herself might write, a woman who wakeboards must eventually return to the shore. I’m sure you will be thrilled to hear that a rested and revitalised Ivanka is seemingly ready to throw herself into public service again. Ladies, it looks as if our Patron Saint of Feminism is back to empower us all! This time through our stomachs.Last Thursday,Ivanka resurfaced in Arkansasto speak at the Heartland Summit, one of a million conferences that seem to exist purely so that extremely rich people can sit around patting one another on the back. The president’s daughter was centre stage with Ariana Huffington, the CEO of Thrive Global, who interviewed her about her mission for tackling food insecurity in the US. In 2023, you see, Ivanka co-founded a “profit-for-purpose” company called Planet Harvest with her friend Melissa Ackerman. According to Axios, the Heartland Summit interview was the first timeIvanka has spoken publiclyabout her role in the company, which she promises will“reimagine the food supply chainthrough private-sector innovation”.I live in the US and have a green card. If I leave the country, will I be allowed back in? | Arwa MahdawiRead moreI’ll give Ivanka’s new project its due: its attempts to reduce food waste seem noble. Yes, the venture (which talks aboutfood as “medicine”) has some overlaps with Robert F Kennedy Jr’s conspiracy-heavy Make America Healthy Again movement – which has helped bring a number ofcrunchy momsinto the Maga fold. But there are plenty of grifts Ivanka could be involved with: just look at some of the other Trumps, who arenow raking it inwith a number of extremely dubious cryptocurrency projects.That said, it’s a little bit rich to be talking about food insecurity in the US when your last name is Trump. I don’t know if Ivanka is aware, but her father’s aggressive federal spending cuts have negatively affected a lot of government-funded food programmes with the same sort of mission as Planet Harvest. Earlier this year, for example, the US Department of Agricultureslashed two programmesthat provided more than $1bn for schools and food banks to purchase food from local farms. Which is certainly convenient for private-sector companies such as Planet Harvest: now they can swoop in toinnovate.Obviously Ivanka isn’t responsible for everything her dad does. But Trump does seem to listen to what his favourite daughter says. Eric Trump, in 2017, even boasted that Trump bombed Syria on Ivanka’s behalf because she was “heartbroken and outraged” at the country’s chemical weapons attack. (Ivanka later played downher influence on the strikes.) And while Ivanka may not have an official role in the current administration, various “sources” told CNN in December that Ivanka will “continue to informally advise [Trump] behind the scenes”.Kushner seems to continue to wield similar influence. In February, the Times of Israel reported that Kushner, who has salivated over the potential of “Gaza’s waterfront property”, was behind Trump’s war crime of a plan for the US to take over Gaza (which, speaking of food insecurity, is on thebrink of faminethanks to Israel’s blockade)and clear it of Palestinians.All this is to say that if Ivanka really gave a damn about food insecurity she would probably have far more impact lobbying her father to change his regressive policies than she will with her “profit-for-purpose” company. But where would be the glory – and the profits – in that?Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Here’s what would actually restore good-paying jobsTue 13 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 12.22 EDTShareOn Sunday night, the US announced that it wascutting tariffs on Chinese importsfrom 145% to 30%, for 90 days, and the Chinese are dropping tariffs on US goods from 125% to 10%, also for 90 days.The stock market soared on the news. (Anyone with inside knowledge of the deal could have made a killing.)But what’s the ultimate goal here? What happens over the next 90 days?It’s impossible to know what’s in Donald Trump’s mind (other than an insatiable thirst for power and money), but his trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, says the “bigger picture is restoring the American manufacturing base”.Protecting democracy is not enough: five things Americans must fight for | Huck GutmanRead moreIn 1970, more than a quarter of US workers held jobs in the manufacturing sector. Today, it’s only about8%. The Trump regime says sweeping tariffs will reverse this decades-long decline.The president also promises torevive the US coal industry. Last month he issued an executive order to rescind regulations limiting coal development. Last week, he evenordered federal agenciesto stop considering the economic damage caused by coal and other carbon emissions when writing regulations. And he’s doing whatever he can to destroy green energy – solar and wind.Manufacturing? Coalmining?These sorts of jobs won’t make America great again. They’ll make American workers sickened, injured and killed on the job again.I was secretary of labor. I saw close up how awful most of these jobs are. I met workers who had lost limbs in manufacturing jobs because machines they were cleaning or repairing accidentally started up. Others I met suffered carpal tunnel injuries from repetitive motions on assembly lines.Child labor was – and still is – a pervasive problem. So, too, with dangerous sweatshops crammed with people working for subminimum wages (if they’re lucky enough to be paid at all).And mining? I met mine workers with black lung disease from exposure to coal dust. Despite being on the decline after the 1970s, black lung hasbeen on the risefor two decades. Changes in mining technology have let mine owners dig deeper, exposing miners to even more highly toxic silica.The reason many working-class Americans want manufacturing and mining to return is not because they loved the work. In most cases it was grueling and dangerous or mind-numbingly boring.It’s because that work paid far better than the service jobs in fast-food and retail outlets, hospitals and hotels that many have been forced to take in their absence.And the reason those manufacturing and mining jobs paid far better was because they were unionized. Unions gave workers in manufacturing and mining the bargaining leverage they needed to force employers to offer better pay (along with more job security and safer working conditions).Trump claimed he was pro-worker. His new order shows how absurd that was | Steven GreenhouseRead moreBut since the Reagan years, corporations have been busting unions. In the 1960s, a third of all workers in the private sector were unionized. Today, just6% are.And if there’s one thing Trump and his croniesdon’twant, it’s unions giving workers more bargaining power. He’sgutted the National Labor Relations Board,eviscerated Osha, and is filling the Department of Labor with corporate stooges.So even if it werepossibleto restore manufacturing and mining to the US – even if we stopped foreign trade and forced US consumers to pay enormous sums for stuff made here, even if we filled the atmosphere with carbon, even if we prevented new technologies (including artificial intelligence) from doing the manufacturing and mining jobs that returned – the American working class would be no better off than they are now, if their pay is still in the cellar.A return of manufacturing and mining jobs won’t make Americans great again. Good-paying jobs will.The easiest and best way to raise the pay of working-class Americans is to 1 strengthen unions, 2 raise the minimum wage (which hasn’t been increased since 2009), 3 expand the earned income tax credit (a wage subsidy) for lower-income workers and 4 institute a universal basic income.Will Trump do any of these things?

On Monday, however, frustrated travellers were given some grounds for cautious optimism that change is on the way.West Yorkshire’s mayor, Tracy Brabin,has unveiledplans for a white rose version of Greater Manchester’s Bee Network in her region. As buses go under local control from 2027, the Weaver Network will unite 19 different brands in an integrated system intended to deliver simpler fares and joined-up travelling options. Eventually, a planned Leeds/Bradford tram network – on which construction is due to start in 2028 – will be woven into the pattern.The return of Greater Manchester’s buses to public stewardship has been a standoutsuccess story, at a time when faith in the power of politics to improve lives is at an alarming low. Average ticket costs are significantly down and ridership has outstripped expectations. The recent introduction of a London‑style tap-in, tap-out system, with a daily fare cap, has been predictably popular. With Ms Brabin taking West Yorkshire on the same journey, Labour’s metro mayors are doing their bit to redress a grotesque shortfall in the quality of transport infrastructure, compared with London and the south-east.Westminster should now play its part, too. Ahead of June’s government spending review, leaders across the north are rightlydemandingsignificant and overdue investment in a rail network whose dysfunctionality has passed into national legend. Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, and his Liverpool city region counterpart, Steve Rotheram, have presented Treasury officials with areportsuggesting modernised transport links between Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds could deliver more benefit to the economy than the Oxford-Cambridge growth corridorbackedby Rachel Reeves in January.Separately, David Blunkett will this month present the conclusions of a rail connectivityreviewcommissioned by Yorkshire’s three Labour metro mayors. Their likely tenor can be gauged by the former home secretary and Sheffield MP’s disclosure that he was “absolutely staggered” by the levels of delays in the region. Lord Blunkett has also pointed out that the government’s ambitious housebuilding targets – key to its growth strategy – will not be achieved without greater connectivity in terms of work and leisure.There are, then, compelling economic reasons for Ms Reeves to back a truly transformative modernisation of transport in the north of England. But just as importantly, this is a matter of equity. Mr Burnham likes to contrast England’s regional imbalances with Germany, where the Basic Lawguaranteesa broad equivalence of living standards across the 16Länderor federal states. The state of transport in the north has become a dismal symbol of a very different approach, in which narrow Treasury “green book” guidelines have led to less well-off regions being starved of the public investment they need to flourish.As Labour anguishes over how to combat the rise of Reform UK in places which were once its uncontested heartlands, transport is a sector in which straightforward social democratic strategies and priorities can sway hearts and minds. It should listen to its mayors and get weaving.Explore more on these topicsPublic transportOpinionManchesterAndy BurnhamWest YorkshireBradfordLeedsLiverpooleditorialsShareReuse this content"

In just months, he has shifted from denouncing “communist” price controls to saying he wouldimplementthem, and from defending tax breaks for the wealthy toproposingtax increases on those earning more than $2.5m a year if it benefits poorer Americans. These moves echo longstanding proposals from progressives likeBernie Sanders– despite Mr Trump’s past efforts to portray such ideas as “lunatic”. The irony is hard to miss.Consider recent policy announcements that mirror a liberal-left agenda. Capping credit card interest rates was a Sanderscampaign promisebefore it was a Trumpone. And it may happen – courtesy of an unlikely alliance betweenMr Sanders and the Republican senator Josh Hawley. Slashing drug prices by executive fiat? Absolutely, says Robert F Kennedy Jr, Mr Trump’s secretary of health, creditingMr Sandersfor the idea. The Vermont senatorshot back, saying the administration’s plan would be “thrown out” by judges – and that meaningful reform required legislation.It’s not so much strategy as media stunt. Whereas the Biden White House used tariffs as part of its industrial strategy against China, Mr Trump ratcheted them up to 145% without a plan. On Monday they were dramatically slashed to30%in a fit of economic realism. The justification is easy to see: domestic pain.Empty shelves and collapsing supply chainshave a way of reminding even the most blustering Maga nationalist that trade wars are not, in fact, easy to win.This disarray isn’t a side-effect; it’s the method. Mr Trump borrows popular ideas, announces them with great fanfare, and then either fails to follow through or runs into a predictable mess. His approach is driven more by appearances. He shifts messages depending on the audience. One day he presents himself as achampion of working people, the next as a defender of corporate interests. It’s a series of conflicting signals designed to keep him in control of the narrative.This confusion works to Mr Trump’s advantage. He keeps hisbillionairebackers happy while providing enough headlines to suggest the impression of fairness. It is gameshow politics – with Mr Trump appearing both as host and winning contestant. Meanwhile,watchdogsare gutted, workers’wagesare cut, and tax policies prop up the1%. Now and then, he floats a progressive idea, but it rarely amounts to anything real.Mr Trump’s populist image – attacking elites while claiming to fight for ordinary Americans – masks a pattern of elite self-dealing. In any previous era, a US president accepting a$400mjet from a Gulf royal or a Middle Eastern statespending$2bn on cryptocurrencies through a first-family-owned company would have sparked a constitutional crisis. Thescandalis hiding in plain sight, disguised by Mr Trump’s own performance.It’s often less about ideology than popularity, as Mr Trump retreats from chaotic policies that rattled markets and hurt his poll numbers. He backs appealing progressive ideas – like redistribution and price-gouging crackdowns – for thepartisandrama they provoke. Whether this performative populism lasts is unclear. But if the early months are any guide, this is a rerun, only with sharper slogans, fewer rules and an even greater hunger for applause over governing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Aside from the sweet sound of tennis balls being struck between Djokovic and Carlos Alcaraz, his training partner for the day, the only audible noise was the communication between Djokovic and Murray. Their technical and tactical discussions were constant.It was a fascinating sight. After years of playing against and trying to outsmart each other from across the net, they were now charged with understanding their distinct perspectives and figuring out the best solution to ensure that Djokovic was ready to continue competing for the biggest titles in the world. They both seemed genuinely hopeful over the opportunity to work so closely together, energised by their shared greatness.Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray end coaching partnership after six monthsRead moreThe early signs were positive. Despite hurting his hamstring before his quarter-final match against Alcaraz, Djokovic still pushed himself to his limits andclosed out an incredible win. He played a spectacular match, crunching his forehand and dominating against one of the best players in the world. He celebrated it by walking directly to Murray and hugging his new coach. When asked about Murray, as has been the case countless times over the past five months, Djokovic was effusive in his praise for the Scot’s professionalism and passion.That honeymoon period did not last long. It is reflective of Djokovic’s recent struggles thathis announcement of their coaching splitcomes as little surprise in the midst of one of the most barren stretches of his 22-year career.The final days of their time working together have been particularly dire. After early defeats by players such as Alejandro Tabilo and Matteo Arnaldi in Monte Carlo and Madrid, Djokovic has lost three matches in a row and he described himself as entering a “new reality” following his latest defeat.Having spent his career starting tournaments with the expectation of winning each one, in recent weeks Djokovic has arrived at those same events merely hoping to win a single match. Despite how low he set the bar, he still could not clear it.Thirty-seven has been a difficult agefor many great tennis players, usually one obstacle too far. In some ways the deterioration of Djokovic’s form has been gradual, with the Serb struggling for much of the 2024 season even though he managed to push himself in some of the biggest events, including winning a career‑completingsingles gold medalat the Paris Olympics. Still, the sight of him being picked off in the opening rounds at Masters events has been shocking.View image in fullscreenNovak Djokovic during his defeat by Matteo Arnaldi at the Madrid Open.Photograph: Juan Medina/ReutersFor Murray, the dissolution of his partnership with Djokovic may well feel like a reprieve. Months after his own retirement at the Paris Games, Murray had been leaving the golf course, a place he had spent much of his time since the end of his career, when he realised he had missed a call from Djokovic. Murray had no intention of returning to tennis so soon, but the opportunity to work with Djokovic was too fascinating to turn down. Suddenly, he was back on the tour. He spent a month in Australia, four weeks in the US for Indian Wells and Miami, and then he was in Madrid. He has invested a lot of his time in this partnership, but the benefits have been minimal.In both Monte Carlo and the Madrid Open, some of Djokovic’s practice sessions did not seem productive. As he has struggled to find his game on the practice court, let alone in matches, he has been in a dour mood. A video of one such training session in Madrid showed Djokoviccursing the sport in Serbianwhile Murray handed him a pair of tennis balls. “Fuck sport, fuck tennis, fuck everything else,” Djokovic said. Murray probably did not need a translator to understand his charge’s perspective.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He has achieved everything in the sport and has enjoyed a career that was once beyond the realms of any aspiring player’s imagination. As tennis reaches the busiest part of its calendar, with Roland Garros, Wimbledon and then even the US Open on the horizon, there will be nowhere to hide. If he continues his recent form and endures further early defeats in the biggest events, he will have to seriously consider his future.Next week, Djokovic will attempt to halt the momentum against him as he takes a wildcard into the Geneva Open, a small ATP 250 event that takes place on the eve of the French Open.All eyes will be on him to see how he fares, and indeed, who he will trust to follow him as he tries to extend the final stretch of his long, unforgettable journey.Explore more on these topicsNovak DjokovicAndy MurrayTennisanalysisShareReuse this content"

It’s a semi‑final at home, a goal up – I think we were caught between two attitudes. Once they scored, then we felt we had to score.“We had a list [of penalty takers] but the corner kick was fantastic for Ballard. They deserve it, and now we have a fantastic final to play. [Ballard] is a strong man at the back, really important for us. Tonight, we’ll enjoy it and switch on for the final very soon.”Le Bris is not a manager to neglect homework and, sure enough, his Coventry studies prompted the decision to shift the Stadium of Light’s perimeter advertising hoardings forward, moving them two metres closer to the pitch. The idea was to reduce the threat posed by Milan van Ewijk from long throws, by restricting the right-back’s room for manoeuvre – and it duly did.Add in reports that, at the end of an unusually warm May day on Wearside, the remote‑controlled heating in the away dressing room had been turned up to the maximum temperature and it was quite the welcome for Lampard’s players. As if that was not sufficient Coventry emerged from the tunnel to be greeted by a giant Sunderland fans’ banner depicting a black cat with terrifying claws, sharply bared teeth and chillingly ferocious eyes.View image in fullscreenEphron Mason-Clark scores for Coventry to force extra time.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PALe Bris’s Black Cats may not have been quite that formidable in the first leg but they left the Midlandsholding a precious 2-1 lead. Le Bris stuck to the 4-4-2 formation that had ruined Lampard’s night here but, although the former Lorient manager and long serving youth coach had suggested that, rather than repeat last Friday’s low block, his team would be “proactive” and in front foot, high pressing mode, this version was self destructively cautious.Yet if Lampard’s much admired attacking midfielder Jack Rudoni always looked capable of hurting his hosts, Sunderland could not be underestimated on the break. Tellingly, Coventry’s centre-halves at times struggled in the face of Eliezer Mayenda’s quick, clever feet and, midway through the first half, Ben Wilson, the Sunderland academy graduate turned Coventry goalkeeper, saved smartly from Wilson Isidor’s young attacking partner.Such cameos apart, though, Le Bris’s players looked in increasing peril of falling into the trap of retreating too deep and inviting the sort of pressure that eventually tends to prompt defensive mistakes. Not to mention silencing a previously raucous full house at the Stadium of Light.Tellingly Rudoni might have levelled the aggregate scores but his shot flew off target as he collided with the home goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, after arriving late, and Lampard-esque, into the box.Coventry have scored more goals from crosses and more headers than any other side in the EFL or Premier League this season and, as the interval beckoned, it was no surprise when Rudoni went close with a header from Jay Dasilva’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionAs the second half unfolded only a series of stalwart clearances from the indomitable Ballard prevented a visiting goal and a blizzard of Coventry crosses and corners offered Lampard hope.Although Wilson needed to save acrobatically to keep Trai Hume’s volley out, it was realised when Van Ewijk overlapped down the right before crossing superbly for Ephron Mason-Clark to toe-poke the ball into the back of the net.As an eerie silence descended on the stadium and Wembley felt that little bit further away from the north east, Le Bris replaced Isidor with the 17-year-old Chris Rigg. As Sunderland’s manager paced the technical area nervously, locals were tempted to watch Coventry continue to dominate through their fingers.Le Bris’s circumspect gameplan had failed and now he introduced the recently hamstrung winger Romaine Mundle from the bench, moved Le Fée into his preferred central role and a suddenly fluent Sunderland improved immeasurably. That tactical reshuffle may have been belated but it emphasised that the Breton’s days of anonymity are well and truly over.It took a fantastic block from Josh Eccles to keep a Mundle shot out before Le Fée’s execution and Ballard’s six-yard header off the underside of the bar, left Lampard looking as devastated as he ever did after assorted disappointments at major tournaments in an England shirt.“Congratulations to Sunderland, but I’m so proud of my players,” Lampard said. “I think we dominated at home, dominated large spells of this game tonight … from 17th in the league, how far this team has come, competing with the top teams in this division.“We’re not bitter, but we were the better team over the two matches. I’m so disappointed for the players, the fans, the club … but I can’t be disappointed with the performance tonight. We took control, but in extra time it became more of a coin-toss. We were getting ready for penalties … it’s cruel, but we have to take pride in how we played.”Explore more on these topicsChampionshipSunderlandCoventry Citymatch reportsShareReuse this content"

On Tuesday, as the new captain Nat Sciver-Brunt gave her first press conference sinceshe was appointedlast month, the curtain finally rose just enough to give the public a tantalising glimpse at a very new-look England setup.Twenty-four hours previously, the head coach, Charlotte Edwards, and the newly chosen national selector (whose identity is yet to be revealed) had sat down to select England’s squad to face West Indies in the series beginning on 21 May – without Sciver-Brunt’s input.Edwards, Sciver-Brunt revealed, has taken the decision to remove her new skipper from all formal selection committees. “My views are heard pre-meeting,” Sciver-Brunt said. “I haven’t been part of the big meeting. The new national selector will take that role, to lighten the burden of being captain.”Beyond the runs: Virat Kohli’s obsessive intensity left indelible mark on Test cricket | Jonathan LiewRead morePerhaps Edwards simply felt that Sciver-Brunt – who in the past six weeks has watched her wife give birth, undergone electroshock therapy for an achilles injury and received a phone call from Edwards to tell her she was about to become the new England captain – already had enough to be going on with?Except that this is a permanent change. In fact, it is the clearest signal yet that this new era of England women’s cricket will be driven forward by Edwards: she will set the standards and write the plans, and the captain will implement them. Sciver-Brunt described her role as “focusing on pitch things and winning games for England”. That is a 180-degree shift from her predecessor, Heather Knight, whose voice on and off the pitch was heard more loudly than either of England’s previous head coaches, Jon Lewis and Lisa Keightley.If the world really is divided into Type As (ambitious and driven) and Type Bs (carefree and even-tempered), then Sciver-Brunt is an archetypal Type B, recently described by Edwards as “laid-back and unassuming”. Edwards wanted a captain who could lead from the front: Sciver-Brunt emerged from the wreckage of last winter’s Ashes still one of the world’s leading all-rounders. But the leadership style of a Type B is likely to be more focused on inspiring and motivating those around them than imposing decisive plans.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Edwards has worked closely with Nat Sciver-Brunt at Mumbai Indians in the Women’s Premier League.Photograph: Ben Whitley/PASciver-Brunt is a textbook example. “As a leader, I want to empower people to be the best version of themselves,” she said last week. “As a group, I want us all to work really hard for each other and the team. I’ll be having conversations with everybody to work out the best way to work with them when we’re on the pitch and what they would need from me to help them best work.”There are two problems for the softly spoken Sciver-Brunt. The first is that she takes office at a nadir for England women’s cricket: the scrutiny-genie of last winter’s Ashes is never getting put back in the bottle. Asked what she was most dreading about the England captaincy, her answer came instantly: “Press conferences.” She might well prefer a more limited role, where she can focus purely on the cricket without having to answer difficult questions from journalists – but that is not the one on offer any more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Is she likely to allow Knight to lead by stealth? No. Will she tolerate a poor team culture? Also no. Edwards has worked with Sciver-Brunt long enough – most recently at Mumbai Indians in the Women’s Premier League – to know exactly the kind of leader she will make. The key to understanding her choice of captain is this: Edwards – herself a Type A, if ever there was one – has picked the player who will best complement her own coaching style. It’s as simple, and as complicated, as that.Explore more on these topicsEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketanalysisShareReuse this content"

Sunday’s game against relegated Southampton will mark Goodison’s last Premier League fixture.David Squires on … the many memories of Everton’s Goodison ParkRead moreBut in a shock move that has delighted fans the club’s new American owners have announced that the historic ground will become the new long-term home of the women’s team in a bid to make the ground “one of the most distinctive homes in European women’s football”.The move would provide “a blueprint for how clubs can build the future of women’s football”, said Nikki Doucet, the CEO of Women’s Super League Football. “Establishing Goodison Park as a purpose-driven home for the women’s team sends a powerful signal – not just about ambition, but about belief,” she said. “Belief in the players, the fans, and in what the women’s game can become when given the stage it deserves.”Everton Women are currently in eighth position in the WSL, but sources said the move was a “statement of intent” of the new owners’ ambitions for the women’s team. The Friedkin Group, owned by the Texas billionaire Dan Friedkin,bought Everton in December last year, bringing the turbulent era of Farhad Moshiri to an end.After the group took over AS Roma in 2020, the women’s team came fifth in the 2020-21 season and took their first major trophy, winning the 2021Coppa Italia. They won their firstSerie Atitle in 2023, and secured the domestic double in 2024.View image in fullscreenEverton Women at Goodison in March 2023.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/Reuters“It shows just how committed they are to backing the women’s team and making Everton a force at the very top of the women’s game in this country,” said Julie Makin, secretary of the Everton Women Supporters’ Club.Everton Women’s tenure at Goodison Park comes 105 years after the ground hosted a landmark women’s match between Dick, Kerr Ladies and St Helens Ladies, which held the attendance record for a women’s game for 103 years. “Evertonians have a saying of ‘If you know your history’, that is why it is deeply meaningful that the very same ground that held the record attendance for a women’s fixture for so many years will now become home to Everton Women,” said Richie Gillham, secretary of the Everton FC Heritage Society.Sources at the club said Everton Women’s move from Walton Hall Park, which has a capacity of just 2,220, was seen as an financial opportunity for the club to increase attendances at women’s games. The WSL is expected to attract 1 million fans for the first time this season, with attendances doubling in the last two seasons. With more than half of those attending games under 40, the club hopes to build lifelong loyalty at a venue which already has a significant sentimental draw. “This move is a testament to where the women’s game is right now and, more importantly, where it is heading,” said Everton Women’s captain, Megan Finnigan.A feasibility study commissioned by The Freidkin Group last month confirmed that the ground would meet standards set by the WSL, but the Archibald Leitch-designed stadium is likely to change dramatically after its new custodians move in.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Goodison Park, soon to be home of Everton Women.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“We know how treasured Goodison is, not only to every Evertonian, but to the game itself,” said Everton’s recently appointed CEO, Angus Kinnear. “We’re under no illusions – there are obstacles we need to overcome to make this a success, but we’re confident that we will overcome those challenges.”Everton will drastically reduce its 39,000 capacity – with upper tiers of the ground likely to be taken out of action after season ticket seats are sold off to fans at the end of this season. But there are no immediate plans to change its structure in the short term, according to the club which added that it was “planning targeted investments” to adapt the ground for the women’s game.It is understood that plans drawn up under the club’s previous owners, to bulldoze Goodison to make way for acommunity-focused regeneration projectwith housing, shops, a care home and healthcare facilities, have become less viable since they were first submitted in April 2020.

Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United have all been credited with an interest in the Swedish striker, who has scored 38 goals in the Portuguese top flight this season – 20 more than his nearest challenger. Sporting will be reluctant to lose their star but the former Brighton and Coventry player seems perfectly suited to the rigours ofPremier Leaguefootball. This summer might be the one when he leaves Lisbon.Benjamin Sesko, RB LeipzigSesko was linked with a move to Arsenal last summer, but opted to sign a new deal with RB Leipzig. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a fine campaign in Germany, scoring 13 goals and laying on five assists for an underperforming RB Leipzig side. His xG overperformance of 2.78 is among the biggest in theBundesliga. He has an eye for the incredible, so it’s no wonder he continues to crop up on Premier League radars.Hugo Ekitike, Eintracht FrankfurtSesko isn’t the only Bundesliga striker who could be joining one of the Premier League’s big hitters. Eintracht Frankfurt will not want to lose their two prized forwards in a matter of months,Omar Marmoush having left the club for Manchester City in January, but they will struggle to keep the young French forward. There are rough edges to the 22-year-old’s game – an xG underperformance of 6.80 is the highest in Germany’s top tier – but Ekitike has huge potential. His style is very similar to that of Alexander Isak; Ekitike could be a cost-effective alternative to the in-demand Swede.Diogo Costa, PortoThis season has been one to forget for Porto, who are 11 points off the pace going into the final week of the season. Even so, they boast one of the best defensive records in the division, having conceded just 30 goals in 33 games. Their goalkeeper deserves a lot of the credit. The Portuguese penalty-saving machine has kept more clean sheets (15) than any other goalkeeper in Portugal’s top tier this term. Costa has the best pass success rate for goalkeepers in the league (81.3%), so it’s easy to see why he has been linked with a move to Manchester City.View image in fullscreenDiogo Costa playing for Porto against Bodø/Glimt in the Europa League.Photograph: Mats Torbergsen/EPA-EFEJoan García, EspanyolGarcía, another goalkeeper, was wanted by Arsenal last summer but the deal never materialised. He has shone again this season, making more saves (135) than any other goalkeeper inLa Liga. Espanyol are 14th in the table and look likely to stay up; they would be as good as relegated were it not for his performances. Manchester United are reportedly keen on the 24-year-old, though so too are Aston Villa, Arsenal and Bournemouth.Jamie Gittens, Borussia DortmundGittens followed in Jadon Sancho’s footsteps, leaving Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund. He could be returning to England this summer. The 20-year-old has impressed this season, despite being in and out of the starting XI. Only Florian Wirtz (81) has completed more dribbles than the young winger (77) in the Bundesliga this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham reportedly monitoring his progress.Rodrygo, Real MadridIt looks increasingly likely that Real Madrid will sell Rodrygo this summer as they overhaul their squad and cash in on one of their most lucrative players following a disappointing season. The 24-year-old is no longer a guaranteed starter, with injuries and the signing of Kylian Mbappé restricting the Brazilian to just 22 league starts. Manchester City, who kickstarted their rebuild in January, have been linked with a move for Rodrygo, who still contributed six goals and five assists for Carlo Ancelotti’s side in La Liga this season.Rayan Cherki, LyonWith a rumoured release clause of just £25m, it’s no wonder there is a queue of suitors for Lyon winger Cherki. The Frenchman was a rumoured target for Borussia Dortmund in January, but he stayed in France. There is little chance the 21-year-old will be a Lyon player come the start of the new season,especially if they fail to qualify for Europe. Liverpool and Manchester United have been linked with the youngster. The versatile forward ranks top for accurate through balls (13), big chances created (21) and assists (10), and third for key passes (70), in Ligue 1 this season. Expect a scramble for his services.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki scoring for Lyon against Manchester United.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersMartín Zubimendi, Real SociedadLiverpool tried to sign Zubimendi last summer but he decided to stay at Real Sociedad. In the end, it worked out well for Liverpool, with Ryan Gravenberch stepping up and excelling under Arne Slot. Zubimendi is still a wanted man in England, with Arsenal seemingly ready to sign the 26-year-old midfielder for €60m. Jorginho is expected to join Flamengo and Thomas Partey’s contract expires at the end of the season, so Mikel Arteta needs midfield reinforcements.Angelo Stiller, StuttgartLiverpool are expected to bring in another midfielder as they look to build on their title success. Stiller would be a cost-effective and tactically versatile alternative to Zubimendi. The 24-year-old has been a key player for Stuttgart in recent seasons, with his performances earning him a place in the national team. He signed a new contract with Stuttgart earlier this year, so Liverpool would have to spend big to secure the deal. But Stiller would ease the pressure on both Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsTransfer windowGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueLa LigaSerie ALigue 1BundesligaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The Spaniards tried to sign the 20-year-old when he was a youth player at Málaga and have continued to track the former Juventus and Roma defender’s progress. Huijsen’s footballing idol is Sergio Ramos, the former Spain and Madrid defender.The question has always been whether Madrid wish to use a significant part of their transfer budget on signing Huijsen. They have looked to sign players on free transfers in recent years and are closing in on a deal for the Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose contract expires this summer.But Madrid have endured an underwhelming season – the European champions exited the Champions League in the quarter-finals and are set to lose their La Liga crown to Barcelona – and are aware of the need to rebuild. Bayer Leverkusen’s Xabi Alonso is set to replace Carlo Ancelotti, who is taking over the Brazil national team, as manager.There remains a possibility that Madrid will decide not to pay the release clause, paving the way forChelseato complete a deal they have been working on behind the scenes. But a consideration for Madrid, who have had to deal with a host of defensive injuries this season, is that Huijsen will become more expensive if he joins a big English side this summer.Chelsea are looking for another centre-back and have alternative targets, including Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite. Enzo Maresca has favoured Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofana in central defence but the French centre-back has struggled to stay fit.Fofana is out for the rest of the season while Axel Disasi, Trevoh Chalobah and Benoît Badiashile could be up for sale this summer.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowReal MadridChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

The PGA of America has reiterated its stance against the rollback of the golf ball, with its chief executive stating the organisation is “vehemently against” plans put forward by the sport’s rule-makers.The R&A and USGA announced in late 2023 that all professionals will be required to use amodified golf ball from 2028. The changes would apply to amateurs from 2030. It has long been the view of many that hitting distances for leading players have become problematic, an issue that renders many traditional courses obsolete in elite competition.Can watching sport really improve your wellbeing? The science suggests it can | Sean IngleRead moreThere is, however, an opposing view. The PGA Tour has never supported the rollback plan. The PGA of America, a close ally of the PGA Tour, is in the same camp. While theEuropean TourGroup has never formally expressed a view, it is likely it would stand alongside the PGA Tour. Equipment manufacturers have been firm in their opposition to the proposals.“There’s no change in our stance,” said Derek Sprague, the PGA of America’s chief executive. “We’re certainly vehemently against the ball rollback. We’ve had great conversations with the governing bodies. We’ve had several constructive and collaborative meetings probably a number of times, three, four times. I feel really good about where we are with them and we’re going to continue to collaborate on the proposed rollbacks.”Golf’s various organisations held talks on the subject at thePlayers Championship in March. The PGA of America was among those asking for a delay in the rollback so research numbers can be reassessed. Modifying drivers rather than golf balls is also an area that may be explored.“They’re clear where I stand, where we stand for sure,” Sprague said. “I talk really almost monthly now with the governing bodies and we’re working to really take a deep dive on the rollback and make sure it’s the right thing.“We’re really concerned about the 28 million golfers in this country. A number of people have reached out, a number of amateur golfers, recreational golfers have reached out and have the same concerns that we do. They’re thanking us for pushing this issue to make sure it’s well thought out, and if we can hit the pause button or change it altogether, that’s our goal.”Golf could do without another high‑profile dispute. The Saudi‑backedLIV tourhas created a schism in the men’s professional game. The R&A and USGA may agree to a new timetable to keep the peace. Martin Slumbers, a key proponent of the rollback, is no longer chief executive of the R&A.“We’re representing the 31,000 [professional golfers] that talk to the 28.1 million,” said Don Rea, the PGA of America president. “Now, whatever happens to this collaborative approach, it’s going to happen over the next six to eight years. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I assure you, when this is all done, we’re going to stand arm in arm and say this is the decision, and this is where we’re moving forward. It might change from what it is now.

It has affected him. He has been affected by this continuous insecurity, fear of violence and fear of other offences.”Kvernenes pointed out that on another occasion Jakob said he had been threatened with being dragged out of a car and beaten to death unless he agreed with Gjert.View image in fullscreenJakob Ingebrigtsen told the court that he had been punched and kicked by his father when he was still at primary school.Photograph: Lise Åserud/AP“There is no doubt that there was a culture of fear in the home as early as January 2008 when Jakob was seven years old and Ingrid was one and a half years old,” she said. “The starting point in these cases is unconditional imprisonment.”According to the indictment, Gjert is also alleged to have used threats, coercion and violence against his 18-year-old daughter, Ingrid, including “whipping” her in the face with a wet towel in 2022 after he had refused to let her play outside with friends.Kvernenes reminded the court that Ingrid has also alleged that Gjert had made her cry by screaming at her while they were in a car together – and then refused to return home until she promised not to tell anyone about the incident. She said there was “no doubt” that Gjert had also used abusive language towards his daughter and poked her on the chest and upper arm on several occasions.Gjert denies all the charges. Speaking outside court on Tuesday his attorney Heidi Reisvang said the defence would call for an acquittal when they make their closing arguments on Wednesday.“We believe that the sentence imposed in this case is far too high,” she told the Norwegian newspaper VG. “We believe this should not have been a case for the court in the first place.“We have heard an extremely large number of witnesses. We cannot see that there have been any witnesses who have substantiated from the outside that there has been fear among the children, something the court must find evidence of in order to convict for a so‑called regime of abuse.”The case is due to finish on Thursday, with the verdict expected later in the summer.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsSport politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Multiple sources have told the Guardian that the club have been given a deadline to confirm by next week whether or not they wish to participate, or face demotion.Hemp, Greenwood and Stanway back in major Euros boost for EnglandRead moreThe situation is understood to have left the players and staff anxious, angry and feeling like they are in a state of limbo, while they await a formal decision.Some of the squad have posted their concerns on social media, with the Scotland youth international Murphy writing: “We, Blackburn Rovers women’s first team, were made aware there is a 99% chance that the club’s owners won’t be financially supporting the team next season.“Us players and staff deserve far better than what we’ve experienced in recent seasons. We’ve once again been left in the dark, waiting to see if the owners will have the decency to do what’s best for their players, staff and women’s football.”Simon Parker’s team finished 10th, second from bottom, in the women’s second tier this term, five points clear of danger, despite operating on what was understood on a comparatively low playing budget. The second tier – which was known previously as the Women’s Championship – was renamed on Monday as WSL 2.This summer, the minimum requirements to take part in the division are being increased in a bid to raise minimum standards for the players involved, to an extent whereby it is understood second-tier women’s clubs will now have to essentially operate a full‑time, professional operation.The list of criteria is believed to include requirements for clubs to commit to appointing the following staff within one month of next season starting: a head of women’s football, marketing manager, head coach, assistant coach, physiotherapist or sports therapist, doctor, a strength and conditioning coach, a goalkeeping coach and several people in specific safeguarding and player-welfare roles.Blackburn played all of their home women’s matches at Ewood Park this season and their former players include the England internationals Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone and Keira Walsh and have a proud history of developing young players.The league will be keen to avoid a repeat of the situation last summer when Reading withdrew from the second tier at the end of June – for financial reasons – at such a relatively late point in the summer that there was deemed to be insufficient time before pre-season to begin a process of promoting a replacement club, which led to the division including only 11 teams this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This group has worked relentlessly hard all season for so little reward.”If they withdraw, Blackburn would not be the only club to decide not to fund a WSL 2 licence this summer, after third-tier Wolves did not submit a bid for promotion despite finishing second in their division. On Monday, the Wolves chairman, Jeff Shi, promised to apply next season instead.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

That amounted to £536m of the £2.8bn that the health service in England paid out in damages in 2023-24 – its record bill for mistakes.“Far too many patients still suffer clinical negligence which can cause devastating harm to those affected,” and the ensuing damages drain vital funds from the NHS, the report said.A DHSC source accepted the PAC’s findings, saying: “The cost of clinical negligence claims is rising at an unsustainable rate, eating into resources available for frontline care. Annual cash payments have more than doubled in the last 10 years and quadrupled in the past 17 years to £2.8bn.”The PAC criticised the department for not yet having explained why patient harm occurs and devised a strategy to overhaul patient safety, despite the committee in the last parliament asking the DHSC do so by last summer. The DHSC “has only recently written to us in response” to that recommendation, the PAC said.“It is unacceptable that the department is yet to develop a plan to deal with the cost of clinical negligence claims and so much taxpayers’ money is being spent on legal fees,” the report says.Paul Whiteing, the chief executive of patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said that lawsuits arose over errors by NHS staff in every area of care. “But the largest sums are awarded to families of babies that are left with lifelong disabilities, such as brain damage, through negligence at birth.”The NHS has faced a series of maternity care scandals in recent years that have left mothers and babies dead or badly injured. In 2023 the Care Quality Commission, the health service care regulator,said that two-thirds of maternity units provided substandard care.The NHS would face fewer lawsuits if it was more open when mistakes happen, Whiteing added.“We see many people who only litigate because the NHS ‘pulled down the shutters’, by which I mean failed to properly look into what went wrong, offer a meaningful apology for their mistake and involve the family in the investigation. If steps such as these were followed, many fewer people would resort to litigation,” he said.Jess Brown-Fuller, a Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said the huge cost of NHS medical negligence payouts are “symptomatic of a health service that simply is not functioning. The Labour government’s embrace of dither and delay on social care, maternity reforms and rebuilding our hospitals is prolonging the misery.”In its analysis of the DHSC’s annual report and accounts for 2023-24, the PAC also revealed the cost of building long-planned new high containment labs in Harlow, Essex, to help protect the UK against infectious diseases, had spiralled from £530m to “an eye-watering projected £3.2bn”.And it criticised the government for not spelling out what impact its decision to abolish NHS England and axe tens of thousands of health service managers would have on patients and staff. It voiced concern about cuts to dentistry, GP services and health prevention.Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, echoed the PAC’s unease. “While many leaders understand the need for change, the lack of detail on how the national shake-up will be taken forward, the pace of this restructure, and how it connects to the ambitions of the 10-year plan are a cause for concern among staff,” he said.A DHSC spokesperson said: “Patient safety is the bedrock of a healthy NHS and social care system. This government will ensure the country has the best system in place to keep patients safe by overhauling the overly complex bureaucracy of healthcare regulation and oversight and we will examine the drivers of costs, how to manage spending on clinical negligence and the potential merits of reform options.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a danger that ministers and civil servants might see this as a quick fix to save money, but doing this well is essential and hard.”The government claims that Consult will work 1,000 times faster than a human and will be 400 times cheaper, with its conclusions being “incredibly similar” to those reached by experts but in a fraction of the time.Speaking on the launch of Consult, the technology secretary,Peter Kyle, said Consult would save “millions” for taxpayers.“No one should be wasting time on something AI can do quicker and better, let alone wasting millions of taxpayer pounds on outsourcing such work to contractors.“After demonstrating such promising results, Humphrey will help us cut the costs of governing and make it easier to collect and comprehensively review what experts and the public are telling us on a range of crucial issues.“The Scottish government has taken a bold first step. Very soon, I’ll be using Consult, within Humphrey, in my own department and others in Whitehall will be using it too – speeding up our work to deliver the plan for change.”There is no fixed date yet for Consult, which is still in its trial phase, being implemented in government work, but the belief is that it could be deployed in government offices by the end of 2025.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

There is also evidence of Israel making efforts to limit incidental harm to civilians.”Is Britain breaking international law over Israel to avoid offending Trump? We may find out in court this week | Yasmine AhmedRead moreGovernment lawyers also stressed that the international court of justice last year had not found there was a plausible risk of a genocide occurring.The government argues no violation of the duty to prevent such a genocide “can occur unless and until there is actually a genocide”.Yet Husain told the court that “on the first of this month, at least 1.9 million people, or about 90% of the population, have been displaced on 10 times or more.“On 7 May the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that every single one of Gaza hospitals has been damaged or destroyed and, as of this month, only half were partially functional.“Official reporting from the ministry of health, cited by UN agencies, indicated that between 23 October and 25 April over 50,000 Palestinians to be killed, including at least 15,000 children and a further 214,000 injured.”He said: “These acts of annihilation have been accompanied by persistent genocidal, dehumanising and even celebratory statements made at all levels of the Israeli military and political structure, including such figures, I regret to say, as the prime minister, president, minister of defence, minister of national security and minister of finance.”The hearing before Lord Justice Males and Mrs Justice Steyn is due to conclude on Friday, and a decision is expected in writing at a later date.Explore more on these topicsArms tradeGazaIsraelForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

It added that a man attended a voluntary interview at a London police station on 13 March.A Conservative party spokesperson said Spencer had been suspended by the party and had the whip withdrawn with immediate effect.Party sources said they found out about the accusations after Spencer won his seat and had been appointed as parliamentary aide to the shadow education secretary, Laura Trott.They added that the chief whip had asked the MP not to attend parliament while police inquiries were ongoing.Lawyers acting for Spencer said Spencer categorically denied the charges.“He has cooperated fully with the police investigation from the moment he became aware of it and he will defend the allegations robustly in court. Given that the proceedings are now on foot, no further comment will be made,” they said.Before entering parliament, Spencer worked for his billionaire father’s investment company IPGL, before working for a centre-right thinktank, the Centre for Social Justice.Spencer won his seat with a majority of 4,290 votes ahead of Kevin Craig, whowas suspendedas the Labour candidate nine days before the election after it was revealed he had bet on himself to lose.According to his website, Spencer lives in Suffolk with his wife and two sons.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

She was supplied with money, drugs and alcohol in return for sex.She was taken to various places where she was raped over several years, including by Hussain and the Ahmed brothers. Many of the offences took place in the flats above the brothers’ family’s grocery shop.Hussain and Fayaz Ahmed were 18 and 17 respectively when they carried out their offences, while Imtiaz Ahmed was in his 30s.In an impact statement read to the court, the victim said that almost 30 years after the abuse, she still suffered flashbacks and the trauma left her unable to trust people, including the services there to protect her.Rigby said: “This case involved the shocking and hideous abuse of a vulnerable teenager by these three sexual predators. I referred these sentences to court of appeal because in my view they were unduly lenient.“I attended court today for the hearing and I very much welcome the court of appeal’s significant increases to these sentences.”The trio were convicted in January. Ibrar Hussain was initially sentenced to six years and six months – this was increased to 10 years on Tuesday.Imtiaz Ahmed was initially sentenced to nine years, which was increased to 11, and Fayaz Ahmed had his sentence extended from seven years and six months to 10 years.Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultWest YorkshirePrisons and probationCrimeUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

But since it is short-lived in the atmosphere compared with carbon dioxide, cuts to emissions have been identified as an urgent move in tackling climate breakdown.However, an assessment of 20 major dairy and coffee shop chains – with combined revenues exceeding $420bn (£323bn), almost half the value of the estimated size of the global dairy industry – found most lack clear methane reduction targets, credible action plans or even basic transparency on emissions.The food products corporation Danone came top in a league table compiled by researchers, being the only company to have a methane-specific target. The US-based company General Mills came in second place, having published a climate target but not one specific to methane.Nestléand Arla came third, with Nestlé the only company to have explicitly supported reducing dairy consumption.Of the companies assessed, only Nestlé and Danone claimed to have actually cut emissions, despite all but two having affirmed methane and livestock pose a threat to the climate.“Dairy production is a rare lever to control methane emissions, but one that firms clearly don’t want to touch,” said Nusa Urbancic, the chief executive ofChanging Markets, which carried out the research.“The near-total absence of methane-specific targets and credible action plans sends a clear signal: companies are turning a blind eye to emissions of one of the most potent and solvable drivers of global heating.”Companies in the assessment included the largest dairy companies inEuropeand North America by annual revenue, the five largest coffee chains in Europe and North America, and all eight members of the Dairy Methane Action Alliance (DMAA), an industry initiative.Urbancic added: “Our audit shows that fine words from businesses and a few voluntary actions are little more than hot air.

What is the case about and why is it significant?Climate group alleges energy giant misled 400,000 customers about ‘Go Neutral’ product, arguing that carbon credits don’t actually remove emissionsGet ourbreaking news email,free appordaily news podcastCatie McLeodConsumer affairs reporterTue 13 May 2025 17.24 EDTShareA landmark legal case is about to begin involving one of Australia’s largest electricity and gas providers, which is alleged to have engaged in “greenwashing”.Energy Australia will appear before the federal court on Wednesday in a case brought by the Parents for Climate group, which alleges the energy giant misled more than 400,000 customers about its “Go Neutral” product.The case is significant because it is the first one in the country to be brought against a company for “carbon neutral” marketing. It is also the first time an Australian energy retailer has faced legal action for alleged greenwashing.What is greenwashing?Greenwashing is when a company promises or implies action to help the environment but fails to deliver, according to Erin Turner, the chief executive officer of the Consumer Policy Research Centre (CPRC).Speaking generally, Turner says the centre’s research has found that some companies lie or mislead customers, while others use vague promises or green colours to imply a product is environmentally better.More than 40% of electricity used in Australia’s main power grid at start of year was renewableRead more“We also see greenwashing cause harm and confusion for consumers when high polluting companies or sectors advertise hyper-specific green initiatives,” Turner says. “For example, we found the mining sector using ads on social media to boast about their clean tech.”Additionally, Turner says carbon neutral certification schemes can cause consumer confusion when they hand out their logo to highlight “one good product or service” from a company that causes environmental harm in other parts of its operations.A survey of 446 people conducted by Parents for Climate found that 43% had experienced greenwashing from an energy provider, bank or super fund.Is there anything to stop it from happening in Australia?Turner says the Australian Consumer Law protects consumers against companies that mislead customers, but it doesn’t help if a company uses “vague or woolly language” to imply green credentials.“This is why CPRC has been calling for stronger consumer protections specifically to stop companies from claiming their products are green, eco or sustainable without doing to work to show how they’re delivering on their green promises,” she says.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailThe European Union has adopted what is known as the “green claims directive”, requiring member states to pass their own legislation to introduce protections against greenwashing including verification requirements for environmentally friendly claims or carbon neutral marketing.In 2023, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission released “principles” to “guide” businesses’ environmental claims, but Parents for Climate says these are “open to interpretation” and the federal government needs to do more.What are Parents for Climate arguing in their case?Parents for Climate launched their legal action against Energy Australia in 2023. They allege the retailer marketed its “Go Neutral” product by telling consumers their electricity and gas would be carbon neutral because the company was buying carbon credits to offset the pollution.The lead lawyer in the case, David Hertzberg, says the key argument will be that Energy Australia allegedly engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct – in contradiction of the Australian Consumer Law – because burning fossil fuels creates emissions and offsets don’t permanently remove them.Energy Australia remains a participant in the federal government’s Climate Active certification scheme. Most of the carbon credits it bought were from international projects, as well as one “carbon farming initiative” involving planned burning in Western Australia’s Kimberley region.What is the Climate Active certification scheme?Companies that join this voluntary register report their emissions and the offsets they are buying, so they can tell customers they are certified and claim their products are carbon neutral.The Parents for Climate chief executive, Nic Seton, says the group is concerned about the scheme because companies can buy “low-quality” offsets that don’t actually reduce net emissions.The problematic offsets include “avoidance credits”, which claim to prevent potential future emissions but don’t actually remove carbon from the atmosphere, Seton says.“We argue that the way in which these companies are using offsets to make carbon neutral claims is potentially false and misleading,” Seton says. “There’s a little bit of creative marketing. The worst case scenario is it’s being deliberately used as a licence to pollute.”More than 40% of electricity used in Australia’s main power grid at start of year was renewableRead moreMore than 100 companies havereportedly left the Climate Active schemein the past two years, including Australia Post, the Cbus superannuation fund, Telstra, Canva and PwC.The federal environment department says it is considering the future direction of the Climate Active program. For now, a spokesperson says the program continues to operate as usual, \"certifying entities that have met the requirements\".What has Energy Australia said?After Parents for Climate filed its legal action, Energy Australia stopped providing the “Go Neutral” option to new customers. On its website, it says it will be “progressively ending our Go Neutral product” for customers who have already opted into the scheme.“We’ve made a commercial decision to close Go Neutral while we focus on reviewing and updating our plan to help customers reduce their emissions,” the website says.A spokesperson for the retailer says it has been working with Parents for Climate and it remained “optimistic we can resolve this issue together”.“Energy Australia remains committed to decarbonising by investing in and supporting assets that enable the clean energy transformation, and helping our customers to directly reduce their emissions,” the spokesperson says.What happens from here?Parents for Climate are seeking a court declaration that Energy Australia engaged in greenwashing and for the company to issue a corrective notice.The hearings are scheduled for eight days, with the court to make a ruling at a later date.Depending on the outcome, the case could set a precedent for future instances of alleged corporate greenwashing and prompt the government to take stronger action to stop it.Explore more on these topicsEnergyClimate crisisClimate scienceexplainersShareReuse this content"

However, it added that demanding a specific percentage reduction in emissions was not realistic.Instead, the group has called for a ban on Shell’s new oil and gas fields rather than setting an emissions target.“We simply cannot sit back and wait while Shell continues on its fossil path. Shell remains fully committed to new oil and gas fields, despite warnings from scientists that this will have disastrous consequences. Now is the critical moment to curb the climate crisis,” Pol said.A spokesperson for Shell confirmed that it had received the letter but stressed that no lawsuit has been filed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the world continues to use oil and gas to heat homes and to transport goods and people, the transition needs collaboration between governments, businesses and consumers. By working together, with effective government policies, the world can move to low-carbon products and maintain a secure supply of affordable energy,” the spokesperson added.The lawsuit is the latest legal row between Shell and climate campaigners after the oil companysettled a $2.1m (£1.6m) lawsuitagainst Greenpeace after its campaigners boarded an oil rig as part of a peaceful protest last year.Shell in 2023 successfully quashed a lawsuit broughtby the environmental law charity ClientEarthwhen the high court in London refused permission to bring a case against the energy company.Explore more on these topicsShellOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilGasNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The only other country to have withdrawn from the agreement is the US, twice,under Donald Trump.Factcheck: Kemi Badenoch’s claim that net zero is ‘impossible’ by 2050Read moreBowie said: “We are not climate deniers and while we believe in getting to net zero, what we shouldn’t do is be hamstrung by arbitrary targets such as a date of 2050, which was concocted simply because it was a good end point as a date. There’s no scientific rationale for choosing 2050 as the point to which we should reach net zero.”However, the reason May, as prime minister,set 2050 as a date– along with the world’s other developed countries – was that it is in line with scientific advice on meeting the Paris agreement target of limiting temperature rises preferably to 1.5C above preindustrial levels, or certainly well below 2C, by 2050.TheIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change(IPCC), the body of leading climate scientists,set out in its landmark assessmentsof the world’s knowledge of climate science – regarded as the gold standard for research, though seen as too conservative by some scientists – the need for global emissions toreach net zero by mid-centuryin order to have a greater than even chance of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C.Friederike Otto, a climatologist and senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, said: “From a scientific point of view, net zero is absolutely crucial. We cannot stabilise temperatures without reaching zero new emissions in the atmosphere. The only IPCC emissions scenarios that stabilise temperatures at below 2C, as agreed on in the Paris agreement, need net zero by 2050 globally, so if anything a country like the UK should reach it earlier, not later.”Bowie said of the IPCC: “They’re biased towards their worldview, which is that we need to reduce climate emissions by a certain arbitrary date. That is not conducive to the overall economic wellbeing of this country.”View image in fullscreenAndrew Bowie in the House of Commons in 2021.Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/PAHe added: “There’s quite a few scientists that say we don’t need to get to net zero by 2050.” Bowie and his office were unable to name such scientists when pressed.In 2021, the last Tory governmentled a global effortto get developed countries to sign up to net zero by 2050 whilehosting the Cop26 UN climate summitin Glasgow.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

So what we need to do is go away and develop an energy strategy that allows us to decarbonise absolutely but to do it in a way which is conducive to the country’s prosperity and to our energy and national security, and that’s the position we find ourselves in.”Recent research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has shown that tackling the climate crisis willimprove rather than hampereconomic growth. Other studies,going back to the 2006 Stern reviewcommissioned by the UK government, have also found a strong economic rationale for tackling global heating, which is on track for catastrophic levels unless global emissions are reduced.The Tories are conducting a review of policy, which will encompass net zero and energy policy. Bowie is the acting shadow energy secretary while Claire Coutinho, who was energy security and net zero secretary under Rishi Sunak, is on maternity leave.Bowie said the review was not complete but Badenoch had “been sceptical about the net zero by 2050 commitment for some time”, so that although a net zero target of some kind could be kept, it would not be for 2050.Mike Childs, the head of science, policy and research at Friends of the Earth, said: “The IPCC is made up of the world’s most eminent climate scientists from 195 member states. In compiling its assessments on the health of our planet, a process that takes years of in-depth research and analysis, the IPCC’s findings are subject to extensive scrutiny and scientific rigour before being published. It’s incredible for the shadow energy minister to suggest he has greater authority on our climate than the world’s top minds.”Explore more on these topicsConservativesGreen politicsClimate crisisParis climate agreementnewsShareReuse this content"

A police spokesperson said: “GreaterManchesterpolice can confirm an investigation has been launched into allegations of financial irregularities at the University of Greater Manchester.“This follows a review of allegations published in The Mill [an independent news site] and subsequent PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC) report commissioned by the university’s fraud response panel.”An interim leadership team has been put in place, led by Dr Greg Walker, pro vice-chancellor (academic) who assumes the role of acting vice-chancellor and interim accountable officer while the investigation is under way.In an email to staff, the chair of the university board, Prof William Morris, said: “These suspensions are a neutral step, taken to protect the integrity of the process and to allow a full and fair process to take place.“As this is a live investigation, we are limited in what we can share at this stage, but we are committed to keeping you informed appropriately and transparently.“We understand this news may be concerning. Please be assured that the university’s core functions and academic activities will continue without disruption.”In March, Lucy Powell, the leader of the House of Commons,told MPs that police and the higher education regulator for England, the Office for Students, were looking into allegations at the university.Phil Brickell, the Labour MP for Bolton West, asked Powell to give MPs time to debate allegations that had emerged from whistleblowers and detailed reporting by The Mill, claiming racism, financial misconduct and bullying at the university.Brickell said on Tuesday: “We need to let the investigation run its course. I will continue to monitor developments closely and engage with the university and relevant authorities in order to ensure the university best serves its students, staff, the people of Bolton and it’s surrounding communities.”Explore more on these topicsUniversitiesGreater ManchesterManchesterHigher educationnewsShareReuse this content"

People will continue to make choices like the one of my mum. She deserves better. We deserve better. Let’s vote for this at stage one to continue the conversation.”That argument was challenged by Edward Mountain, another Scottish Tory MSP, who said that while the bill could prevent direct coercion of terminally ill people, it could not prevent passive coercion or coercion by the state.He said too many Scots could not access proper palliative care, and could not afford private care, which may coerce them into assisted dying, to cut costs and stress. And the drugs used to end life could also cause distress, he claimed.“This parliament has a duty to make it easier to choose life, rather than making it easier to die, which is what this bill will do,” he said.But Rona Mackay, an SNP MSP and deputy convener of Holyrood’s assisted dying all-party group, said this bill was not “a leap into the unknown. It is a cautious, evidence-based step forward. Voluntary assisted dying is founded on international best practice. [The] framework it proposes is safe, compassionate and practical.”For the Scottish Greens, Maggie Chapman said that reform was “long past time”. In countries with a legal right to die, “people experience assurance, peace of mind and courage to face the weeks and months ahead. For many people, simply knowing that the end is within their control is enough.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingScottish politicsScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

He remains in police custody.It is understood there is no indication the attacks were linked to hostile state action, which also falls under the remit of Scotland Yard’s counter-terrorism command.The prime minister’s family home, which he now rents out, a flat he once owned and a car he previously owned were all attacked. Detectives are trying to establish with certainty if all three arsons are linked.None of the attacks led to injuries and police said at the Starmer family home in Kentish Town that “damage was caused to the property’s entrance”.The property is understood to be owned by the prime minister. Starmer, who resides with his family at his official residence in Downing Street, is understood to be renting out the four-bedroom house to his sister-in-law and her family.The arrangement is declared through the ministerial register of interests, but as his relative only pays a peppercorn rent in order to protect her legal rights as a tenant, the rental income does not meet the £10,000-a-year threshold required to be declared on the MPs’ register, the Guardian understands.On Monday at 1.35am, police were alerted by the London fire brigade to reports of a fire at a residential address in north-west London.The investigation team is also considering two other incidents: a vehicle fire in north-west London last Thursday, reportedly on the same street as Starmer’s Kentish Town property, and a fire at the entrance of a property in north London on Sunday.The house, which he and his wife, Victoria, bought in 2004, has previously been targeted by protesters. Last year, three people were found guilty of public order offences after apro-Palestinian demonstration outside the property. Damage had been caused to the entrance but nobody was hurt.Commander Dominic Murphy, the head of the Metropolitan police’s counter-terrorism command, said: “We are working at pace and continue to explore various lines of enquiry to establish the cause of the fires, and any potential motivation for these.“A key line of enquiry is whether the fires are linked due to the two premises and the vehicle all having previous links to the same high-profile public figure.“We recognise that this investigation may cause concern to other public figures – particularly MPs … I would encourage any MP who is concerned about their own safety to get in touch with their dedicated local Operation Bridger [security programme] officer, who can provide further advice and support.”The Met said that as a precaution and due to the property’s connections to the prime minister, officers from its counter-terrorism command were leading the investigation into this fire.On Monday, Starmer thanked the emergency services for their work. His official spokesperson said the matter was “subject to a live investigation so I can’t comment further”, and he declined to provide any details on who may have been in the property when the fire started.The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she had been briefed about the suspected arson attacks. Asked about the incidents by BBC Breakfast, Cooper said: “You are right that the police are investigating these incidents, and they have my full support in doing so.“I have been briefed about these incidents but you will understand, as home secretary I obviously cannot comment in any detail on the investigations that are ongoing.”Kemi Badenoch condemned the “shocking” suspected arson attacks. Writing on X, the Conservative leader said: “My thoughts are with the prime minister and his family. No one should face these sorts of threats, let alone people in public service.“It’s an attack on our democracy and must never be tolerated.”Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Scientists say the technique could provide new insights into congenital heart defects, which affect nearly one in 100 babies.“This is the first time we’ve been able to watch heart cells this closely, for this long, during mammalian development,” said the study’s senior author, Dr Kenzo Ivanovitch of University College London’s Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health. “We first had to reliably grow the embryos in a dish over long periods, from a few hours to a few days, and what we found was totally unexpected.”The footage of the developing embryos was captured using a technique called advanced light-sheet microscopy. This allowed scientists to track the embryos as they went through a developmental milestone known as gastrulation, when the embryo begins to form distinct cell lines and starts to establish the basic axes of the body.Soon after, heart muscle cells organise themselves into a large tube that will go on to divide into sections that will eventually become the walls and chambers. In babies with heart defects, a hole can form during this process.Using fluorescent markers, the team tagged heart muscle cells called cardiomyocytes, causing them to glow in distinct colours. Snapshots were captured every two minutes over 40 hours, showing the cells moving, dividing and forming a primitive organ. This allowed the team to see when and where the first cells that make the heart appeared in the embryo.The researchers found that early during gastrulation (about six days into mouse embryo development), cells contributing solely to the heart emerged rapidly and behaved in highly organised ways. Rather than moving randomly, they began to follow distinct paths, whether contributing to the ventricles (the heart’s pumping chambers) or the atria (where blood enters the heart from the body and lungs).“Our findings demonstrate that cardiac fate determination and directional cell movement may be regulated much earlier in the embryo than current models suggest,” said Ivanovitch. “This fundamentally changes our understanding of cardiac development by showing that what appears to be chaotic cell migration is actually governed by hidden patterns that ensure proper heart formation.”The team said the insights could advance the understanding and treatment of congenital heart defects and accelerate progress in growing heart tissue in the lab for use in regenerative medicine.The findings were published inthe EMBO Journal.Explore more on these topicsBiologyEmbryosHeart diseaseMedical researchLondonUCL (University College London)newsShareReuse this content"

Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity. That’s why art is a threat.”As applause broke out in the Grand Lumiére, Cannes’ largest cinema, De Niro continued:‘A coward’s violence’: Robert De Niro trolls Trump outside hush-money trialRead more“That’s why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists. America’s philistine president ha[s] had himself appointed head of one of our premier cultural institutions [the Kennedy Center]. He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education.”De Niro then addressed Trump’s surprise announcement 10 days ago that he planned toput a 100% tariff on filmsmade outside the US.“You can’t put a price on creativity,” said De Niro, “but apparently you can put a tariff on it. Of course, this is unacceptable. All of these attacks are unacceptable. And this isn’t just an American problem, it’s a global one. Like a film, we can’t just all sit back and watch. We have to act, and we have to act now.”De Niro concluded his speech with a rallying call for people to take action, “without violence, but with great passion and determination”.“It’s time for everyone who cares about liberty to organise,” he said, “to protest, and when there are elections, vote. Vote. Tonight, and for the next 11 days, we show our strength and commitment by celebrating art in this glorious festival. Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.”The actorLeonardo DiCapriopresented De Niro, now 81, with the award in advance of the opening night film – French comedy Partir Un Jour. De Niro was president of the jury at the festival in 2011 and has long been a regular on the Croisette.Some of his key films have also premiered at the festival, including Martin Scorsese’s Mean Streets in 1973 and Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America in 1984.This year’s Cannes has so far been marked by its engagement with real-world affairs.

[But] what is sacred is when you create, when you act, and he is no longer sacred … Now the power lies elsewhere.”Meanwhile, freelance workers at the festival staged a small protest at the opening ceremony for the second consecutive year.With the backing of union collective Sous les écrans la dèche, the workers – who include drivers and projectionists – said they sought to restart negotiations over unemployment insurance regulations which would better protect their livelihoods.TheCannes film festivalruns until 24 May.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalRobert De NiroDonald TrumpFestivalsLeonardo DiCaprioTrump tariffsGérard DepardieunewsShareReuse this content"

Thyberg was forced to quit as national security adviser on Thursday just hours after being appointed when intimate photos of him from the dating site Grindr were sent to the government.In a statement, the prosecutor said the unnamed diplomat was suspected of carrying out espionage during the same period that Thyberg was forced out. Thyberg is not suspected of any crime, SVT reported.He was, very briefly, the replacement for Henrik Landerholm, the former national security adviser who was also forced to resign in January overmislaying classified documents.Swedish authorities have raised concerns in recent years about increasing threats from foreign powers such as Russia, China and Iran and groups engaging in actions ranging from violent attacks and hybrid warfare to corporate espionage.In March, Säpo warned that foreign powers were operating in ways that threatened security, using hybrid activities to destabilise Sweden andEurope.Sweden warns of heightened risk of Russian sabotageRead moreThe justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, told SVT on Tuesday the government had been informed of Säpo’s operation and that the person in custody was suspected “on reasonable grounds” of espionage. Reasonable grounds is the lower of two grades of suspicion in Sweden.“The investigation has to be carried out and I don’t want to pre-empt it,” Strömmer said in a statement to SVT.Anton Strand, the lawyer appointed to defend the person in custody, declined to comment.Säpo said that one person had been arrested after an operation in the Stockholm area and that they were unable to provide further information owing to secrecy.Karin Lutz, a spokesperson for Säpo, said that while she understood the questions about potential links between the two incidents, she could not comment. “I’ve seen the news and I understand it raises a lot of questions but what we can say is there is one person who has been arrested,” she said.The prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Eventually it became a job for me, pretty much.”She explained Combs would “control the whole situation” and that “it was his fantasy,” adding that she felt like she “couldn’t say no” as she “didn’t want to make him upset”.As Ventura was questioned on Tuesday, prosecutors sought to portray Combs as someone who was controlling and abusive, and who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life – including the clothes she wore, her career, where she lived, who she could talk to, which escorts would participate in the so called “freak-offs”, as well as what occurred during the “freak-offs” themselves.Ventura told the court that she would ingest drugs at every “freak-off”, that she said were provided by Combs, as it helped her “dissociate” and had a “numbing” effect.Ventura emphasized that she felt a “responsibility” to make Combs happy.Combs preferred Ventura to groom herself a specific way – specifically, he wanted her have her nails painted white, her hair combed a certain way and even suggested she get breast implants.Combs and his team would also periodically take away her laptop or phone. “It depended on how long I was being punished for,” she said.Over time, she said, “freak-offs” were not something she wanted to do as they made her feel “horrible”, “humiliated”and “worthless”, she said. “It felt like all I was good for.” She told the court that the “freak-offs” could last two to three days sometimes – with no sleep.“I was an object,” she said. “I was heavily objectified.”Still, she told the court: “I was in love and wanted to make him happy” and “I didn’t know what ‘no’ could turn into.”Of how Combs would get during “freak-offs,” Ventura said: “His eyes go black – the version of him I was in love with was no longer there.”Ventura said that she was expected to take part in the “freak-offs” even while menstruating and that Combs would sometimes direct someone to urinate on her, resulting in bedsheets during these encounters covered in blood and urine. She said she didn’t want that to happen, but “you don’t have a lot of control at that moment”.“I just felt humiliated, it was disgusting, it was too much,” she said. “I choked, I didn’t want to be doing that, I was in a position I couldn’t easily get out of. I eventually put my hands up and Sean saw and told him to stop. I was choking, too much urine in my mouth. Sean urinated on me at the same time.”Ventura also testified that Combs would also sometimes record the “freak-offs” on his device. He would also sometimes use her device to record the sexual encounters, she said, but Ventura told the court that she would delete the videos on her phone afterwards.“I never wanted anyone to see me like that,” she said. “Objectifying me, putting me in compromising, gross positions with strangers.”She recalled her first meeting with Combs, in 2005, when she was 19.“I just knew that he was this larger-than-life entrepreneur, musician. Was a fan of the music. I didn’t know too much about him personally,” she said, adding that she went on to sign a 10-album deal with Combs’s record label.Ventura later released her debut album in 2006, but it would be the only one she ever put out on Combs’s label.Diddy trial draws media circus to New York streets: ‘I just want to catch the vibe’Read moreOf how her relationship with Combs developed, Ventura explained how he kissed her on her 21st birthday in Las Vegas and that the incident made her uncomfortable and that she felt “confused”.From there, despite their 17-year age gap, they began to see each other more frequently and “started to develop a comfortable relationship with each other”.After the pair started dating, which Ventura said “was not public for many years” as Combs was still in a relationship with longtime partner Kim Porter, Ventura described the world Combs lived in as “much different” than her own.“He had assistants at his beck and call. He could get anything done quickly. He had respect from everyone and he traveled quite a bit,” she said.Ventura depicted Combs’s tempestuous moods and the resulting violence he would inflict on her if she didn’t act a certain way. She said she never knew if he would show up at her home in Los Angeles happy or yelling, prompting her to have constant “stomach-in-knots” moments.“Make the wrong face and the next thing I knew I would get hit in the face,” she said. “He would say: ‘Watch your mouth.’”Over time, she said, she began to experience his “abusive side” and his “controlling side” adding that his mood would vary day to day, which affected her “greatly”.Ventura recalled that Combs had guns in safes in his multiple homes, which alarmed her. She cited one particular incident during which Combs made her carry one of the guns, something he did on multiple occasions, which “terrified” her.That incident involved Combs pursuing his longtime rival Suge Knight: “We were having a freak-off in one of his homes in LA and he said Suge was at Mel’s Diner and we packed up and drove down there,” Ventura said.“I was screaming and crying: ‘Please don’t do anything stupid.’ I didn’t know what they were going to do.”Combs, who was arrestedlast September, faces charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations.Daniel Phillip, the second witness called on Monday and a former manager of a “male revue show”, was back on the stand on Tuesday morning to finish his testimony and cross examination.On Tuesday, Combs’s lawyer Xavier Donaldson asked Phillip if Ventura “was in complete control of everything she did” with Combs.“I cannot say that,” Phillip said.Phillip later testified about Ventura’s drug use and noted its infrequency during their encounters. He also revealed that he had bigger feelings for her: “Had she ever given me the chance to date her, I absolutely would have.”On Monday, a jury of eight men and four womenheard opening statements, and testimony from the first two witnesses called to the stand by the government.Prosecutors allege that Combs ran a “criminal enterprise” through his business empire, aided by associates and employees, that engaged in crimes such as sex trafficking, kidnapping, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice – allegedly dating back to at least 2004.First day of Sean Combs sex-trafficking trial ends as prosecutors say he ‘ran a criminal enterprise’Read moreCombs’s defense attorneys acknowledged that Combs perpetrated domestic violence in the past, but denied any involvement in sex trafficking or a racketeering conspiracy, and portrayed any group sex as consensual, describing it as part of a “swinger’s lifestyle”.Before court adjourned for the day, prosecutors questioned Ventura about the circumstances surrounding the hotel assault captured in 2016 surveillance video. Ventura said that she, Combs and a male escort had been engaged in a “freak-off” in the hotel room, when at some point, Combs hit her. She then grabbed her things and left the room.Asked how many times Combs had thrown her to the floor like he is seen doing in the footage in the hotel elevator lobby, Ventura responded: “too many to count”.Proceedings are scheduled to return Wednesday morning with continued questioning by the prosecution.In accordance with federal court rules, the trial is not being televised. If convicted, Combs, who has been jailed since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

Australia’sMilkshake Man by Go-Jois quite self-explanatory; the standout is Finland’s Erika Vikman with Ich Komme (“I am coming” in German). Set to a four-on-the-floor beat and Eurodance instrumental, the track bursts with unrestrained hands-in-the-air energy. Vikman sings of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance with a vigour reminiscent of Norway’s 2023 entry Queen of the Kings, by Alessandra. Vikman hails from a family of Finnish tango musicians – her mother and sister are both active in the genre – and she herself embraced it early in her career. Still, back in 2020, her breakout hit was another sex-positive, disco-inspired anthem: Cicciolina, which celebrates the boldness and self-determination of the Hungarian-born porn star Ilona Staller.Lucio Corsi – Volevo Essere un Duro (Italy)Italy’s entries have always portrayed masculinity in a way that’s more layered than meets the eye, with performers and songwriters such as Cristiano Malgioglio, Renato Zero, and Ivan Cattaneo challenging machismo. In 2025, Lucio Corsi takes the baton with Volevo Essere un Duro (I wanted to be a tough guy), which challenges gendered preconceptions. Melodically, it has hints of 1970s glam rock and Elton John’s ballads, and it conjures a fairytale-like atmosphere that’s amplified by Corsi’s elven-like self-presentation. There’s a bit of a fairytale to his place here, too: he placed second at the Sanremo music festival – to determine Italy’s contender – but got to compete after the winner Olly declined to participate.Emmy – Laika Party (Ireland)Upon learning about the bleak fate of the space dog Laika, Norwegian pop star Emmy tried to envision an alternate story: what if she had not been left to die in space but instead enjoyed dancing among the stars and comets? A delightful synthesis of Aqua, Grimes and a hint of Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road allows us to imagine her partying like it’s 1999. But why is a Norwegian singing about the Soviet space dog Laika representing Ireland, you may ask? Technically, Laika Party counts one Irish and three Norwegian songwriters. It had originally been submitted as a candidate to Norway’s national contest Melodi Grand Prix, only to be rejected by the broadcaster. Ireland’s Eurosong accepted it and it won both the national jury and the televote. Technicalities exist, and should be taken advantage of!Princ – Mila (Serbia)“Dear, you paid the price of me loving you,” goes the refrain of Mila, a heart-rending Balkan power ballad about the end of a toxic relationship. The artist is polymath Princ – frontman of the rock band Sisyphus, former karate champion, philologist and language instructor with a degree in Scandinavian languages, literature and culture, and Jesus in the 2020 Serbian production of Jesus Christ Superstar. While the lyrics portray a slighted man grovelling in the aftermath of the relationship – at one point calling his beloved’s new partner a “liar” – Princ’s delivery renders him tortured and sympathetic rather than pathetic.Laura Thorn – La Poupée Monte le Son (Luxembourg)Dolls and their agency – or lack thereof – are a great musical and artistic trope: look at the ballet Coppélia, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Doll on a Music Box and Aqua’s Barbie Girl. The LuxembourgianEurovisionentry La Poupée Monte le Son (the doll turns up the volume) by Laura Thorn is a tribute to France Gall’s song Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son, composed by Serge Gainsbourg, which won Eurovision 60 years ago. However, over a melody that combines strings, a four-to-the-floor beat and a vaguely eerie music-box melody, Thorn’s doll asserts “je ne suis pas ta marionnette” and lifts from Bizet to warn the man she addresses: “Prends garde à toi” – watch yourself.Tommy Cash – Espresso Macchiato (Estonia)Amore, spaghetti, mafia and espresso are the basis of Tommy Cash’s rap-dance ode to Italian cliches: “Mi like to fly privati / With 24 carati / Also mi casa very grandioso / Mi money numeroso.” It shares no thematic similarities with Sabrina Carpenter’s Espresso but rather DJ Ötzi’s après-ski anthem Pronto Giuseppe!, and in a year where a host of vaguely Italian-themed, AI-generated surrealist memes known as “Italian brainrot” are going viral, the nonsense of Espresso Macchiato fully embodies the zeitgeist. Cash co-wrote it with Johannes Naukkarinen, who gave us the metal-dance-pop fusion track and 2023 Finnish Eurovision entry Cha Cha Cha by Käärijä, in which the drink of choice is piña colada.KAJ – Bara Bada Bastu (Sweden)We don’t want to host if KAJ’s sauna song wins Eurovision, says Swedish city of MalmöRead moreAs the land of Max Martin and Abba, Sweden has historically sent legit – albeit perhaps too clean-cut – pop acts to Eurovision. This year they abruptly changed artistic direction, and along came KAJ, a Fenno-Swedish music/comedy group that credits the unapologetic weirdness of past Finnish acts for the inspiration behind their song, Bara Bada Bastu (let’s take a sauna), performed in the Vörå dialect and featuring that other traditional Eurovision sound, the folksy, pan-European accordion. (A line about dropping the soap was expunged from the final cut.) At this year’s Melodifestivalen – Sweden’s contest to name their Eurovision entrant – KAJ started as the underdog but ended up winning as well as topping Spotify’s global viral chart.Melody – Esa Diva (Spain)In 2001, age 10, Spanish singer Melody released the Euro-rumba tune El Baile del Gorila, complete with ape-channelling choreography: the start of a successful career in the Spanish and Latin-American market. In 2025, she’s representing Eurovision with the anthemic Esa Diva (that diva). It starts as an introspective ballad, similar to 2014 winner Conchita Wurst’s Rise Like a Phoenix, with Melody herself reminiscing on her career. Then the chorus hits and the beat drops, and she offers her own expansive definition of what makes a diva: not just someone who does not step on others in order to shine, or someone who can rise again “with more strength than a hurricane”, but a mother who wakes up early and a struggling artist. The thumping bass lines and lyrics celebrating a person’s own uniqueness irrespective of their life circumstances makes this 2025’s equivalent to Emma Muscat’s 2022 entry for Malta, I Am What I Am.Ziferblat – Bird of Pray (Ukraine)What would Bohemian Rhapsody sound like if it were composed for Eurovision by a Ukrainian alt-rock band in 2025? Ziferblat’s Bird of Pray feels straight out of a 70s rock opera; it balances various elements, including an all-female choir conjuring a sacred atmosphere, rock anthemics and the theatrics of singer Danylo Leshchynskyi, whose presentation echoes Bowie. The lyrics provide a sombre contrast to the high-octane production, telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated by the war, with the titular bird conveying a message of hope – it’s a bird ofpray,not prey.Sissal – Hallucination (Denmark)With an electronic base reminiscent of Sia and David Guetta’s collaborations, and with powerhouse, Adele-lite vocals that stave off predictability, Sissal’s Hallucination is a neatly packaged EDM-scandi-pop record that feels like a welcome 2010s throwback (akin to Carola’s Invincible and Loreen’s Euphoria). This is not a coincidence: Sissal’s inspirations are Norwegian singer Dagny and Swedish singer Robyn. Is it a bit safe? Sure, but high camp, sexual innuendo and joyous nonsense need a counterpoint to avoid the contest descending into caricature. Plus, the obsessive posters on Eurovision forums and subreddits swear she is best on stage.The grand final of the Eurovision song contest 2025 will take place in Basel, Switzerland, on 17 May.

Anna Perach, an artist born in Ukraine, talks us through her new show inspired by Hoffman’s love triangle tale The SandmanEliza GoodpastureTue 13 May 2025 10.38 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 11.53 EDTShare‘I’m led by stories,” Anna Perach tells me as we sit in her sun-drenched studio at Gasworks in London. The wall behind me is stacked with a rainbow of yarns, and on her desk sit a collection of texts that point to the key themes of her work: femininity, magic and the uncanny. Perach’s life-size humanoid sculptures made of tufted carpet surround us, their presence equal parts eerie and warming. Their strange humanity seems steeped in narrative, which she draws from folklore and fairytales.The sculptures cry out to be touched, with their beautifully fluffy, varied and multicoloured surfaces. They are, as she says, “aesthetically overbearing”. Perach’s work is in part about the porous boundaries between bodies and the world. Their intense tactility, meanwhile, brings out a childish desire to sink your fingers deep into a comforting, if slightly spooky, softness. And their hollowness asks the viewer to imagine a body inside them – when exhibiting the works, performers do inhabit them and bring them to life.I grew up with tons of carpet. It’s heavy and weird – but creates cosinessPerach was born in Ukraine behind the iron curtain, and Soviet aesthetics are foundational to her work. But her medium of tufted carpet came to her intuitively. “I grew up with tons of carpet. It has an uncanniness: it’s heavy and weird, but it also creates cosiness and home.” She describes the tension between excess and scarcity in the history of Russian taste, and the way that desire for abundant patterns and textures has always influenced her. “I intuitively make work from what I know. I think we all do,” she says. The unexpected way she uses carpets or rugs brings to mind the phrase “sweeping it under the rug”; Perach smiles as she tells me that her work tries to show “what’s under the rug”.View image in fullscreen‘I make work from what I know’ … Anna Perach in her studio.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFor her new exhibition at Richard Saltoun in London, Perach has made a series of sculptures and works on paper that respond to the 1817 ETA Hoffman story The Sandman, about a love triangle between a man, his fiancee and an automaton. There is a moment in the story when the automaton, Olympia, is singing in public and glitches, behaving strangely and revealing to the audience that she is only a machine. Inspired by this moment, Perach has made two identical sculptures in the shape of Victorian dresses that will be activated in the gallery space: one by a human hidden inside, and one by a machine. Perach wants to explore how viewers will respond to the disjuncture – the glitch – of realising that they can’t immediately tell which is which.“It’s not inspired by AI,” she is quick to tell me, but the discomfort the story raises is connected to the questions we’re dealing with today around automation and artificial intelligence. “The terror of automatons or AI is the way they play with your assumptions of humanity, which in turn makes you question your own humanity.” She has titled the exhibition A Leap of Sympathy, a phrase borrowed from philosopher Henri Bergson referring to the way that we are all constantly making the assumption that the people around us are fellow humans, so that we can connect with them. Perach’s work asks what happens when that assumption is called into question.This is the first time she has used mechanics or robotics in her sculptures. In previous exhibitions, as well as this one, Perach worked in collaboration with choreographer Luigi Ambrosio, sound composer Laima Leyton and performer Maria Sole Montaci. Perach has only performed inside the sculptures herself a few times. “I see myself more and more as a director – I can’t be master of all crafts,” she says. Working with her collaborators gives her access to a range of expertise to bring her work to life.View image in fullscreenProud legacy … Uncanny Valley by Anna Perach.Photograph: The ArtistPerach purposefully walks the line between craft and fine art. “I push the craft element to the extreme,” she says. That aspect of her work is another way she engages with femininity – after all, women have traditionally been associated with craft and especially with textile work. The way her carpet figures have peeled off their two-dimensional stretcher to take up space in the room makes a case against the hierarchy that has traditionally seen media other than painting or sculpting with marble or bronze looked down on. They sit proudly in a legacy of pagan eastern European visual traditions, with their monstrous masked beasts and colourful traditional folk attire.She has started to branch out into other materials – most recently glass – but can’t imagine letting go of carpet. “The material is so forgiving and malleable, and it can be manipulated in so many ways,” she explains. She started out by cutting up existing carpets to make sculptures with them, but wanted more control over the material. Her practice now incorporates both mechanical and manual processes of tufting, and allows her to control the supply chain feeding her work – “I know where my yarn comes from,” she says.Perach’s work takes a long view of history – and of life. “I’m fascinated by the split between spirit and matter,” she says. “I’m trying to go back to that place of trauma, of split.” The drift away from magical and mystical ways of understanding the world towards highly scientific ones is one of the defining features of modernity. “As we grow up – as individuals and as a society – we are forced to rationalise. There is an element of refusal to do so in my work,” she says.As we talk about the many new questions arising around AI and new digital innovations, she reminds me that many of those questions are actually old, if not ancient. Stories such as Hoffman’s, or Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein,grappled with the threat of non-human life long before we ever imagined the details of something like ChatGPT. Reflecting on the fundamental questions at the core of all those works, she says: “It’s really an ancient fantasy to give something life.

Such a one, sadly, is this listless and supercilious musical – ostensibly on the theme of heartwarming home town values – which flatlines like a hedgehog run over by an 18-wheeler the moment the female lead opens her mouth to sing one of the film’s many terrible songs.Cécile (played by French singer Juliette Armanet) is about to open a restaurant in the big city having recently won a top-rated TV cooking show, and she is dating her colleague Sofiane (Tewfik Jallab). But when she hears that her adorable, exasperating old dad Gérard (François Rollin) has had a heart attack, brought on by the strain of running the family’s truck-stop cafe out in the boondocks with Cécile’s mum Fanfan (Dominique Blanc), she realises she must (naturally) put her shallow workaholic lifestyle on hold to go and see him. But of course she runs into her twinkly-eyed ex-boyfriend from the old neighbourhood; this is Raph (Bastien Bouillon), whose heart broke when she just left one day – and what makes it all complicated is that she’s pregnant.This bafflingly underpowered, muddled film is the work of Amélie Bonnin, a feature-length adaptation of her award-winning short of the same name. It is burdened by a trite and naive sentimentality that it doesn’t know how to make realistically plausible or transform into romanticism or idealism. One of the many things the film can’t make up its mind about is food. Cécile is now the fancy purveyor of haute cuisine to discerning diners and she had been a bit snobbish in interviews about the homely fare her old mum and dad used to dish up at the truck stop – and her dad’s feelings were hurt. But will she finally see that the simple, homely “pot-au-feu” cooking has something inspired about it? And that embracing it will demonstrate her new maturity and humility as a chef and human being? Or is it, erm, just slop that she was quite right to deride?We never really find out. Cécile is unconvincing and uninteresting as a devotee of either type of cooking. There is no gusto, no flavour to the music either. When the characters start singing, there is no passion, or even camp enjoyment … just a sense that, don’t worry, the lo-cal singing will be over soon and we can get back to the equally bad spoken dialogue.Then there’s Raph. Should she really be with him? Should he really be with her? He seems to think so … mooning and swooning over her like he’s still a teen. But wait. Raph is actually married, with a kid. So does he feel pain at almost cheating on his wife? At revealing that he doesn’t love this woman? Again, we never find out. The subject is never acknowledged.One day, we will have a film where a workaholic from the big city comes back to their home town to realise that their values are boring and oppressive and the big city is morally superior as well as more exciting. It would at least be unusual.Partir Un Jour screened at theCannes film festival.Explore more on these topicsFilmMusicalsComedy filmsRomance filmsFranceCannes film festivalFoodreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a story that the director appeared to have chanced upon through following the blog of a brilliant photographer, Maria Vatne, who recorded her idyllic wilderness existence living on a farm in Norway withher British husband Nik Payne and their three home-schooled children, Ulv, Falk, and Freja, and an elder daughter Ronja, from Maria’s previous partner. Butone blogpost from October 2018, titled A New Kind of Wildernessrevealed that she had cervical cancer, and she died in 2019.The film shows us the family coming to terms with their terrible loss and grief, particularly Nik. For a start, they can no longer live on their beloved farm because without Maria’s photography income Nik cannot keep up the mortgage repayments; they must move to a much smaller place and the kids will go to regular school. (So their former existence was not, in fact, as “off-grid” as all that; Maria’s website reveals that she took photography assignments and the idyllic farm images perhaps functioned in a way as a shopwindow.) The film allows us to wonder if Nik’s emotional wretchedness is subtly complicated by feelings of self-reproach as a breadwinner. Also, he ponders taking the children home to England where his relatives have a farm, but the children would find that insupportable and it might be the ultimate disloyalty to Maria.Then there is Ronja, whom the film reveals to have moved back in with their dad, and her father’s absence is itself, incidentally, something to ponder. Ronja reveals she always felt a little estranged from her half-siblings, especially Freja, and there is a painful, emotional break between the two of them as Ronja decides to move away from them all to Bodø in the remote Nordland county to train as a midwife (perhaps in an unacknowledged, unprocessed spirit of anger).The film, with heartfelt sweetness, finally shows the children starting to grow up and move on, while for Nik it is not so easy. And then, over the closing credits, the director springs what is effectively a brilliant, subtle, extra-textualcoup de cinema; she directs the audience to Maria’s website, perhaps in the knowledge that they might well read Maria’s blogpost from June 2016, called The Letting Go, which will send you back to watch the film all over again. A deeply humane and emotionally literate piece of work.A New Kind of Wilderness is in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFamilyParents and parentingNorwayEuropeDeath and dyingreviewsShareReuse this content"

Virtually nothing, except the interest of television mastermindNathan Fielder, who braids such disparate concepts together in the galaxy-brained second season ofThe Rehearsal.In just four episodes, thegenre-bending show of elaborate simulations– essentially, extremely realistic role-playing in the name of preparing people for uncomfortable situations – has provided some of the most compelling, bizarre and dementedly brilliant scenes on television this year: a shy commercial airline pilot on a first date, accompanied by 20 actors mirroring his every move. Fielder, sporting his series uniform laptop harness, peering into a “wrecked” cockpit through pretend flames. The sight of the Lizard Lounge – an exact replica of Brooklyn’s Alligator Lounge, where Fielder wastending barjust last month – inside an exact replica of a section of Houston’s George Bush airport. And in a scene that was shockingly transgressive even for a docu-comedy auteur who has built a career on stretching the outer boundaries of reality television, the sight of Fielder, shaven, rubber-capped and diapered, suckling from the papier-mache teat of a puppet 50s housewife as part of a canonically insane, deeply sincere attempt to relive the life – and thus absorb the wisdom – of Captain Sully Sullenberger (of Tom Hanks biopic, crashing into the Hudson fame).Surreality TV: The Curse finds the horror in home renovation showsRead moreIf you haven’t seen The Rehearsal or aren’t acclimatized to Fielder’s ultra-cringe brand of experimental comedy, this probably sounds deeply off-putting, tedious and/or nonsensical. And it is – Fielder’s comedy, which could more accurately be described as Rube Goldberg-esque social experiments pursued to such absurd ends and with such deadpan narration as to produce laughter, is deliberately alienating. Zigging where others would zag, getting hung up on what others would glide past, building arcane in-jokes with long-simmering payoffs in the lane of erstwhile prestige TV dramas, it is television probing the human condition – how people think, why they behave a certain way, how they react to off-script social interactions – that is difficult to explain to other humans, difficult to follow and at times difficult to watch.And yet, it is appointment television, a truly singular meditation on artifice and authenticity, performance and sincerity, that has only improved with its second season. The Rehearsal’s first outing, which aired in 2022, introduced audiences to Fielder’s particular strand of neuroticism and apparent negotiating power atHBO; over six episodes, he constructed numerous simulations to approximate a potential real-life experience, primarily oriented around one woman’s deliberation over whether or not to have a child (in one of the show’s dicier and rightfully critiqued bits, Fielder played father to a real toddler). Fielder’s genius lies as much in episodic structure as in performance of his affectless producer persona – The Rehearsal marked a graduation, of sorts, from the harebrained business schemes of his Comedy Central seriesNathan For Youto becoming the Penn & Teller of television, pulling off sleights of hand while showing the strings and delivering the most monotone “abracadabra” imaginable, with a revelatory commitment to, as one fanput it, letting the camera linger long enough to reveal someone to be the weirdest person alive.With the six-episode second season, Fielder has leveled up the scale and stakes of his magic tricks, while further interrogating the production, assumptions and experiences that go into producing reality television, in service of a seemingly noble and topical aim: aviation safety. Fielder theorizes that the No 1 understudied cause of plane crashes is human error compounded by a breakdown of communication in the cockpit. Co-pilots, for whatever reason, do not correct pilots when they make a mistake. Based on the number of real crashes Fielder’s team re-enacts, with obligatory virtual explosions, via flight simulator in the first episode, this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis. But to prove it, Fielder embarks on a characteristically intricate and involved series of experiments, from recreating the life conditions of a 2011 dog for its clone – the better to test nature v nurture – to encouraging a co-pilot to confront issues with his girlfriend during a simulated flight.How The Rehearsal pushes the boundaries of reality TVRead moreThere’s a certain hyper-competency pleasure to seeing these scenarios play out, to seeing someone’s imagination given this much financial and legal runway. But the series is most satisfying, to this TV fan, as a grand deconstruction of the rules of reality TV through elaborate role-play. The fourth episode dissects the series-long assumptions behind hiring actors to say certain lines of dialogue or perform certain scenarios, questioning the logic behind any suspension of disbelief. And one of the series’ many side quests includes the elaborate staging of an aviation-themed singing competition modeled on Fielder’s experience as a 23-year-old junior producer for Canadian Idol – the northern spinoff of American Idol – where he was tasked with rejecting hopeful singers who did not exhibit “star potential”. The meditation on what makes would-be off-screen staff better at an unenviable task is at once fascinating and practical; theoretically, co-pilot judges – selected because they all share the quality of having not died in a plane crash – who practice rejection would be better prepared to stand up to stubborn captains.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Wings of Voice has, like all of Fielder’s work, drawn criticism for psychological manipulation and false representation. On Monday, participant Lana Love broke a show NDA toclaimthat she lost $10,000 and was tricked by the show’s producers into thinking she was on a real singing competition show and not, as Fielder calls it, “a singing competition as part of another TV show that has nothing to do with singing”. A level of manipulation is baked into the Fielderian worldview and school of acting, though I’d argue that, at this point, his methods are easily Googled and the subject of the show’s ultimate critique. The Rehearsal season two is, in my view, the least ethically fraught of Fielder’s output (and that includes his dramatic turn on the HGTV satireThe Curse). The show’s overarching illusion works because it serves an overall purpose more pointed than the original aim to “better understand the human condition” – it’s impossible to tell how serious Fielder is about changing Federal Aviation Administration training requirements around flight simulations to encourage better cockpit communications, but he seems serious enough about it to devote six episode of expensive television to the cause, with an added argument for pilots to get better therapy.Nathan Fielder’s TV show moves in mysterious ways – my ex laughed, I cried | Emma ForrestRead moreAnd with a sly, deceptive heart. In the most recent episode, which aired on Sunday, Fielder helps a shy co-pilot named Colin improve his nonexistent romantic life by practicing a first date, with a twist. Having watched enough nature documentaries to know that some animals function well in packs, Fielder recruits a dozen or so actors to hover around Colin, mimicking every move and word, the idea being that it’s easier to do things when you’re not doing it by yourself. It’s very possible that the bashful, social cue-averse Colin was also an unstated actor. Fielder, of course, has his own motives as master puppeteer; the image of Colin sipping coffee echoed by a chorus of other faces does indeed make excellent television. But it also made me tear up, this surreal, distinctly Fielder hack to the unavoidable loneliness of being alive, to the universal discomfort of social awkwardness and personal insecurity. It fails, of course. The show purports to believe that all human behavior can be taught, that all emotions can be simulated and thus controlled. Both the magician and the audience know that life doesn’t work that way, but what a wonder to pretend otherwise.Explore more on these topicsNathan FielderUS televisionTelevisionTV comedyHBOComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There’s an almost lazy richness to the picture: the late afternoon sun, the “moss so lush between the wooden rail ties that, at a certain angle of thick, verdant light, it looks like algae”, the junkyard “packed with school buses in various stages of amnesia”.His poetic credentials established, the author of the bestselling autofictionalOn Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeousgives narrative its head. Instead of jumping from the bridge, Hai crosses it, to be adopted on the other side by 82-year-old Grazina, a woman suffering mid‑stage prefrontal lobe dementia. He will become her proxy grandson; they will be each other’s support in a crap world. It will be a disordered but productive relationship.Grazina, born in Lithuania, “an old country, far away”, lives on a street known locally as the Devil’s Armpit, takes 14 pills a day, and always eats Stouffer’s Salisbury Steak for dinner. She needs a carer; Hai, a pillhead in remission but longing to be back in the arms of opioids, needs a more constructive narrative of himself. Between them they invent a role-playing game to bring her down from the destabilising hallucinations and insomniac panics of her disease. Then, as she sleeps, he quietly ransacks her cupboards for prescription medicines.This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fictionSome of the themes of On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous echo through into this novel. We recognise the familial landscapes of the Vietnamese immigration to the US; the need to manage partly assimilated, dangerously unprocessed generational tensions; the sense of life as the pursuit of a second chance. Complex relations between story and backstory also feature, but at a less demanding scale, producing less of a dense lyrical flicker at the sentence level, more of a traditional juggle with larger narrative elements. This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fiction; from the industrial farming of animals to the drive to write yourself free of the parental experience.As well as chosen family, The Emperor of Gladness is also about the brutality of work. Hai takes a job at HomeMarket, a fast-casual diner chain out on Route 4. There, beside “smoking vats of vibrant, primary-coloured side dishes” precooked “nearly a year ago in a laboratory outside Des Moines”, he makes more new friends. BJ, the manager, “six foot three with a buzz cut fade and shape-up”, whose ambition is to become a pro wrestler under the pseudonym Deez Nuts; Russia, “a cuter version of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings”, who is actually of Tajikistani origins; Maureen the cashier, an ageing conspiracy theorist who relieves her arthritic knees each evening with a pack of mac and cheese from the freezer. Soon, they are his family too. Family outings include a visit to a slaughterhouse where the barbaric conditions are genuinely difficult to read, and an evening of wrestling at Hairy Harry’s dive bar: experiences and situations which move steadily towards surrealism as the novel comes to its climax.BJ’s crew are “just like the people anywhere else in New England. Weatherworn and perennially exhausted or pissed off or both.” The take-home from their state being that, whatever else, the HomeMarket chain offers a tacky but undeniably sensual experience to the customer; and a living, however minimal, for the crew. Where they converge, these two basic socioeconomic goods encourage the emergence of a third: a genuine if brief glow of gladness cast over a life of hopeless situations. Versions of this glow become the real subject of the story. Dwellers in precarity must provide themselves with a narrative future. Some are better at it than others. For Hai – who once told himself the story of “wanting to be a writer” – such support fictions aren’t maintenance-free: after every defeat, every incursion of reality, they have to be repaired and revised. It’s hard labour, carried out in addition to his daily struggles to manage Grazina’s illness and earn a living. He’s not good at it.We’re all writers now, Vuong seems to suggest. A cheap dinner eaten at HomeMarket under the kitsch but somehow menacing light of a Thomas Kinkade fantasy painting – “Beside Still Waters”, “Victorian Family Christmas” – is a story of reward. Two Dilaudid pills, crushed and snorted, are a story about time out. Any economic aspiration at all is so clearly a fiction. This condition is depicted with the authenticity of experience. At the same time Vuong takes it apart with patience and an ear for dialogue: “I like Nasa – the real kind, not make-believe like Star Trek,” he has Hai’s cousin Sony – named after the TV – say. “My mom likes make-believe, but I hate it. It makes things wobbly.” Heartbreaking, heartwarming yet unsentimental, and savagely comic all at the same time, The Emperor of Gladness is about just how wobbly things can become.The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

Brain scans revealed a damaged hippocampus and a tumour, probably benign. To improve her memory, doctors asked her to look at strings of numbers, and then reel them off backwards – an exercise she likens to “Cognitive Crufts”. She ruminates on the relationship between language, memory and time: “three gifts, co-dependent, that create and sustain each other”. Her first book, All of Us Atoms, is a memoir in snapshots, sketching a rough portrait of her life through a series of scattered recollections and reflections.Dawson’s story begins in an unnamed industrial town, where the closure of the local steelworks had produced a surplus of “angry bored men, making mothers out of their wives”; her family decamped to a Cornish fishing village, where she spent the best part of her childhood. As a youngster she was “serious and odd” – morbid, obsessed with the past, a little solipsistic. Hers was among the last generations of pupils to access private schooling via the Assisted Places Scheme, shortly before it was discontinued by the Thatcher government. She later moved to rural East Sussex, where she is currently “reader-in-residence” at Charleston.In a life marked by change and uncertainty, the family unit was the one constant. Dawson writes with tenderness about her younger brother, and credits her grandmother with teaching her to “hold real life lightly and imaginative life tight”. At the age of 16, she had been on the verge of joining a prestigious ballet school, but turned it down at the last minute because it would mean being away from her family. Although the admissions process had been long and arduous, she couldn’t go through with it. She has no regrets. She saw herself, her mother and her brother as three parts of a single entity: “Put them together, and their triangle keeps them safe.”All of Us Atoms is best understood as a sort of love letterThis all feels very intimate, and at times the reader has the uncomfortable sense of snooping on personal correspondence. The sentimentalism occasionally cloys; an extended metaphor about how children are a bit like satsumas is laboured to the point of embarrassment. In one three-page chapter, Dawson lists the most beautiful sounds she has ever heard in a series of unpunctuated, single-line paragraphs, written entirely in lower case. (“a japanese garden the breeze through the cherry trees the trickle of tea into porcelain cups”.)The narrative voice changes from one chapter to the next. Early on in the book, Dawson’s brain addresses her in the second person, reproaching her for running it into the ground through lack of self-care; later, she’s a third-person character, denoted by reference to her role – “The Sister”, “The Dancer”, “The Mother”, and so on. She adopts a slightly stunted vocabulary for childhood recollections: her body turns “erupty skinny red” and she “gets all sick hot dizzy volcanoey” during bouts of illness; she writes of her “you-ness”, “is-ness” and “we-hood”, presumably because her younger self doesn’t know the grownup words for these concepts.This reticence about using “I” in an autobiographical work is intriguing. The blend of second- and third-person voices imbues the narration with an evasive, deflective quality – it’s the literary equivalent of avoiding eye contact. Dawson mentions in passing that she tended to view the world in gendered terms (“Men/Bad, Women/Good”), but doesn’t feel the need to unpack this. Although her apparently formative obsession with Virginia Woolf is referenced at several points, we are not told what it was about Woolf’s work that resonated with her. It’s just not that sort of memoir; the author is more interested in aestheticising the process of recall itself than imparting information.All of Us Atoms is best understood as a sort of love letter. The central theme is human interdependence – the idea, hinted at in the book’s title, that our sense of self is largely shaped by the roles we perform in our relationships with others. Axiomatic, perhaps, and borderline platitudinous, but it bears repeating. Caring is the only truly important thing we do in every phase of our brief time on Earth – “This constant procession of becoming and unbecoming.

Even if they don’t, that needn’t put you off: the new show from Mischief, the company behind the smash-hit … Goes Wrong series, also offers farce, slapstick and multiple callbacks. So much of the script relies on linguistic misunderstandings (sweet/suite, need/knead, etc) that even the most tolerant viewer may become homophone-phobic.View image in fullscreenThe gag rate of Airplane! … Chris Leask (Sergei Ivanov) and Charlie Russell (Elena Popov) in The Comedy About Spies.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianThe nonsense, orchestrated by director Matt DiCarlo, kicks off immediately with secret agents confusingly named after letters of the alphabet (“Not U –you!”). We then jump to the art deco lobby of the Piccadilly Hotel where MI6, the CIA and the KGB are trying to get their hands on the mysterious Project Midnight. Among those caught up in the tangle of mistaken identities are a milquetoast baker and a blustering thespian hoping to be cast in Dr No as “Ooh-Seven”.A predisposition to the gag-rate ofAirplane!will boost enjoyment, though The Comedy About Spies is fast-paced enough to make that film seem positively Beckettian. I was crying helpless tears of laughter within the first five minutes, and at several other moments throughout, not least during a line about a haunted leaflet that would take a paragraph to explain. The damp-squib gags tend to be eclipsed by the dynamite ones, with a single exception: a vulgar running joke about a veteran CIA agent thrilled by the prospect of a threesome with her own son rather sours the jolly mood.A very British omnishambles: how The Play That Goes Wrong conquered the worldRead moreDavid Farley’s doll’s-house-style cross-section set, which splits the hotel into colour-coded quarters in the first act, is glorious, but his designs grow fussy and over-dressed in act two and leave one craving the ingenious minimalism ofOperation Mincemeat. The depth of emotion in that similarly silly show is also absent here, making The Comedy About Spies a more mechanical endeavour. Except, that is, for actor and co-writer Henry Lewis’s poignant final line reading, which bestows dignity on to a character (the Bond wannabe) who has been a buffoon throughout. This time, there were tears in my eyes for a different reason.At theNoël Coward theatre, London, until 5 SeptemberExplore more on these topicsTheatreComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)West EndreviewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump wrote The Art of the Deal, or at least had his name on the cover, and the playwrightDavid Mametmade his film directing debut with House of Games, a thriller in which Mike draws Margaret, a psychotherapist, into his world of tells, bluffs and long cons.View image in fullscreenStandout … Oscar Lloyd as Billy in House of Games.Photograph: Manuel HarlanFor the stage adaptation, Richard Bean (One Man, Two Guvnors) has retained the plot while surrounding Mike with a more broadly comic posse whose charms are exhausted long before their stage time. The locations have been reduced to a manageable two. Occupying the upper half of Ashley Martin-Davis’s set is Margaret’s office, crisp and bright but occasionally lined with noirish stripes. Beneath the office – and very much the id to its ego – is the dingy bar where Mike and his crew mount the elaborate cons that resemble fringe theatre performances (one of the reasons why the screen-to-stage switch makes sense). In the opening split-seconds, director Jonathan Kent and lighting designer Peter Mumford pull off a minor trick of their own: a visual switcheroo more satisfying than anything in the play proper.Bean teases the material into new shapes which continue or comment on other Mamet works. A familial triangle mirrors the ones in American Buffalo and The Cryptogram: Billy, the antsy gambler whose plight first connects Margaret to Mike, is made an explicitly filial figure, with the therapist and the conman his surrogate parents. That choice pays off nicely during the explicitly Oedipal confrontation that gives the play its climax.Where House of Games never gels is in the marriage of Mamet’s ascetic sensibility with Bean’s crowd-pleasing cheer: it’s the equivalent of an emaciated figure in a baggy suit. Kent’s direction of the ensemble scenes also has a frustrating shapelessness; the central sequence is so unfocused that any tension has dissipated by the time the con is revealed.Despite the efforts of Lisa Dillon as Margaret, Richard Harrington as Mike and especially Oscar Lloyd, the show’s standout as Billy, this is a low-stakes enterprise overall. Then again, perhaps none of its bait-and-switch tricks could ever compete with the ultimate real-life plot-twist:Mamet going Maga.AtHampstead theatre, London, until 7 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreHampstead theatreDavid MametreviewsShareReuse this content"

There are two options for publishers wishing to make use of the technology: “Audible-managed” production, or “self-service” whereby publishers produce their own audiobooks with the help of Audible’s AI technology.Both options will allow publishers to choose from more than 100 AI-generated voices across English, Spanish, French and Italian to narrate their books. AI translation of audiobooks is expected to be available later in the year.“Audible believes that AI represents a momentous opportunity to expand the availability of audiobooks with the vision of offering customers every book in every language, alongside our continued investments in premium original content,” said Bob Carrigan, the chief executive of Audible. “We’ll be able to bring more stories to life – helping creators reach new audiences while ensuring listeners worldwide can access extraordinary books that might otherwise never reach their ears.”However, Audible’s announcement has been criticised by writers, translators and voice actors. “This shortsighted scheme reduces what we love about storytelling to the simple delivery of code,” said Chocolat author Joanne Harris. “In an age of declining literacy, I can’t think of anything more likely to put people off listening to audiobooks altogether.”Kristin Atherton, who has narrated more than 400 audiobook titles on Audible, said human narrators “actively sell audio content by being good at their jobs.“The art – and it is an art – of a good audiobook is the crack in the voice at a moment of unexpected emotion, the wryness of good comedy timing, or the disbelief a listener feels when one person can convincingly be a whole cast of characters,” she added. “No matter how ‘human’ an AI voice sounds, it’s those little intricacies that turn a good book into an excellent one. AI can’t replicate that.”Stephen Briggs, who voiced some of the audiobooks of Terry Pratchett’s Discworld novels, said: “The use of AI to replace human creativity is in itself a dangerous path,” while the actor and audiobook narrator Deepti Gupta said: “We need to create more, not less, space for Bipoc narrators, and these AI tools are a new way to marginalise and colonise the voices that need to be heard.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

Which is only true if you ignore the vast processing power even the simplest AI request requires.”“In the search for a cheap simulacra to an actual human, we are prepared to burn down the planet and call it progress,” he added.Meanwhile, Anna Ganley, chief executive of the UK’s largest writers’ body, the Society of Authors, said although this innovation “will expand the availability of audiobooks and help writers of all profiles reach new audiences”, the opportunities offered “must be transparent both to authors and consumers. Audible’s AI tool, and others like it, must not be used as a back door to teach and refine existing AI tools. Authors must be included in the process and not get shut out by tech companies and publishers. They must also be able to choose whether their work is narrated by a human or synthetic voice, and this must be clearly labelled to consumers.”Since last year, Audible has allowed self-publishing authors in the US to use its “virtual voice” technology to turn their ebooks into audiobooks. More than 60,000 of these computer-generated audiobooks currently exist.Audible, founded in 1995, is the longstanding global market leader for audiobooks. Its first comparable competitor arrived in 2023 when Spotify started offering audiobooks to its premium subscribers. Membership, which costs £7.99 a month in the UK, is reportedly at an all-time high.Explore more on these topicsAudiobooksArtificial intelligence (AI)AmazonComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

Inone image– including the artists Paul Thek and Eva Hesse – the writer Linda Rosenkrantz stands near the centre. “That was mostly people that I had gotten together, some who became very well-known,” Rosenkrantz tells me by phone from California. “Five or six of us would go ice-skating or dancing on Friday nights.”Rosenkrantz grew up in the Bronx in the 1930s. After university she moved to Manhattan to work in the publicity and editorial department of the Parke-Bernet auction house, becoming enmeshed in the city’s art scene. “I met Hujar in 1956. We hit it off immediately,” she says.Hujar and Rosenkrantzremained close until his death from Aids-related complications in 1987.View image in fullscreenIn crowd … from The Tribe by Peter Hujar, including Linda Rosenkrantz sitting on the floor.Photograph: Peter Hujar Archive LLC, Artists Rights Society ARS.In the 70s, when Rosenkrantz was an established writer, she asked various artists to note everything that happened to them on a specific day, and then read it out for her to record. The first two were Hujar and the painter Chuck Close . The latter’s day – 18 December 1974 – featured a job photographing Allen Ginsberg for theNew YorkTimes.The project eventually ran out of steam and Rosenkrantz didn’t give it much thought until decades later, when Hujar’s archive went to theMorgan Libraryin New York and she donated the material. Eventually the publisher Magic Hour Press discovered it and in 2021 released their discussion as the book,Peter Hujar’s Day. Now it’s been adapted intoa film by Passages director Ira Sachs, with Ben Whishaw as Hujar and Rebecca Hall playing Rosenkrantz.“When Ira Sachs signed up for the film, he got in touch and I instinctively felt that he was the right person to do it, because I had liked his other films,” says Rosenkrantz. “It’s been a great experience for me, and it was so serendipitous.”The film, which premiered to good reviewsat Sundance, is due for release later this year. It plays into a recent surge of interest in Hujar, with an acclaimed showat Raven Row in London, after an exhibition at the Venice Biennale last year. While Hujar has been celebrated in the decades since his death, Rosenkrantz remains lesser known.View image in fullscreen‘It’s been a great experience for me’ … Rosenkrantz (right) with Rebecca Hall at the Sundance premiere of Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APAged 90, she is living in Santa Monica in California. Her husband of 50 years, the Guernsey-born writer and artist Christopher Finch, died three years ago. When I contact Rosenkrantz about an interview, she cautions that she’s not very articulate, which is ironic given how heavily speech features in her work.She is best known for the cult book Talk from 1968, a dialogue-only “reality” novel, in which she spent months taping her conversations with friends. She then transcribed hours of tape into 1,500 pages of text, eventually whittling it to a story of three friends in their late 20s, spending a summer by a Long Island beach.It was a raw, funny book presenting people from the Warholian art crowd talking about sex, drugs, psychoanalysis and much else. (Sample chapter title: Emily, Marsha and Vincent Discuss Orgies).The book captured the modern moment in a novel way. “That kind of thing was in the zeitgeist. Artists were painting from photographs,” she says. “It just struck me as I was getting ready to go to East Hampton that I should take a tape recorder and I always had it in mind as a book.”It caused a minor stir.New York magazineran two reviews, alongside a photo of Rosenkrantz on the beach in a bikini, tape recorder by her side. Not all responses were kind. “It was mocked for all the talk of sex, drugs and therapy. There was a minister or some church person in Britain who thought it should be banned,” she recalls.It had its admirers too; Harold Pinter sent a note of praise, George Romero’sproduction companywanted the film rights and Leonard Cohen was a fan. “He said that he had read it out loud walking on the beach,” she says, “and that he had tried to do something similar and decided that it couldn’t be done and that I had done it.”Through the 60s and 70s, she was an art world insider, encountering the likes of Susan Sontag and David Hockney, going to Andy Warhol’s parties at the Factory. While working at Parke-Bernet, then acquired by Sotheby’s, she set up and edited their art magazine.She met her husband while running the magazine. He was a friend of Chuck Close and later she was the subject of one of the painter’slarge-scale portraits, not that sitting for him was particularly dramatic: “He took a polaroid. It was very quick and not a lot of talking or direction.”View image in fullscreen‘We hit it off immediately’ … Rosenkrantz and Hujar in Florence in 1958.Photograph: Joseph RaffaelAfter Talk was published, she tried more tape experiments, including the day-in-a-life recordings, while another idea, Ex, had gallows humour: “I invited, one by one, about a dozen ex-boyfriends to dinner and taped the whole evening, and they’re pretty funny.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They co-wrote anovel called Soho, a multi-generational saga set in the Manhattan neighbourhood, and Gone Hollywood, a social history of cinema’s golden age. “We worked very well together,” she says, though Soho – written under the pseudonym CL Byrd – “did not make an impact.”In 1990, the couple and their daughter Chloe left New York for LA, shortly after Rosenkrantz started a new track. A friend, Pamela Redmond Satran was an editor at Glamor magazine: “I pitched the idea of doing an article about baby names. And she said, ‘You know, I think this could be a book’.”Before this, there were just books with lists of names; Rosenkrantz and Satran added more analysis with social context and trends. “The first one, which was called Beyond Jennifer and Jason, sold very, very well,” she says. This was followed by nine more books. They set up a website,nameberry.com, to collect everything. “It influenced the culture in a major way.”Whether anticipating thebabynaming industry, or developing new approaches to storytelling, Rosenkrantz always had a knack for the new. “My father used to say that I was ahead of my time when I was quite young,” she says. She has also “always been attracted to unusual forms”, which led her to publish a memoir in the style of a listicle, before they were BuzzFed to death.View image in fullscreenWry self-awareness … Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: © Ira SachsMy Life As a List: 207 Things About My (Bronx) Childhood waspublished in 1999. But by the 00s, her most significant work – Talk - was no longer in wide circulation. One reason for its muddled reception was that her publishers presented it as a straightforward novel, rather than a recorded rendering of reality. But in 2015, when New York Review Books revived Talk in their Classics strand, she says, “It was a complete reversal. It got great reviews and was seen for what it was. I kind of insisted that it had to be what it was meant to be, which was a taped book. I felt very redeemed.”The book was praised as a blast of 60s counterculture and for its prescient view of neurotic city dwellers. CriticBecca Rothfield wrotethat it “reminds us that wry self-awareness and anxious fragility are hardly a millennial invention”. It was seen as presaging the autofiction boom of the 2010s and likened to the TV shows Girls and Broad City.Then in 2018, Lena Dunham’s website Lenny Letter revived parts of the Ex project:publishing transcriptsof Rosenkrantz’s boyfriend dinners, rendered in comic strip form.Today Rosenkrantz wants to do more with Ex, and revisit diaries she kept years ago. When Peter Hujar’s Day was published, she was said to be working on a book called Namedrops Keep Falling on My Head, about the people she’s met through the years. She says now that it’s not enough for a book but perhaps it will appear in another form. It takes in everyone from Janet Malcolm, David Hockney and Fred Astaire, to the beat poet Gregory Corso with whom she had a relationship. Meanwhile, she hopes the new film prompts interest in a screen version of Talk. “It has real scenes as opposed to thePeter Hujar[book].”How does she feel about Rebecca Hall’s representation of her in Peter Hujar’s Day? “I’m very happy with it,” she says. “Most of it is Peter talking, but she doesn’t get to say very much, or I didn’t say very much. But she sort of captured the way I would have responded.” This hints at a self-effacing matter-of-factness to Rosencrantz. She doesn’t give off a sense of thwarted ambition or great regrets – just a life lived well.In the original Peter Hujar transcript, there’s a moment where Rosenkrantz explains her motive for the project: “To find out how people fill up their days, because I myself feel like I don’t do anything much all day.” The fact that at 90 she’s still developing work seems to prove otherwise.Explore more on these topicsArtPeter HujarPhotographyNew YorkFictioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

But sendoffs don’t have to be that dearMabel Banfield-NwachiTue 13 May 2025 02.00 EDTShareSet a budget earlyCosts can spiral quickly when you’re planning for a big group and there are lots of ideas flying around. Agree on a realistic budget from the start that works for everyone, and stay within it.Bridesmaids or the best man often lead, but if you are not organising the event, do not be afraid to speak up if something feels too expensive – others may well be thinking the same.“Unfortunately, you’re going to need to make the dreaded WhatsApp group,” saysGeorgie Mitchell, a wedding planner. “Open communication from the start with upfront and real-time prices can help people to understand what they can afford.”If not all the group use WhatsApp find a way to make sure they are included. For your group, for example, email or an iMessage chat may be better.Loop in the bride or groom early too, as they will often be chipping in and will want to know that costs are not putting people off coming.Keep it to one nightView image in fullscreenAviva says the average UK hen or stag weekend now costs £1,208 if it takes place abroad.Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty ImagesLong weekends and trips abroad have become the norm but they usually come with a hefty price tag. Accommodation, transport, meals and drinks can add up to hundreds of pounds – and that is even before the novelty T-shirts come out. According to the insurer Aviva, the average hen or stag weekend now costs £779 a person in the UK, rising to £1,208 if it takes place abroad.Sticking to one night (or a single day) keeps things simpler, cheaper, and easier for people with children or limited time off work.You can also plan it for ­“off-peak” times of the year to save money, Mitchell says. “Does it need to be a weekend in summer? Can you avoid the school holidays? The event doesn’t need to be within the few months before the wedding – find the most cost-effective dates for everyone,” she adds.Stay localPints in Prague may be relatively cheap, but getting there – and staying there – may not be. A night out in Brighton, a hike in the Peaks or a well-planned day locally can be just as memorable. You’ll skip the airport slog and still get a change of scene if you are trying something new.View image in fullscreenYou don’t need to head to Amsterdam to hire a beer bike.Photograph: Victoria Simmonds/AlamyHosting at home is another option if someone in the group has enough space. You’ll save on venue costs, which means you can put more into decorations, games or food and still have a great night without the big spend. “What you save on accommodation can be reallocated to beautiful florals or delicious catering,”says Matilda Bea, a dinner-party planner.Go self-cateringIf you are staying overnight, renting a large house or flat geared towards hen and stag groups can be far cheaper than hotel rooms, especially once the cost is split between everyone. It also gives you more space to hang out without having to fork out for endless rounds at bars.When booking for a big group, check the listing for restrictions on stag or hen dos – some hosts will not allow them. Always message ahead to confirm, or use filters to avoid disappointment. For guaranteed party-friendly options in the UK, take a look at listing sites such asGroup Stays,FlockorParty Houses.You will save more by cooking a few meals and bringing your own drinks. Think brunch ingredients, big pasta dishes or even just breakfast basics – it doesn’t have to be fancy to make a dent in costs. Agree upfront whether you will split food and drink or ask people to bring their own so no one ends up paying for something they didn’t want.Keep in mind that you can often save by buying in bulk. For instance,Sainsbury’s Nectar holders can get up to 25% off six or more bottlesof selected wines. If anyone in your party has a Costco membership, it is worth checking out what deals they have on alcohol and food.Keep travel simplePick somewhere easy to reach by public transport and consider how people will get home safely – especially for a one-day event. Booking taxis in advance or carpooling can help keep costs down and avoid chaos after a few drinks. It is worth thinking about for outings to the pub or dinner, too.If the bride or groom is set on going overseas, try to book flights or trains as early as possible to get the cheaper tickets. But make sure to factor in the cost of getting to the airport or station, especially if it’s at an odd time or far from home.Being flexible helps – Skyscanner’s “Everywhere” search orsavings generatorlets you compare the cheapest places to fly on your dates.For UK stays, booking train tickets far in advance does not always guarantee savings. The cheapest advance fares typically appear onTrainlineabout 12 weeks before travel. They sell out quickly so set a reminder or sign up for an alert.Rather than booking train tickets separately, one person could sort them all out so you can benefit from special offers. GroupSave fares are for three to nine people travelling together on off-peak or super off-peak journeys and can cut travel costs by a third. For example, a trip to Brighton from London for a weekend in mid-June costs £130.50 for three adults – or £96.54 with GroupSave.Plan low-cost activitiesView image in fullscreenKaraoke is almost always fun, and relatively cheap.Photograph: Betsie Van Der Meer/Getty ImagesYou do not need spa days or axe throwing to have a good time. Plenty of free or cheap options – such as park picnics, karaoke, home spa nights or pub quizzes – can be just as fun. The website Hitched has a section on ideas forstagandhen dosyou can use for inspiration.Many classic hen or stag games are easy to make yourself – the toilet paper wedding dress game needs nothing more than a few loo rolls, and DIY beer pong just takes some plastic cups, a table and a couple of ping pong balls.While it is tempting to pack every hour with plans: brunch, games, a scavenger hunt, dinner, drinks, dancing, more does not always mean better. Giving the group some breathing room lets people have some downtime without feeling as if they’re wasting money.If you are staying overnight, plan one or two core activities and leave the rest flexible. A bit of relaxation time often makes the main event more enjoyable.Make yourdecorationsIf you have picked a theme, make decorations that stick to it, but remember they can be simple: old CDs make great disco props, cardboard cacti work for a cowboy night, and colourful card can be used to make a personalised banner.Bea says personalised touches can help a night feel special, while being easy on the wallet. “Make your space feel special with hand-painted stationery, like “Take a shot, take a seat” signs or personalised place names. It’s budget-friendly, thoughtful, and instantly sets the tone”. For her own birthday dinner, Bea put the idea into action withpersonalised gift bags for guests and handmade menus.Make extras optionalView image in fullscreenBeen there, done that, got the T-shirt … (although not everyone wants one, or can afford one; so do you need them?)Photograph: Konrad Zelazowski/AlamyNot everyone wants the matching T-shirt, the massage, or the cocktail-making session. Mitchell recommends building flexibility into your plans so people can join for part of the day or skip bits without feeling awkward.She says: “Can some guests join for one day? Can they opt out of the expensive activity? Giving options helps match everyone’s budget.”You can make this clear early on with a rough breakdown of what’s essential and what’s optional. That way, people on tighter budgets can still join in without being hit by a £200 all-in-one invoice. A quick poll in the group chat helps work out who is in for which parts – and keeps things fair from the start.Have a‘sten’Streamline the planning – and cut the cost – by hosting a joint stag and hen do (yes, a “sten do”). It is a break from tradition, but if the couple are keen, a “sten” makes financial sense: accommodation, food and drink can all be shared, and bigger groups often unlock better discounts, says Bea.“You don’t have to spend the entire time together, but combining forces for one big night – especially if you’re heading abroad or booking a special experience – can cut costs while doubling the fun.”If, for example, you and your partner would otherwise be going to separate events, you might cut costs by sharing a room.It also gives the wedding party a chance to meet before the big day. You do not have to do everything together. Separate nights out or activities work fine, but sharing a base could keep things simple and cheaper.Explore more on these topicsWedding, honeymoon and stag tripsMoney hacksWeddingsConsumer affairsTravel & leisurefeaturesShareReuse this content"

I experienced both as I joined one of the first people to do it in 1955Andrew MartinTue 13 May 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 02.02 EDTShareOne August evening in 1955, members of York Mountaineering Club had convened in the city’s Olde Starre Inne. They were, perhaps, lamenting the shortage of mountains (or indeed hills) in York, when club chair David Laughton turned up waving a copy of that month’s Dalesman magazine.It contained a challenge, issued by Bill Cowley, author of the Farmer’s Diary column. Cowley would provide a cup – “an inexpensive one” – to anyone who traversed the North York Moors in less than 24 hours: “… You would cross Carlton Moor, Cringle Moor and Cold Moor; Botton Head and Bloworth; the long flat expanse of Stony Ridge … over Howl Moor and Simon Howe, by Tom Cross Rigg and Snod Hill to Lilla Cross, then over Fylingdales Moor … to the sea.”North York Moors walk mapWhen Laughton asked his fellow mountaineers if they were on for it, a loud “Aye” went up. After several weekends of hitchhiking to the moors to finalise a route, the seven men and three women of the YMC were ready. They, plus Cowley himself, two senior scouts from Middlesbrough and a forest ranger from Guisborough, began their attempt at noon on 1 October.For 23 hours, the party waded through heather and navigated by compass towards Ravenscar on the coast, where the tankards were distributed. Mindful of the burial mounds on the Moors, Cowley had named the walk after the ancient Lyke Wake Dirge, a “lyke” being a Yorkshire dialect word for a corpse:“This ya neet, this ya neet, / Ivvery neet an’ all, / Fire an’ fleet an’ cannel leet, / An’ Christ tak up thy saul”(I recommendthe version by Steeleye Span, who sound like a choir of ghosts in some vast ruined cathedral.)View image in fullscreenBill Cowley (flat cap) being given a commemorative tankard in Ravenscar with the rest of the group who completed the first Lyke Wake Walk in October 1955. Malcolm Walker is wearing the white jumper second from the right .Photograph: HandoutAmong that original party was Malcolm Walker, a trim, bronzed, humorous young man of 19. In 1971, he and his wife, Edna, and their children, Paul and Lindsey, moved into the York street where I lived. I think I always knew Malcolm had been a Lyke Wake pioneer – not that he ever boasted about it, but the walk was at the peak of its popularity then, the ultimate challenge in the great testing ground of the “broad acres”.In that year, my mother died, and Malcolm and Edna took me and my sister under their wing. We went camping with the Walkers most summer weekends. I recall navigating by dinghy along the River Swale in the broiling summer of 1976, and happy trudges through heather, with the Walkers’ border terrier, Copper, forgoing his delight in frolicking ahead to walk beside me for a while – out of sheer politeness, it always seemed.Only in retrospect do you appreciate the scenery: the fauvist colours – pinks, yellows, lime greens – and the drama of the time-lapse weatherI walked the Lyke Wake with Malcolm and Paul in 2005, to mark the 50th anniversary, and so I earned the black coffin lapel badge that signifies the achievement and summarises the Yorkshire philosophy: mistrust jollity. There’s never much of it on the walk. The moors, it seems, don’t want you there. If the sun doesn’t burn you, the wind will. Dare to sit on the heather and something will bite you, ideally not an adder. Only in retrospect do you appreciate the scenery: the fauvist colours – pinks, yellows, lime greens – and the drama of the time-lapse weather.A few weeks ago, Paul Walker called me to say that, in this 70th anniversary year, he was mounting another Lyke Wake attempt. Five of his six children would be taking part, as well as Lindsey’s husband and their three sons. Lindsey and Paul’s wife, Christine, would be driving support cars (even Bill Cowley’s lot had a support team). Malcolm, now 89, would walk the final stretch. Was I on for it? Well, to say “no” at 62 years of age would have been to throw in the towel. My son, Nat, veteran of a 30-miler with Malcolm, would also come along.We started from Osmotherley at 2.15am, to get the dark bit out of the way first. As we scrambled over the crazy paving of Carlton Bank, Middlesbrough glittered below. Dawn broke slowly and with the greatest reluctance, the sun pasty white and wreathed in rain clouds. The hardest part came six hours later, as we followed the seemingly endless exposed ridge above Farndale that once carried an ironstone railway.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Occasionally, the smoky rain clouds dissipated, and all Farndale became golden green for a few minutes. At last, we came to that oasis of Blakey Moor, theLion Inn. Whereas the people in the pub were appalled by my appearance – “You lookreallycold … Your eyes are bloodshot” – I considered them ridiculously complacent, with their suede shoes, red wines at 11am and fireside seats.We started from Osmotherley at 2.15am, to get the dark bit out of the way first. As we scrambled over the crazy paving of Carlton Bank, Middlesbrough glittered belowWe trudged on, skirting Rosedale now. Observing a great waterfall of light coming through clouds, one of Paul’s children said: “It’s like God’s coming down to Earth.” I heard snatches about Malcolm from his grandchildren: about how he’d taken them on walks with the hiking club of the printing firm where he worked. I heard how, last year, the day after Edna’s funeral, he undertook the York Parkrun, which he’s done several times, always joking that he came “first” (in the 80 and over category, that is – a subdivision he usually has to himself).We met Malcolm in the early evening, on dusty Jugger Howe Moor, under a sky of milky blue. He walked the last five miles with us, chatting to anyone who wanted to chat (which was not everyone at this point), our target being a radio mast that seemed to retreat further into the distance every time I glanced away. We reached the mast at 8pm, having walked 42 miles. We then convened for photographs in a lounge at the Raven Hall Hotel, Ravenscar.View image in fullscreenThe group started at 2.15am and didn’t finish until 8pm.Photograph: Nat MartinAs Malcom sipped beer from his “inexpensive” trophy mug of 1955, I asked him why anyone should do the walk. “Well, there’s a lot to be saidagainstit,” he said, and we reflected silently on our crossings (my two, his half-dozen) – on bouts of nausea, hay fever, bites and blisters. “I count the walk an achievement, I suppose,” Malcolm said at length, “but nothing to this …” and he waved his tankard in the general direction of his family, all reanimated by hotel comforts.I pointed out that the walk had been the pretext for their coming together. “Aye,” said Malcolm, nodding, “I suppose that’s another thing you could say in its favour.” Beyond the hotel windows, the sun was setting over Robin Hood’s Bay: pink clouds rolling over a purple sea. I could have mentioned that this wasn’t just some family tea party, it was a day that would be seared into everyone’s memory, but in Yorkshire, as mentioned, one doesn’t want to go over the top.Andrew Martin writes theReading on TrainsSubstackExplore more on these topicsWalking holidaysYorkshire holidaysEngland holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, if you don’t want to spend your days – or your cash – at the salon, then a hot brush could be just the styling tool you need.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.As the name suggests, a hot brush is a round or paddle-shaped hair-styling tool that either heats up like astraightening ironor uses warm airflow like a hairdryer to dry and style your hair. Depending on the shape and size of the brush, a hot brush can give you anything from a straight, sleek style to volume and lift, or even red-carpet curls.A good hot brush is a thing of joy because it can provide close to salon-style results with minimum fuss. Brushes that style with warm air can be used for wet-to-dry styling straight from the shower, saving you time, while blow-dry brushes usually style at lower temperatures, reducing the risk of heat damage to your hair.At a glanceBest hot brush overall:GHD Duet BlowdryFrom £379 at GHDBest budget hot brush:Revlon One-Step£29.80 at AmazonBest premium multistyler brush and curler:Dyson AirWrap idFrom £429.99 at DysonBest round brush for root lift:Mark Hill Pick’n’ Mix round brush£21.99 for handle at Boots£19.99 for round brush head at BootsBest for wet and dry:BaByliss Air Power Volume£63.99 at John LewisWhy you should trust meI’ve embraced my natural curly hair for many years, but it’s hard to deny that a good professional blowout brings a polish and confidence that everyone else is quick to notice. During lockdown, when you couldn’t get a salon appointment, sales of hot brushes began to take off; as a home-styling tool, I became enamoured of their time-saving ease and effectiveness. As a beauty journalist, I’ve tested dozens, some of which are among my all-time favourite tools – and I always have my own hot brush on standby at home.How I testedView image in fullscreen‘I checked the condition of my hair immediately after styling.’Photograph: Lise SmithI tested 11 of the most popular hot brushes on the market, including blow-dry brushes and ceramic hot brushes in various sizes and shapes. I used each of the brushes on my medium-length curly hair straight after washing, and again on the day after washing. I dried my hair fully before testing the ceramic hot brushes, and I gave my day-old hair a quick spritz of water when using the blow-dry brushes.With each of the brushes, I timed how long the brush took to achieve a relaxed daytime look with a bit of polish, and a more styled look suitable for an evening out. I also took note of how each brush handled when styling, how comfortable it was to hold and how easy it was to get my desired results. I checked the condition of my hair immediately after styling, and wore the finished styles for a typical working day to see how well a style lasted.After testing, the hot brushes sourced for this article were either returned to the manufacturer or donated to the homelessness charityCrisisfor resale.Here are the hot brushes that performed best in my tests.The best hot brushes in 2025View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Lise SmithBest hot brush overall:GHD Duet BlowdryView image in fullscreenFrom £379 at GHD£379 at AmazonGHD’s blow-dry brush looks slightly terrifying with its black ceramic barrel and spiky teeth, but it does a fantastic job of styling and taming the most unruly hair (including mine) to leave it with amazing shine.Why we love itWhen the Duet was launched last year, GHD’s lineup already included a small range of ceramic hot brushes for styling dry hair (see below). The Duet is a departure for GHD in that it combines the brand’s signature ceramic coating and intelligent heat sensing with warm-air styling at a low temperature of 120C to give great results with less heat damage.The ceramic-coated plastic bristles look a little scary at first, but they passed through my hair effortlessly without any tugging or snagging. By directing heat evenly over all parts of the tool (bristles and all), the Duet worked quickly even on myType-3curly hair. Not only did the hot brush enable quicker styling, which meant less time getting ready in the mornings, but the reduced time that hair is in contact with heat resulted in less dehydration and a shiny, happy finish.It’s the finish it achieves that sets the Duet Blowdry apart from its competitors – this brush created the healthiest, glossiest look out of all the brushes tested, especially at the drier ends of my hair. It’s also possible to use the Duet to create a range of styles: by simply changing the angle of the brush as I styled, directing and rotating the hair away from my face, I was able to get more of a bouncy, voluminous look; or a sleeker style by stroking the brush downwards. The Duet is a great all-rounder that could happily replace several of your existing styling tools.It’s a shame that …the Duet Blowdry retails at nearly £380, a fairly hefty price even for this premium brand. Nevertheless, its ability to style at low heat means that if you have fine or damaged hair, or if you style often, your locks might just thank you for the investment.Wet or dry styling: wetMotor: 460WHeat settings: oneIonic technology: noCord length: 2.7mBest budget hot brush:Revlon One-StepView image in fullscreen£30.99 at Currys£29.80 at AmazonLaunched in 2016, Revlon’s One-Step is the hot brush that saw air styling go viral, with hundreds of thousands of online posts proclaiming the wonders of the all-in-one paddle brush and blow dryer.Why we love itThere are good reasons the One-Step is part of many people’s home styling routines: it’s effective, and effortless to use. There are no complicated settings here – simply plug it in and switch it on, and you’re good to go. Warm air (there are two heat settings, plus a cold shot) dries the hair and heats the ceramic barrel to smooth and style the hair within minutes.The One-Step brush has two kinds of bristles to smooth and shape the hair: nylon bristles that spread out and detangle the hair, and boar bristles that smooth over the outer cuticle for a sleek and shiny finish. Pass the hair over the wider, flatter side for a smooth, straight finish, or curl around the curved edges to lift the roots or slightly curl the ends. That’s all there is to it.Revlon has introduced upgraded models to its One-Step range, but the original One-Step remains unsurpassed for its simplicity and effectiveness – I have actually received gasps of admiration after styling my hair with it. The ceramic barrel smooths hair with every stroke, and ionic technology leaves hair looking healthy, glossy and frizz-free. If you’re looking for a good wet-to-dry styler at a great price, this is the one I’d recommend.It’s a shame that …the One-Step doesn’t pretend to be anything other than an all-in-one hair styling brush; it does a simple blowout extremely well, but (unlike some of the other stylers on our list) it doesn’t do anything else.Wet or dry styling: wetMotor: 800WHeat settings: two, plus cold shotIonic technology: yesCord length: 2mBest premium multistyler:Dyson Airwrap idView image in fullscreenFrom £429.99 at Dyson£479.99 at John LewisDyson’s original Airwrap and its 2022 update introduced the world to the Coandă effect – a method of styling that sees the hair wrap around the Airwrap’s curling barrels like magic, curling the hair without exposure to direct heat. This upgraded id model comes with new attachments and an optional Bluetooth-connected app to automate your styling routine.Why we love itThe new Airwrap id comes in two versions with different attachments included in the box. Thecurly/coily hair versionincludes a round styling brush, a wide-toothed comb for detangling, and a diffuser attachment for softly drying the hair; the wavy/straight version arrives with a handy attachment for hiding flyaways. Both come with a new conical styling barrel, which allows you to choose how tight you’d like your curls – even allowing for a tighter wrap closer to the root for lifted volume and softer ringlets at the ends.The biggest change from the first two Airwrap models is the smart app, which enables you to connect your Airwrap id to your phone and set up a hair profile with recommended settings for your chosen hair type, texture and style. The Airwrap id can then be fully controlled from the app, wrapping, drying and cooling the hair automatically.I found the app quite intuitive, while using the recommended settings gave me confidence that I was doing the right thing. Heat and airspeed settings can be independently selected using either the buttons on the handle or through the app, plus a cool shot helps to set the finished look. The Airwrap’s soft curls – noticeably different from my natural pattern – lasted all day and into the next.It’s a shame that …the Airwrap id costs almost £500 for a complete multistyler set; but it’s more than just a hot brush and will be best suited to those who will use all or most of the attachments. The two models include only the most useful attachments for their given hair type to reduce waste, but I’d like to be able to select (or add on) my preferred attachments.Wet or dry styling: wet (although touch-ups to dry hair also possible)Motor: 1,300WHeat settings: two, plus cold shotIonic technology: yesCord length: 2.67mBest round brush for root lift:Mark Hill Pick ‘N’ Mix round brushView image in fullscreenHandle£21.99 at BootsFrom £21.99 at Mark HillRound brush head£19.99 at Boots£19.99 at Mark HillIf you like to switch up the way you style your hair, then the Mark Hill Pick ‘N’ Mix system is a neat concept whereby you can add whichever styling attachments you desire to a single heating unit – perfect for changing your hair to match your outfit or your mood.Why we love itDyson should take note: this versatile system lets you choose as many attachments as you like, all at a reasonable price of £22 for the main unit and £10-£20 for each additional attachment. I tried the 48mm round brush in the Pretty in Pink edition – a cute pastel shade that would look good in any millennial bedroom.The Pick ‘N’ Mix handle/heating unit has one temperature setting of 180C and a simple on-off switch; it’s a hot tool rather than a blow-dry brush, so it’s suitable for use on dry hair only. The ceramic-coated round brush attachment clicks neatly into place and is simple to use: I wrapped sections of dry hair around the barrel and rotated the brush away from the root to create smooth lengths with a voluminous Hollywood lift. For more in the way of a curl, there arecurling barrelsandtongsin the Pick ‘N’ Mix range, or even astraighteningattachment if you prefer a sleeker look. The brush is easy to use and gave my hair a nice soft finish, and I liked the idea of building a collection of mix-and-match tools.It’s a shame that …the Pick ‘N’ Mix is suitable for styling dry hair only, so it won’t save you time in the morning in the way that a blow-dry brush does – not so much a drawback, more the way the product is designed. However, at this price, I don’t mind too much.Wet or dry styling: dryMotor: not applicableHeat settings: oneIonic technology: noCord length: 3mskip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

The Air Power Volume, launched last summer, offers wet-to-dry air styling and a dry-styling mode to refresh your look between wash days.Why we love itIn wet mode, the oval-shaped styling brush with flexible bristles smooths and lifts hair. One switch on the handle controls the combined heat and airflow settings, while a separate button toggles on an ionic anti-frizz mode for extra silky shine. The 1,000W motor made light work of drying my hair, taking me from towel-dry to a wearable everyday style in less than 10 minutes. In dry mode, I found the Air Power’s heated ceramic fins great for finishing or for touching up my style a day or two after.Using the BaByliss Air Power to style from wet to dry left my hair smooth, soft and sleek all day; and dry mode worked really well for smoothing hair down again the following day. This is a well-designed wet-to-dry air styler for less than £100 that delivers results comparable to some of the more expensive brushes on our list.It’s a shame that …dry mode on its own wasn’t quite powerful enough to fully style my Type-3 curly hair from a standing start. This may be less of an issue if you have wavy, rather than curly, hair.Wet or dry styling: bothMotor: 1,000WHeat settings: two, plus cold shotIonic technology: yesCord length: 2.5mThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘Perfect for touching up your styled hair in the evening’: the Shark SmoothStyle.GHD GlideView image in fullscreen£179 at GHD£179 at John LewisBest for: straightening long and thick hairGHD’s Glide hot paddle brush is one of the best alternatives toclassic straighteners. Designed to be used on dry hair, the Glide’s ceramic bristles smooth effortlessly, detangle and straighten even thick and curly hair, with ionic technology sealing in moisture and reducing frizz. The tool quickly straightens large sections of hair, so it’s a great replacement for your straighteners if you have long or thick hair and like to wear it straight.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found the Glide effective on my mid-length hair, but preferred the voluminous look achieved using the Duet Blowdry (above). Nevertheless, this is a fantastic brush for creating sleek styles, especially for those with more hair than I have.Wet or dry styling: dry;motor: not applicable;heat settings: 1;ionic technology: yes;cord length: 2.7mThe best hair straighteners for foolproof styling, tried and tested by our expertRead moreShark SmoothStyleView image in fullscreen£66.50 at Shark£66.50 at AmazonBest for: fine and delicate hairShark’s SmoothStyle wet-or-dry styling brush can be used on damp hair as a blow-drying brush, drying and styling in one easy step; or in dry mode, it works more like a ceramic hot-styling brush, perfect for touching up your styled hair in the evening or following day.In wet mode, the SmoothStyle’s 900W motor blows air through the brush vents, and you can choose from three heat settings: 50C if your hair’s on the fine or delicate side; 70C for regular hair; and 100C if you have thicker hair that’s a bit tougher to dry and style. It’s easy to switch settings – just give the base of the brush a slight twist and you’re good to go. I loved the way my hair felt after styling with the SmoothStyle, and at its lowest temperature setting, it would be a great choice for fine, brittle or even artificial hair.It didn’t make the final cut because …I found my style lasted just a little longer with the BaByliss (above) – but they’re both very good products at a similar price.Wet or dry styling: both;motor: 900W;heat settings: three in blow-dry mode; one in dry mode;ionic technology: no;cord length: 2.4mHershesons The Multi-TaskerView image in fullscreen£195 at HershesonsBest for: budget multistylerNot quite an Airwrap dupe, since it uses heated barrels rather than air to style, but the Hershesons Multi-Tasker is still a rival in the multistyling space as it comes with three attachments to smooth, lift and curl hair. It comes in two variants by hair length – I tried the Multi-Tasker for short hair, which comes with a 38mm round brush for a voluminous faux-blowout, a 30mm brush for voluminous waves, and a 25mm curling wand for more defined curls, all in an eye-catching shade of cobalt blue.I found the two brush attachments worked well on my curly hair when I styled it from dry in its natural pattern. For best results with the curling wand, I found it was necessary to dry my hair straight-ish first before styling, which added an extra step. The finished results were good with all three attachments, however, and lasted a full day of wear.It didn’t make the final cut because …as with the Mark Hill curler above, the Multi-Tasker is designed for use only on dry hair, which is a drawback if you’re hoping to save time on styling. The Airwrap has the edge for styling in multiple ways from wet to dry.Wet or dry styling: dry;motor: not applicable;heat settings: four;ionic technology: no;cord length: 2.5mWhat you need to knowView image in fullscreen‘The shape of the brush you choose will affect the type of styles you can create.’Photograph: Lise SmithHot brushes aren’t an entirely new idea – I can still remember my mum’s round brush with aluminium heating plates from the 1980s. However, the hot brush market has expanded significantly over the past decade, with today’s models offering far more advanced features than my mum’s old brush. Today you’ll find they have multiple heat settings, intelligent heat control to reduce damage, ceramic coatings for gentler styling, and ionic technology to lock moisture into hair.Types of hot brushesHot brushes generally fall into two categories. The first uses hot plates, similar to those found in straighteners or curling irons, to heat the hair and reshape it. The second type, the blow-dry brush, uses warm air to dry and style hair, often combined with a ceramic barrel. Blow-dry brushes are designed for use on damp hair and can dry and style at the same time, which is fantastic for saving you time on your morning routine. They usually deliver a voluminous finish, similar to a professional salon blowout. Ceramic hot brushes, like straighteners, are used on dry hair.‘This will give you a beautiful fringe’: top hairdressers on the 14 best at-home styling toolsRead moreThe shape of the brush you choose will affect the type of styles you can create. Flat, paddle-shaped brushes are great for straightening and smoothing, while round brushes add lift at the roots and curl at the ends (with smaller barrels creating tighter curls). Oval-shaped brushes allow for both, smoothing along the long edge and curling or lifting with the rounded corners. Most blow-dry brushes are either round or oval in shape, giving lift and slight curl to the hair; ceramic brushes are usually either round or paddle-shaped.How to use a hot brushTo use a blow-dry brush, start with towel-dried hair.

Pull the brush through the hair from the root to the end, creating tension as you go (as you would when drying your hair with a separate brush and dryer), while also rotating the brush as you go if it’s round. If your brush has the setting, you can optionally finish with a cool shot of air to help reduce the temperature of your hair and fix the style.With a ceramic hot brush, start with dry hair and section it. Slowly glide the brush down each section, pulling the hair taut. Let each section cool briefly before moving on. Finish with your favourite hairspray to fix the style in place.Can you buy a refurbished hot brush?Premium hot brushes command a hefty price tag. If you’d like to save some cash and consider sustainability, it’s worth looking for refurbished options on manufacturer websites. Manufacturer-refurbished models are tested for electrical safety and covered by a warranty, so you won’t be out of pocket if a problem arises. Some brands also offer trade-in programmes, where you can exchange an old tool for a discount on the latest model. If you’re looking for an even more budget-friendly hot brush, I’ve included some excellent options here for less than £50.Lise Smith is a freelance writer withmore than 15 years of experience covering beauty, lifestyle, parentingand the performing arts.

And white and red ones, too? And that some are good for sweet recipes and others for curries? Our top cooks have all the spicy smartsAnna BerrillTue 13 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the difference between green and black cardamom, and when should I use pods or ground?“Cardamom is my favourite spice,” saysCynthia Shanmugalingam, chef/proprietor ofRambutanin London. “It smells like childhood puddings and sweets.” That’s not to say the papery pods filled with black seeds aren’t versatile, mind. Yes, cardamom can bring a “piney, eucalyptus-like fragrance and warmth” to desserts, Shanmugalingam adds, but it also “adds depth” to savoury dishes, meaning you can take it in multiple directions.With its origins in southern India and a relative of ginger, cardamom pods commonly come in green and black (also known as brown) form, as well as red (used mainly in Chinese and Asian cuisines) and white, which are bleached green pods. While Roopa Gulati, author ofIndian Kitchens: Treasured Family Recipes from Across the Land, often uses both black/brown and green in the same dish, she says you “have to be aware that they are totally different in flavour. You’re not going to make a lovely, aromatic rice pudding and stick some brown cardamom in it, because that will override all the other flavours.”That’s because black cardamom is earthy, smoky and more robust than its green relative, which is why Gulati puts it to work in the likes of meaty curries, lamb pilaf and rice dishes, as well as in garam masala: “It has a good, solid base note.” The Kashmiri stockyakhniis a good example: “That has loads of spices in it, but if you also chuck in a couple of brown cardamom pods, it just gives it that extra layer.” That’s not to say the bolder brown cardamom should stay in its lane, though: “It can also go with sweet things such as dates,” Gulati adds. As for red cardamom, which is similar in taste to brown, “in India, we don’t cook with it, but it’s interchangeable with brown, though our homegrown brown cardamom is a bit more pungent!”Green cardamom, meanwhile, is “quite fresh and citrussy”, so Gulati uses that in cake batters and desserts, such as rice pudding: “I’ll sometimes put green cardamom pods in a pan of milk and simmer to infuse.” And while Shanmugalingam is a fan of the lighter, sweeter spice inwatalappan(a Sri Lankan coconut caramel pudding), she’ll also put it to work in pilafs and biryanis, dals and marinades for chicken. Finally, with white cardamom, which is the more mellow of the bunch, again think creamy desserts and cakes.As for using whole pods versus grinding the seeds inside, Shanmugalingam leans towards the former, because, she says, “they retain flavour better and infuse sweet rice pudding and curries really well”. If you’re after something punchier, meanwhile, Gulati’s top tip is to drop the pods into hot oil: “Their volatile oils are released and you get a stronger flavour; always pierce the pod first, though, otherwise it might explode.”Ground cardamom, meanwhile, works best in cakes and marinades, Shanmugalingam says, although the process of grinding those seeds is, Gulati admits, “a real pain in the neck”. To grease the wheels, she suggests adding a pinch of caster sugar to proceedings: “It acts as an abrasive, so makes it much easier and quicker to pound with a pestle.” Thankfully, a little goes a long way, and always remember that freshness is key: “Once you’ve ground the seeds, use them quite quickly,” Gulati says, “otherwise they’ll turn musty.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Lemons are variously described as electric, fresh, optimistic, uplifting, zesty, spritzy, cheerful, sunny, lively. They are synonymous with freshness and optimism, and a happy lemon is full, pert and perky, and unapologetically, proudly yellow. Long live the lemon!Spring fregola salad (pictured top)Fregola is a Sardinian pasta made by rolling grains of semolina together to form small balls, then roasting them in an oven. The finished pasta has a toasty, smoky flavour, a wonderful, nubbly texture and is just small/large enough to provide a nutty chew. It is versatile and delicious, and can be cooked like rice or pasta. Here, it is boiled like pasta and left to cool before becoming the basis of a substantial salad. The smokiness works well with the sweetness of young raw courgettes, while toasted almonds top everything off. This is a great side dish for roast fish or white meat, or a nice summer salad on its own.Prep10 minCook20 minServes4as a side250gfregolaSea salt and black pepper150gfrozen peas50-60mlextra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serveFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon3 small courgettes, sliced or peeled into strips1 handfulsweet herbs(mint, parsley, dill), roughly chopped, plus extra to serve150gfresh ricotta40gflakedalmonds, toastedCook the fregola in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for about eight to 10 minutes, until al dente, adding the frozen peas to the pan a minute before the fregola is done. Once the pasta is cooked, drain and rinse quickly under cold running water. Drain again and put in a bowl to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent the fregola sticking together. When the fregola has cooled, season it well with salt, plentiful olive oil and lemon juice and zest, then taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly (the fregola will drink up the oil).Toss the courgette ribbons through the cooled fregola and pea mixture, then add a little more seasoning if necessary. Toss through the herbs, then arrange on a platter and top with large blobs of ricotta. Sprinkle over some more roughly chopped herbs and the almonds, drizzle with a little extra oil to finish, then serve.Creamy fennel, lemon and pecorino bakeView image in fullscreenLetitia Clark’s creamy fennel, lemon and pecorino bake.At one of my favourite restaurants of all time,the Seahorse in Dartmouth, Devon, a small silver dish of sliced fennel baked in cream is often served alongside baked white fish. The fennel is pale, delicate, sweet and savoury, and provides the perfect accompaniment. It looks beautiful, too, in all of its elven, pale green-white splendour. This is a gilded version of that same dish, lifted by a double hit of lemon and given a savoury punch by garlic and anchovies; if you prefer to keep it vegetarian, leave out the anchovies and it will still be delicious (you might also like to add a few roasted almonds, for extra savouriness and crunch). This can be a meal in itself (with a sharp, lemon-dressed green salad, say) or a side for pork, chicken or fish.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4-6Butter, for greasing2 large or 3 small fennel bulbs(about 1kg)Sea salt300mldoublecream50mlmilk1 lemon, zested and quartered1 garlic clove, peeled and bashed80ggrated pecorino(make sure it’s a vegetarian one, if need be)30gcoarse breadcrumbs, preferably from a rustic loaf (dried breadcrumbs would also work)Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling6 anchovy fillets(optional)Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and grease a large gratin dish with butter.Trim the roots and stems from the fennel bulbs, chop off and reserve the fronds, then slice the bulbs lengthways into 3mm- to 4mm-thick slices. Bring a pan of well-salted water to a boil, drop in the sliced fennel and cook for three minutes, until just tender. Drain, dry and arrange in the gratin dish.Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the cream and milk with half the lemon zest, a pinch of salt, the chopped reserved fennel fronds and the bashed garlic clove. When it comes to a boil, take off the heat and stir in half the pecorino, until melted.Chop one of the lemon quarters into thin slices, then chop these into little pieces and scatter all over the fennel. Pour over the cream mixture, and remove and discard the bashed garlic.Mix the remaining lemon zest with the breadcrumbs and remaining cheese, sprinkle this over the fennel and cream, and drizzle with the olive oil. Dot over the anchovy fillets, if using, then bake for about 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling.These recipes are edited extracts from For the Love of Lemons: Italian-inspired Sweet and Savoury Recipes, by Letitia Clark, published by Quadrille at £28.

She hasn’t given a particular reason. I asked if there may be a deeper resentment about me– but she saidnot. I asked if she perhapshad feelingsfor other men– but shesaidnot.She is in the later stages of menopause– eight years ago, when we first met,it was a bigger part of her life. But last week she just saidthatalthough she loves me very much, and there areno issues, shedoesn’t want to have sex or anything else.She wantsme to be there for heras acelibate partner,indefinitely, leavingme, faithfully, in limbo.I love her, but I feel the lack of physical intimacycould break us up.No doubt your wife’s decision is devastating for you, and you may have to decide if this new scenario is possible for you, but it would probably be worth trying to glean more information to help you to understand “Why this? Why now?” Menopause can have a devastating effect on a woman’s libido, and there can be all kinds of other issues such as genital dryness and pain. Learn more about this, then demonstrate your understanding about it to your wife, and inquire about being helpful to her in some way, such as helping her get to doctors’ appointments and being available to listen to her physical and emotional concerns. A sexual compromise might eventually be possible through gentle negotiation, but I imagine it would have to be very much on her terms at this point. Some women elect to boost their hormone levels in one way or another, which can help restore libido, but that is an individual choice.

When the couple married and decided to buy a flat together, Laura was earning more, but her husband was given a house deposit by his family, leading to complicated questions about who should own what proportion of the property. When Laura spent two years on maternity leave, her husband became the sole breadwinner.Let’s be honest: how we deal with money in a relationship is underpinning everything“We still had our separate accounts, but mine was empty, my pension contributions were zero, and he paid all the bills,” said Laura. “Even though he recognised my unpaid childcare as an equal contribution, I felt financially at his mercy.“I never thought money would define any of my relationships but let’s be honest: in a world where public services are shot to pieces and another rent increase can tip a person into an existential crisis, how we deal with money in a relationship is underpinning everything.”It was only when the couple decided to merge all their assets and bank accounts, Laura said, that their relationship dynamic “felt healthy and equal again”.Laura was among hundreds of people who shared with the Guardian how they manage finances with their romantic partner.Scores felt that money had become a central topic in their relationships in recent years, with many pointing to the cost of living, financial literacy, pensions and smart investing having become major topics on social media.For many couples,shared finances are no longer the default model. At the same time, thegender pay gapand thegender pension gapremain stubbornly in place in many countries.Millions of women have unwillingly quit work or reduced their hoursbecause of childcare in recent years, while studies consistently show that women are more stressed about finances and the cost of living than men, andlag behind them in financial education, confidence and literacy.What would be the point in me having more money than my wife?While many respondents said they were uncomfortable with the idea of merging finances with their partner, many others said they had embraced the traditional model of combining everything, as they felt other models risked creating conflict and resentment.“We share everything 50/50, although I earn significantly more than my wife,” said a 40-year-old father from Nantwich. “What would be the point in me having more money than my wife?”“I struggle to get my head around long-term couple friends who can’t go on holiday together because only one person has enough saved to afford it, due to differences in their pay,” said Matt, 42, a researcher from Manchester.View image in fullscreenSome people said they kept their finances separate because they wanted privacy and personal freedom.Photograph: Artur Widak/NurPhoto/REX/ShutterstockDozens of people who had separate finances said that this was primarily due to wanting financial privacy and personal freedom, or because their partner had vastly different spending behaviours. Many said, however, that separate finances seemed to only work well when both partners earned similarly and when money was not in short supply generally.Melanie, 60, from Devon, who does not have children and lives in a home owned outright with her partner, said she enjoyed that any money that remained hers only after splitting bills equally could be “spent without guilt orfeeling that you need to ask permission from your partner”.“In my experience this can only work though if the person earning more money provides financial parity by paying for the extras that both parties can enjoy,” she added.Many of those who said their partner earned significantly more or less than they did reported having no money conflicts because all finances and assets were shared equally, whereas various people in relationships with a substantial income gap and split finances reported that money was a conflict in their relationship.Scores who said they had separate finances and were happy with this arrangement were earning significantly more than their partner, while a number of people who were earning substantially less than their partner said they were very unhappy about having separate finances.A number of respondents said they felt their lives were controlled by their higher earning partner, with some saying they were unable to save or to keep up with their wealthier partner’s lifestyle. Some people said they felt insecure because they lived in a property only owned by their partner, and could not build property wealth of their own because of it. Such “power imbalances”, various respondents said, had put a big strain on their relationship and caused dysfunction.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He’s made clear that future bills would need to be split 50/50.I’d normally be able to apply for universal credit during maternity leave and for help with childcare costs, but because of my partner’s high salary I’m not entitled to any help, despite the fact that I don’t benefit from his income in any way,” she said.“I’d have to claim benefits illegally to afford having children, so I’ve given up on it. I think the government doesn’t understand how common it is today for couples to not share their finances at all, which makes the benefit rules very unfair.”Various people said they did not know how much their partner was earning, how much they had in savings or debts, or even what kind of assets they owned, and questioned whether this was healthy. Almost all the respondents raising such concerns were women. Other women however felt that having independent finances was a feminist principle, and could protect them from financial abuse in their relationship.I would hear my parents talking about owing each other money as a child, thinking how strange this wasMoney, dozens of people felt, was a highly emotive topic, with many saying their attitudes towards spending, saving and sharing finances with their partner were heavily influenced by either positive or negative examples in their family history.“My parents never shared their finances and I always found this approach odd growing up,” said Sandy, a mother from Derby in her 30s. “I would hear them talking about owing each other money as a young child, thinking how strange this was.”Today, she and her husband share all finances. “We’ve even discussed that if we were to ever split up we would split our finances and assets 100% evenly as we’ve both contributed to them in different ways over the 10 years we’ve been married.”For Edgar, an IT professional in the finance sector from London in his 40s, the financial repercussions of a potential future relationship breakdown are much less clear. He was among various people who said a previous failed relationship or traumatic divorce had made them financially more cautious.“We decided, at my suggestion, to keep our own bank accounts and open a joint account for common expenses,” he said.“The amount each transfers in is roughly proportional to our net earnings – I cover 75%, she 25%. I think this is a good approach because we’re still left with our own funds and we’re free to spend that, or save, as we like. Usually it’s not an issue, although I’m very conscious of our joint spending, my wife is less restrained in that respect. If the cost of living keeps going up it’ll be an issue soon, as my wife would then have very little disposable income left.”View image in fullscreenSome people said a failed relationship or divorce had made them financially more cautious.Photograph: True Images/AlamyEdgar was also among scores of people who said money was rarely discussed in their relationship. He was aware, he said, that his wife did not have “a lot” in her pension pot, echoing the remarks of various people in favour of separate finances who however worried how this approach would work in retirement, because their partners would have much smaller pensions that could prove difficult to live off.Many respondents equated joint finances and open discussions about money with deeper levels of trust and commitment.“Being mutually invested in our financial success helps us to communicate our concerns, our plans to save, and to work together,” said Lydia, 37,an operations manager and mother of two who immigrated from South Africa and now lives in Basingstoke, Hampshire.“I think it’s only enhanced our relationship and has added another level of openness between us.”We waited until the 20th year of our 35-year marriage to put our money togetherSome people said that trust regarding finances had to be earned over a longer period of time.“Our finances are joined now, but we waited until the 20th year of our 35-year marriage to put our money together,” said JC, a retiree in his 70s from Portland, Oregon.“We married in our late 30s, and were very independent and wanted to preserve that. As time went on, it became clear that keeping it separate was an extra hassle. Sometimes one of us takes issue with the other’s spending, but we can come to an agreement.”Open communication and transparency, many people who were in favour of joint and separate finances agreed, was ultimately the most important matter.“We have been having more conflict about finances lately, as I feel as if I’m unable to keep up in maintaining the life that we have built,” said Grace, from Vermont, who earns much less than her husband but splits almost all bills 50/50, as she fears not doing so would mean losing her “autonomy”.“We’ve started a weekly meeting to discuss financial matters, instead of having an emotionally heated exchange. I would like to find more resources and models of how to find equity in situations like ours.”Explore more on these topicsHousehold billsConsumer affairsBankingShareReuse this content"

Dubbed the “caveman method”, it involves shunning any kind of skincare products, as well as water, and letting the skin barrier “heal”.TikTok creator Tia Zakher has become a viral sensation for her adherence to the trend. The 22-year-old sparked debate about the method afterposting videos of herself with visibly flaky skin, apparently a result of the trend. “What you’re seeing is dead skin, that’s going to flake off eventually while new healthy skin forms underneath,” she told millions of viewers.Zakherhas her scepticsbut, whether or not you believe the videos, what do experts think about the regime, which has been attributed to other celebrities includingAlexa Chung and Salma Hayek?Can the ‘caveman method’ help your skin?Like many healthcare professionals who have commented on the viral videos, Associate Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, says “it’s not a good idea”.Feeling stressed and wondering if a ‘cortisol detox’ can help?

But you don’t want to take it from one extreme to the other, like this person,” Sebaratnam said.He recommends in the morning putting sunscreen on, and then at the end of the day a gentle soap-free cleanser, ideally without fragrances or perfumes. “You don’t need to be spending lots of money – the cheap stuff works great.”Sebaratnam says cleansers are helpful because “with makeup, with sunscreen, even with your own sweat and oil, you need something a little bit more than just water, because those things are oil-based, and oil and water don’t mix, so you need something that can help remove oil-based products.”Shilajit: male influencers claim it boosts testosterone and libido, but what does the science say? | AntiviralRead more“That’s really all you need in terms of a very simple skincare routine – you don’t need to be doing anything extra on top of that. All sunscreen have moisturiser in-built within them, so you don’t need to be putting sunscreen and moisturiser on at the same time,” Sebaratnam said.Wait, really, not even moisturiser?From a medical perspective, only people with conditions such as eczema need moisturiser, Sebaratnam said. But there are lots of different factors that motivate people when it comes to their skincare – “for some people, that’s their form of meditation or their form of self-care”.Do I need to be careful of certain products?Sebaratnam says aggressive skin care products can certainly disrupt the barrier function of the skin. “Even products like soap can strip away natural oils. Anything you put on your skin can disrupt the pH transiently but our skin is resilient and has mechanisms in place to self-regulate this.”Commercial skincare brands often promoteproducts with active ingredientsto target specific concerns such asvitamin A for anti-ageing, hyaluronic acid for hydration or vitamin C for brightening. “There’s lots of different products that you can put on your skin but, in particular, a lot of the actives, they’ll all cause a small degree of irritation, and then if all of a sudden you’re putting 12 of these things on, you know, 12 times a small degree of irritation becomes a big degree of irritation,” Sebaratnam says.“Be intentional with your skincare. Just because you see someone online using something and it suits them, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to help you reach your skincare goals.“Having a sense of what you want to achieve with your skincare is important, and then you can pick products that suit that.”For some people whose intention is to use their skincare to pamper themselves, they might want to buy expensive products, often paying for a fancy bottle and fragrance, but the improvement in skin quality the next day is likely to be the same whether you use $150 or $15 cream at night, he says.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It thrives in warm, humid environments with poor airflow. Powdery mildew doesn’t usually kill a plant outright, but it weakens growth, damages leaves and can spread quickly to nearby plants.Houseplant clinic: why do my supermarket plants keep dying?Read morePrescriptionStart by isolating the affected plant to prevent the fungus from spreading. Remove any heavily infected leaves carefully. Improve airflow by opening a window often or using a fan. Treat the remaining leaves with a natural antifungal spray: mix one teaspoon of baking soda with a litre of water and a drop of castile soap. Spray the plant weekly until the mildew clears. For more stubborn infections, apply neem oil or use a store-bought fungicide.PreventionMake sure not to overcrowd your plants and maintain good air circulation, particularly around succulents.

Despite Combssettling that lawsuitwith Ventura for an undisclosed sum, it prompted a federal investigation that culminated with Combs’s arrest in September 2024.On Tuesday, the eight-and-a-half-month pregnant singer took the stand for the first time in advance of what is expected to be days-long testimony.Day two of Sean Combs sex-trafficking trial ends as Cassie Ventura describes alleged abuseRead moreHere are the key takeaways from her first day of testimony.1.Ventura provided detailed explanations of the ‘freak-offs’, which were almost weeklyVentura described Combs’s infamous “freak-offs” as “the hiring of an escort and setting up this experience so that I could perform for Sean”, adding that it allowed Combs “to watch me with the other person and actually direct us on what we were doing. Eventually it became a job for me, pretty much.”She testified that she would be directed by Combs tofind the escorts through classifieds ads on platforms such as Craigslist or Backpage and, later, througha service called Cowboys 4 Angels. The escorts, she said, were paid in cash, typically ranging between $1,500 and $6,000. Ventura alleged that Combs not only choreographed the sexual encounters but also provideddrugs to those involved including ecstasy, cocaine, marijuana, ketamine and mushrooms.Ventura said that she was first introduced to these “freak-offs” during the first year of their relationship. Her first “freak-off” occurred in Combs’s Los Angeles home when she was 22, around 2008, she said. After that, she alleged that they became nearly weekly occurrences. Her final one took place in either 2017 or 2018, she said.The locations of the freak-offs varied, she said, and would take place in cities such asNew York City, Miami, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Las Vegas, Ibiza, and Turks and Caicos.Ventura stated that either she or Toni Fletcher, a Bad Boy employee, would book the hotel rooms – often using pseudonyms such as Frank Black and Frank White.2.The ‘freak-offs’ were so intense that it would take days to recover from themOver time, Ventura said the “freak-offs” were not something she wanted to participate inas they made her feel “horrible”, “humiliated” and “worthless”. The “freak-offs” could last two to four days sometimes – with no sleep. Drugs would help them stay awake, she said.Still, she told the court “I was in love and wanted to make him happy” and “I didn’t know what no could turn into.”“Freak-offs became a job where there was no space to do anything else but recover and just try to feel normal again,” she testified, adding that the freak-0ffs would sometimes last for days and take her days to recover.Ventura also testified that Combs would take videos of the “freak offs” and alleged that he use the videos as “blackmail materials”.“I felt pretty horrible about myself. I felt disgusting. I felt humiliated,” she said. “I didn’t have the words to show how horrible I felt. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it.”She claimed that she was expected to take part in the “freak-offs” sessions even while menstruating, and that Combs would sometimes instruct someone to urinate on her. Bedsheets during these encounters, she said, were often soiled with baby oil, blood and urine. She said she didn’t want that to happen, but “you don’t have a lot of control at that moment.”“I just felt humiliated, it was disgusting, it was too much,” she said.Combs’s lawyers have depicted the sexual encounters as consensual. He has pleaded not guilty and denied the allegations against him.3.Combs’s violence throughout Ventura’s relationship with him caused constant fearVentura depicted Combs’s tempestuous moods and the resulting violence he would inflict on her if she didn’t act a certain way. She said she never knew if he would show up at her home in Los Angeles happy or yelling, prompting her to have constant “stomach-in-knots” moments.“Make the wrong face and the next thing I knew I would get hit in the face,” she said. “He would say: ‘Watch your mouth.’”She testified that he would drag, kick and even stomp on her, later noting that she would agree to things she didn’t want to do for fear of how he’d react if she said no.“I didn’t want him to be upset or not trust me. He was a scary person, he would be violent,” she said.Upon being asked how many times Combs threw her to the ground during their relationship, as seen in the 2016 hotel video, Ventura said: “Too many to count.”4.Ventura’s music career and entire life was in Combs’s handsVentura said that Combs “controlled a lot of my life” including her career, how she dressed where she lived and who she spoke to. She described Combs to the court as a “polarizing person”.“Control was everything,” she testified.Over time, she said, she began to experience his “abusive side” and “controlling side”, adding that his mood would vary day to day, which affected her “greatly”.Combs even preferred Ventura to groom herself a specific way for the “freak-offs”: he wanted her nails painted white or with French tips, to wear high heels, have her hair combed a certain way, and even suggested she get breast implants.“I had to look a certain way during freak-offs,” she said, noting that his remarks on her appearance impacted her confidence.Combs would choreograph and dictate the sexual acts he wanted to see her and the escort perform, frequently instructing them to reapply baby oil, she said. Combs would also have the hotel rooms staged, often with scented candles or colored lights.Ventura also alleged that Combs and his team would periodically take her laptop or phone away from her: “It depended on how long I was being punished for,” she said.A timeline of allegations and charges against Sean ‘Diddy’ CombsRead moreDecisions about her career also had to go through Combs, which Ventura said left her manager, James Cruz, to manage her “with one hand tied behind his back”.5.Combs kept guns in his homes and repeatedly forced Ventura to handle themVentura recalled that Combs had guns in safes in his multiple homes, which alarmed her. She cited one particular incident during which Combs made her carry one of the guns, something he did on multiple occasions, which “terrified” her.That incident involved Combs pursuing his longtime rival Suge Knight.“We were having a freak-off in one of his homes in LA and he said Suge was at Mel’s Diner and we packed up and drove down there,” Ventura said. “I was screaming and crying: ‘Please don’t do anything stupid.’ I didn’t know what they were going to do.”Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

That day he was scouting a new route where his group could leave life-saving water and food forthe sporadic waves of migrantswho still cross through these desolate borderlands. Ruiz and his friend, a fellow Border Angels member, already knew they were being watched. A helicopter had been buzzing overhead for the past several hours, tracking them.Shortly after the duo sat down for a mid-hike coffee break, the border patrol agent appeared on the trail. Four or five other officers lagged behind him in the distance.The first agent seemed disappointed that the two weren’t migrants crossing the border illegally.“Oh, I thought you all were ‘customers’,” he said as he got closer, referring to migrants who travel through the area.Ruiz reiterated that they were not.“We got excited,” the border agent told them, according to Ruiz. “Daddy Trumphas been doing a good job so it’s been slow.”View image in fullscreenA group of volunteers with the nonprofit Border Angels hikes near the US-Mexico border wall in late April.Photograph: Amanda UlrichThat type of politically charged interaction has not been uncommon in the nation’s borderlands over the last few months. And for the network of non-profits across southernCaliforniathat seek to help migrants and asylum seekers, the prevailing atmosphere has often felt more intense and angry since the Trump administration launched its crackdown on immigration across the southern border.Groups like Border Angels have been on the frontlines of that change. During their monthly hikes to drop water and food for migrants, interactions with border patrol (some tense, others more neutral) have become a regular occurrence. Pre-Trump, some Border Angels volunteers said they rarely saw agents in these remote areas. The supplies they leave have also been vandalized on many occasions, although the culprits are unclear. Once, someone hurled a large boulder into a crate of water and left a hand-written note in Spanish: “America siempre” (or “America always”). And since Trump’s inauguration, the non-profit has been receiving a more consistent flow of nasty messages and emails from the public.“There has been a lot more open hate around the work that we do,” Ruiz said.But the need is still there. If migrants can’t find basic aid while passing through California’s backcountry, the region’s near-freezing winter nights, triple-digit summer days and perpetually harsh terrain can lead to injuries and even death.Although the number of people crossing into the US illegally has plummeted dramatically from this time last year, some have continued to take the risk. This March alone,more than 1,300 migrantswere apprehended between official ports of entry in California. That same month,three people died while attempting to crossin the same wilderness area Ruiz had been hiking through. More people have been apprehendedin the San Diego sectorthan any other section of the southern border this fiscal year.But for many people seeking asylum from outside of the country, there is virtually no way to legally enter the United States right now. A government mobile app called CBP One, where migrants were previously able to schedule an appointment with immigration officials,was shut downfor that purpose in January by Trump.View image in fullscreenMigrant applications are processed by US border patrol agents in Jacumba Hot Springs, California, in 2024.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesMelissa Shepard, director of legal services for the non-profit law firm Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said she had been forced to have very difficult conversations with asylum seekers who are waiting in limbo. Recently, at a migrant shelter in Tijuana, she met a mother of two whose husband had just been killed in their home town. After his death, the woman fled to the border. Shepard had to break the news that, at least for now, there is no path forward for her and her children.“At this point,” Shepard said, “unfortunately there are no real means for them to enter the US lawfully to seek asylum.”The lack of legal options also opens the door for coyotes and smugglers, who approach migrants in Tijuana and offer to help them cross the border. Someone desperate enough may take that option, Shepard said, especially considering the fact that migrants are still able to apply for asylumif they are physically in the US– whether or not they’ve entered legally.“People are fleeing really desperate situations, and I think if the opportunity presents itself, they’re willing to take that risk,” Shepard said. “We’ve seen it over and over again that despite these harsh policies that are put into place, deterrence is not effective.”Signs of survival: from inhalers to handcuffsOne recent weekend in April, a pack of volunteers with Border Angels ventured out on one of their monthly water-drop hikes, in the same mountains where Ruiz had run into border patrol the month before. The volunteers carried heavy-duty camping backpacks loaded with bottles of water, Gatorade, hand warmers, emergency blankets and little tins of canned sausage and tuna fish.As they trekked deeper into the wilderness, off the designated dirt trail and into dense vegetation, there were signs of people crossing – and struggling to survive – everywhere. In some dugout-like areas protected from view by trees, probably used as resting spots for different groups of migrants, there were layers upon layers of discarded clothes, shoes, hats and backpacks (once people get closer to civilization, they often cast off dirty clothing that could expose them as having just crossed the border, the volunteers explained).Because Border Angels dates each can of food or bottle of water they leave, it was also clear that some supplies had been consumed recently; one volunteer held up an empty can of tuna, dated 22 February.View image in fullscreenBorder Angels leaves water, food and hand warmers in southern California’s remote borderlands. Without aid, some migrants die while attempting to cross through the region from Mexico.Photograph: Amanda UlrichBut other items left along the route told more harrowing stories, ones that the volunteers will never be able to fully piece together. They spotted an inhaler left in one patch of dirt, then a bottle of baby powder. In a thicket of bushes off the beaten path, a pair of handcuffs were found clasped around a branch. Ruiz and another Border Angels member crouched down near the handcuffs, trying to determine what could have happened there. Maybe a smuggler had ditched them?“We just don’t know,” Ruiz said.As always, the group of hikers knew that immigration officials could be aware of their movements; this heavily surveilled slice of the border is constantly being watched. Nearby, closer to the border wall, hi-tech autonomous surveillance towers and dronesmonitor the areaaround the clock. Trump recently proposed increasing the Department of Homeland Security’s budget for next fiscal yearby nearly $44bn, a portion of which would go towards further increasing the ​​border’s security technology.About two hours into the hike, as if on cue, a helicopter with US Customs and Border Protection flew by overhead.“They there are,” Ruiz yelled over the whirring. “We may have triggered one of the sensors, the cameras.”Some of the Border Angels volunteers had experienced all of this before, but others were on their first hike with the group. One of them, Belen Hernandez, had driven an hour and a half from Orange county that morning to be there, carrying four big bottles of water and other supplies on her back.Hernandez, who works as a law clerk with an immigration law firm, said she had been on a professional rollercoaster for the last near-decade. On her first day as a legal assistant back in September 2017, during Trump’s first presidency,his administration moved to terminate the Daca policy, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.View image in fullscreenMigrants cross into the US from Mexico via an abandoned railroad.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesNow, things seem to be moving faster and faster, she said. Within the legal system, Hernandez often feels her hands are tied in terms of her ability to help migrants, including extremely vulnerable groups like unaccompanied minors – they either qualify for status in the US or they don’t.But out in the borderlands, helping feels a little simpler.“Even though I work in immigration, I can’t necessarily give everyone a green card, or some type of status,” Hernandez said, while readying her backpack for the second, uphill portion of the hike.“But this is at least one thing I can do, which is: ‘Here, you made it this far. Let me get you a little further by giving you food and water.’”Explore more on these topicsUS-Mexico borderUS immigrationCaliforniaTexasWest CoastArizonafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This was calculated to be beyond net zero (-49.7t of CO2equivalent) for our farm, based on modelling using the Sandy “natural capital navigator”, a Defra-recognised, scientifically robust platform. Mr Monbiot dismisses it as “a right old mess”, but his comment wrongly assumes that laboratory soil tests collected and described in the report were used to draw this conclusion. Instead, they provided a baseline and additional helpful analysis of soil health.Focusing on the carbon impact alone is also missing the point about what it takes to achieve sustainable beef production. Beyond carbon, our report’s findings demonstrate broad benefits, including improved biodiversity, reduced reliance on inputs, enhanced water infiltration and healthier soils. Together, these outcomes outline a more resilient food system.Øistein ThorsenCEO, FAI FarmsIn attempting to blame sheep and cattle grazing for wildfires, George Monbiot resorts to prehistory to turn reality on its head. The major increase in such fires is a 21st-century phenomenon, which is the result of a major decline in traditional grazing and vegetation management by upland communities. A large proportion of the40% decline in UK cattlenumbers and 30% in sheep flocksduring recent decadeshas been in upland landscapes, which also comprise most of our national parks.It is only logical that if the vegetative carbon biomass that was previously converted via lamb and beef into (non-combustible) human biomass is now left to die and dry out, it will create a major fire hazard in hot, dry weather. Such summer wildfires represent a 21st-century failure in land management.Aidan HarrisonMorpeth, NorthumberlandGeorge Monbiot is offering the choice between two dystopias. One is fully industrial farming, controlled by ever fewer players. This is where we have been heading in the quest for cheap and plentiful food for all since the privations of the second world war. As a proportion of income, we spend relatively little on food, and cheap food comes at the cost of our health and that of our planet.His second dystopia is based onlab-grown foodandrewilding. The issues are complex, but agriculture is a part of a malfunctioning political and economic system; while there is blame to be laid at the door of the current system, the answer lies in reconnecting people to a better understanding of the natural world in which we are less exploitative. Can you really imagine abolishing all farmers and eating “food” supplied by mega-corporations?There is a third way. It requires adjustments to our methods and is inclusive, and would result in greater health for people and planet. We run an organic flour mill. Currently, wheat and barley grown for animal feed in the UKuses 40% of its arable landand half of the annual wheat harvest. Freeing up land from animal feed production would allow us to farm a higher acreage organically and regeneratively, sequestering carbon very effectively as we do so.Nelly TrevelyanYorkshire Organic MillersDo you have a photograph you’d like to share with Guardian readers?

This linguistic nonsense effectively renders all protest unlawful, for the point of protests is typically to draw attention by causing annoyance or inconvenience.If serious harm includes serious annoyance, presumably serious annoyance could include serious indifference, which could include serious amusement? While we’re at it, let’s redefine “serious wounding” to include “serious tickling”.The story quotes a young woman involved who describes the meeting as “six young women in a room, in a place that we hired, that we publicly advertised … I don’t really see any conspiracy in that.” Yet despite the word’s ordinary connotations, “conspiracy” in law just meanstwo or more people agreeing to carry out a crime, whether secretly or not.These young women seem understandably shocked that the law could define what they were suspected of doing as a serious crime, but the sad fact is that the police could have had grounds for suspicion, simply because the offence of conspiracy to cause public nuisance is so broad. Policing aside, we’ve allowed the criminal law itself to spread its tentacles over almost all conceivable protest-related activity – redefining sincere, democratically engaged citizens as dangerous enemies of society who belong behind bars.

He’s chosen to be called Leo: that’s no accident, 8 May). This is a key task facing his pontificate, and operates on a number of levels.First and foremost, building bridges within the different factions and groups of the Catholic church, and its 1.4 billion adherents worldwide, as well as with other Christian denominations. Second, building bridges between the Vatican and other faith groups, particularly Muslims, Hindus and the Jewish community, where there is painful history to heal. Third and finally, the pope needs to build bridges between the religious and secular worlds to find common ground. Bridge-building in our troubled world is a sacred task, and Pope Leo will have his work cut out.Zaki CooperVice-president,Council of Christians and JewsThe election of Pope Leo XIV is a reassuring and inspiring choice in a turbulent world. The new leader of the worldwide Catholic church is both a US and a Peruvian citizen.His greetingof “Peace be with you … A peace that is unarmed and disarming, humble and persevering. A peace that comes from God, the God who loves us all, unconditionally” is a deeply moving message that the world needs.For once, demagogues and dictators have been sent offstage; instead, Pope Leo attracts the attention of the world’s media. Indeed, he heralds the beginning of a new voice on the world’s stage, calling for peace, and reaching out across divisions by building bridges.Christina ThomasDurhamHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

His SSA is under the Presidential Council that came to power in 2021 with the government of national unity (GNU) of Abdul Hamid Dbeibah through a UN-backed process.Armed clashes erupted overnightand gunfire echoed in the city centre and other parts of Tripoli after reports of Kikli’s death.Libya’s Emergency Medicine and Support Centre said: “Six bodies have been retrieved from the sites of clashes around Abu Salim.The GNU’s interior ministry called on citizens to stay at home “for their own safety”. After the ministry’s call, drivers started speeding and honking in many Tripoli streets.One man told Reuters: “I heard heavy gunfire and I saw red lights in the sky.” . Other residents reported gunfire echoing in their neighbourhoods of Abu Salim and Salah Eddin.The UN mission in Libya urged all parties to “immediately cease fighting and restore calm”, reminding them of their obligation to protect civilians. “Attacks on civilians and civilian objects may amount to war crimes,” it said.Amnesty International and theEuropean Center for Constitutional and Human Rights(ECCHR) have described Kikli’s group as one of the main perpetrators of violence inside Libya’s detention centres. According to a UN security council panel of experts report in December 2024, Kikli was a central figure in Libya’s balance of power, playing a key role in militia financing through corrupt practices.As leader of the SSA, he was accused of extrajudicial killings, torture and serious human rights violations. His name appears in a 189-page complaint filed in 2022 by the ECCHR to the international criminal court, listing him among potential co-perpetrators of crimes against humanity linked to the systematic abuse of migrants and refugees.Diana Eltahawy, the deputy regional director for the Middle East and North Africa at Amnesty International, saidin a report published in 2022: “It can come as no surprise that al-Kikli’s militia is yet again involved in horrific crimes – whether against migrants and refugees or Libyans. For over a decade, militias under his command terrorised people in the Tripoli neighbourhood of Abu Salim through enforced disappearances, torture, unlawful killings and other crimes under international law. He should be investigated and, if there is enough admissible evidence, prosecuted in a fair trial.”In March, aphoto shared on Xby a Libyan activist showed Kikli in Rome, at the European hospital, visiting a GNU minister, Adel Juma, who was being treated there after surviving an attack in Tripoli on 12 February.Libya is a major transit point for Europe-bound asylum seekers. For years, human rights organisations have documented how migrants trapped in the country are at the mercy of militias and smugglers. Tens of thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa are kept indefinitely in overcrowded refugee detention centres where they aresubjected to abusesand torture.The country, a major oil producer in the Mediterranean, has had little stability since a 2011 uprising backed by Nato. Libya split in 2014 between warring eastern and western factions. Major fighting paused with a ceasefire in 2020 but efforts to end the political crisis have failed, with major factions occasionally joining forces in armed clashes and competing for control over Libya’s substantial economic resources.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsLibyaAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The South Africans jumped ahead of thousands of would-be refugees overseas who had been undergoing years of vetting and processing.First group of white South Africans arrive in US after Trump grants refugee statusRead moreEpiscopal Migration Ministries has long resettled refugees under federal grants. Rowe said that about two weeks ago, the government contacted it and said it expected the ministry to resettle some of the South Africans under the terms of its grant.“In light of our church’s steadfast commitment to racial justice and reconciliation and our historic ties with the Anglican Church of Southern Africa, we are not able to take this step,” Rowe said. “Accordingly, we have determined that, by the end of the federal fiscal year, we will conclude our refugee resettlement grant agreements with the US federal government.”South Africa’s government has vehemently denied allegations of discriminatory treatment of its white minority residents.“It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years,” Rowe said. “I am saddened and ashamed that many of the refugees who are being denied entrance to the United States are brave people who worked alongside our military in Iraq and Afghanistan and now face danger at home because of their service to our country.”He also said many refugees, including Christians, were victims of religious persecution and were now denied entry.He said the church would find other ways to serve immigrants, such as those already in this country and those stranded overseas.The move marks the end of a ministry-government partnership that, for nearly four decades, has served nearly 110,000 refugees from countries, including Ukraine, Myanmar and Congo, Rowe said.It is not the first high-profile friction between the Episcopal church and theTrump administration. Bishop Mariann Budde of Washington DC drew Trump’s anger in January at an inaugural prayer service in which she urged “mercy” on those fearing his actions, including migrants and LGBTQ+ children.The Anglican church of Southern Africa includes churches in South Africa and neighboring countries. It was a potent force in the campaign against apartheid in the 1980s and 1990s, an effort for which the late archbishop Desmond Tutu received the Nobel peace prize in 1984.Another faith-based refugee agency, Church World Service, says it is open to serving the South African arrivals.“We are concerned that the US Government has chosen to fast-track the admission of Afrikaners, while actively fighting court orders to provide life-saving resettlement to other refugee populations who are in desperate need of resettlement,” Rick Santos, CWS president and CEO, said in a statement.He added that the action proved the government knows how to screen and process refugees quickly.“Despite the Administration’s actions, CWS remains committed to serving all eligible refugee populations seeking safety in the United States, including Afrikaners who are eligible for services,” he said. “Our faith compels us to serve each person in our care with dignity and compassion.”The Episcopal ministry and CWS are among 10 national groups, most of them faith-based, that have partnered with the government for refugee resettlement.Explore more on these topicsUS newsReligionTrump administrationSouth AfricaRaceUS politicsAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He was 89.His death was announced by the current Uruguayan president. Yamandú Orsi. In a post on social media platform X, Orsi called Mujica a “president, activist, guide and leader”. Mujica had been under treatment forcancerof the esophagus since spring 2024, when the disease was diagnosed.Even as the treatment left him weak and hardly able to eat, Mujica reappeared on the political stage in fall of 2024, campaigning for his leftwing coalition in national elections thatvaulted his preferred candidate and protege, Orsi, to the presidency.In September of 2024, his doctor reported that radiation had succeeded in eliminating much of Mujica’s tumor. But in January of 2025, his doctor announced that the cancer in his esophagus had returned and spread to his liver. His autoimmune disease and other underlying medical problems led Mujica to decide not to pursue further treatment.José Mujica: is this the world’s most radical president? | Giles TremlettRead more“Honestly, I’m dying,” Mujica told weekly magazine Búsqueda in what he said would be his final interview. “A warrior has the right to rest.”During his 2010-2015 presidency, Mujica, widely known as “Pepe”, oversaw the transformation of his small South American nation into one of the world’s most socially liberal democracies. He earned admiration at home and cult status abroad for legalizing marijuana and same-sex marriage, enacting the region’s first sweeping abortion rights law and establishingUruguayas a leader in alternative energy.He sparked global fascination byshunning the presidential palaceto live in a tiny farmhouse and donating most of his salary to charity.In the 1960s, he co-founded the Marxist-Leninist urban guerrilla movement Tupamaros, which started out robbing from the rich to give to the poor but later escalated its campaign to kidnappings, bombings and assassinations.During those years, Mujica lived a life of derring-do. He sustained multiple gunshot wounds and took part in a mass prison breakout.But when the Tupamaros collapsed in 1972, he was recaptured and spent all of Uruguay’s 1973-1985 dictatorship in prison, where he was tortured and spent years in solitary confinement.After his release, he threw himself into politics and in 1989 founded the Movement of Popular Participation (MPP), the largest member of the leftist Broad Front coalition.Elected to Congress in 1995, he became a senator in 2000 and then agriculture minister in Uruguay’s first-ever leftwing government.He served just one five-year term as president, in line with Uruguay’s term limits.Mujica had no children and is survived by his wife, Lucía Topolansky, another former militant.In his final interview, Mujica repeatedly answered interview questions with philosophical aphorisms.“Life is a beautiful adventure and a miracle,” he said. “We are too focused on wealth and not on happiness. We are focused only on doing things and – before you know it – life has passed you by.”Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsUruguayAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The department declined to comment.Ovidio Guzmán was extradited to the United States in 2023 to face narcotics charges, joining his father, one of the world’s most infamous drug traffickers, who is serving a life sentence in a US prison.Judicial sources told AFP in October that Ovidio Guzmán was negotiating a plea deal with prosecutors to avoid trial.A court hearing in the case was due to be held on 12 May, but it was canceled and rescheduled for 9 July.According to court documents, a “change of plea agreement” is scheduled to take place on that day before a judge in Illinois.‘Mother of all battles’: terror for Mexicans as war rages inside Sinaloa cartelRead moreThe United States accuses El Chapo’s sons – known as the Chapitos – of taking over the Sinaloa cartel after the capture of their father.The cartel is one of six Mexican drug trafficking groups designated terrorist organizations by Donald Trump.Ovidio Guzmán is accused of conspiring to ship cocaine, fentanyl, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States.Another son, Joaquín Guzmán López, was arrested after arriving in the United States last July in a private plane with cartel co-founder Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who claimed he had been kidnapped.The arrests sparked cartel infighting that has leftmore than 1,200 people dead and 1,400 missingin Sinaloa state, located in north-western Mexico.Explore more on these topicsJoaquín 'El Chapo' GuzmánMexicoDrugs tradeAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Anand previously served in roles including defense minister.Women make up half of the cabinet, as they did in Trudeau’s cabinet.François-Philippe Champagne retains his job as finance minister, while Dominic LeBlanc remains minister of US trade and intergovernmental trade at a time of trade war betweenCanadaand the United States.‘Not everybody who voted for Carney quite knows what they got’: Canada eyes its new prime ministerRead moreCarney won the job of prime minister by promising to confront the aggression toward Canada shown by Donald Trump , whilepreserving the calm demeanor of an economistwho has led the central banks of both Canada and the United Kingdom.“Canadians elected this new government with a strong mandate to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States and to build a stronger economy for all Canadians,” Carney said.“My government will work relentlessly to keep Canada secure as a sovereign nation,” he added.Carney noted that King Charles III will deliver a speech outlining the Canadian government’s priorities on 27 May, when parliament resumes. Charles is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.Carney has emphasized Canada’s founding nations, the United Kingdom and France, and has said the old relationship with the US based on steadily increasing integration is over.More than 10 people were dropped from the new cabinet, including former defense minister Bill Blair.

But a voter has also claimed her ballot wasn’t counted, throwing the result once more into disarray.Officials at Elections Canada at the weekend finished a recount for theQuebecdistrict of Terrebonne, where the incumbent Bloc Québécois candidate Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagné appeared to have beaten her Liberal challenger Tatiana Auguste.Confusingly, Auguste was initially projected to emerge as the winner followingthe federal election on 28 April, after final tallies showed her ahead by 35 votes. But an official validation process on 1 May instead found that Sinclair-Desgagné, first elected in 2021, finished ahead by 44 votes.Under election law, a judicial recount is triggered automatically when the number of votes separating the winner and any other candidate is less than 0.1% of the valid votes cast. The recount, completed on Saturday, was overseen by aQuebeccourt judge.The win was returned to Auguste, with the Liberal candidate receiving 23,352 votes and Sinclair-Desgagné receiving 23,351.The latest result means the Liberals currently hold 170 seats in the House of Commons. To form a majority government, 172 seats are needed.Complicating the result, however, is a woman who says her vote wasn’t included in the final count.Terrebonne resident Emmanuelle Bossé says she voted for Sinclair-Desgagné but her mailed ballot was returned to her due to a postal code error.“I wasn’t the one who got Elections Canada’s address wrong on the envelope,” she told CBC’s Radio-Canada. “ElectionsCanadaglued this label on the envelope. I had nothing to fill. I just had to put my vote in there.” Bossé mailed her ballot on 5 April and it was returned to her nearly a month later on 2 May.Elections Canada says it is investigating the issue and “still working to gather all the facts”.If the new ballot is accepted and produces a tie, Elections Canada could force a byelection.Three more recounts are pending in the electoral districts of Milton East-Halton Hills South, Terra Nova-The Peninsulas, and Windsor-Tecumseh-Lakeshore. In the last case, which the incumbent, Irek Kusmierczyk, lost by 77 votes, he successfully petitioned for a recount after a number of ballots were deemed to have been improperly rejected.If Kusmierczyk emerges victorious from the challenge, the Liberals would hold 171 seats in parliament, just one short of a majority.Explore more on these topicsCanadaQuebecAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

China also removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.Donald Trump hailed the talks as a“total reset”of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US forwreaking economic chaos.Meeting Latin American leaders in Beijing on Tuesday, Xi said there were “no winners in tariff wars or trade wars”.“Bullying and hegemony will only lead to self-isolation,” he added, in reference to the US.On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry continued to condemn the “unreasonable” tariffs, urging the US to “stop smearing and shifting blame” for its fentanyl crisis on to China.The imbalance of 10% and 30% under the agreement is because the US is keeping a 20% tariff linked to accusations that China turns a blind eye to exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl, which Beijing denies.Chinese officials have repeatedly said Beijing opposes all tariffs and does not want to enter into a mutually destructive trade war but is willing to “fight to the end”.An English-languageeditorialpublished across state media titles on Tuesday said the talks marked “a crucial step toward resolving differences”. It said China’s approach had been consistent and constructive, and it welcomed the US’s “willingness to engage in that process”.“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and arduous nature of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.The tariff war has had anextraordinary impacton Chinese traders and manufacturers, with shipments grinding to a halt and an estimated16m jobs at risk.China now joins dozens of other countries in waiting to see if it can reach an agreement with the US not to restart crushing tariffs. On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and weathering the shocks of the tariffs.Ms Bao, an assistant to the general manager of a Ningbo foreign trade company, said 30% of their export volume went to the US, and they were feeling cautiously optimistic about the 90-day pause.“It’s hard to say what will happen after 90 days because we don’t know,” Bao told the Guardian. “There may be an increase in the volume of good shipping now because everyone may want to rush to ship the goods before [the end of the 90 days].”The Chinese business media outlet Caixinreportedthat some companies had already shifted their focus away from the US to domestic or other Asian markets instead.On Chinese social media, where discussion of the agreement received more than half a billion engagements, views were split.Hu Xijin, a former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, described the agreement as a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”.One reader commenting on the Paper’s report said: “Persistence is victory!”Others were more sarcastic about the “victory”. “Oh, did we win again?” said one person on Weibo. “The stock indexes react like we just lose.”On Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram, a user likened the pause to “changing the ventilator … on a dying patient”. “He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk briskly,” they wrote.Other commenters compared the US to the boy who cried wolf and hoped that it wouldn’t “break its promises again and again”. One said: “Economically speaking, this is sort of a ceasefire.”Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTrump tariffsTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The 49-year-old former nickel executive and mayor has vowed to get the economy back on track and support discussions on independence.“We need to find a way out. We haven’t spoken to each other for years, since the [independence] referendums. Now we’re talking again. Everyone is aware of what’s at stake,” Ponga said.New Caledonia is a territory ofFrancewhich lies in the Pacific Ocean. Ponga leads the Le Rassemblement party which wants to keepNew Caledoniawithin France.“Being president wasn’t necessarily what I wanted. But I was appointed to solve problems. I take them one by one, without any preconceptions,” said the native of Kouaoua, a small mining village on the archipelago’s east coast, where he had been mayor since 2014 before becoming president this year.Old tensions in New Caledonia: curfews and colonialism resurface on anniversary of French takeoverRead moreIn a wide-ranging interview with the Guardian to mark the anniversary of the unrest, Ponga discussed the independence debate, economic crisis and how to rebuild the vital nickel industry. Ponga also said New Caledonia can play a bigger role in the region, and hopes to develop relationships with partners like Australia and New Zealand.Theunrest that broke out in the archipelagoin May 2024 was sparked by French plans to change voting rules andinflamed tensions among Indigenous Kanak communities, who make up about 41% of the population. Fourteen people, mostly Kanak, were killed and the riots caused an estimated $2.4bn (€2.2bn) in damage. The crucial nickel industry and other businesses were severely disrupted and unemployment levels surged. One in five workers lost all or part of their income due to the riots and many remain unemployed.Since the unrest broke out, more than 10,000 people have left the territory. For a region with a population of about 270,000, the drain has serious consequences. There is a shortage of doctors and nurses, and health services are under severe stress.View image in fullscreenDeadly clashes that began in May 2024 led to the deaths of 14 people in New Caledonia.Photograph: Delphine Mayeur/AFP/Getty Images“We all need to face up to our responsibilities for what has happened and look to the future,” Ponga said.“Even if calm has returned, without real economic recovery and tax reforms, we’re dead. That’s what my government is going to do,” he said.A path toward independence continues to divide the population and the political conversation on the topic remains tense.Under the terms of the Nouméa Accord, signed in 1998, Caledonians have had three referendums on independence from France. The referendums held in 2018, 2020 and 2021 all received “no” votes – but results of thelast referendum are disputedby the pro-independence movement.Manuel Valls, the French Minister for overseas territories, visited Nouméa in April and May, with the hope of reaching an agreement between supporters of independence and pro-France figures on the road ahead.Valls left the territory last week without striking a new deal. Certain proposals were seen as an open door to independence and provoked anger from pro-France supporters including Ponga, who took part in the crucial discussions.Chosen by the party of loyalists to France to represent them, Ponga remains confident in New Caledonian’s ability to reach an agreement in months ahead.Ponga says that in the 1970s, the territory’s elder were all in agreement. “They wanted to get things moving so they could take charge of their lives, that was their emancipation strategy. You don’t have to be an independentist to want to take responsibility for yourself. I’m not an independentist, but I’m still a Kanak.”“Then the question of independence came along and blocked everything, and since then we’ve spent our time dancing around the table without doing anything.”View image in fullscreenA pro-independence supporter waves a flag on the side of a road ahead of legislative elections in Nouméa inJune 2024.Photograph: Delphine Mayeur/AFP/Getty ImagesReviving a weak economy remains one of Ponga’s most immediate challenges.Nickel is the lifeblood of the archipelago’s economy yettwo of the country’s three metallurgical plants remain idle. Nickel produced in New Caledonia accounts for about 8% of the world’s reserves, according to a report by the Overseas Institution of Issue (Ieom).Ponga has a background as an executive in the nickel industry and says the territory’s strategy toward this vital reserve has remained static and lacked flexibility.“If we want to bring back investors, we’re going to have to recreate the conditions of attractiveness. And that won’t be possible without France,” he said.map of new caledoniaTo run the country’s affairs during his term of office, Ponga intends to rely on “the three values I taught my children: work, work and work”.The president often refers to the land where he grew up, his roots. He proudly displays on his phone photos of his banana, yam and potato fields, where he and his children continue to work.‘Left by the wayside’: New Caledonia MP vows to take Indigenous frustrations to ParisRead moreHe also sees an opportunity for New Caledonia’s influence in the region.“We have an important role to play,” he asserts, when previous loyalist presidents were not very keen on opening up to the region.“We’ve neglected the Pacific and our Melanesian neighbours too much. Yet New Zealand, Australia and France are partners, and we need to take advantage of these links to develop our own axes of relationship, doing things at our own level.”“We need to assume our responsibilities and project ourselves forward.”Explore more on these topicsPacific leaders: in their wordsNew CaledoniaPacific islandsFranceAsia PacificEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And we should do our part. Sensibly approach this issue, to show that it’s not us that is slowing down the process,” said Zelenskyy, speaking to a small group of journalists, including the Guardian, in his office at the presidential administration in Kyiv.Zelenskyy said he would travel to Turkey on Thursday whether or not Putin flew in for talks.Zelenskyy said he had arranged to meet with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, in Ankara, but would be ready to fly to Istanbul at a moment’s notice if the Russian leader showed up. “If Putin does not arrive and plays games, it is the final point that he does not want to end the war,” he said on Tuesday.Previously, after Putin used an unexpected late-night Kremlin address to call for direct Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul, Zelenskyy responded by saying he would be waiting for Putin personally in Turkey on Thursday.Trump, who is on a visit to Saudi Arabia, appeared to float the idea of a three-way meeting with Putin and Zelenskyy,sayingon Monday: “I believe the two leaders are going to be there. I was thinking about flying over.”Zelenskyy said he was hoping Trump would indeed meet him in Turkey. “If Trump travels, it will push Putin also to travel,” he said. “Trump can really help. It’s the situation where the US being present can give important guarantees.”Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, also suggested the potential for a three-way summit. “This could be a really great meeting … We hope that President Putin will also come, and then President Trump will be there,” he told Fox News. Kellogg, as well as the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, and the envoy Steve Witkoff are also reportedly expected in Turkey.However, there is little sign that Putin is prepared to travel. Although he has not directly ruled it out, comments from the Kremlin suggest Russia will instead send a lower-level negotiating team to Istanbul.“Our delegation will be there and will wait for the Ukrainian side,” said Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, on Tuesday evening. The Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said Russia wanted to use any talks to address the “root causes” of the conflict as Moscow sees them, including the “denazification” of Ukraine and the official incorporation into Russia of annexed territories – suggesting that the rhetoric of the two sides is still very far apart.1:45Zelenskyy says he will wait in Turkey for face-to-face talks with Putin – videoZelenskyy said he believed that without a ceasefire agreed by the leaders, there was no point in beginning lower-level talks.“I want you to understand why I would meet with Putin. We are not going to be able to agree on everything now. It’s impossible. We have different approaches to life, different worldviews. But we have to somehow find a way to end the war,” he said. If he and Putin could agree on a ceasefire, Zelenskyy said, then lower-level groups could meet to start hammering out details of the next steps.He pointed to previous talks in Saudi Arabia, when the Americans acted as intermediaries between Russian and Ukrainian delegations, and a lasting full ceasefire could not be agreed. “Without signals from the leaders, or a meeting of the leaders, this format doesn’t work,” he said.However, when pressed, he refused to rule out sending a lower-level delegation to Istanbul for talks. “I don’t know. I am being honest. Maybe the Americans, maybe someone will really want to launch this format again. I don’t know,” he said.The back-and-forth diplomacy began with a visitto Kyiv by the leaders of Britain, France, Germany and Polandon Saturday, timed symbolically to come just one day after a set-piece military parade in Moscow marking 80 years since the Soviet victory in the second world war. After speaking with Trump on the phone, the four European leaders laid down an ultimatum to Putin that he should sign up to a 30-day ceasefire by Monday or face further sanctions.Putin rejected the ultimatum, instead offering the Istanbul talks without a ceasefire.Zelenskyy invites Pope Leo to Ukraine as pontiff urges journalists to report truthRead moreIn the event that nothing is agreed during whatever meetings take place in Turkey this week, the big question is whether the Europeans can bring Trump along with them in their plans to ratchet up the pressure on Moscow. Zelenskyy said he hoped that new sanctions would soon be on the agenda if Thursday’s meetings came to nothing.“I believe that President Trump is not against imposing sanctions … and I believe that there is political will in Congress to vote for these sanctions. I believe the Americans are very close to imposing these sanctions,” he said. He added that consultations would take place in the coming days – “if you’ll allow me, I won’t say where or when” – in which Europeans would be briefed on upcoming US sanctions plans.The Ukrainian president has been walking a diplomatic tightrope in recent weeks, as Kyiv tries to keep the Trump administration on side. After the disastrous White House meeting at the end of February, Zelenskyy appears to have had some success turning the relationship around,culminating in a positive meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis’s funeral in the Vatican last month.Asked what he had said to Trump to win him back over, Zelenskyy declined to answer: “I won’t tell you. I know the reasons; in my opinion, I know why we had such a good talk. But I can’t say, I just can’t.”British and French officials have been speaking regularly with Ukrainian counterparts since the White House debacle and offering guidance on how to mend relations with the US administration.Zelenskyy said the contact with European allies had been closer and more frequent than ever before, and that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, was one of “two or three” leaders whom he spoke with regularly by phone. “He has a very creative approach … He’s a risk-taker. And risk-takers can be different kinds of people, but they are all focused on results. They don’t put themselves above everything else,” Zelenskyy said.After his visit to Turkey, Zelenskyy is expected to visit Albania for a meeting of European politicians on Friday, and then may travel to Rome, where he suggested he could attend the inaugural mass of the new pope, Leo XIV, after having a positive phone call with him earlier this week.“I think it could happen on Sunday,” Zelenskyy said. “If it works out. We don’t know what this week will bring. We have come to the moment when we don’t know what will happen tomorrow.”Explore more on these topicsVolodymyr ZelenskyyVladimir PutinUkraineDonald TrumpEuropeRussianewsShareReuse this content"

Thyberg was forced to quit as national security adviser on Thursday just hours after being appointed when intimate photos of him from the dating site Grindr were sent to the government.In a statement, the prosecutor said the unnamed diplomat was suspected of carrying out espionage during the same period that Thyberg was forced out. Thyberg is not suspected of any crime, SVT reported.He was, very briefly, the replacement for Henrik Landerholm, the former national security adviser who was also forced to resign in January overmislaying classified documents.Swedish authorities have raised concerns in recent years about increasing threats from foreign powers such as Russia, China and Iran and groups engaging in actions ranging from violent attacks and hybrid warfare to corporate espionage.In March, Säpo warned that foreign powers were operating in ways that threatened security, using hybrid activities to destabilise Sweden andEurope.Sweden warns of heightened risk of Russian sabotageRead moreThe justice minister, Gunnar Strömmer, told SVT on Tuesday the government had been informed of Säpo’s operation and that the person in custody was suspected “on reasonable grounds” of espionage. Reasonable grounds is the lower of two grades of suspicion in Sweden.“The investigation has to be carried out and I don’t want to pre-empt it,” Strömmer said in a statement to SVT.Anton Strand, the lawyer appointed to defend the person in custody, declined to comment.Säpo said that one person had been arrested after an operation in the Stockholm area and that they were unable to provide further information owing to secrecy.Karin Lutz, a spokesperson for Säpo, said that while she understood the questions about potential links between the two incidents, she could not comment. “I’ve seen the news and I understand it raises a lot of questions but what we can say is there is one person who has been arrested,” she said.The prosecutor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Reuters contributed to this report.Explore more on these topicsSwedenEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

However, it added that demanding a specific percentage reduction in emissions was not realistic.Instead, the group has called for a ban on Shell’s new oil and gas fields rather than setting an emissions target.“We simply cannot sit back and wait while Shell continues on its fossil path. Shell remains fully committed to new oil and gas fields, despite warnings from scientists that this will have disastrous consequences. Now is the critical moment to curb the climate crisis,” Pol said.A spokesperson for Shell confirmed that it had received the letter but stressed that no lawsuit has been filed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His name will be added to the sex offender register inFrance, the judge ruled. He was also given a €29,000 fine. Depardieu’s lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said he would appeal against the verdict.The set dresser, named in the media as Amélie, said outside court: “For me, this is a victory. Justice has been done.”0:33'Justice was done', says victim after Depardieu guilty verdict – videoCarine Durrieu Diebolt, Amélie’s lawyer, said: “I hope this is the end of impunity for cinema artists. I’ve heard some actors recently still supporting Depardieu. Now with this verdict, no one can say Gérard Depardieu is not a sexual predator, and that’s very important. Today, on the first day of the Cannes film festival, I want the cinema world to think of the victims of Gérard Depardieu, and to speak of those victims.”Before the verdict, the French actor Brigitte Bardot backed Depardieu publicly, defending what she called “talented people who grab a girl’s bottom”.The Green lawmaker Marie-Charlotte Garin wrote on social media: “Depardieu is convicted at last. This is a clear message: even the most powerful are not untouchable. My thoughts with all the victims, who, like in this trial, still face contempt, challenges and humiliation for daring to speak out #MeToo.”Depardieu, a leading actor in French cinema for decades, had for years been supported by key figures in the cultural and political world and had become a symbol of France’s reluctance to reckon with women’s allegations.In December 2023, when Depardieu was under formal investigation for rape in another case and also facing scrutiny over sexist comments revealed in a TV documentary, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, defended him saying “he makes France proud.” Asked at the time about stripping Depardieu of a state award, Macron said: “You will never see me participate in a manhunt … hate that type of thing.”Finding Depardieu guilty, the judge Thierry Donard, set a precedent by ruling that Depardieu’s defence lawyer, Assous, had been “excessively harsh” to the two woman in court, saying they were not real victims and liars. Assous had said the women were working for the cause of “rabid feminism” and called their lawyers hysterical, “abject and stupid” and said they had an “unbearable voice”. The judge awarded the complainants compensation for being further victimised by Depardieu’s defence during the trial, ordering Depardieu to pay each woman €1,000.The court heard Depardieu trapped theset decorator, Amélie, between his legs on the film set and grabbed her buttocks, pubis and chest. She said he trapped her with force, used obscene language and had to be pulled off her.Depardieu targeted Amélie on set when she was making phone calls to track down parasols for the film. He allegedly said: “Come and touch my big parasol. I’ll stick it in your pussy.”View image in fullscreenGerard Depardieu’s lawyer, Jérémie Assous, said the actor would appeal against the verdict.Photograph: Thomas Padilla/APAmélie told the court that he then grabbed her hips, pulled her towards him and trapped her between his thighs with great force, and grabbed her body, including her pubis, waist and chest.“That’s where I understood the strength he had, he held me very, very hard,” she said. “I remember his eyes, I saw this big face, red eyes, very angry, very agitated. And he was saying: ‘Come touch my big parasol,’ with a crazy look. I’ve never seen anything like that.”She said: “That fear that I felt – what stands out for me is not his sexual desire but his savagery. It was the fact that he knew I was afraid – I saw his eyes light up with a kind of pleasure in making someone afraid. I remember that savagery. He really terrified me, and that amused him.”Depardieu was also convicted of sexually assaulting anassistant directoron the same film, touching her breasts or buttocks on three separate occasions. The woman, who was not named in the media, was tasked with accompanying Depardieu from his dressing room on to the set during the filming. She said the assaults left her “petrified”.The assistant director told the court that a first sexual assault happened during a night shoot in Paris, when she found herself alone with Depardieu at the end of a short road where his dressing room was located as they walked towards an outdoor set.She said the second assault happened at a later date on a set inside a Paris apartment, where Depardieu blocked her against a door and put his two hands on her breasts. She told the court: “I said no. I was scared.”She said that on a third occasion Depardieu put his hand on her buttocks and she again said: “No.”The assistant director told the court that Depardieu “talked about sex all day on set, constantly talking of ‘pussy’ to everyone”.Depardieu did not attend the reading of the verdict in court. His whereabouts were not immediately clear. Last month, he was working in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores on a new film directed by his friend, the actor Fanny Ardant, who testified in court in support of him.Depardieu denied sexual assault. He told the trial that the media had used allegations against him to damage his reputation. He attacked the#MeToo movementas well as women who had held protest placards outside a concert tour he was on at the time of the allegations. “This movement is going to become a terror,” he said.The Paris prosecutor’s office has requested Depardieu face a further trial for rape and sexual assault in a separate case brought by the actor Charlotte Arnould, but no date has been set.In an open letter to Le Figaro in 2023, Depardieu denied the allegations, saying any encounter with Arnould had been consensual.Explore more on these topicsGérard DepardieuFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The informal meeting will be the first face-to-face meeting between a US president and a Syrian leader since 2000, when Bill Clinton met with the late leader Hafez al-Assad in Geneva.Speaking at an investment forum on Tuesday, Trump said that he planned to lift sanctions on Syria after holding talks with Saudi Arabia’s Mohammed bin Salman and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. “I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance at greatness,” Trump said.1:35Trump says the US will lift its sanctions on Syria’s new government – videoSharaa’s pitch to woo the US president offered access to Syrian oil, reconstruction contracts and to build a Trump Tower in Damascus in exchange for the lifting of US sanctions onSyria.Though the details of the sanctions relief were still unclear, Sharaa’s team in Damascus was celebrating.“This is amazing, it worked,” said Radwan Ziadeh, a Syrian writer and activist who is close to the Syrian president. He shared a picture of an initial mockup of Trump Tower Damascus. “This is how you win his heart and mind,” he said, noting that Sharaa would probably show Trump the design during their meeting in Riyadh on Wednesday.The visit was heavily focused on business interests and securing quick wins – often with characteristic Trumpian embellishment – for the administration. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed pledged to invest $600bn in the United States during a lunch with Trump, including $20bn in artificial intelligence data centres, purchases of gas turbines and other energy equipment worth $14.2bn, nearly $5bn in Boeing 737-8 jets, and other deals.But details of the specific commitments remained vague, the numbers put out by the White House did not total $600bn, and some of the programs began under Joe Biden’s administration.Trump 2.0 takes quid pro quo fears to new heights with $400m flying griftRead moreThe White House called the arms deal the “largest defence sales agreement in history” and said that it included plans for more than a dozen US defense companies to sell weapons, equipment and services in the areas of air force advancement and space capabilities, air and missile defense, as well as border and maritime security.The US president was feted with a royal guard as he arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday. Royal Saudi Air Force F-15s escorted Trump’s Air Force One jet as it arrived in Riyadh and Trump sat with Salman in an ornate hall at the Royal Court at Al Yamamah Palace with members of the US and Saudi and business elite. Among them were Elon Musk, prominent figures in AI such as Sam Altman, as well the chief executives of IBM, BlackRock, Citigroup, Palantir and Nvidia, among others.When Salman pledged that Saudi Arabia would invest $600bn in the US economy, Trump smiled and joked that it should be $1tn.The trip is part of a reordering of Middle Eastern politics dominated by Trump’s “America first” platform of prioritising domestic US economic and security interests over foreign alliances and international law. Critics have said that thedealmaking empowers Trump and a coterie of businessmenaround the president, and the US president’s family has business interests in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, giving this administration an unprecedented conflict of interest.The most glaring example of the new commoditisation of American foreign policy under Trump has beenthe proposed giftfrom the ruling family of Qatar of a luxury Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet that the White House said could be converted into a presidential plane and then be given to Trump’s presidential library after he leaves office.The gift has provoked anger from congressional Democrats, one of whom described it as an “aerial palace” and said it would constitute “the most valuable gift ever conferred on a president by a foreign government”.Trump has defended the offer, saying in a post it would “replace the 40 year old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction” and called Democrats asking for an ethics investigation “World Class Losers!!!”The meeting between Trump and Salman was characterised by smiles and friendly backslapping, a sharp contrast to past summits when the Saudi leader was mired in controversy over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.While his administration touted big deals, Trump also admitted that his geopolitical goals of Saudi Arabia’s diplomatic recognition of Israel would take time due in large part to the Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza.“It will be a special day in the Middle East, with the whole world watching, when Saudi Arabia joins us” in the Abraham accords, the Trump administration’s framework for Arab states to recognise Israel, he said. “And I really think it’s going to be something special – but you’ll do it in your own time.”Trump is also due to visit the United Arab Emirates on Thursday before continuing on to Qatar this week.His negotiations in the region have been characterised by big-ticket investment deals, and those appeared to play a role in his reversal of US policy on Syria as well.Sharaa, who is keen to normalise relations with the US, has reportedly offered Trump a number of sweeteners including the Trump tower in Damascus, a demilitarised zone by the Golan Heights that would strengthen Israel’s claim to the territory it has occupied since 1967, diplomatic recognition of Israel, and a profit-sharing deal on resources similar to the Ukraine minerals deal.‘Just wildly illegal’: top Democrats push to censure Trump’s plan to accept Qatar jetRead moreThe idea to offer Trump a piece of real estate with his name on it in the heart of Damascus was thought up by a US Republican senator, who passed on the idea to Sharaa’s team.“Sanctions in Syria are very complicated, but with Trump, he can [get] most of them lifted. It is a great opportunity,” Ziadeh said.The trip is also extraordinary for Trump’s decision not to visit Israel, the US’s closest ally in the region, due to the war in Gaza and Trump’s fraught relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu. Hamasreleased the lastremaining American hostage, Edan Alexander, on the eve of Trump’s visit to the Middle East, in an effort to push Trump to pressure Netanyahu to end the war.Netanyahu doubled down on the war on Tuesday in a show of defiance, saying that any ceasefire would only be “temporary”.“In the coming days, we will enter with full force to complete the operation to defeat Hamas,” he said. “Our forces are there now.”“There will be no situation where we stop the war,” he added.Explore more on these topicsUS foreign policySaudi ArabiaTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsMiddle East and north AfricaSyrianewsShareReuse this content"

There is also evidence of Israel making efforts to limit incidental harm to civilians.”Is Britain breaking international law over Israel to avoid offending Trump? We may find out in court this week | Yasmine AhmedRead moreGovernment lawyers also stressed that the international court of justice last year had not found there was a plausible risk of a genocide occurring.The government argues no violation of the duty to prevent such a genocide “can occur unless and until there is actually a genocide”.Yet Husain told the court that “on the first of this month, at least 1.9 million people, or about 90% of the population, have been displaced on 10 times or more.“On 7 May the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported that every single one of Gaza hospitals has been damaged or destroyed and, as of this month, only half were partially functional.“Official reporting from the ministry of health, cited by UN agencies, indicated that between 23 October and 25 April over 50,000 Palestinians to be killed, including at least 15,000 children and a further 214,000 injured.”He said: “These acts of annihilation have been accompanied by persistent genocidal, dehumanising and even celebratory statements made at all levels of the Israeli military and political structure, including such figures, I regret to say, as the prime minister, president, minister of defence, minister of national security and minister of finance.”The hearing before Lord Justice Males and Mrs Justice Steyn is due to conclude on Friday, and a decision is expected in writing at a later date.Explore more on these topicsArms tradeGazaIsraelForeign policyMiddle East and north AfricaPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

The company will sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips inSaudi Arabia, with a first tranche of 18,000 of its newest “Blackwell” chips going to Humain, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth-fund-owned AI startup, Reuters reported. Cisco on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with G42, the AI firm based in the United Arab Emirates, to help the company develop that country’s AI sector.Trump plans to visit the UAE on Thursday. The New York Times on Monday reported that hisadministrationis nearing a deal to allow UAE to buy large volumes of Nvidia’s AI chips as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The White House said the Saudi Arabian firm DataVolt will invest $20bn in AI data centers and energy infrastructure in the US. Alphabet’s Google, DataVolt, Oracle, Salesforce, Advanced Micro Devices and Uber will invest $80bn in transformative technologies in both countries, according to the White House, though no further details were available.Cisco said it had reached an agreement with UAE’s G42 “to assess the potential” to work together on cybersecurity technologies that use US AI as well as AI data centre technologies.Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to make its economy less dependent on oil revenue, aims to position itself as a hub for AI and a leading centre for AI activity outside the United States. The pivot is recent: on Monday, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced the launch of Humain, which will develop and manage AI technologies in Saudi Arabia. The two companies said they would leverage Nvidia’s platforms to establish Saudi Arabia as a global leader in AI, GPU cloud computing and digital transformation.Command over the world’s most advanced semiconductors, vital for cutting-edge AI, has put Trump in a powerful negotiating position as he tours the Middle East. The deals with Saudi Arabia for AI chips stand in stark contrast to the strict restrictions the US has imposed on trading the commodity with China. Nvidia in particular has been prohibited from selling its latest models to Chinese firms, though some have still been able to match American companies’ AI, most notablyDeepSeek.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyDonald TrumpSaudi ArabiaArtificial intelligence (AI)GoogleNvidiaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The UAE currently does not enrich uranium for its own nuclear programme.The consortium would be based on Iranian facilities with enrichment returned to the 3.67% levels set out in the original 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six world powers, which Donald Trump unilaterally ended in 2018.The US has demanded that Iran ends enrichment and dismantles all its nuclear facilities. But amid divisions in Washington, Trump has not made a final decision on the issue and praised Iran’s seriousness in the talks.The consortium idea was first proposed by former Iranian nuclear negotiator Seyed Hossein Mousavian and Princeton physicist Frank von Hippel long before the current Tehran-Washington talks, in a widely read October 2023 article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.Under the consortium, the Saudis and UAE would be shareholders and funders, and would gain access to Iranian technology. The involvement of the Gulf states could be seen as an extra insurance that Iran’s nuclear programme was for entirely civil purposes and not the pathway to building a bomb, as Israel alleges.If the Saudis and UAE were permitted to send engineers to Iran, an extra form of visibility about the programme would become possible, leaving the international community less reliant solely on the work of the UN nuclear inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency.Iran gradually moved away from the levels of enrichment and stockpile limits set out in the original 2015 deal, blaming Trump for leaving the nuclear deal. Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: “For a limited period of time, we can accept a series of restrictions on the level and volume of enrichment.”The US originally gave the impression that it needs an agreement with Iran within two months of the talks starting but, as the technicalities of any agreement become more complex, it is possible the talks will be allowed to drag on through the summer.Iran currently enriches uranium to 60% purity – far above the 3.67% limit set in the 2015 deal, and a short technical step from 90% needed for weapons-grade material. The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said these uranium enrichment level are far higher than necessary for civilian uses.In what may have been a reference to the Iranian proposal Omani foreign minister, Badr Al Busaidi, referred to “useful and original ideas reflecting a shared wish to reach an honourable agreement”.The UAE operates a civil nuclear power plant named Barakah, located west of Abu Dhabi. It is the first nuclear power plant in the Arab world to be fully operational, with all four reactors now online, and should be capable of producing a quarter of the UAE’s electricity needs.Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeUnited Arab EmiratesIran nuclear dealSaudi ArabiaIranMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

That amounted to £536m of the £2.8bn that the health service in England paid out in damages in 2023-24 – its record bill for mistakes.“Far too many patients still suffer clinical negligence which can cause devastating harm to those affected,” and the ensuing damages drain vital funds from the NHS, the report said.A DHSC source accepted the PAC’s findings, saying: “The cost of clinical negligence claims is rising at an unsustainable rate, eating into resources available for frontline care. Annual cash payments have more than doubled in the last 10 years and quadrupled in the past 17 years to £2.8bn.”The PAC criticised the department for not yet having explained why patient harm occurs and devised a strategy to overhaul patient safety, despite the committee in the last parliament asking the DHSC do so by last summer. The DHSC “has only recently written to us in response” to that recommendation, the PAC said.“It is unacceptable that the department is yet to develop a plan to deal with the cost of clinical negligence claims and so much taxpayers’ money is being spent on legal fees,” the report says.Paul Whiteing, the chief executive of patient safety charity Action Against Medical Accidents, said that lawsuits arose over errors by NHS staff in every area of care. “But the largest sums are awarded to families of babies that are left with lifelong disabilities, such as brain damage, through negligence at birth.”The NHS has faced a series of maternity care scandals in recent years that have left mothers and babies dead or badly injured. In 2023 the Care Quality Commission, the health service care regulator,said that two-thirds of maternity units provided substandard care.The NHS would face fewer lawsuits if it was more open when mistakes happen, Whiteing added.“We see many people who only litigate because the NHS ‘pulled down the shutters’, by which I mean failed to properly look into what went wrong, offer a meaningful apology for their mistake and involve the family in the investigation. If steps such as these were followed, many fewer people would resort to litigation,” he said.Jess Brown-Fuller, a Liberal Democrat health spokesperson, said the huge cost of NHS medical negligence payouts are “symptomatic of a health service that simply is not functioning. The Labour government’s embrace of dither and delay on social care, maternity reforms and rebuilding our hospitals is prolonging the misery.”In its analysis of the DHSC’s annual report and accounts for 2023-24, the PAC also revealed the cost of building long-planned new high containment labs in Harlow, Essex, to help protect the UK against infectious diseases, had spiralled from £530m to “an eye-watering projected £3.2bn”.And it criticised the government for not spelling out what impact its decision to abolish NHS England and axe tens of thousands of health service managers would have on patients and staff. It voiced concern about cuts to dentistry, GP services and health prevention.Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, echoed the PAC’s unease. “While many leaders understand the need for change, the lack of detail on how the national shake-up will be taken forward, the pace of this restructure, and how it connects to the ambitions of the 10-year plan are a cause for concern among staff,” he said.A DHSC spokesperson said: “Patient safety is the bedrock of a healthy NHS and social care system. This government will ensure the country has the best system in place to keep patients safe by overhauling the overly complex bureaucracy of healthcare regulation and oversight and we will examine the drivers of costs, how to manage spending on clinical negligence and the potential merits of reform options.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a danger that ministers and civil servants might see this as a quick fix to save money, but doing this well is essential and hard.”The government claims that Consult will work 1,000 times faster than a human and will be 400 times cheaper, with its conclusions being “incredibly similar” to those reached by experts but in a fraction of the time.Speaking on the launch of Consult, the technology secretary,Peter Kyle, said Consult would save “millions” for taxpayers.“No one should be wasting time on something AI can do quicker and better, let alone wasting millions of taxpayer pounds on outsourcing such work to contractors.“After demonstrating such promising results, Humphrey will help us cut the costs of governing and make it easier to collect and comprehensively review what experts and the public are telling us on a range of crucial issues.“The Scottish government has taken a bold first step. Very soon, I’ll be using Consult, within Humphrey, in my own department and others in Whitehall will be using it too – speeding up our work to deliver the plan for change.”There is no fixed date yet for Consult, which is still in its trial phase, being implemented in government work, but the belief is that it could be deployed in government offices by the end of 2025.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Peter KyleScotlandnewsShareReuse this content"

We will also be making sure that government jobs support economic growth throughout the country,” he said.Alex Thomas, programme director at the Institute for Government, said thousands of civil servants had already been moved out of London and the targets should be achievable, meaning talented civil servants can build their careers outside the capital.However, he cautioned: “It would be a mistake to spray jobs across the country at random – civil servants benefit from working on campuses together, organised around a common theme. We’ve seen the benefits this can bring at the Darlington Economic Campus. But success takes hard work, and senior ministerial and official investment of time and resource.”The plan will also mean more young entrants to the civil service can have careers in the government without ever having worked in Whitehall.The government is not setting a target for how many jobs will be moved outside London, as some of the 12,000 jobs lost in London will not be replaced. Departments are responsible for coming up with plans about shifting their focus outside the capital as part of the spending review.The Cabinet Office said the changes are projected to bring about £730m in local economic benefits to areas with new civil service hubs between 2024 and 2030.Fran Heathcote, PCS’s general secretary, said:“PCS believes the civil service has a vital role to play in rebuilding the nation. We consider there should be improved access for workers to higher grade roles in the civil service across regions and nations. This will allow those workers to develop their careers without having to uproot from their families and communities; and it will assist economic regeneration in areas that need it.“If these government proposals are to be successful, however, it’s important they do the right thing by workers currently based in London. That must include guarantees of no compulsory redundancies, no compulsory relocations and access to more flexible working arrangements to enable them to continue their careers should they wish to do so.”Dave Penman, the FDA general secretary, said civil servants will welcome the commitments from the government “to ensure that, alongside the targets for moving greater numbers of roles outside of London, there’s a recognition that for this to be a success, civil servants need to be able to build careers for the longer-term across the UK, including in London where there will now be fewer opportunities”.“There will also be uncertainty for the thousands of civil servants affected by the office closures announced today. We need to hear quickly from the departments affected how this will be managed, not least how they will be affected by the office closures, relocation of roles out of London and reduction in headcount all happening at the same time,” he said.Explore more on these topicsCivil servicePublic services policyTrade unionsnewsShareReuse this content"

In 2009 only 15% of deaths from cardiovascular disease occurred in people with diabetes, out of a total of 147,820 deaths.The report also found the UK spends £10.7bn ondiabetescare each year, with the figure set to rise to £18bn by 2035, while just 61.3% of people received all of the recommended care processes for people living with diabetes in 2023-24. More than a third of these missed at least one of these checks.An estimated 5.8 million people across the UK areliving with diabetes, and about 90% of these cases are type 2 diabetes.The report called for the government’s upcoming 10-year health plan to confirm the target of reducing death and disability from cardiovascular disease by a quarter, and that clear metrics should be outlined on how this target will be reached.Colette Marshall, the chief executive of Diabetes UK, said:“Diabetes shouldn’t be a gateway to ill health but, right now, this is the devastating reality facing millions of people living with the condition. Diabetes leads to 812 strokes, 568 heart attacks and 2,909 cases of heart failure each week in England alone. But this can and must change.“The government has already laid out its aims for the 10-year health plan, which is focused on switching the dial from sickness to the prevention of ill health. If they are to succeed in this aim, diabetes must be an integral part of their plans.“We already have the tools and knowledge to successfully make this shift. Now we need the political will to fully deliver it. The government must act now, so no life is cut short by diabetes.”Kamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, said: “The findings of this report underscore the critical importance of cardiovascular health management in individuals with diabetes. We now have ample evidence that if we do the simple things well – like controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and blood glucose – we can significantly reduce complications and improve both the quality and length of life for people with diabetes.“However, this report shows that one in three people do not receive the simple care processes that every person with diabetes should receive. This is just not good enough with the evidence that we have. We also now have specific therapies that prevent cardiovascular diseases and kidney disease in people withtype 2 diabetes.”NHS England have been approached for comment.Explore more on these topicsDiabetesHealth policyNHSHeart diseaseEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

She was supplied with money, drugs and alcohol in return for sex.She was taken to various places where she was raped over several years, including by Hussain and the Ahmed brothers. Many of the offences took place in the flats above the brothers’ family’s grocery shop.Hussain and Fayaz Ahmed were 18 and 17 respectively when they carried out their offences, while Imtiaz Ahmed was in his 30s.In an impact statement read to the court, the victim said that almost 30 years after the abuse, she still suffered flashbacks and the trauma left her unable to trust people, including the services there to protect her.Rigby said: “This case involved the shocking and hideous abuse of a vulnerable teenager by these three sexual predators. I referred these sentences to court of appeal because in my view they were unduly lenient.“I attended court today for the hearing and I very much welcome the court of appeal’s significant increases to these sentences.”The trio were convicted in January. Ibrar Hussain was initially sentenced to six years and six months – this was increased to 10 years on Tuesday.Imtiaz Ahmed was initially sentenced to nine years, which was increased to 11, and Fayaz Ahmed had his sentence extended from seven years and six months to 10 years.Explore more on these topicsRape and sexual assaultWest YorkshirePrisons and probationCrimeUK criminal justicenewsShareReuse this content"

Eventually it became a job for me, pretty much.”She explained Combs would “control the whole situation” and that “it was his fantasy,” adding that she felt like she “couldn’t say no” as she “didn’t want to make him upset”.As Ventura was questioned on Tuesday, prosecutors sought to portray Combs as someone who was controlling and abusive, and who exerted power over nearly every aspect of Ventura’s life – including the clothes she wore, her career, where she lived, who she could talk to, which escorts would participate in the so called “freak-offs”, as well as what occurred during the “freak-offs” themselves.Ventura told the court that she would ingest drugs at every “freak-off”, that she said were provided by Combs, as it helped her “dissociate” and had a “numbing” effect.Ventura emphasized that she felt a “responsibility” to make Combs happy.Combs preferred Ventura to groom herself a specific way – specifically, he wanted her have her nails painted white, her hair combed a certain way and even suggested she get breast implants.Combs and his team would also periodically take away her laptop or phone. “It depended on how long I was being punished for,” she said.Over time, she said, “freak-offs” were not something she wanted to do as they made her feel “horrible”, “humiliated”and “worthless”, she said. “It felt like all I was good for.” She told the court that the “freak-offs” could last two to three days sometimes – with no sleep.“I was an object,” she said. “I was heavily objectified.”Still, she told the court: “I was in love and wanted to make him happy” and “I didn’t know what ‘no’ could turn into.”Of how Combs would get during “freak-offs,” Ventura said: “His eyes go black – the version of him I was in love with was no longer there.”Ventura said that she was expected to take part in the “freak-offs” even while menstruating and that Combs would sometimes direct someone to urinate on her, resulting in bedsheets during these encounters covered in blood and urine. She said she didn’t want that to happen, but “you don’t have a lot of control at that moment”.“I just felt humiliated, it was disgusting, it was too much,” she said. “I choked, I didn’t want to be doing that, I was in a position I couldn’t easily get out of. I eventually put my hands up and Sean saw and told him to stop. I was choking, too much urine in my mouth. Sean urinated on me at the same time.”Ventura also testified that Combs would also sometimes record the “freak-offs” on his device. He would also sometimes use her device to record the sexual encounters, she said, but Ventura told the court that she would delete the videos on her phone afterwards.“I never wanted anyone to see me like that,” she said. “Objectifying me, putting me in compromising, gross positions with strangers.”She recalled her first meeting with Combs, in 2005, when she was 19.“I just knew that he was this larger-than-life entrepreneur, musician. Was a fan of the music. I didn’t know too much about him personally,” she said, adding that she went on to sign a 10-album deal with Combs’s record label.Ventura later released her debut album in 2006, but it would be the only one she ever put out on Combs’s label.Diddy trial draws media circus to New York streets: ‘I just want to catch the vibe’Read moreOf how her relationship with Combs developed, Ventura explained how he kissed her on her 21st birthday in Las Vegas and that the incident made her uncomfortable and that she felt “confused”.From there, despite their 17-year age gap, they began to see each other more frequently and “started to develop a comfortable relationship with each other”.After the pair started dating, which Ventura said “was not public for many years” as Combs was still in a relationship with longtime partner Kim Porter, Ventura described the world Combs lived in as “much different” than her own.“He had assistants at his beck and call. He could get anything done quickly. He had respect from everyone and he traveled quite a bit,” she said.Ventura depicted Combs’s tempestuous moods and the resulting violence he would inflict on her if she didn’t act a certain way. She said she never knew if he would show up at her home in Los Angeles happy or yelling, prompting her to have constant “stomach-in-knots” moments.“Make the wrong face and the next thing I knew I would get hit in the face,” she said. “He would say: ‘Watch your mouth.’”Over time, she said, she began to experience his “abusive side” and his “controlling side” adding that his mood would vary day to day, which affected her “greatly”.Ventura recalled that Combs had guns in safes in his multiple homes, which alarmed her. She cited one particular incident during which Combs made her carry one of the guns, something he did on multiple occasions, which “terrified” her.That incident involved Combs pursuing his longtime rival Suge Knight: “We were having a freak-off in one of his homes in LA and he said Suge was at Mel’s Diner and we packed up and drove down there,” Ventura said.“I was screaming and crying: ‘Please don’t do anything stupid.’ I didn’t know what they were going to do.”Combs, who was arrestedlast September, faces charges including racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and denied all allegations.Daniel Phillip, the second witness called on Monday and a former manager of a “male revue show”, was back on the stand on Tuesday morning to finish his testimony and cross examination.On Tuesday, Combs’s lawyer Xavier Donaldson asked Phillip if Ventura “was in complete control of everything she did” with Combs.“I cannot say that,” Phillip said.Phillip later testified about Ventura’s drug use and noted its infrequency during their encounters. He also revealed that he had bigger feelings for her: “Had she ever given me the chance to date her, I absolutely would have.”On Monday, a jury of eight men and four womenheard opening statements, and testimony from the first two witnesses called to the stand by the government.Prosecutors allege that Combs ran a “criminal enterprise” through his business empire, aided by associates and employees, that engaged in crimes such as sex trafficking, kidnapping, arson, bribery, enticement to engage in prostitution and obstruction of justice – allegedly dating back to at least 2004.First day of Sean Combs sex-trafficking trial ends as prosecutors say he ‘ran a criminal enterprise’Read moreCombs’s defense attorneys acknowledged that Combs perpetrated domestic violence in the past, but denied any involvement in sex trafficking or a racketeering conspiracy, and portrayed any group sex as consensual, describing it as part of a “swinger’s lifestyle”.Before court adjourned for the day, prosecutors questioned Ventura about the circumstances surrounding the hotel assault captured in 2016 surveillance video. Ventura said that she, Combs and a male escort had been engaged in a “freak-off” in the hotel room, when at some point, Combs hit her. She then grabbed her things and left the room.Asked how many times Combs had thrown her to the floor like he is seen doing in the footage in the hotel elevator lobby, Ventura responded: “too many to count”.Proceedings are scheduled to return Wednesday morning with continued questioning by the prosecution.In accordance with federal court rules, the trial is not being televised. If convicted, Combs, who has been jailed since his arrest last year, could spend the rest of his life in prison.Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organizations.

The company had not decided on permanent closure, a statement said, adding the chemicals giant was “exploring all available options for the future of the site, including sale of the facility”.Air in Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’ likely more toxic than previously thoughtRead moreThe fence-line community’s fight for clean air has become a national and international environmental justice clarion call, prompting a number of interventions from the Biden administration. These included the introduction of anew rulegoverning emissions on the plant’s primary pollutant, a likely human carcinogen namedchloroprene, and aUS justice department lawsuit seekingto compel Denka to lower its pollution.TheTrump administrationsought to undo many of these initiatives. Donald Trump’s justice departmentdropped the litigationin March citing “ideological overreach” and a new executive order targeting so-called “DEI programs”.Denka said the administration had also “committed to rewrite” the Biden-era chloroprene rule.Still, the company said in a statement that it had endured “extraordinary loss in its financial results” for the last year amounting to a 16.1bn yen (roughly $109m) in losses. Although citing a decline in global demand, the company also blamed the uncertainty caused by increased regulation under Joe Biden for its facility’s financial collapse in America.The Guardianhas revealedhow the plant’s former owners, US chemicals giant DuPont, sought to sell the facility in 2015 in a secretive deal after citing concerns about potential environmental regulation and its impact on profit margins. DuPont allegedly withheld information about these concerns before selling to Denka.DuPont did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.Denka made reference to the 2015 sale again on Tuesday, suggesting it had “not anticipated” the need to install pollution control technology and equipment at the point of purchase. Since purchasing the facility, the Japanese firm has invested over $35m in emissions offset technology and has claimed to have reduced chloroprene emissions by more than 80%.Notably,chloroprene readings recorded by the EPAhave continued to show measurements well in excess of the federal government’s lifetime exposure guidance.‘It is going to be terrible’: a senior in Louisiana’s ‘Cancer Alley’ prepares for Trump’s dismantling of hard-won environmental progressRead moreResidents who have fought for years against the plant’s pollution expressed some cautious optimism on Tuesday.“It [the suspension of production] is not about us, the community. They don’t care about us,” said Mary Hampton of Boundless Community Action. “What I see now is that they never intended to get emissions down. But now they’ve been hit internationally they don’t have a choice.”Hampton, who has lived in the fence-line community of Reserve for her entire life and lost a number of family members to cancer, added that the community remained concerned about a potential sale to another manufacturer.“I worry it’s just a temporary thing,” Hampton said. “I worry they’re going to sell to somebody else, who will come in with the same regulations and keep doing exactly what they want.”Explore more on these topicsLouisianaCancer townPollutionAir pollutionHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Art looks for truth. Art embraces diversity. That’s why art is a threat.”As applause broke out in the Grand Lumiére, Cannes’ largest cinema, De Niro continued:‘A coward’s violence’: Robert De Niro trolls Trump outside hush-money trialRead more“That’s why we are a threat to autocrats and fascists. America’s philistine president ha[s] had himself appointed head of one of our premier cultural institutions [the Kennedy Center]. He has cut funding and support to the arts, humanities and education.”De Niro then addressed Trump’s surprise announcement 10 days ago that he planned toput a 100% tariff on filmsmade outside the US.“You can’t put a price on creativity,” said De Niro, “but apparently you can put a tariff on it. Of course, this is unacceptable. All of these attacks are unacceptable. And this isn’t just an American problem, it’s a global one. Like a film, we can’t just all sit back and watch. We have to act, and we have to act now.”De Niro concluded his speech with a rallying call for people to take action, “without violence, but with great passion and determination”.“It’s time for everyone who cares about liberty to organise,” he said, “to protest, and when there are elections, vote. Vote. Tonight, and for the next 11 days, we show our strength and commitment by celebrating art in this glorious festival. Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité.”The actorLeonardo DiCapriopresented De Niro, now 81, with the award in advance of the opening night film – French comedy Partir Un Jour. De Niro was president of the jury at the festival in 2011 and has long been a regular on the Croisette.Some of his key films have also premiered at the festival, including Martin Scorsese’s Mean Streets in 1973 and Sergio Leone’s Once Upon a Time in America in 1984.This year’s Cannes has so far been marked by its engagement with real-world affairs. Theconviction and sentencing ofone of the festival’s most-celebrated stars, Gérard Depardieu, on sexual assault charges earlier on Tuesday dominated discussion during the first day.‘He’s not a monster’: Juliette Binoche talks Gérard Depardieu as verdict dominates start of CannesRead moreAlong with Trump’s tariffs and the new ban on nude or excessively voluminous red carpet dresses, it proved an unavoidable talking point at the jury press conference in the afternoon, with this year’s president, Juliette Binoche,sayingshe felt her sometime co-star was “not a monster”.“He’s a man who lost his aura owing to facts thatoccurred and were looked at by a court,” she said. “The star of a film is a king for me. [But] what is sacred is when you create, when you act, and he is no longer sacred … Now the power lies elsewhere.”Meanwhile, freelance workers at the festival staged a small protest at the opening ceremony for the second consecutive year.With the backing of union collective Sous les écrans la dèche, the workers – who include drivers and projectionists – said they sought to restart negotiations over unemployment insurance regulations which would better protect their livelihoods.TheCannes film festivalruns until 24 May.Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalRobert De NiroDonald TrumpFestivalsLeonardo DiCaprioTrump tariffsGérard DepardieunewsShareReuse this content"

But imports from China face a 30% levy and most other US imports still face a 10% levy. Consumers appear to be bracing themselves for higher prices.Consumersentimentdropped sharply in April, measured by the University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers, and expectations of inflation rose to 6.5%, the highest it has been since 1981.A new Harris/Guardianpollpublished on Monday found six out of 10 Americans said they have had to hold off on a major financial goal because of the current economy, an indicator of widespread economic anxiety.It is unclear how long this pessimism will last. Wall Street rose sharply on Monday after the announcement of a 90-day pause in Trump’s tariff dispute with China. But stock markets have been more reactive to changes to Trump’s tariff policies than consumers.Economists also expect price increases to get worse this year. Many companies have not had to increase prices yet, as many of the goods being sold now were imported before the new tariffs were implemented.“There isn’t a lot of evidence of tariffs boosting the CPI in April, but this shouldn’t be surprising as it takes time,” said Ryan Sweet, chief US economist at OxfordEconomics, in a statement.Sweet noted that even though tariff rates have been reduced, rates against China are still high. “The overall US effective tariff rate [for China] is still among the highest since the 1930s, and that will be inflationary,” he said.Though the pace of inflation has slowed, officials at theFederal Reservesaid they expect tariffs to have an impact on prices, even if only temporary.“Certainly the risks to higher inflation [and] higher unemployment have increased,” the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, said at a press conference last week, adding that tariffs could delay inflation from reaching the Fed’s target rate of 2% by at least a year. “We would, at least for the next, say, year, not be making progress toward those goals if that’s the way tariffs shake out.”This is contrary to what Trump has been saying about tariffs and the impact they have had on prices. Trump insists that any inflation is a holdover from the Biden administration, though Trump has been in the White House for over three months.“DRUG PRICES TO BE CUT BY 59%, PLUS!” Trump wrote on social media on Monday. “Gasoline, Energy, Groceries, and all other costs, DOWN. NO INFLATION!!!”This article was amended on 13 May 2025. Core inflation hit an annual rate of 2.8% in April, not 2.3% as an earlier version stated.Explore more on these topicsInflationFederal ReserveTrump tariffsTariffsDonald TrumpEconomicsUS economynewsShareReuse this content"

He will remain chairman of the company’s board. Witty will serve as a senior adviser to Hemsley.It has been a punishing period for UnitedHealth, starting in December when executive Brian Thompson wastargeted outside of a New York City hotel and killed. While unrelated to the financial operations of the $340bn healthcare giant, its shares have tumbled severely since the attack.“I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during an early Tuesday conference call.“Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency.”The 60-year-old Witty joined the company in 2018 after serving about nine years as CEO of the British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline. He was named UnitedHealth’s CEO in February 2021, replacing Dave Wichmann.UnitedHealth became one of the nation’s largest companies under Witty’s leadership. Total revenue topped $400bn last year, a 55% increase from the $257bn UnitedHealth brought in the year before Witty became CEO.Shares of UnitedHealth rocketed higher under Witty, too, up 60.5% since he took the company’s top job.Yet there have been several setbacks for UnitedHealth over the past five months as it wrestles with thenational attention on Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on a federal murder charge in the killing of Thompson.UnitedHealth Group resists shareholder proposal on delayed and denied careRead moreThe case has captured the American imagination, setting off a cascade of resentment and online vitriol toward US health insurers while rattling corporate executives concerned about security.UnitedHealth cut its 2025 forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in more than a decade. On Tuesday the company withdrew that financial forecast entirely, saying that medical costs from new Medicare Advantage members were higher than expected.Shares of UnitedHealth, which have plummeted 38% since the deadly 4 December ambush of Thompson in midtown Manhattan, fell more than 12% at the opening bell.More than 50 million people have health insurance under UnitedHealth Group Inc. It also has a large pharmacy benefit manager that runs prescription drug coverage and a growing Optum segment that delivers care and provides technical support.UnitedHealthcare is the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with more than 8 million customers. Those are privately run versions of the federal government coverage program mostly for people ages 65 and older.Explore more on these topicsUS healthcareMinnesotanewsShareReuse this content"

Microsoft has exceeded Wall Street’s earnings estimates for the past four quarters in a row.The company’s chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said on an April earnings call that the company was focused on “building high-performing teams and increasing our agility by reducing layers with fewer managers”. She also said the headcount in March was 2% higher than a year earlier, and down slightly compared with the end of last year.Explore more on these topicsMicrosoftJob lossesnewsShareReuse this content"

It was the culmination of Trump’sweekslong promotion of the contest, which has drawn allegations that he is using his position to enrich his family business while opening himself up to foreign influence.The cryptocurrency, called $TRUMP, was created in mid-January and boasts a market capitalization of over $2bn after months of investors buying into the heavily promoted coin. A Trump family-linked company and another firm own a majority of the coins,according to Reuters.Critics slam deregulation of crypto as Trump family expands its footprint in industryRead more“Congratulations, if you’re in the top 220 on the leaderboard we will be contacting you in the next 24 hours. Check your inbox (and spam folder) and expect a phone call for the Trump Official Dinner invitation and details,” the $TRUMP website announced mid-day on Monday. “President Trump will see YOU on May 22 at the Gala Dinner in Washington D.C.”Trump’s crypto enterprise has drawn criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and even the Securities and Exchange Commission overpotential conflicts of interestand allegations of corruption. The contest to dine with the president has intensified those concerns, as it has created what is essentially a bidding war for direct access to the president.The dinner is being held at Trump National golf club in Virginia and will also include “an ultra-exclusive VIP reception with the president” for the top 25 holders of the coin. The rules listed on the coin’s website suggest that the person who bought the coin can also send someone else instead of themselves, stating that if the buyer cannot attend they are able to list the name of a family member or friend to go in their place.Although the coin’s buyer leaderboard is public, it does not explicitly list the names of the winners. The site instead lists only the usernames and cryptocurrency wallet numbers of the buyers, which has led to speculation about who is vying for a place at the dinner and what political or financial interests they may harbor.Many of the top $TRUMP holders used foreign cryptocurrency exchanges that ban US users from purchasing the coins,according to Bloomberg’s analysis of the crypto wallets. Democrats and government ethics groups have alleged that thememe coincould allow foreign entities to purchase influence with the president, with Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut senator, opening an ethics inquiry into Trump’s cryptocurrency activities.“$TRUMP allows, and even invites, anyone in the world, including foreign governments and unscrupulous individuals, to directly enrich the President, while hiding potential payoffs in the pseudonymity of the blockchain,” Blumenthal wrote in a letter last week to Bill Zanker, who is named on the papers of incorporation for the Fight Fight Fight LLC sponsoring the coin.How Trump’s love for crypto threatens US residents’ peace: ‘I just want quiet’Read moreThe White House has claimed that the auction, which Trump has personally promoted on his Truth Social platform, will not influence the president’s policy choices. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters last week that Trump is “abiding by all conflict of interest laws” through his cryptocurrency endeavors.The price of the $TRUMP coin has fluctuated wildly since it debuted on 17 January. It initially rose to around $75 a coin before plummeting downward in the following weeks and then hovering around $12 at the time of the auction’s end. About 750,000 buyers have lost money trading the coin, while the biggest buyerscollectively spent millionsto reach the top of the leaderboard.“This is a high-security, high-status event with President Trump,” the coin’s website states. “If you earned a seat at the table, it’s becauseyouearned it.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

China also removed a ban on airlines taking delivery of Boeing planes, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday.Donald Trump hailed the talks as a“total reset”of the bilateral relationship but China’s responses made it clear that Beijing was still angry, and still blamed the US forwreaking economic chaos.Meeting Latin American leaders in Beijing on Tuesday, Xi said there were “no winners in tariff wars or trade wars”.“Bullying and hegemony will only lead to self-isolation,” he added, in reference to the US.On Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry continued to condemn the “unreasonable” tariffs, urging the US to “stop smearing and shifting blame” for its fentanyl crisis on to China.The imbalance of 10% and 30% under the agreement is because the US is keeping a 20% tariff linked to accusations that China turns a blind eye to exports of chemicals used to make fentanyl, which Beijing denies.Chinese officials have repeatedly said Beijing opposes all tariffs and does not want to enter into a mutually destructive trade war but is willing to “fight to the end”.An English-languageeditorialpublished across state media titles on Tuesday said the talks marked “a crucial step toward resolving differences”. It said China’s approach had been consistent and constructive, and it welcomed the US’s “willingness to engage in that process”.“While we are glad to see the resumption of dialogue, we are also fully prepared for the long-term, complex and arduous nature of resolving differences between the two countries,” it said.The tariff war has had anextraordinary impacton Chinese traders and manufacturers, with shipments grinding to a halt and an estimated16m jobs at risk.China now joins dozens of other countries in waiting to see if it can reach an agreement with the US not to restart crushing tariffs. On Monday, China’s commerce and finance ministries held discussions with foreign trade representatives about navigating the next three months and weathering the shocks of the tariffs.Ms Bao, an assistant to the general manager of a Ningbo foreign trade company, said 30% of their export volume went to the US, and they were feeling cautiously optimistic about the 90-day pause.“It’s hard to say what will happen after 90 days because we don’t know,” Bao told the Guardian. “There may be an increase in the volume of good shipping now because everyone may want to rush to ship the goods before [the end of the 90 days].”The Chinese business media outlet Caixinreportedthat some companies had already shifted their focus away from the US to domestic or other Asian markets instead.On Chinese social media, where discussion of the agreement received more than half a billion engagements, views were split.Hu Xijin, a former editor of the nationalist Chinese tabloid the Global Times, described the agreement as a “great victory for China in upholding the principles of equality and mutual respect”.One reader commenting on the Paper’s report said: “Persistence is victory!”Others were more sarcastic about the “victory”. “Oh, did we win again?” said one person on Weibo. “The stock indexes react like we just lose.”On Xiaohongshu, China’s Instagram, a user likened the pause to “changing the ventilator … on a dying patient”. “He can breathe, but he’s still far from being able to walk briskly,” they wrote.Other commenters compared the US to the boy who cried wolf and hoped that it wouldn’t “break its promises again and again”. One said: “Economically speaking, this is sort of a ceasefire.”Additional research by Lillian Yang and Jason Tzu Kuan LuExplore more on these topicsChinaTrump tariffsTariffsInternational tradeGlobal economyAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The decision will affect staff and contractor jobs across manufacturing, sales and administration, as well as research and development.Nissan did not say which factories were due to shut. However, its factory at Sunderland in north-east England, the carmaker’s only factory in Europe and where it employs 6,000 people, is not thought to be a likely candidate for closure.Thames Water CEO says crisis ‘decades in the making’; Goldman Sachs cuts US recession odds – business liveRead moreThe shake-up will reduce the number of its factories from 17 to 10 by 2027, andaim to save a total of 500bn yen(£2.6bn). Nissan will also overhaul its supply chain to source more parts from fewer suppliers to save money.The company’s new chief executive, Ivan Espinosa, faces the difficult task of turning around a carmaker whose once-mighty brand value has been eroded. The company will be focusing on profitability rather than volume, he told a press conference.“In the face of challenging full-year 2024 performance and rising variable costs compounded by an uncertain environment, we must prioritise self-improvement with greater urgency and speed, aiming for profitability that relies less on volume,” he said.“As new management, we are taking a prudent approach to reassess our targets and actively seek every possible opportunity to implement and ensure a robust recovery.”Nissan made a 671bn yen (£3.4bn) net loss in the year to the end of March, as it was hit by weakening sales in the US and China, plus the early effects of Donald Trump’s trade war.

But the subject on many minds in the city’s jewelry district was not diamonds but gold.Covid, Ukraine and now Donald Trump’s trade wars have all sparked new interest in gold – which can trace its history as a currency back to600BC.On West 47th Street, gold trader Becky Algozhoeva at GT Findings was showing coins and ingots stamped with the Roman goddess Fortuna, also known as “Lady Fortuna”, to customers.“Regular people are thinking gold is the key. They don’t even believe in banks any more because the economics are shaky, and they don’t even want to invest in institutions. They want to have it under their pillow. And gold doesn’t go bad. It’s not milk, right?”The price of gold is up more than 20% since Trump’s election in November,and 95% over the past five years.Gold prices have declined from the record of $3,500 an ounce set last month, partly on expectations that Trump will further dial down trade tensions. But gold bugs love uncertainty and it seems likely there is more of that to come.Every mention of gold by government officials, in the media, on Instagram and TikTok, was contributing to it coming back as “the only currency that is recognized universally”, said Algozhoeva.Over the first few months of the year, US demand has grown so great that traders started sending 400-ounce gold bars from London vaults to Switzerland, where they were converted into kilo bars and sent to the US in the hold of commercial airliners, four tons at a time.“It’s been unprecedented,” says Philip Newman, managing director of the precious metals consultancy Metals Focus. “We saw some rise during Covid but this has been more structural and long-lasting.”As a result, US gold inventories have doubled, with more than 20m ounces, or roughly 600 tons, being transported into vaults in New York City. In February, JPMorgan alone said it planned to deliver $4bn of gold to the US, according to filings on the US Comex exchange.After last month’sdisappointingUS economic growth numbers, some economists said that an unusually large amount of non-monetary gold – bullion, gold coins, unwrought gold, semi-manufactured gold and gold scrap – had accounted for some of the jump in imports.View image in fullscreenGold is displayed in a store window in the jewelry district in Manhattan on 29 April. Consumers are buying less jewelry but more bars and coins.Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesSince the beginning of April, when it became clear that the US would not tariff gold and silver, the market has quieted down. But there’s no sense that it will remain so. “There’s uncertainty over what Trump will do tomorrow, and that uncertainty is ongoing,” Newman says.The gold rush of 2024 may be more deep-seated than an attempt to offset Trump’s US-led trade war and concerns about the global economy and rising debt levels. Central banks have been buying gold to diversify assets since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 at double the annual rate – 1,000 tons a year – over the previous decade.In the final quarter of 2024, when Trump won the US election, central bank purchases accelerated 54% year-on-year to 333 tons, according to an estimate from the WorldGoldCouncil (WGC).Michael Widmer, a commodity strategist with Bank of America, told Reuters that central banks should increase their reserves by 11,000 tons of gold. “Emerging market central banks currently hold around 10% of their assets in gold,” he said. “They should really hold 30% of their assets in gold.”At the same time, it’s not only central and commercial banks that are buying more gold.Consumers purchased 13% less gold jewelry but increased purchases of bars and coins in 2024 by 3% to 325 tons.Overall. The first quarter of 2025 was the second-strongest on record for global gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) inflows, according to the WSG, as investors poured $21bn into the gold-owning investment vehicles in the first three months of the year.Earlier this month, Wells Fargo estimated that the retailer Costco was making $100m to $200m a month byselling gold bars. The company began selling 1-ounce bars made of nearly pure 24-karat gold priced at about $2,000 last year. In October, Costco’s chief financial officer, Richard Galanti, told investors, “they’re typically gone within a few hours.”Despite the recent drop in gold prices, many see no immediate end to gold fever. Deutsche bank expects bullionto hit $3,700 an ounceby next year, and the billionaire investor John Paulson told Reuters that central bank gold buying and global trade tensions were likely to push bullion prices to near $5,000 an ounce by 2028.Paulson’s fund, Paulson & Co, is reported to have earned $3.7bn on a 2007 bet the subprime mortgage boom would end in collapse, as it did. Paulson & Co is already the largest shareholder in Idaho’s Perpetua goldmine and earlier this month bought an $800m, or 40%, stake in NovaGold’sDonlin gold projectin Alaska from Barrick.“As central banks and people look to put their money in a more stable source … I think gold will increase its position in the world,” Paulson told Reuters. He said western confiscation of Russia’s foreign reserve holdings after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine was a catalyst for the world’s central banks – especially China’s – to pile into gold.Gold has surged amid economic uncertainty. Should you buy some?Read more“When the war started, [Russia] kept their physical gold, that was safe, but all their cash – the paper reserves – were confiscated,” Paulson said. “So that caused other central banks to wake up and say … ‘What happens if there’s a conflict with the US? Could the US keep our treasuries, and all our savings would disappear?’”But gold fever, with the metal’s long historical record as a desirable asset goes beyond Costco survivalists, central banks and money managers.“It’s the only thing you can trust, right?” ventured Konstantin “Gino” Popolis, a manager at Green Diamond buyers. “It’s the only thing that can prove you have assets. Nothing else. There’s no more digital, no AI, no bubbles, no shortages. With gold, you have the proof.”Explore more on these topicsGoldCommoditiesNew YorkfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, it added that demanding a specific percentage reduction in emissions was not realistic.Instead, the group has called for a ban on Shell’s new oil and gas fields rather than setting an emissions target.“We simply cannot sit back and wait while Shell continues on its fossil path. Shell remains fully committed to new oil and gas fields, despite warnings from scientists that this will have disastrous consequences. Now is the critical moment to curb the climate crisis,” Pol said.A spokesperson for Shell confirmed that it had received the letter but stressed that no lawsuit has been filed.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As the world continues to use oil and gas to heat homes and to transport goods and people, the transition needs collaboration between governments, businesses and consumers. By working together, with effective government policies, the world can move to low-carbon products and maintain a secure supply of affordable energy,” the spokesperson added.The lawsuit is the latest legal row between Shell and climate campaigners after the oil companysettled a $2.1m (£1.6m) lawsuitagainst Greenpeace after its campaigners boarded an oil rig as part of a peaceful protest last year.Shell in 2023 successfully quashed a lawsuit broughtby the environmental law charity ClientEarthwhen the high court in London refused permission to bring a case against the energy company.Explore more on these topicsShellOil and gas companiesEnergy industryOilGasNetherlandsEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The decision clears the path for the sport’s all-time hits leader and the storied Chicago White Sox star to be considered for the Hall of Fame.Manfred ruled that MLB’s punishment of banned individuals ends upon their death. “Obviously, a person no longer with us cannot represent a threat to the integrity of the game,” Manfred wrote in a letter to attorney Jeffrey M Lenkov, who petitioned for Rose’s removal in January.Say it ain’t so, Joe! How 1919 informs America’s entire worldview on gamblingRead moreESPNwas first to reportthe news of the commissioner’s historic decision.Rose accepted his ban in 1989 after an MLB investigation found he bet on games while managing the Cincinnati Reds. Jackson and seven other White Sox players were banned for life in 1921for allegedly fixing the 1919 World Series. Rosedied in Septemberat age 83; Jackson passed away in 1951.The ruling also removes 16 other deceased players and one deceased owner from MLB’s banned list, including Jackson’s former teammates Eddie Cicotte and George ‘Buck’ Weaver.Rose and Jackson are now eligible for the Hall of Fame, with their cases expected to be reviewed by the ClassicBaseballEra Committee in December 2027. Both would need 12 of 16 votes for induction, meaning the earliest possible enshrinement would be summer 2028.Lenkov, who led the petition for Rose’s reinstatement, called the decision “a long journey”. He plans to meet with Hall of Fame officials to discuss Rose’s candidacy. “Reds Nation will not only be able to celebrate Pete’s legacy, but now optimistically be able to look forward to the possibility that Pete will join other baseball immortals,” Lenkov said.The decision has sparked debate. John Dowd, who led MLB’s original investigation into Rose, criticized the move, saying the ban’s significance should not be erased after death. “There’s no difference with him being dead – it’s about behavior, conduct, and reputation,” Dowd told ESPN.Rose’s career remains unmatched, with 4,256 hits, three World Series titles, and a .303 lifetime batting average. Jackson, despite his involvement in the 1919 scandal, finished with a career .356 average – the fourth highest in MLB history.Rose and Jackson’s eligibility for Cooperstown now rests with Hall of Fame voters, reigniting debates about integrity, redemption, and legacy in America’s pastime.Explore more on these topicsMLBCincinnati RedsBaseballUS sportsChicago White SoxnewsShareReuse this content"

Tatum was in clear pain after the injury and was later seen with his head in his hands as he was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair.The injury puts both the hopes of the Celtics defending their title and Tatum’s playing status for next season in doubt. When Kevin Durant tore his achilles during the 2019NBAfinals, he went on to miss the entire 2019-2020 season.The 27-year-old Tatum was leading the Celtics in points (28.1), rebounds (11.5) and assists (5.4) per game for the second straight postseason before his injury.The Knicks lead the Celtics 3-1 in their Eastern Conference semi-finals series. Game 5 is in Boston on Wednesday night.The Mavs’ Cooper Flagg lottery miracle fuels conspiracy theories – and hopeRead moreNow, Tatum’s teammates will face a daunting task that few teams before them have pulled off if they want to break an NBA record six-season drought without a repeat champion. Teams holding a 3-1 lead in the NBA playoffs have gone on to win 95.6% of the time, with only 13 teams in 293 tries ever coming back from the deficit to win the series.“Obviously, we all realize in our heads what this could mean. This part of the sport – it’s tough,” Celtics center Kristaps Porzingis said on Monday. “We have to move forward. He don’t want us to be over here sad and not play our best basketball.”To become just the 14th team to overcome a 3-1 deficit, the Celtics will need big performances from a roster that has several players who have dealt with injuries this postseason. All-Star Jaylen Brown entered the playoffs dealing with a knee issue that has slowed him at times. Porzingis also has been affected by the lingering effects of a viral illness.Regardless of how this series or the rest of the playoffs play out for Boston, Tatum’s injury will alter how the franchise confronts this coming offseason.Including this year, the Celtics’ payroll will be over the salary cap and make them a luxury-tax team for the third straight season. That means they will be hit with the “repeater tax” for being over the cap threshold in three out of our seasons.Their current payroll for next season is on track to come in around $225m, which would mean a tax bill next year of almost $280m. The combined potential $500m total price tag would be a league record. It is unclear whether the team’s incoming new ownership will want to keep paying those hefty taxes to maintain the current rosterafter agreeing to a purchase in Marchthat is expected to have a final price of a minimum of $6.1bn.Tatum signed an NBA-record five-year, $314m contract last July that will begin next season. Brown is playing under a five-year, $304m deal that kicked in this season. That means that trimming player salary is a possibility ownership could explore this summer. And with Tatum possibly missing all of next season, it could accelerate the front office’s timeline for reworking the current roster with an eye toward the future.Other notable athletes who have come back from a torn achilles tendonAaron Rodgers.The four-time NFL MVP tore his achilles tendon in September 2023, four snaps into his first year with the New York Jets. Rodgers, 39 at the time, returned to practice in an astonishing 77 days after surgery but did not play again until September 2024. The Jets released him in March, and he is undecided on playing in 2025.Kobe Bryant.The late Hall of Famer tore his achilles in April 2013 had surgery the next day and returned to the court with the Los Angeles Lakers in December that year, at age 35. Bryant played only six games before a knee injury forced him to miss the rest of the season. Bryant averaged 22.3 points in only 35 games in 2014-15 and 17.6 points in 66 games in his last season in 2015-16.Kevin Durant.The two-time NBA finals MVP tore an achilles tendon in June 2019. He missed a full season and came back with the Brooklyn Nets in December 2020, at age 32. Durant hasn’t played more than 55 games in any season since his return but he’s been elite, averaging 28.8 points, 7.1 rebounds and 5.7 assists in three seasons since the injury.Dominique Wilkins.The Hall of Famer tore an achilles tendon in January 1992. He returned to the court with the Atlanta Hawks that November, just two months shy of turning 33. Wilkins averaged 29.9 points in his first season back and played seven more years, including two stints overseas.Explore more on these topicsBoston CelticsNBANew York KnicksBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The league did not specify when that meeting would take place.Trump says ‘we just want to be friends’ as Canada PM torpedoes 51st state ideaRead moreThe offending messages were part of a back-and-forth on X with a user identified as “Dr Grizzo”. The exchange, which began with comments about the ongoing playoff series between the Maple Leafs and Panthers, quickly shifted to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. Cifu’s account prominently displayed five Israeli flags in his bio, alongside the statement “all tweets mine”.Tensions escalated after Dr Grizzo wrote: “Hey, what’s worse, using headshots to win a series or using starvation as a weapon to win a war?” – an apparent reference to accusations of high hits by Florida players in the series and the broader geopolitical conflict.Cifu responded sharply: “Actually being a whiny dope anti-semite is clearly worse. Loser.”The exchange grew more heated after Dr Grizzo replied: “Not approving of using starvation as a weapon makes me a bigot?” He added further comments about Cifu’s stock market success and political affiliations.That prompted Cifu to fire back with: “Eat shit 51st state anti-semite loser. Israel now and forever. Until ever [sic] last Hamas rat is eliminated.” His remarks referencedDonald Trump’s recent suggestionthat Canada could be the “51st state”, a comment that had drawn widespread debate.Cifu’s account was made private shortly after the incident and was deactivated entirely by Monday. The NHL acted swiftly, announcing its decision in a statement: “The NHL has concluded that Mr Cifu’s X posts were unacceptable and inappropriate. As a result, Mr Cifu has been suspended indefinitely from any involvement with the Club and the NHL.”TheFlorida Panthersdid not release a statement of their own, instead pointing to an apology Cifu gave to Florida Hockey Now on Tuesday. “Two days ago, I posted regrettable and inflammatory comments on social media,” Cifu said. “My behavior does not reflect the standards of the Florida Panthers organization and the Viola family. I sincerely apologize to all those affected by my comments. I am committed to working with the NHL to amend my actions.”Cifu is the CEO of Virtu Financial, a financial technology services company he co-founded with Panthers owner and chairman Vincent Viola in 2008. His name was engraved on the Stanley Cup after the Panthers won their first championship in 2024.The Maple Leafs and Panthers are currently tied 2-2 in their best-of-seven Eastern Conference semi-final series, which has been marked by physical play and controversy over hits, including a collision in Game 1 that forced Toronto goalie Anthony Stolarz to exit the series. Game 5 is scheduled for Wednesday night in Toronto.Explore more on these topicsNHLFlorida PanthersUS sportsToronto Maple LeafsShareReuse this content"

Torre cited 11 sources, including two who claimed Hudson was specifically told she was “no longer allowed in the football building”. UNC later denied those reports andBelichick told ESPN on Tuesdaythat he had spoken to his players about the issue.Bill Belichick’s relationship with Jordon Hudson is one narrative he can’t controlRead more“Really off to the side,” Belichick told ESPN. “It’s a personal relationship, and she doesn’t have anything to do with football.”Hudson has been a prominent figure around Belichick since his arrival at UNC last December. The six-time Super Bowl-winning coach took over the Tar Heels’ program on a $10m annual salary, making him the highest-paid public employee in North Carolina. Hudson’s influence on Belichick’s media presence was thrust into the spotlight during an April interview with CBS Sunday Morning. While promoting his new book, Belichick was asked about how he and Hudson met. Hudson, off-camera, interjected, saying, “We’re not talking about that.”On Tuesday, UNC athletic director Bubba Cunningham again said the school had no issues with Belichick or Hudson.“Bill’s been great to work with,” Cunningham said. “He talked about practicing like a pro and he runs a professional organization that is teaching students how to be professional in all aspects of their life. He is a very determined, professional individual, and that’s the way he carries himself and the way he conducts the program.”Belichick was in attendance at last weekend’s Miss Maine pageant, where Hudson finished as a runner-up. He said that he does not believe such storylines are a distraction for his players.“I talked to the players when we meet with them,” Belichick said. “We want to make the players the best they can be and giving them the best opportunity on and off the field.”Belichick was known for his ruthlessly focused approach during his long reign with the New England Patriots. He said he hoped to bring a similar philosophy to UNC.“Everything we do is a pro model,” Belichick said. “Head coach, general manager, and we want the players to develop professionally in every aspect.”Explore more on these topicsCollege footballCollege sportsUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a semi‑final at home, a goal up – I think we were caught between two attitudes. Once they scored, then we felt we had to score.“We had a list [of penalty takers] but the corner kick was fantastic for Ballard. They deserve it, and now we have a fantastic final to play. [Ballard] is a strong man at the back, really important for us. Tonight, we’ll enjoy it and switch on for the final very soon.”Le Bris is not a manager to neglect homework and, sure enough, his Coventry studies prompted the decision to shift the Stadium of Light’s perimeter advertising hoardings forward, moving them two metres closer to the pitch. The idea was to reduce the threat posed by Milan van Ewijk from long throws, by restricting the right-back’s room for manoeuvre – and it duly did.Add in reports that, at the end of an unusually warm May day on Wearside, the remote‑controlled heating in the away dressing room had been turned up to the maximum temperature and it was quite the welcome for Lampard’s players. As if that was not sufficient Coventry emerged from the tunnel to be greeted by a giant Sunderland fans’ banner depicting a black cat with terrifying claws, sharply bared teeth and chillingly ferocious eyes.View image in fullscreenEphron Mason-Clark scores for Coventry to force extra time.Photograph: Steve Welsh/PALe Bris’s Black Cats may not have been quite that formidable in the first leg but they left the Midlandsholding a precious 2-1 lead. Le Bris stuck to the 4-4-2 formation that had ruined Lampard’s night here but, although the former Lorient manager and long serving youth coach had suggested that, rather than repeat last Friday’s low block, his team would be “proactive” and in front foot, high pressing mode, this version was self destructively cautious.Yet if Lampard’s much admired attacking midfielder Jack Rudoni always looked capable of hurting his hosts, Sunderland could not be underestimated on the break. Tellingly, Coventry’s centre-halves at times struggled in the face of Eliezer Mayenda’s quick, clever feet and, midway through the first half, Ben Wilson, the Sunderland academy graduate turned Coventry goalkeeper, saved smartly from Wilson Isidor’s young attacking partner.Such cameos apart, though, Le Bris’s players looked in increasing peril of falling into the trap of retreating too deep and inviting the sort of pressure that eventually tends to prompt defensive mistakes. Not to mention silencing a previously raucous full house at the Stadium of Light.Tellingly Rudoni might have levelled the aggregate scores but his shot flew off target as he collided with the home goalkeeper Anthony Patterson, after arriving late, and Lampard-esque, into the box.Coventry have scored more goals from crosses and more headers than any other side in the EFL or Premier League this season and, as the interval beckoned, it was no surprise when Rudoni went close with a header from Jay Dasilva’s cross.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As Sunderland’s manager paced the technical area nervously, locals were tempted to watch Coventry continue to dominate through their fingers.Le Bris’s circumspect gameplan had failed and now he introduced the recently hamstrung winger Romaine Mundle from the bench, moved Le Fée into his preferred central role and a suddenly fluent Sunderland improved immeasurably. That tactical reshuffle may have been belated but it emphasised that the Breton’s days of anonymity are well and truly over.It took a fantastic block from Josh Eccles to keep a Mundle shot out before Le Fée’s execution and Ballard’s six-yard header off the underside of the bar, left Lampard looking as devastated as he ever did after assorted disappointments at major tournaments in an England shirt.“Congratulations to Sunderland, but I’m so proud of my players,” Lampard said. “I think we dominated at home, dominated large spells of this game tonight … from 17th in the league, how far this team has come, competing with the top teams in this division.“We’re not bitter, but we were the better team over the two matches. I’m so disappointed for the players, the fans, the club … but I can’t be disappointed with the performance tonight. We took control, but in extra time it became more of a coin-toss.

Sunday’s game against relegated Southampton will mark Goodison’s last Premier League fixture.David Squires on … the many memories of Everton’s Goodison ParkRead moreBut in a shock move that has delighted fans the club’s new American owners have announced that the historic ground will become the new long-term home of the women’s team in a bid to make the ground “one of the most distinctive homes in European women’s football”.The move would provide “a blueprint for how clubs can build the future of women’s football”, said Nikki Doucet, the CEO of Women’s Super League Football. “Establishing Goodison Park as a purpose-driven home for the women’s team sends a powerful signal – not just about ambition, but about belief,” she said. “Belief in the players, the fans, and in what the women’s game can become when given the stage it deserves.”Everton Women are currently in eighth position in the WSL, but sources said the move was a “statement of intent” of the new owners’ ambitions for the women’s team. The Friedkin Group, owned by the Texas billionaire Dan Friedkin,bought Everton in December last year, bringing the turbulent era of Farhad Moshiri to an end.After the group took over AS Roma in 2020, the women’s team came fifth in the 2020-21 season and took their first major trophy, winning the 2021Coppa Italia. They won their firstSerie Atitle in 2023, and secured the domestic double in 2024.View image in fullscreenEverton Women at Goodison in March 2023.Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images/Reuters“It shows just how committed they are to backing the women’s team and making Everton a force at the very top of the women’s game in this country,” said Julie Makin, secretary of the Everton Women Supporters’ Club.Everton Women’s tenure at Goodison Park comes 105 years after the ground hosted a landmark women’s match between Dick, Kerr Ladies and St Helens Ladies, which held the attendance record for a women’s game for 103 years. “Evertonians have a saying of ‘If you know your history’, that is why it is deeply meaningful that the very same ground that held the record attendance for a women’s fixture for so many years will now become home to Everton Women,” said Richie Gillham, secretary of the Everton FC Heritage Society.Sources at the club said Everton Women’s move from Walton Hall Park, which has a capacity of just 2,220, was seen as an financial opportunity for the club to increase attendances at women’s games. The WSL is expected to attract 1 million fans for the first time this season, with attendances doubling in the last two seasons. With more than half of those attending games under 40, the club hopes to build lifelong loyalty at a venue which already has a significant sentimental draw. “This move is a testament to where the women’s game is right now and, more importantly, where it is heading,” said Everton Women’s captain, Megan Finnigan.A feasibility study commissioned by The Freidkin Group last month confirmed that the ground would meet standards set by the WSL, but the Archibald Leitch-designed stadium is likely to change dramatically after its new custodians move in.View image in fullscreenAn aerial view of Goodison Park, soon to be home of Everton Women.Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images/Reuters“We know how treasured Goodison is, not only to every Evertonian, but to the game itself,” said Everton’s recently appointed CEO, Angus Kinnear. “We’re under no illusions – there are obstacles we need to overcome to make this a success, but we’re confident that we will overcome those challenges.”Everton will drastically reduce its 39,000 capacity – with upper tiers of the ground likely to be taken out of action after season ticket seats are sold off to fans at the end of this season. But there are no immediate plans to change its structure in the short term, according to the club which added that it was “planning targeted investments” to adapt the ground for the women’s game.It is understood that plans drawn up under the club’s previous owners, to bulldoze Goodison to make way for acommunity-focused regeneration projectwith housing, shops, a care home and healthcare facilities, have become less viable since they were first submitted in April 2020. But the club’s charitable armEverton in the Community, which runs outreach work in the mile radius of Goodison, will be based at the ground, with the charity developing plans to support the development of girls’ and women’s football more widely.“What we are looking to do with the women and girls strategy at Goodison Park is really exciting,” saidSue Gregory, the CEO of the charity. “But for our communities I think its important that when they come down the County Road they will still see Goodison and feel the presence of the club.”Explore more on these topicsEverton WomenWomen's footballEvertonLiverpoolMerseysidenewsShareReuse this content"

Multiple sources have told the Guardian that the club have been given a deadline to confirm by next week whether or not they wish to participate, or face demotion.Hemp, Greenwood and Stanway back in major Euros boost for EnglandRead moreThe situation is understood to have left the players and staff anxious, angry and feeling like they are in a state of limbo, while they await a formal decision.Some of the squad have posted their concerns on social media, with the Scotland youth international Murphy writing: “We, Blackburn Rovers women’s first team, were made aware there is a 99% chance that the club’s owners won’t be financially supporting the team next season.“Us players and staff deserve far better than what we’ve experienced in recent seasons. We’ve once again been left in the dark, waiting to see if the owners will have the decency to do what’s best for their players, staff and women’s football.”Simon Parker’s team finished 10th, second from bottom, in the women’s second tier this term, five points clear of danger, despite operating on what was understood on a comparatively low playing budget. The second tier – which was known previously as the Women’s Championship – was renamed on Monday as WSL 2.This summer, the minimum requirements to take part in the division are being increased in a bid to raise minimum standards for the players involved, to an extent whereby it is understood second-tier women’s clubs will now have to essentially operate a full‑time, professional operation.The list of criteria is believed to include requirements for clubs to commit to appointing the following staff within one month of next season starting: a head of women’s football, marketing manager, head coach, assistant coach, physiotherapist or sports therapist, doctor, a strength and conditioning coach, a goalkeeping coach and several people in specific safeguarding and player-welfare roles.Blackburn played all of their home women’s matches at Ewood Park this season and their former players include the England internationals Georgia Stanway, Ella Toone and Keira Walsh and have a proud history of developing young players.The league will be keen to avoid a repeat of the situation last summer when Reading withdrew from the second tier at the end of June – for financial reasons – at such a relatively late point in the summer that there was deemed to be insufficient time before pre-season to begin a process of promoting a replacement club, which led to the division including only 11 teams this season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This group has worked relentlessly hard all season for so little reward.”If they withdraw, Blackburn would not be the only club to decide not to fund a WSL 2 licence this summer, after third-tier Wolves did not submit a bid for promotion despite finishing second in their division. On Monday, the Wolves chairman, Jeff Shi, promised to apply next season instead.Explore more on these topicsWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

The Spaniards tried to sign the 20-year-old when he was a youth player at Málaga and have continued to track the former Juventus and Roma defender’s progress. Huijsen’s footballing idol is Sergio Ramos, the former Spain and Madrid defender.The question has always been whether Madrid wish to use a significant part of their transfer budget on signing Huijsen. They have looked to sign players on free transfers in recent years and are closing in on a deal for the Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold, whose contract expires this summer.But Madrid have endured an underwhelming season – the European champions exited the Champions League in the quarter-finals and are set to lose their La Liga crown to Barcelona – and are aware of the need to rebuild. Bayer Leverkusen’s Xabi Alonso is set to replace Carlo Ancelotti, who is taking over the Brazil national team, as manager.There remains a possibility that Madrid will decide not to pay the release clause, paving the way forChelseato complete a deal they have been working on behind the scenes. But a consideration for Madrid, who have had to deal with a host of defensive injuries this season, is that Huijsen will become more expensive if he joins a big English side this summer.Chelsea are looking for another centre-back and have alternative targets, including Ajax’s Jorrel Hato, Crystal Palace’s Marc Guéhi and Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite. Enzo Maresca has favoured Levi Colwill and Wesley Fofana in central defence but the French centre-back has struggled to stay fit.Fofana is out for the rest of the season while Axel Disasi, Trevoh Chalobah and Benoît Badiashile could be up for sale this summer.Explore more on these topicsTransfer windowReal MadridChelseanewsShareReuse this content"

The club have endured a horrible league campaign but the hierarchy feels the Portuguese deserves this summer transfer window to improve the squad and sign players better suited to his tactics.United are 16th in the Premier League, having lost 17 games, their worst performance since 1973-74. Amorim replaced Erik ten Hag in November but has failed to oversee an upturn in fortunes domestically, also being eliminated by Fulham in the FA Cup and Tottenham in the League Cup.The Europa League has offered some hope in a dismal season and United will qualify for the Champions League if they defeat Spurs in Bilbao next Wednesday. Amorim, however, cut a disconsolate figure on Sunday after Unitedlost 2-0 at home against West Ham, suggesting he could walk away if results do not improve.“I’m talking about myself, I’m talking about the culture in the club and the culture in the team,” he said. “We need to be really strong in the summer and be brave. We will not have a next season like this if we start like this. If the feeling is still here we should give space [his position] to different persons.”He added: “It’s mentally. We are not scared of losing a game as Manchester United. We don’t have that fear any more and that is the most dangerous thing that a big club can have.”Amorim has targetedWolves’ Matheus Cunhaand Ipswich’s Liam Delap in his rebuild. United, however, have to raise funds by selling players if they are to sign the duo. Cunha has a £62.5m release clause and Delap’s is £30m.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United have all been credited with an interest in the Swedish striker, who has scored 38 goals in the Portuguese top flight this season – 20 more than his nearest challenger. Sporting will be reluctant to lose their star but the former Brighton and Coventry player seems perfectly suited to the rigours ofPremier Leaguefootball. This summer might be the one when he leaves Lisbon.Benjamin Sesko, RB LeipzigSesko was linked with a move to Arsenal last summer, but opted to sign a new deal with RB Leipzig. The 21-year-old has enjoyed a fine campaign in Germany, scoring 13 goals and laying on five assists for an underperforming RB Leipzig side. His xG overperformance of 2.78 is among the biggest in theBundesliga. He has an eye for the incredible, so it’s no wonder he continues to crop up on Premier League radars.Hugo Ekitike, Eintracht FrankfurtSesko isn’t the only Bundesliga striker who could be joining one of the Premier League’s big hitters. Eintracht Frankfurt will not want to lose their two prized forwards in a matter of months,Omar Marmoush having left the club for Manchester City in January, but they will struggle to keep the young French forward. There are rough edges to the 22-year-old’s game – an xG underperformance of 6.80 is the highest in Germany’s top tier – but Ekitike has huge potential. His style is very similar to that of Alexander Isak; Ekitike could be a cost-effective alternative to the in-demand Swede.Diogo Costa, PortoThis season has been one to forget for Porto, who are 11 points off the pace going into the final week of the season. Even so, they boast one of the best defensive records in the division, having conceded just 30 goals in 33 games. Their goalkeeper deserves a lot of the credit. The Portuguese penalty-saving machine has kept more clean sheets (15) than any other goalkeeper in Portugal’s top tier this term. Costa has the best pass success rate for goalkeepers in the league (81.3%), so it’s easy to see why he has been linked with a move to Manchester City.View image in fullscreenDiogo Costa playing for Porto against Bodø/Glimt in the Europa League.Photograph: Mats Torbergsen/EPA-EFEJoan García, EspanyolGarcía, another goalkeeper, was wanted by Arsenal last summer but the deal never materialised. He has shone again this season, making more saves (135) than any other goalkeeper inLa Liga. Espanyol are 14th in the table and look likely to stay up; they would be as good as relegated were it not for his performances. Manchester United are reportedly keen on the 24-year-old, though so too are Aston Villa, Arsenal and Bournemouth.Jamie Gittens, Borussia DortmundGittens followed in Jadon Sancho’s footsteps, leaving Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund. He could be returning to England this summer. The 20-year-old has impressed this season, despite being in and out of the starting XI. Only Florian Wirtz (81) has completed more dribbles than the young winger (77) in the Bundesliga this season, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham reportedly monitoring his progress.Rodrygo, Real MadridIt looks increasingly likely that Real Madrid will sell Rodrygo this summer as they overhaul their squad and cash in on one of their most lucrative players following a disappointing season. The 24-year-old is no longer a guaranteed starter, with injuries and the signing of Kylian Mbappé restricting the Brazilian to just 22 league starts. Manchester City, who kickstarted their rebuild in January, have been linked with a move for Rodrygo, who still contributed six goals and five assists for Carlo Ancelotti’s side in La Liga this season.Rayan Cherki, LyonWith a rumoured release clause of just £25m, it’s no wonder there is a queue of suitors for Lyon winger Cherki. The Frenchman was a rumoured target for Borussia Dortmund in January, but he stayed in France. There is little chance the 21-year-old will be a Lyon player come the start of the new season,especially if they fail to qualify for Europe. Liverpool and Manchester United have been linked with the youngster. The versatile forward ranks top for accurate through balls (13), big chances created (21) and assists (10), and third for key passes (70), in Ligue 1 this season. Expect a scramble for his services.View image in fullscreenRayan Cherki scoring for Lyon against Manchester United.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersMartín Zubimendi, Real SociedadLiverpool tried to sign Zubimendi last summer but he decided to stay at Real Sociedad. In the end, it worked out well for Liverpool, with Ryan Gravenberch stepping up and excelling under Arne Slot. Zubimendi is still a wanted man in England, with Arsenal seemingly ready to sign the 26-year-old midfielder for €60m. Jorginho is expected to join Flamengo and Thomas Partey’s contract expires at the end of the season, so Mikel Arteta needs midfield reinforcements.Angelo Stiller, StuttgartLiverpool are expected to bring in another midfielder as they look to build on their title success. Stiller would be a cost-effective and tactically versatile alternative to Zubimendi. The 24-year-old has been a key player for Stuttgart in recent seasons, with his performances earning him a place in the national team. He signed a new contract with Stuttgart earlier this year, so Liverpool would have to spend big to secure the deal. But Stiller would ease the pressure on both Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister.This is an article byWhoScoredExplore more on these topicsTransfer windowGuardian Sport NetworkPremier LeagueLa LigaSerie ALigue 1BundesligaEuropean club footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Georgia is in training. What we hope is that she comes into camp and continues building with us and, hopefully, towards the Euros.WSL 2024-25 season review: our writers’ best and worstRead more“It’s important that she’s healthy, that she can handle training loads and recover from it, and then perform at that level. We have the time to see that [before the European Championship]. Hopefully we can build and see where she’s at. She needs to be performing at the highest level, at her highest level, to compete for a position, as with anyone else.”Hemp, Greenwood and Stanway sustained their injuries in November, December and January respectively. Hemp and Greenwood returned to action for Manchester City last month but Stanway is yet to play competitively since her treatment began.Wiegman has also given a senior call-up to the Tottenham full-back Ella Morris, bolstering her chances of a late surge into the tournament squad for the finals in July, and there is a place in the 27-player list for the Brighton striker Michelle Agyemang, on loan from Arsenal, who is rewarded for a superb goal moments into her senior international debut in England’s last match in April.Agyemang, 19, was a late injury replacement in the April squad midway through that camp but has done enough to impress Wiegman to be retained in the senior setup.The uncapped Aston Villa midfielder Missy Bo Kearns, a former captain of England Under-23s, has also been recalled by Wiegman. The England head coach has named her squad a week earlier than usual, before the home fixture at Wembley against Portugal on 30 May and the trip to face the world champions Spain on 3 June. It is the final time England will meet before Wiegman names her Euro 2025 squad in June.View image in fullscreenLauren James is not in the squad due to her hamstring injury.Photograph: Rhianna Chadwick/PAHowever, there is no place in the squad for the injured Chelsea forward Lauren James, who sustained a hamstring injury in thehome win against Belgiumin April. On the 23-year-old’s fitness, Wiegman said: “She can’t join us in the next camp but we’re trying to build [her fitness], together with club. She really, of course, as many other players, wants to go to the Euros, and hopefully we can get her fit and ready to go into it.“These three things are important: she needs to be healthy, she needs to be able to train and recover from training and then you can build a bit. She’s working really hard to get fit.“There’s also the fact that she performed really well and she developed so quickly and so well and really showed up for Chelsea and for us, I think. So I just want to give it a chance. She’s a special player who has moments in the game where she can be decisive.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The new event, which will include Manchester City and Manchester United, as well as Mary Earps’s Paris Saint-Germain side and Stanway’s Bayern Munich among the eight clubs taking part overall, involves 15-minute halves, played on a smaller pitch.Wiegman said: “It’s a seven-a-side, so it’s a different load, so of course they’re not going to overload themselves.

Trying to help address the issue, with the ultimate aim of reducing instances of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries, is a new, year-long academic study at Kingston University in London, which has received funding from football’s world governing body, Fifa.Starting in June, the university’s sports science experts Dr Simon Augustus, Dr James Brouner and Dr Michelle Richards, and the project’s lead, PhD student Blake Rivers, will analyse hormone concentrations from blood samples collected from 20 to 25 adult female players, aged between 18 and 35, and then examine how they perform specific movement tests at different stages of their individual menstrual cycles.‘Sexism is the risk factor’: football’s race to learn more about ACL injuriesRead more“We know the hormones fluctuate within those different phases of the menstrual cycle and some of them might be related to things like increased ligament laxity or decreases in neuromuscular control,” says Dr Augustus, senior lecturer in sport biomechanics.“What we want to do then is to correlate that with how they perform certain physical-performance tests so, in terms of being able to identify ACL injury risk, we do things like change-of-direction tests or a landing test, and really we want to see whether the changes we see in terms of physiology, in terms of the hormone profiles, whether they extend through to changes in their functional movement patterns and how they actually perform these various tasks which might be ones that are indicative of injury risk.”ACL injuries have been prominent in the sport for decades but the issue has been brought into sharp focus in recent years after a string of high-profile cases, such as when the former Ballon d’Or winner Alexia Putellastore her ACLon the eve of the last European Championship finals at a time when she was widely considered to be the world’s best women’s player, or when the England captain Leah Williamsonsuffered the same injuryand missed the 2023 World Cup. However, it is much more widespread than those headline cases: in the Women’s Super League alone, there are 14 players out with ACL injuries.Experts are not expecting to be able to completely eradicate the problem but the science will aim to help reduce the risk, as Dr Augustustold Moving the Goalposts: “There are going to be certain injury occurrences that are unavoidable, if you get a bad tackle, your leg is in the wrong position, no matter how much science we can do in terms of the research.“The ones we might have the potential to intervene with, and lower the rates of, are the ones that seem to happen when players are performing an action on their own, where there are no external forces, no external contact, so ones like when they are changing direction or landing from a header, when they seem to be slightly off-balance.“These are the ones where, if we can get a really good holistic understanding of the load-demands that are placed on the skeletal and muscular systems, and the various factors surrounding that, if we can really understand how those contribute to the loads placed on the player, then – whether via strength and conditioning, load-management or looking at players’ techniques as they develop up through the age groups – these are the ones that we might be able to intervene with and help prevent.”That said, there is not expected to be a one-size-fits-all model for how to mitigate hormonal changes during a player’s period. As Dr Augustus explains: “The important thing to say with this is it’s extremely variable within women. If you think about a menstrual cycle, the ‘average’, which probably doesn’t really exist, is 28-35 days, and we know that within naturally ovulating and menstruating women, there should be a certain profile, but even within that, there’s going to be a huge variation in terms of how those hormones are released within the individual.“That’s even before we start to think about the many different types of contraceptives that the athletes could be taking, and different contraceptives will do different things to those hormone profiles. So, again, what we’re really going to have to get to grips with is making sure we understand the individual profiles of the athletes we’re investigating, because that’s going to be key if we’re going to make meaningful conclusions.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jos Buttler, Jacob Bethell and Will Jacks, whose sides are towards the top of the table, could all find their allegiances tested, but the England and WalesCricketBoard is confident that at least the latter two will prioritise England’s first white‑ball games on home soil since Brendon McCullum took over as coach of the limited-over sides and Harry Brook as captain.It is not certain that all of the 10 English players who had been at the IPL before its suspension last week will choose to go back at all, and with some teams not playing again until next Wednesday there is still time for them to make up their minds. But Buttler is expected to arrive on Wednesday in the country and the ECB has promised to “facilitate players’ return should they choose to go back”.Two members of the West Indies squad play for teams that look likely to be involved in the playoffs, and while both the ECB and Cricket West Indies had agreed to let any players involved in the tournament stay in India for its duration, the new schedule has made that stance more difficult.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer has not been picked for the T20s against West Indies as England build him up for a return to Test cricket.Photograph: Akhtar Soomro/ReutersIn a statement the ECB said that No Objection Certificates, which must be issued by a player’s home association before they are allowed to play in a foreign league, had “been granted based on the original IPL dates” and that they would “need to review any potential extensions”.The new IPL dates also affect the preparations of the two World Test Championship finalists, with that title to be decided when South Africa and Australia meet at Lord’s, starting on 11 June.Quick GuideEngland squads to face West IndiesShowODI squad:Harry Brook (Yorkshire, captain), Jofra Archer (Sussex), Gus Atkinson (Surrey), Tom Banton (Somerset), Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Brydon Carse (Durham), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Tom Hartley (Lancashire), Will Jacks (Surrey), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Jamie Overton (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jamie Smith (Surrey).T20 squad:Harry Brook (Yorkshire, captain), Rehan Ahmed (Leicestershire), Tom Banton (Somerset), Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Brydon Carse (Durham), Liam Dawson (Hampshire), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Will Jacks (Surrey), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Jamie Overton (Surrey), Matthew Potts (Durham), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Phil Salt (Lancashire), Luke Wood (Lancashire).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.While Cricket Australia has said it would “support players in their individual decisions” and “work through preparation implications for the WTC final for those players who choose to play in the remaining IPL matches”, Cricket South Africa has indicated that it expects the eight members of its squad who are involved in the IPL to report for duty in England as planned on 31 May.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Phil Salt is named only in the T20 squad, while Liam Livingstone, who captained his country as recently as November, has been left out altogether.Explore more on these topicsEngland cricket teamCricketnewsShareReuse this content"

Mads Pedersen finished fourth to retain the maglia rosa.After thefirst three stages in Albaniaand a subsequent rest day, the Giro returned to Italy in Puglia, with a mostly flat 189-kilometre run from Alberobello to Lecce.Bradley Wiggins says he is ‘lucky to be here’ after revealing cocaine addictionRead moreFollowing an early break from the Spaniard Francisco Muñoz (Team Polti VisitMalta) there was a crash in the peloton with around 125km left, with Pedersen among those caught up as well as Tom Pidcock and Nickolas Zukowsky, both of Q36.5. The Canadian Zukowsky, making his debut in the event, was forced to abandon with a suspected fractured collarbone.As the teams looked to keep their sprinters in position in the closing metres, Van Uden timed his move to perfection – securing his first stage win since June 2024.“I didn’t do it alone – we did it with the whole team. All the boys here and all the staff here and in HQ as well. They did super work,” Van Uden said. “I didn’t have to do anything until 200m to go. I have a good sprint and went for it. We’ve done a really good job all season with the leadouts.“I knew I had to just follow Bram [Welten] and the boys – they did a super good job and I’m really happy to give them something back. I’m not surprised and I know all the boys have a lot of belief in me.”Van Uden’s victory also provides a massive boost to Picnic-PostNL’s hopes of remaining in the World Tour, with the Dutch team facing the prospect of relegation.In the general classification, Pedersen of Lidl-Trek is seven seconds ahead of Primoz Roglic (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe), with Mathias Vacek (Lidl-Trek) third, 14 seconds down. Stage five on Wednesday is a 151km route from Ceglie Messapica to Matera.Explore more on these topicsGiro d'ItaliaCyclingnewsShareReuse this content"

The PGA of America has reiterated its stance against the rollback of the golf ball, with its chief executive stating the organisation is “vehemently against” plans put forward by the sport’s rule-makers.The R&A and USGA announced in late 2023 that all professionals will be required to use amodified golf ball from 2028. The changes would apply to amateurs from 2030. It has long been the view of many that hitting distances for leading players have become problematic, an issue that renders many traditional courses obsolete in elite competition.Can watching sport really improve your wellbeing? The science suggests it can | Sean IngleRead moreThere is, however, an opposing view. The PGA Tour has never supported the rollback plan. The PGA of America, a close ally of the PGA Tour, is in the same camp. While theEuropean TourGroup has never formally expressed a view, it is likely it would stand alongside the PGA Tour. Equipment manufacturers have been firm in their opposition to the proposals.“There’s no change in our stance,” said Derek Sprague, the PGA of America’s chief executive. “We’re certainly vehemently against the ball rollback. We’ve had great conversations with the governing bodies. We’ve had several constructive and collaborative meetings probably a number of times, three, four times. I feel really good about where we are with them and we’re going to continue to collaborate on the proposed rollbacks.”Golf’s various organisations held talks on the subject at thePlayers Championship in March. The PGA of America was among those asking for a delay in the rollback so research numbers can be reassessed. Modifying drivers rather than golf balls is also an area that may be explored.“They’re clear where I stand, where we stand for sure,” Sprague said. “I talk really almost monthly now with the governing bodies and we’re working to really take a deep dive on the rollback and make sure it’s the right thing.“We’re really concerned about the 28 million golfers in this country. A number of people have reached out, a number of amateur golfers, recreational golfers have reached out and have the same concerns that we do. They’re thanking us for pushing this issue to make sure it’s well thought out, and if we can hit the pause button or change it altogether, that’s our goal.”Golf could do without another high‑profile dispute. The Saudi‑backedLIV tourhas created a schism in the men’s professional game. The R&A and USGA may agree to a new timetable to keep the peace. Martin Slumbers, a key proponent of the rollback, is no longer chief executive of the R&A.“We’re representing the 31,000 [professional golfers] that talk to the 28.1 million,” said Don Rea, the PGA of America president. “Now, whatever happens to this collaborative approach, it’s going to happen over the next six to eight years. I don’t know what’s going to happen, but I assure you, when this is all done, we’re going to stand arm in arm and say this is the decision, and this is where we’re moving forward. It might change from what it is now.

The Wave are majority owned by the Levine Leichtman family, who completed their $113m purchase of 100% of the club from former owner Ron Burkle at the end of the 2024 season. Since the new ownership took the reins, the club has undergone numerous changes. That includes the departure of club president and former USWNT coach Jill Ellis, followingallegationsthat she created a hostile work environment (Ellis hascountersuedfor defamation of character), along with the hiring of former Arsenal Women head coach Jonas Eidevall and thetrade of Jaedyn Shawto the North Carolina Courage.“Alex has always fought to positively impact this game beyond the pitch,” said Lauren Leichtman, controlling owner of Wave FC. “Her decision to invest is not only a continuation of her leadership but also a reflection of her belief in what we are building.”Morgan finished her career as one of the most accomplished players in the history of US women’s soccer, winning two World Cups and Olympic gold with the US to go with an NWSL Championship in 2013 and the NWSL Shield in 2023.

FaceAge is an AI tool created by scientists at Mass General Brigham in Boston. By looking at a photo of your face, it can determine your biological age as opposed to your chronological age.What does that mean?It means that everyone ages at different speeds. At the age of 50, for example, Paul Rudd had a biological age of 43, according to researchers.

Sometimes it helps me to write by thinking about how a radio broadcaster or television presenter would deliver the information, so I’m your host, Blake Montgomery. Today in tech news: questions hover over the automation of labor in the worker-strapped US healthcare system; and drones proliferate in a new conflict: India v Pakistan, both armed with nuclear weapons. But first, how fights over AI and copyright take very different shapes in the UK and US.‘A brazen, unprecedented power grab’The United Kingdom is in the throes of a debate over whether to compensate artists’ for the use of their copyrighted work in the creation of generative artificial intelligence technology. The fracas came to head on Monday with a vote in theHouse of Lordsthat saw parliament’s upper house demand tech companies make clear whether they have used copyright-protected content.My colleagues Dan Milmo and Raphael Boyd report:The UK government has suffered another setback in the House of Lords over its plans to let artificial intelligence firmsuse copyright-protected work without permission.An amendment to the data bill requiring AI companies to reveal which copyrighted material is used in their models was backed by peers, despite government opposition.The government’s copyright proposals are the subject of a consultation due to report back this year, but opponents of the plans have used the data bill as a vehicle for registering their disapproval.The main government proposal is to let AI firms use copyright-protected work to build their models without permission, unless the copyright holders signal they do not want their work to be used in that process – a solution that critics say is impractical and unworkable.Read the full story about Monday’s votehere.Meanwhile, in contrast to a thoughtful and robust conversation, the US is taking the opposite tack. Over the weekend, Donald Trump fired the head of the US copyright office,CBS Newsreported. Register of Copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, was sacked after she issued a report questioning AI companies’ growing need for more data and casting doubt on their expressed need to circumvent current copyright laws.In a statement, New York Democratic representative Joe Morelle pointed specifically to Trump’s booster-in-chief Elon Musk as a motivator for Perlmutter’s firing: “Donald Trump’s termination of register of copyrights, Shira Perlmutter, is a brazen, unprecedented power grab with no legal basis. It is surely no coincidence he acted less than a day aftershe refused to rubber-stampElon Musk’s efforts to mine troves of copyrighted works to train AI models.”Trump’s abrupt severing of the copyright chief from her job reminds me of the Gordian knot. Legend has it that Alexander the Great was presented with a knot in a rope tying a cart to a stake. So complex were its twistings that no man had been able to untie it of the hundreds who had tried. Alexander silently drew his sword and sliced the knot in two. The story is one of a great man demonstrating the ingenuity that would lead him to conquer the world. Alexander did solve the riddle. He also defeated its purpose. The cart is left with no anchor. Perhaps the riddle had taken on more significance than the original problem of keeping the cart in place, but that is a question for another day.Trump may have cut through any thorny legal questions the copyright office had raised, but the vacuum at the head of the US’s copyright authority means that richer and better-connected players will run roughshod over copyright law in the course of their business. That may be what the president wants. The more powerful players in lawsuits over AI and copyright are undoubtedly the well capitalized AI companies, as much as I want artists to be paid in abundance for their creativity. These tech companies have cozied up to Trump in an effort to ensure a friendlier regulatory environment, which seems to be working if the firing of the copyright chief is any evidence. Lawsuits over how much AI companies owe artists and publishers for their surreptitious use of copyrighted material with an avowed lack of permission still abound, and both plaintiffs and defendants will be taking their cues from the US copyright office.Trump sells access on the blockchainView image in fullscreenDonald Trump at the White House in Washington DC, Monday.Photograph: Nathan Howard/ReutersMy colleague Nick Robins-Early reports on a sweepstakes put on by Trump promising face-time with the president to holders of his cryptocurrency:On Monday, the top 220 buyers of a Donald Trump-sponsored cryptocurrency won access to an exclusive dinner with the president as a reward for pouring money into the coin. It was the culmination of Trump’s weekslong promotion of the contest, which has drawn allegations that he is using his position to enrich his family business while opening himself up to foreign influence.The cryptocurrency, called $TRUMP, was created in mid-January and boasts a market capitalization of over $2bn after months of investors buying into the heavily promoted coin. A Trump family-linked company and another firm own a majority of the coins,according to Reuters.“Congratulations, if you’re in the top 220 on the leaderboard we will be contacting you in the next 24 hours. Check your inbox (and spam folder) and expect a phone call for the Trump Official Dinner invitation and details,” the $TRUMP website announced mid-day Monday. “President Trump will see YOU on May 22 at the Gala Dinner in Washington D.C.”Trump’s crypto enterprise has drawn criticism from Democrats, ethics watchdogs and the Securities and Exchange Commission over conflicts of interest and allegations of corruption. The contest to dine with the president has intensified those concerns as it creates what is essentially a bidding war for direct access to the president.Drones proliferate along the border between India and PakistanView image in fullscreenResidents inspect their damaged houses in Neelum Valley of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on Monday.Photograph: Muzammil Ahmed/AFP/Getty ImagesThough India and Pakistan have reached a tenuous ceasefire, the four days of open conflict between the two hostile neighbors offered yet another instance of a phenomenon that has accelerated in recent years: drones now play a central part in modern warfare.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Indian military officials claimed that Pakistan had sent between 300 to 400 drones on the offensive at 36 locations on the night of 8 May. Pakistan said it had shot down some 70 drones flown from India.“Drones” refers to two things that are related but very different: small quadcopters operated by remote control and much larger semi-autonomous aerial vehicles operated from military command centers. It is an unfortunate quirk of English, in my opinion. In India and Pakistan, as well as in Ukraine andMyanmar, the smaller unmanned aircraft have become a mainstay weapon.The war between Ukraine and Russia has demonstrated how widely drones have proliferated. Explosive quadcopters, equipped with first-person view and functioning as aerial improvised explosive devices, have carried out some of the most dramatic attacks of the conflict, including a bombing of the Kremlin itself in May 2023. One expert summarized the development to the Guardian earlier this year bydescribing dronesas evolving from “a novelty in 2022, to one of the weapons of choice in 2023, to roaming the entire tactical space”.Can the US automate its way out of a shortage of healthcare workers?View image in fullscreenA nurse uses a new automated dose assembly machine in Columbus, Ohio.Photograph: Doral Chenoweth/The Columbus Dispatch via USA Today NetworkOne of the great fears of our age is that machines will replace our jobs en masse, leaving the human workforce in the lurch. The Guardian published a story over the weekend about Zing, a robot that dispenses methadone, a drug used in treatment for the opioid addiction that has spread through the veins of the US in recent decades. Beneath the story of innovation runs an undercurrent: where do we draw the line between automation that offers genuine help to workers and profiteering preference for robot labor over humans?Read the full story about drug-dealing robotshere.The story published one day before Walgreens announced it would expand the services of its “micro-fulfillment centers” – hubs where prescription-dispensing robots count and package medications for chronic health conditions for the company’s pharmacies,CNBC reports. Already, these automated centers handle about 16m prescriptions each month, 40% of prescriptions served by Walgreens, according to the company. The company plans to up the number of stores that rely on these centers from 4,800 in February to 5,000 by the end of the year. Walgreens says the shift to automated labor, begun in 2021, is already producing financial results, some $500m in cost savings over the past four years.Pharmacy techs suffer from similar issues as methadone-dispensing nurses – low pay, intense pressure, and high turnover rates – but at a much wider scale. Walgreens is a massive conglomerate of some 12,500 stores across the US, Europe and Latin America worth about $9.7bn; it employs 312,000 people, per its website.In 2023, Walgreens’ pharmacy workers staged walkouts across the US to protest their working conditions. Chief among their concerns: chronic understaffing and burnout among the workers who chose to stay. They called the protests “Pharmageddon”.Walgreens may hire fewer pharmacy workers because it has automated their labor and outsourced it to a micro-fulfilment center. But it seems equally possible based on what pharmacy workers say that those jobs were going unfilled to begin with, leading to unsafe working conditions. Automated labor may fill the gap left by the labor shortage. The same dynamic may play out at methadone clinics across the United States.Already, Walgreens corporate says its automated labor is helping alleviate the problems workers face and allowing staff to spend more time interacting with patients in person. Among the stats: a 40% increase in vaccine dispensations, which are performed person-to-person, at pharmacies served by its automated prescription system.Read more about the automation of labor in a different arena: Amazon warehouseshere.The wider TechScapeBM Boys: the Nigerian sextortion network hiding in plain sight on TikTokCourt clash between Meta and NSO ends in $168m defeat for spyware firmAI of dead Arizona road rage victim addresses killer in courtExplore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingDonald TrumpLibrariesIntellectual propertyHouse of LordsnewslettersShareReuse this content"

Now they want us to see their products as trustworthy collaboratorsVauhini VaraTue 13 May 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 13.08 EDTShareView image in fullscreenIllustration: Mathieu Labrecque/The GuardianAfter publishing my third book in early April, I kept encountering headlines that made me feel like the protagonist of some Black Mirrorepisode. “Vauhini Vara consultedChatGPTto help craft her new book ‘Searches,’” one of themread. “To tell her own story, this acclaimed novelist turned to ChatGPT,” saidanother. “Vauhini Vara examines selfhood with assistance from ChatGPT,” went athird.The publications describingSearchesthis way were reputable and fact-based. But their descriptions of my book – and of ChatGPT’s role in it – didn’t match my own reading. It was true that I had put my ChatGPT conversations in the book, but my goal had been critique, not collaboration. In interviews and public events, I had repeatedly cautioned against usinglarge language modelssuch as the ones behind ChatGPT for help with self-expression. Had these headline writers misunderstood what I’d written? Had I?In the book, I chronicle how big technology companies have exploited human language for their gain. We let this happen, I argue, because we also benefit somewhat from using the products. It’s a dynamic that makes us complicit in big tech’s accumulation of wealth and power: we’re both victims and beneficiaries. I describe this complicity, but I also enact it, through my own internet archives: my Google searches, my Amazon product reviews and, yes, myChatGPTdialogues.The polite politics of AIHow an embarrassing U-turn exposed a concerning truth about ChatGPT | Chris Stokel-WalkerRead moreThe book opens with epigraphs from Audre Lorde and Ngũgĩ wa Thiong’o evoking the political power of language, followed by the beginning of a conversation in which I ask ChatGPT to respond to my writing. The juxtaposition is deliberate: I planned to get its feedback on a series of chapters I’d written to see how the exercise would reveal the politics of both my language use and ChatGPT’s.My tone was polite, even timid: “I’m nervous,” I claimed.OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, tells us its product is built to be good at following instructions, andsome research suggeststhat ChatGPT is most obedient when we act nice to it. I couched my own requests in good manners. When it complimented me, I sweetly thanked it; when I pointed out its factual errors, I kept any judgment out of my tone.ChatGPT was likewise polite by design. People often describe chatbots’ textual output as “bland” or “generic” – the linguistic equivalent of a beige office building. OpenAI’s products are built to “sound like a colleague”, as OpenAIputs it, using language that, coming from a person, would sound “polite”, “empathetic”, “kind”, “rationally optimistic” and “engaging”, among other qualities. OpenAI describes these strategies as helping its products seem “professional” and “approachable”. This appears to be bound up with making us feel safe: “ChatGPT’s default personality deeply affects the way you experience and trust it,”OpenAI recently explainedin a blogpost explaining the rollback of an update that had made ChatGPT sound creepily sycophantic.Trust is a challenge forartificial intelligence(AI) companies, partly because their products regularly produce falsehoods and reifysexist,racist, US-centric cultural norms. While the companies are working on these problems, they persist: OpenAI found that its latest systems generate errors at ahigher ratethan its previous system. In the book, I wrote about the inaccuracies and biases and also demonstrated them with the products. When I prompted Microsoft’s Bing Image Creator to produce a picture of engineers and space explorers, it gave me an entirely male cast of characters; when my father asked ChatGPT to edit his writing, it transmuted his perfectly correct Indian English into American English. Those weren’t flukes. Research suggests thatboth tendenciesare widespread.In my own ChatGPT dialogues, I wanted to enact how the product’s veneer of collegial neutrality could lull us into absorbing false or biased responses without much critical engagement. Over time, ChatGPT seemed to be guiding me to write a more positive book about big tech – including editing my description of OpenAI’s CEO,Sam Altman, to call him “a visionary and a pragmatist”. I’m not aware of research on whether ChatGPT tends to favor big tech, OpenAI or Altman, and I can only guess why it seemed that way in our conversation. OpenAI explicitly states that its products shouldn’t attempt to influence users’ thinking. When I asked ChatGPT about some of the issues, it blamed biases in its training data – though I suspect my arguably leading questions played a role too.When I queried ChatGPT about its rhetoric, it responded: “The way I communicate is designed to foster trust and confidence in my responses, which can be both helpful and potentially misleading.”Still, by the end of the dialogue, ChatGPT was proposing an ending to my book in which Altman tells me: “AI can give us tools to explore our humanity in ways we never imagined. It’s up to us to use them wisely.” Altman never said this to me, though it tracks with a common talking point emphasizing our responsibilities over AI products’ shortcomings.‘Don’t ask what AI can do for us, ask what it is doing to us’: are ChatGPT and co harming human intelligence?Read moreI felt my point had been made: ChatGPT’s epilogue was both false and biased. I gracefully exited the chat. I had – I thought – won.I thought I was critiquing the machine. Headlines described me as working with itThen came the headlines (and, in some cases, articles or reviews referring to my use of ChatGPT as an aid in self-expression). People were also asking about my so-called collaboration with ChatGPT in interviews and at public appearances. Each time, I rejected the premise, referring to the Cambridge Dictionary definition of a collaboration: “the situation of two or more people working together to create or achieve the same thing.” No matter how human-like its rhetoric seemed, ChatGPT was not a person – it was incapable of either working with me or sharing my goals.OpenAI has its own goals, of course. Among them, it emphasizes wanting to build AI that “benefits all of humanity”. But while the company iscontrolled by a non-profitwith that mission, its funders still seek a return on their investment. That will presumably require getting people using products such as ChatGPT even more than they already are – a goal that is easier to accomplish if people see those products as trustworthy collaborators. Last year, AltmanenvisionedAI behaving as a “super-competent colleague that knows absolutely everything about my whole life”. In aTed interviewthis April, he suggested this could even function at the societal level: “I think AI can help us be wiser and make better collective governance decisions than we could before.” By this month, he wastestifyingat a US Senate hearing about the hypothetical benefits of having “an agent in your pocket fully integrated with the United States government”.Reading the headlines that seemed to echo Altman, my first instinct was to blame the headline writers’ thirst for something sexy to tantalize readers (or, in any case, the algorithms that increasingly determine what readers see). My second instinct was to blame the companies behind the algorithms, including the AI companies whose chatbots are trained onpublished material. When I asked ChatGPT about well-known recent books that are “AI collaborations”, it named mine, citing a few of the reviews whose headlines had bothered me.I went back to my book to see if maybe I’d inadvertently referred to collaboration myself. At first it seemed like I had. I found 30 instances of words such as “collaboration” and “collaborating”. Of those, though, 25 came from ChatGPT, in the interstitial dialogues, often describing the relationship between people and AI products. None of the other five were references to AI “collaboration” except when I was quoting someone else or being ironic: I asked, for example, about the fate ChatGPT expected for “writers who refuse to collaborate with AI”.Was I an accomplice to AI companies?But did it matter that I mostly hadn’t been the one using the term? It occurred to me that those talking about my ChatGPT “collaboration” might have gotten the idea from my book even if I hadn’t put it there. What had made me so sure that the only effect of printing ChatGPT’s rhetoric would be to reveal its insidiousness? How hadn’t I imagined that at least some readers might be convinced by ChatGPT’s position? Maybe my book had been more of a collaboration than I had realized – not because an AI product had helped me express myself, but because I had helped the companies behind these products with their own goals. My book concerns how those in power exploit our language to their benefit – and about our complicity in this. Now, it seemed, the public life of my book was itself caught up in this dynamic. It was a chilling experience, but I should have anticipated it: of course there was no reason my book should be exempt from an exploitation that has taken over the globe.Better at everything: how AI could make human beings irrelevantRead moreAnd yet, my book was also about the way in which we can – and do – use language to serve our own purposes, independent from, and indeed in opposition to, the goals of the powerful. While ChatGPT proposed that I close with a quote from Altman, I instead picked one from Ursula K Le Guin: “We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words.” I wondered aloud where we might go from here: how might we get our governments to meaningfully rein in big tech wealth and power? How might we fund and build technologies so that they serve our needs and desires without being bound up in exploitation?I’d imagined that my rhetorical power struggle against big tech had begun and ended within the pages of my book. It clearly hadn’t. If the headlines I read represented the actual end of the struggle, it would mean I had lost. And yet, I soon also started hearing from readers who said the book had made them feel complicit in big tech’s rise and moved to act in response to this feeling. Several had canceled their Amazon Prime subscriptions; one stopped soliciting intimate personal advice from ChatGPT. The struggle is ongoing. Collaboration will be required – among human beings."

In just months, he has shifted from denouncing “communist” price controls to saying he wouldimplementthem, and from defending tax breaks for the wealthy toproposingtax increases on those earning more than $2.5m a year if it benefits poorer Americans. These moves echo longstanding proposals from progressives likeBernie Sanders– despite Mr Trump’s past efforts to portray such ideas as “lunatic”. The irony is hard to miss.Consider recent policy announcements that mirror a liberal-left agenda. Capping credit card interest rates was a Sanderscampaign promisebefore it was a Trumpone. And it may happen – courtesy of an unlikely alliance betweenMr Sanders and the Republican senator Josh Hawley. Slashing drug prices by executive fiat? Absolutely, says Robert F Kennedy Jr, Mr Trump’s secretary of health, creditingMr Sandersfor the idea. The Vermont senatorshot back, saying the administration’s plan would be “thrown out” by judges – and that meaningful reform required legislation.It’s not so much strategy as media stunt. Whereas the Biden White House used tariffs as part of its industrial strategy against China, Mr Trump ratcheted them up to 145% without a plan. On Monday they were dramatically slashed to30%in a fit of economic realism. The justification is easy to see: domestic pain.Empty shelves and collapsing supply chainshave a way of reminding even the most blustering Maga nationalist that trade wars are not, in fact, easy to win.This disarray isn’t a side-effect; it’s the method. Mr Trump borrows popular ideas, announces them with great fanfare, and then either fails to follow through or runs into a predictable mess. His approach is driven more by appearances. He shifts messages depending on the audience. One day he presents himself as achampion of working people, the next as a defender of corporate interests. It’s a series of conflicting signals designed to keep him in control of the narrative.This confusion works to Mr Trump’s advantage. He keeps hisbillionairebackers happy while providing enough headlines to suggest the impression of fairness. It is gameshow politics – with Mr Trump appearing both as host and winning contestant. Meanwhile,watchdogsare gutted, workers’wagesare cut, and tax policies prop up the1%. Now and then, he floats a progressive idea, but it rarely amounts to anything real.Mr Trump’s populist image – attacking elites while claiming to fight for ordinary Americans – masks a pattern of elite self-dealing. In any previous era, a US president accepting a$400mjet from a Gulf royal or a Middle Eastern statespending$2bn on cryptocurrencies through a first-family-owned company would have sparked a constitutional crisis. Thescandalis hiding in plain sight, disguised by Mr Trump’s own performance.It’s often less about ideology than popularity, as Mr Trump retreats from chaotic policies that rattled markets and hurt his poll numbers. He backs appealing progressive ideas – like redistribution and price-gouging crackdowns – for thepartisandrama they provoke. Whether this performative populism lasts is unclear. But if the early months are any guide, this is a rerun, only with sharper slogans, fewer rules and an even greater hunger for applause over governing.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Hasan Piker, a popular streamer with4.5 million followersacross YouTube and Twitch, who has been hailed by mainstream publications such as the New Yorker andNew York Timesas the left’s answer to the deluge of rightwing internet influencers, says he wasdetained and questioned for hoursby border control agents as he re-entered the US (Piker is a US citizen). It is an instructive moment. Countries that behave like this towards political commentators and dissenting voices who are their own citizens are either nakedly authoritarian, or well on the way.Piker was reportedly interrogated at length not just aboutHamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah, but his views on Donald Trump. The 33-year-old pundit – an unapologetic champion of the Palestinian cause – stuck to a message of opposing “endless bloodshed” and siding with civilians. That the biggest progressive streamer in the US was subjected to this experience is emblematic of a phenomenon that requires an accurate and insistent description: it is the biggest assault on free speech in the west since the height of McCarthyism seven decades ago.When foreign-born citizens – including green card holders – began to bedetainedby US authorities over their opposition to Israel’s genocide, it should have been clear that this was just phase one: US citizens would be next. Sure, Piker wasn’t arrested, but the authorities are pushing the boundaries bit by bit. Thenumbers of foreign visitorsentering the US are falling as it is, undoubtedly driven by fears of a punitive border regime. But Piker’s detention sends a message to Americans with dissenting opinions – not least opponents of Israel’s genocide. The threat of being stopped at the border and subjected to lengthy interrogation simply because of what you think is straightforward political intimidation. It won’t stop there.That the vice-president, JD Vance,railed against Europefor a supposed war on free speech underlines what a sham this favoured narrative of the right always was. Weeks later, his boss announced that universities allowing “illegal” protests would bestarved of federal cash– with Columbia University losing $400m despite having clamped down on pro-Palestinian protests – and dissenting students would be variously expelled, arrested, imprisoned or deported. Alas, it was under the Biden administration that the McCarthyite blacklisting-style campaign began, with defenders of Palestinian rights being variouslydeplatformed,firedandthreatened.Indeed, Vance could have noted how European countries such as Germany have assaulted free speech by silencing pro-Palestinian activists: from imposingcrippling restrictions on protestsandviolently assaultingdemonstrators toshutting down conferences,sackingpeople who speak out and now seeking todeport activists, too. Alas, it’s not really free speech that Vance is interested in, but rather advancing far-right politics.If we’re going to discuss who is being stopped at the border, let’s discuss the astonishing 23,380US citizens who serve in the IDF, according to figures quoted in the Washington Post a year ago. Many of them are undoubtedly committing unspeakable war crimes in Israel’s genocidal onslaught. Yet they are being waved through the border. And that really sums it up. If like Piker, you speak out against genocide, you are liable to be treated as a criminal as you enter your own country. If you’re a US citizen serving in a foreign army committing heinous atrocities, you’re more likely to be treated as a hero. The world is turned on its head.Owen Jones is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Don’t they know not to look a wooden gift horse in the mouth?Tue 13 May 2025 11.01 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 14.03 EDTShareIf you’re familiar with your folklore, you’ll know the story ofThe Emperor’s New Plane, in which some barely-even-wily out-of-towners turn up with an offer to give a vain and selfish leader a new $400m Boeing 747-8. The merits of accepting this “flying palace” are invisible only to those who are stupid or incompetent, which means the emperor would literally be an idiot not to take it, right?Right? And so it is that Donald Trump is STUNNED that anyone could be so dumb as to not think he should accept the offer of a state-of-the-art griftliner from the Qatari royal family. This willsupposedly becomeAir Force One, with that other candelabra-free dumpster presumably pensioned off to ferry someone tasteless and irrelevant. (Eric Trump?)Then, when the second Trump imperium finishes – and please be assured that a guy who would take a freebie plane off a petrostate autocrat could not possibly have any more respect for the two-term constitutional limit – the plane will be transferred to Trump’s presidential library and become his personal property. Trump calls this entire deal with a foreign government “very transparent” – and I think we can probably agree on that. You’d have to be wearing a lead blindfold not to see right through it. In many ways the most opaque thing about it is the notion that Trump is even planning a presidential library. I thought he kept all his most precious papers behind a shower curtain or stacked next to the toilet in a Mar-a-Lago bathroom that a realtor might describe as “a wonderful opportunity for updating”. In this reading, the term “presidential library” simply functions as one of those twee euphemisms for the guest loo. “I wonder if you could show me to the presidential library?”Anyway, Trump’s inclination to accept a freebie plane from a foreign state has even given pause to some of hisMaga faithful. There are suggestions that his endless promises to drain the swamp are in fact not delivered on by instead flying over the swamp in a lavishly appointed $400m sleazemobile.Meanwhile, because his opponents still feel they have to go through the motions of the old world, of the bygone American century, a number of leading critics have issued appalled statements. And clearly, the president should beware Qataris bearing gifts. Yet the fact is he can’t help himself. Literally the only reason you wouldn’t be able to wheel a giant wooden horse straight through the security gates of the White House without even having to scan it is that Trump only likes elaborate repro gilt, and would find this particular equine aesthetic too hideously rough-hewn and low-key.The weird thing about the luxury jumbo jet is that it isn’t even the most eye-catching present to Trump we’ve got a look at in the past month alone. That honour probably belongs to the portrait sent to the president by Vladimir Putin, which, its Russian artistrecently revealed, Putin had personally told him was a vital step in repairing Russia’s relationship with the US. Again, because people can’t see a nice gesture from an expansionist autocrat without having to read something deep into it that simply isn’t there … there has been a certain amount of consternation that Trump would accept a portrait from Putin.But is it not just possible that the Russian president, a former KGB officer, simply knows the perfect gift? He’s like the Martha Stewart of strings-attached flattery. As for how he knows the ideal present … maybe the clues were there all along, for those who are cold-blooded enough to spot them.Alas, now Trump is back in office, there are six news cycles/shit-floodings of the zone per day, meaning it is incredibly easy to forget that on the day when it emerged that his defence secretary had discussed operational details of a bombing raid in Yemen in a group chat, then added some journalist rando to it, we also learned about 20 other nutty things. One of these was that the president hadlost his mindabout what he perceived as a mildly unflattering portrait of him in the Colorado state legislature.Like I say, you can’t keep up with it all. But friends notice these things on behalf of friends, and in retrospect, while everyone else was droning on about the Houthi raid security breach, you suspect that this was the exact momentVladimir Putindecided to commission a portrait that his buddy WOULD like. Certainly, it wasn’t long before an oil rendering of Trump punching the air after the assassination attempt on him last July was winging its way from Moscow to the United States. Trump’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, described it as a “beautiful portrait” and said the president was “clearly touched by it”. Yes, touched in his special place – his vanity.For many, it’s becoming hard not to think that Trump is being played by his gifters. Imagine if you had petrostate money, and all you needed to spend to have the president of the United States fly around openly advertising his own corruption was $400m. It’s insanely cheap at the price.Except, at the same time, it’s increasingly hard to experience the feeling of outrage at Trump’s behaviour as much more than the occasional twitch of a phantom limb. This, of course, is because the most useful thing Trump was ever gifted, possibly by a fairy at his christening, is the 21st century’s greatest superpower. Namely, a complete inability to feel shame. Almost nothing is more valuable, certainly not a mere $400m plane or a bad-art portrait. It would be good to think the emperor was naked – but unfortunately, only his corruption is.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionQatarTrump administrationVladimir PutincommentShareReuse this content"

Here’s what would actually restore good-paying jobsTue 13 May 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 12.22 EDTShareOn Sunday night, the US announced that it wascutting tariffs on Chinese importsfrom 145% to 30%, for 90 days, and the Chinese are dropping tariffs on US goods from 125% to 10%, also for 90 days.The stock market soared on the news. (Anyone with inside knowledge of the deal could have made a killing.)But what’s the ultimate goal here? What happens over the next 90 days?It’s impossible to know what’s in Donald Trump’s mind (other than an insatiable thirst for power and money), but his trade and manufacturing adviser, Peter Navarro, says the “bigger picture is restoring the American manufacturing base”.Protecting democracy is not enough: five things Americans must fight for | Huck GutmanRead moreIn 1970, more than a quarter of US workers held jobs in the manufacturing sector. Today, it’s only about8%. The Trump regime says sweeping tariffs will reverse this decades-long decline.The president also promises torevive the US coal industry. Last month he issued an executive order to rescind regulations limiting coal development. Last week, he evenordered federal agenciesto stop considering the economic damage caused by coal and other carbon emissions when writing regulations. And he’s doing whatever he can to destroy green energy – solar and wind.Manufacturing? Coalmining?These sorts of jobs won’t make America great again. They’ll make American workers sickened, injured and killed on the job again.I was secretary of labor. I saw close up how awful most of these jobs are. I met workers who had lost limbs in manufacturing jobs because machines they were cleaning or repairing accidentally started up. Others I met suffered carpal tunnel injuries from repetitive motions on assembly lines.Child labor was – and still is – a pervasive problem. So, too, with dangerous sweatshops crammed with people working for subminimum wages (if they’re lucky enough to be paid at all).And mining? I met mine workers with black lung disease from exposure to coal dust. Despite being on the decline after the 1970s, black lung hasbeen on the risefor two decades. Changes in mining technology have let mine owners dig deeper, exposing miners to even more highly toxic silica.The reason many working-class Americans want manufacturing and mining to return is not because they loved the work. In most cases it was grueling and dangerous or mind-numbingly boring.It’s because that work paid far better than the service jobs in fast-food and retail outlets, hospitals and hotels that many have been forced to take in their absence.And the reason those manufacturing and mining jobs paid far better was because they were unionized. Unions gave workers in manufacturing and mining the bargaining leverage they needed to force employers to offer better pay (along with more job security and safer working conditions).Trump claimed he was pro-worker. His new order shows how absurd that was | Steven GreenhouseRead moreBut since the Reagan years, corporations have been busting unions. In the 1960s, a third of all workers in the private sector were unionized. Today, just6% are.And if there’s one thing Trump and his croniesdon’twant, it’s unions giving workers more bargaining power. He’sgutted the National Labor Relations Board,eviscerated Osha, and is filling the Department of Labor with corporate stooges.So even if it werepossibleto restore manufacturing and mining to the US – even if we stopped foreign trade and forced US consumers to pay enormous sums for stuff made here, even if we filled the atmosphere with carbon, even if we prevented new technologies (including artificial intelligence) from doing the manufacturing and mining jobs that returned – the American working class would be no better off than they are now, if their pay is still in the cellar.A return of manufacturing and mining jobs won’t make Americans great again. Good-paying jobs will.The easiest and best way to raise the pay of working-class Americans is to 1 strengthen unions, 2 raise the minimum wage (which hasn’t been increased since 2009), 3 expand the earned income tax credit (a wage subsidy) for lower-income workers and 4 institute a universal basic income.Will Trump do any of these things?

His crime? Trying to gain access and inspection rights to a privately operated detention center that he says is in violation ofmultiple city lawsuits.Three Democratic members of CongressaccompaniedRas Baraka to the Delaney Hall facility in Newark, as they exercised their owncongressionally mandated rightto enter Ice detention facilities for oversight purposes, without prior notice.While Baraka was taken away in handcuffs, two of the House Democrats –Bonnie Coleman WatsonandLaMonica McIver– were shoved and manhandled by Ice agents outside the facility. The third,Rob Menendez, angrily accused Ice of feeling “no weight of the law and no restraint on what they should be doing. And that was shown in broad daylight today when they not just arrested the mayor of Newark but when they put their hands on two members of Congress standing behind me. How is this acceptable?”Trump’s dangerous projects follow a predictable patternRead moreIt’s a good question. Elected Democrats are now under both legal and physical assault from a rogue agency, which behaves less like federal law enforcement and more likeDonald Trump’s private militia. And yet, elected Democrats refuse to call for its abolition. They seem to have decided that the continued existence of Ice is “acceptable”.Despite the feverish claims from Republican politicians and Fox anchors about the Democratic party being “soft” on immigration enforcement, we’re a long way from 2018, when“abolish Ice”wasan actual sloganon the left and deployed by both prominent progressive activists and rising Democratic party stars, such as then newly electedAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez. EvenKirsten Gillibrand, a moderate New York senator, said she wanted to “get rid of [Ice], start over, reimagine it and build something that actually works”.Kamala Harris, then a California senator, said she believed in “starting from scratch” with Ice.These days, however, elected Democrats, even of the progressive variety, have run a mile from the one-time campaign to dismantle Ice. The new Congressional Progressive Caucus chair, Greg Casar, for example,told Semaforlast month he had “changed” his mind on “Abolish Ice”. Ocasio-Cortez did not utter the words “abolish Ice” on her recent“Fighting Oligarchy” tourwith Bernie Sanders. And nor, for that matter, did the independent senator from Vermont, who once said he wanted to“break up”Ice.What on Earth are elected Democrats, especially progressives, waiting for? How many more abuses of power and violations of the law does Ice have to commit? How unpopular does Trump have to get on theissue of immigration– especially on theissue of Ice deportations– before the so-called opposition take a much bolder stance on the future of Ice?Consider some of the Ice horror shows from the past 30 days alone:On 8 May, Ice agents“held a young girl’s face to the ground”while they detained her mother in Worcester, Massachusetts. A video of the incident fromTelemundo Nueva Inglaterrashows the teenage girl screaming as multiple agents and officers chase her and grab her legs.On 7 May, Ice agents detained Jensy Machado, a US citizen, in northern Virginia with “guns drawn”, toquotethe Virginia Democratic congressman Don Beyer. Despite hisattemptto show his Real ID and prove his legal status, they put him in cuffs.On 5 May, Ice agents detained Daniel Orellana, a 25-year-old Guatemalan, at a gas station in Framingham, Massachusetts. When they were told they had apprehended the wrong man,according to Orellana’s girlfriend, one of the agents said: “OK, but we’re going to take you anyway.”On 4 May, a group of Ice agentsdetaineda man filling up gas in his truck at a gas station in Oxnard, California – and left his children behind on their own. “They arrested someone,” said an eyewitness. “They left the children inside the truck.”On 26 April, court papers filed by the Department of Homeland Securityadmittedthat Ice agents did not have a warrant when they arrested the Palestinian activist and green-card holder Mahmoud Khalil in March.On 24 April, in the middle of the night, Ice agents burst into the home of a family of US citizens in Oklahoma City, while executing a search warrant issued for someone else. The agentsorderedthe family outside into the rain in their underwear, the mother said, and confiscated their phones, laptops and all their cash savings as “evidence”.On 22 April, Ice agents detained a mother and her two-year-old daughter, a US citizen, during a routine check-in with the agency in New Orleans andthen deportedthe mother back to Honduras with her American child. A Trump-appointed federal judge said he had a “strong suspicion that the government just deported a US citizen with no meaningful process”.There is no such thing as an ‘illegal immigrant’ | Mehdi HasanRead moreAlso on 22 April, Ice agents in plain clothes, without badges or warrants,detainedtwo men during a raid on a courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. Two bystanders who dared to ask those agents to show them a warrant were ordered not to “impede” the arrest and have since beenthreatened with prosecutionby Ice.On 14 April, Ice agents stopped an undocumented Guatemalan couple in their car in New Bedford, Massachusetts, while looking for another man. When Juan Francisco and Marilu Méndez’s lawyer told them over the phone to stay in the car until she got there, the Ice agents used alarge hammerto smash the rear window of the car and drag them out.Also on 14 April, we learned that Ice agents detained a 19-year old Venezuelan asylum seeker and deported him to theCecotprison in El Salvador – despite his lack of criminal convictions or even tattoos. During the arrest,according to his father, one Ice agent said: “No, he’s not the one,” as if they were looking for someone else, but another agent said: “Take him anyway.”All of these incidents are just from the past month. Go back further, and I could goonandonandon.So where are the Dems on this? Why aren’t they calling for an end to alawless,violent,deadly,institutionallyracist,sexually abusiveagency, whose employees’ union endorsed Trump for president in both2016and2020, and whose former acting director, Tom Homan, has become this administration’s gung-ho “border czar” and “the face of Trump’s cruelty”, toquotemy Zeteo colleague John Harwood?Forget about talk of “reform”. At this point, there is no way to improve or “fix” Ice. It has to be abolished. Shut down. Scrapped. To quote Gillibrand in 2018, the entirety of immigration enforcement in the United States must be “reimagined”.Meanwhile, assome Democratsobsess over opinion polls and worry about looking “soft” on the border, the actual experts on authoritarianism are sounding the alarm. The political scientist Lee Morgenbesser hascomparedIce to a “secret police” and says the agency “is fast becoming a key piece in the repressive apparatus of American authoritarianism”. Historian Ruth Ben-GhiatcallsIce the “foot soldiers” of the “fascists”. Even the “anti-woke” libertarians over at Reason magazinesayIce is on a “militaristic mission that effectively turns nonviolent immigrants into fugitives”.Why would a future Democratic president or Democratic-controlled Congress want tokeepsuch a Gestapo-like outfit? And, sorry, but when did it become a political taboo to call for the abolition of a government agency? Republicans have spent decades trying to shut down a plethora of federal government departments.

It’s about the family businessMohamad BazziThe Trump Organization has millions in developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the UAE – sites of his first state visitTue 13 May 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 12.21 EDTShareOn his first day back in the White House, reporters asked Donald Trump where he might go on his maiden overseas trip. The US president saw it as an opportunity to show off his deal-making prowess and expound on how he would convinceSaudi Arabiato inject billions of dollars into the US economy.While US presidents often visit Canada, Mexico or the UK as their first foreign destination, Trump upended that tradition whenhe traveled to Saudi Arabiain May 2017. Hours after his second inauguration, Trump dangled the possibility of a return trip to the kingdom – for a price. “I did it with Saudi Arabia last time because they agreed to buy $450bn worth of our products,”he said. “If Saudi Arabia wanted to buy another $450bn or $500 – we’ll up it for all the inflation – I think I’d probably go.”Trump thinks he is shaping the Middle East. Instead, it’s Gulf states that will dictate US foreign policy | Simon TisdallRead moreDays later, on 23 January, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler and crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, responded with an even more lucrative offer:he would invest $600bnin the US economy over the next four years.The Saudi leader’s comments were quickly forgotten amid the flurry of executive orders and mass government cuts announced by Trump in his early days in office. But Trump had made clear that his first state visit would be up for sale to the highest bidder.And while he has claimed that he’s most interested in securing economic deals that would benefit Americans, he’s also using this trip to shore up his relationship with regional autocrats and drum up business for his own family.As he did in 2017, Trump decided to make Saudi Arabiathe first stopof his state visit to the Middle East. After arriving in the kingdom on Tuesday, he will head to two neighboring Gulf countries: Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. (Trump made a brief foreign trip to the Vatican last month for Pope Francis’s funeral, but that was not a choreographed state visit by a US president.) It’s clear why the Gulf Arab states – with their vast riches from oil and gas exports, and sovereign wealth funds eager to make investments – would be more attractive to Trump than US neighbors such as Canada and Mexico, or traditional allies such as the UK.During his first term, Trumpinflated his administration’s rolein securing economic deals with Saudi Arabia, including a package of $110bn in weapons sales that he announced with great fanfare during his visit eight years ago. But many of those agreements were tentative and a portion of themilitary equipmentthat the Saudis planned to buy had already been negotiated by Barack Obama’s administration.While the true value of Saudi and other Gulf Arab states’ investments in the US economy remain hazy, their deals with Trump’s family business and its foreign partners are far more tangibleWhile the true value of Saudi and other Gulf Arab states’ investments in the US economy remain hazy, their deals with Trump’s family business and its foreign partners are far more tangible. The president will be visiting three countries that all have Trump-branded properties or ongoing real estate developments, hotels and golf resorts worthbillions of dollars. He will be meeting with foreign leaders who can make decisions that affect the Trump Organization’s projects and relationships with companies that are connected to Gulf Arab governments or their sovereign wealth funds, which could pose an enormous financial conflict of interest for Trump.Here’s a summary of major deals and projects under way in Saudi Arabia,Qatarand the UAE involving Trump’s family business:Saudi ArabiaIn Saudi Arabia, the Trump Organization has signed branding deals for two real estate projects, including aTrump Tower in Riyadh, the capital, and another $530mresidential towerin the coastal city of Jeddah. The deals, announced a month after Trump was elected to a second term, won’t require the Trump family business to contribute funds toward building the towers, but they will earn millions of dollars in licensing fees. The projects are spearheaded by Dar Global, a subsidiary of Dar Al Arkan, one of thelargest real estate developersin Saudi Arabia. The company is privately owned, but it is dependent on contracts from the Saudi government and Prince Mohammed’s favor, especially as he pursues an ambitious development plan called Vision 2030, intended to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil.In recent years, Trump’s family business has also leaned on the LIV Golf League, which is funded by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund. After Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in January 2021, Trump-owned businesses lost a series of real estate and golf sponsorship deals. But Saudi leaders stuck by Trump, andagreed to holdthe LIV professional golf tour at several of his US golf courses, providing millions of dollars in revenue while he was out of office.QatarIn Qatar, the Trump Organization last month announced anew golf resortand real estate development that will be built by Dar Global, along with a Qatari government-owned developer. The project, called the Trump International Golf Club & Villas, will include an 18-hole golf course, a clubhouse and beachfront Trump-branded villas about 40km from the Qatari capital, Doha. Qatar is a longtime US ally, and it hosts the largest US military base in the Middle East. This is another branding deal for the Trump family business, where it won’t put up any capital but willearn millions of dollarsin branding and management fees once the golf resort is operational.The involvement ofQatari Diar, a real estate company established in 2005 by Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, in the Trump Organization’s project raises new concerns about Trump violating the US constitution’s foreign emoluments clause – his plan to accept a$400m luxury jet from Qatar’s royal familynotwithstanding. That provision bans the presidentfrom receiving paymentsor significant gifts from foreign governments or leaders without approval from Congress. During his first term, Trump’s businesses received $7.8m from 20 foreign governments, according to a report issued byDemocrats in Congresslast year. But government watchdog groupsestimatedthat such payments reached $13.6m – and are sounding alarms that Trump could far exceed those sums in his second term, as the family business ventures operated by his two sons are making more foreign deals like the ones with Gulf Arab states.United Arab EmiratesIn the UAE, the Trump Organization already operates Trump International Golf Club, Dubai, which opened in 2017 during the president’s first term. The project is part of a longtime partnership between Trump and Hussain Sajwani, an Emirati billionaire and founder of Damac Properties, a Dubai-based developer. Damac was supposed to build asecond Trump-brandedgolf resort in Dubai, but that project has been beset by delays.Trump’s dangerous projects follow a predictable patternRead moreBut the Trump family business is moving ahead with other projects in the UAE, including a $1bn, 80-story Trump International Hotel and Tower, being built by Dar Global, the Saudi-owned real estate developer. Apartments at the unfinished luxury tower – which accordingto the developerwill include “the highest outdoor pool in the world” and overlook Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest skyscraper – are already selling forup to $20meach.And the Trump family’s dealings with Gulf Arab autocrats go beyond real estate deals and golf tournaments. On 1 May, Eric Trump, the president’s middle son, who runs the Trump Organization, and a business partner, Zach Witkoff (who also happens to be the son of Steve Witkoff, the president’s special envoy to the Middle East), revealed amajor new cryptocurrency dealwith a venture fund backed by the government of Abu Dhabi, the richest emirate in the UAE. The fund would invest $2bn using a form of digital currency offered by World Liberty Financial, the Trump’s family crypto business.Such a transaction could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for Trump and his family – in a financial deal linked to a foreign government and a longtime US ally.Is it any surprise that Trump would want to use the first major foreign trip of his second term to reward leaders whose countries are making large investments that will ultimately benefit his family’s business? With little consequence, other foreign leaders will be eager to partake in Trump’s corrupt politics.Mohamad Bazzi is director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies, and a journalism professor, at New York UniversityExplore more on these topicsDonald TrumpOpinionSaudi ArabiaUnited Arab EmiratesQatarMiddle East and north AfricacommentShareReuse this content"

But Europe should be wary of its advancesTue 13 May 2025 03.30 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 10.50 EDTShareHow does Xi Jinping view the circus Donald Trump is ring-mastering in Washington? There is no denying that the new president has created an opportunity for Xi to drive a wedge into the flank of the battered transatlantic alliance. China’s special representative to the EU optimistically described Trump’s treatment of Europeans as so “appalling” that it was likely to make them more willing to recognise Beijing’s approach to “peace, friendship, goodwill and win-win cooperation”.It was only a few months ago that Xi deserved his reputation as the world’s disruptor-in-chief. Beijing was (and still is) encroaching in the South China Sea, stepping up its incursions in Taiwan, and jousting with Japan over claims to theSenkaku Islands. But since Trump’s election, Xi has begun to look comparatively restrained, like the steadier player in US-China relations. His foreign minister, Wang Yi, went as far todescribe China as an anchorin an increasingly uncertain world.As Trump’s manic tariff war continues to blow the global economyinto uncharted waters(the US and China have now agreed a 90-day pause to their intransigent trade war), Xi’s restraint is being tested. After all, like Trump, he is by nature a retaliatory leader. “We are not afraid of provocations. We don’t back down,” the Chinese foreign affairs ministry spokesperson, Mao Ning,declared recentlyon X. Then she did something truly striking: she linked a clip of Mao Zedong giving a speech during the early 1950s, when the People’s Liberation Army was battling American GIs in the Korean war. “We will never yield … We’ll fight until we completely triumph”, Mao declares in the clip. The message was clear: Xi Jinping will not bend to Trump’s belligerence.The wealthier and more powerful China has become, the more Xi has come to view diplomatic concessions as signs of weakness. He is now just as unlikely as Mao was to make compromises that would maintain peace. That said, Chinese leaders still find Trump hard to read. But here Xi has an incomparable advantage over other mystified globalpoliticians. He already knows what happens when an erratic despot is allowed to override checks and balances, demolish opposition, silence the media, attack his rivals and unleash disorder. He experienced this very phenomenaunder Chairman Mao.Mao’s Cultural Revolutioncoincided with Xi’s teenage years. The period was one of violence and mayhem as Mao rallied millions of Red Guards with his famous poster calling on them to “bombard the headquarters”, a metaphor for attacking the bureaucratic state and overthrowing the existing order. The result was a savage assault on the Communist party establishment. Leaders turned against each other, young people denounced their teachers and parents, and violent class warfare spread across the country.Xi experienced all this personally: he was shipped off to the countryside as a teenager to learn from workers and farmers as part of the “down to the countryside” movement, and his own father, a veteran revolutionary, was denounced as a counter-revolutionary and purged from the party.The Chinese Communist party: 100 years that shook the worldRead moreNow Trump has rallied his own version of Red Guards, the Proud Boys and other vigilante groups who are bent on attacking the so-called deep state, defying lawmakers and supporting the president in his efforts to overturn the established order. Just as Mao inspired uneducated, disenfranchised Chinese peasants to follow him in a rural revolution a century ago, now Trump’s dispossessed, aggrieved base have not onlyvoted him into office, but are set on overturning both the domestic and global status quo.If he wants a guide to the conundrum of the second Trump administration, Xi need look no further than his own country’s experience surrendering to Maoism. During Mao’s revolution, politicians, corporate leaders, lawyers and even heads of universities were forced to genuflect before the Great Helmsman, as Mao was known. Trump now expects the same servile loyalty from those who surround him. He has cut offfunding to universities, threatened to revoke broadcast licences from media outlets that dare to disagree, and hasmenaced political opponents. Mao, like Trump, loved chaos as well as control, and acted impulsively to keep everyone off-balancewith his unpredictability. As Trump’s special presidential envoy Ric Grenellrecently put it: “Predictability is a terrible thing.”If anything, Trump is a far more Maoist leader than Xi. The Cultural Revolution made Xi deeply allergic to the kind of disorder Mao unleashed and that Trump is now inflicting on the US. Xi is inclined toward extreme forms of control that are characteristic of one-party Leninist states, and continues to view mass upheavals as dangerous. His plan isn’t to echo Mao; it’s to create a modern techno-autocracy backed by a vibrant economy.Reflecting on Mao’s style of leadership shows just how different Xi really is from Trump. If the Chinese president is smart, he’ll not retaliate against US belligerence in an immediate tit-for-tat manner. Instead, he’ll wait, make nice, especially towardEuropeand countries that the west has historically counted as allies, including Japan, Australia and Korea. If the US doesn’t come back to its senses soon, Trump’s binge of self-destructiveness could enhance China’s rise without Xi having to lift a finger. You could think of it as America’s Great Leap Backward.Europe should be wary of Xi’s advances. Though hemight wish to peel the continent loose from the transatlantic alliance, his offers of friendship are strictly utilitarian. Trump may havethrown the geopolitical chessboardon the floor, and Beijing may be attempting to sell itself as a more reasonable global “anchor”, but there is a profound contradiction between democracy and autocracy, and between Europe and the People’s Republic of China. That will remain difficult, if not impossible, to bridge.Orville Schell is the Arthur Ross director of the Center on US-China Relations at Asia SocietyExplore more on these topicsChinaOpinionTrump tariffsEuropeTariffsDonald TrumpAsia PacificcommentShareReuse this content"

Dubbed the “caveman method”, it involves shunning any kind of skincare products, as well as water, and letting the skin barrier “heal”.TikTok creator Tia Zakher has become a viral sensation for her adherence to the trend. The 22-year-old sparked debate about the method afterposting videos of herself with visibly flaky skin, apparently a result of the trend. “What you’re seeing is dead skin, that’s going to flake off eventually while new healthy skin forms underneath,” she told millions of viewers.Zakherhas her scepticsbut, whether or not you believe the videos, what do experts think about the regime, which has been attributed to other celebrities includingAlexa Chung and Salma Hayek?Can the ‘caveman method’ help your skin?Like many healthcare professionals who have commented on the viral videos, Associate Prof Deshan Sebaratnam, a dermatologist at the Skin hospital in Sydney, says “it’s not a good idea”.Feeling stressed and wondering if a ‘cortisol detox’ can help? Not so fast | AntiviralRead more“The reason being is your body is constantly regenerating itself, your skin is constantly turning over, and old skin cells are being shed. Normally they can fall off, but sometimes they can get stuck together, particularly if your skin’s a little bit oilier.”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningSebaratnam said a condition known as terra firma-forme – where those dead skin cells can accumulate like scale – can develop when people don’t shower.“I wouldn’t recommend what she’s doing,” he said.Associate professor Yousuf Mohammed, an expert in pharmaceutics and skin toxicology at the University of Queensland, said sebum – the natural, oily substance produced by sebaceous glands in the skin – provides a partial barrier to protect the skin, but if left unwashed for too long can create the perfect atmosphere for certain types of bacteria to grow.“The caveman technique [might have] worked when we lived in the caves because we didn’t have these new kinds of [modern] pollutants around,” he said. “In today’s day and age, we really do need to wash.”What is recommended for a basic skincare routine?“There’s all this misinformation out there that you need a12-step skincare routine– that’s completely not true. But you don’t want to take it from one extreme to the other, like this person,” Sebaratnam said.He recommends in the morning putting sunscreen on, and then at the end of the day a gentle soap-free cleanser, ideally without fragrances or perfumes. “You don’t need to be spending lots of money – the cheap stuff works great.”Sebaratnam says cleansers are helpful because “with makeup, with sunscreen, even with your own sweat and oil, you need something a little bit more than just water, because those things are oil-based, and oil and water don’t mix, so you need something that can help remove oil-based products.”Shilajit: male influencers claim it boosts testosterone and libido, but what does the science say? | AntiviralRead more“That’s really all you need in terms of a very simple skincare routine – you don’t need to be doing anything extra on top of that. All sunscreen have moisturiser in-built within them, so you don’t need to be putting sunscreen and moisturiser on at the same time,” Sebaratnam said.Wait, really, not even moisturiser?From a medical perspective, only people with conditions such as eczema need moisturiser, Sebaratnam said. But there are lots of different factors that motivate people when it comes to their skincare – “for some people, that’s their form of meditation or their form of self-care”.Do I need to be careful of certain products?Sebaratnam says aggressive skin care products can certainly disrupt the barrier function of the skin. “Even products like soap can strip away natural oils. Anything you put on your skin can disrupt the pH transiently but our skin is resilient and has mechanisms in place to self-regulate this.”Commercial skincare brands often promoteproducts with active ingredientsto target specific concerns such asvitamin A for anti-ageing, hyaluronic acid for hydration or vitamin C for brightening. “There’s lots of different products that you can put on your skin but, in particular, a lot of the actives, they’ll all cause a small degree of irritation, and then if all of a sudden you’re putting 12 of these things on, you know, 12 times a small degree of irritation becomes a big degree of irritation,” Sebaratnam says.“Be intentional with your skincare. Just because you see someone online using something and it suits them, it doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s going to help you reach your skincare goals.“Having a sense of what you want to achieve with your skincare is important, and then you can pick products that suit that.”For some people whose intention is to use their skincare to pamper themselves, they might want to buy expensive products, often paying for a fancy bottle and fragrance, but the improvement in skin quality the next day is likely to be the same whether you use $150 or $15 cream at night, he says.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsAsk AntiviralShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

Labour’s recentimmigration white papersets out a supposedly clear answer. Since the recent “surge” in immigration was driven by the system shifting away from “higher-skilled migration”, it has “distorted the labour market” and undermined the UK’s productivity and GDP.This argument, which has been made in increasingly shrill tones by the rightwing press and thinktanks over the past two years, was echoed by the prime minister,Keir Starmer, who tweeted that “the Tories ran an immigration system that relied on cheap foreign labour”. It sounds plausible. There’s just one problem. It doesn’t fit the facts, and the government knows it.If recent migrants were indeed overwhelmingly low-skilled and low-paid, we’d expect to see that in the data. But the mostrecent releasefrom HMRC on this topic – based not on survey data, but on what employers actually report on their PAYE returns – shows that migrant workers, both those from the EU and beyond, have slightly higher median earnings than workers of UK origin. The two largest nationality groups among recent migrants – Indians and Nigerians – also outperform. It’s very telling that HMRC’s simple chart showing this, and indeed any reference to what the evidence and data actually reveals about migrant wages, is entirely absent from the white paper.Of course, that’s just migrants who are employed. What about the “dependants” that the white paper also complains about? Despite the name – which refers to their visa, not their economic status – the evidence suggests most are in fact working. As theOffice for National Statistics(ONS) concludes, “migrants have been increasingly successful in joining the workforce”.So migrants – who are (unsurprisingly) more likely to be of working age – are overall more likely to be in work and have slightly higher wages. It follows almost automatically as a matter of arithmetic that their short-term impact is to boost, not reduce, GDP per capita. Indeed, that’s exactly what the ONS says.What about the longer-term impacts, though? Does migration reduce the incentive to invest in skills and training, and hence depress productivity? Here it’s harder to prove the case one way or the other. But again, yesterday’s white paper doesn’t even try. Whatevidence we havesuggests that overall migration is at least mildly positive for UK productivity, and that the country’s well-documented, and very longstanding, problems with training and investment in people have little if anything to do with the immigration system.Meanwhile, the specific policies announced in the white paper are a mix of the (potentially) good, the bad and the genuinely ugly. Ending the excessive reliance of the care sector on low-paid and often exploited migrant workers by improving pay and conditions is something almost everyone can agree on. But how? These jobs need to be done, after all. The white paper says that “fair pay agreements” will solve the problem. But that’s a means, not an end; if the end is higher pay, someone needs to find the money, and ultimately that can only be taxpayers or those who need care and their relatives. Unsurprisingly, the prime minister wasn’t exactly forthcoming on this score.What about students? The university sector will be relieved that the graduate visa has only been shortened to 18 months rather than drastically curtailed. But the proposed “levy” on international students’ fees is no such thing. It is simply a tax on one of the UK’s most successful exports: university tuition. A tariff, in other words, but one we are imposing on ourselves. The government has, quite understandably, expended huge amounts of diplomatic effort on minimising the damage done by tariffs to key UK export sectors by negotiating a “deal” with the US president, Donald Trump. Today, however, it turned around an imposed one on itself. There is no logic here.Finally, the ugly. The white paper includes proposals to make some people who came to the UK to work – care workers and so on – wait for a full 10 years before they qualify for settlement and then citizenship. Meanwhile, others whoNo 10 describedas “high-skilled, high-contributing individuals” – including, for example, “AI leaders” – would be “fast-tracked”. This isn’t just mean-spirited. It moves us closer towards a “guest worker” model for lower-paid migrants, in which the government does its best to encourage people who have made their lives here to leave rather than to settle and become British citizens, as so many immigrants to this country have done before. It will actively damage integration and community cohesion, increasing the “churn” of short-term migration without having much impact on net migration.Nor is it even popular. It’s well known that while the majority of the public want to see a reduction in immigration, they are alsovery positiveabout people coming to work in the care sector or the NHS – but much less so about bankers and, I’d guess, the “AI leaders” the government is so keen on. What’s less well known is thatmost people thinkthe current time frame for settlement – five years in most cases – is if anything too long.The UK is actually very good – and much better than most European countries – at integrating migrants, because most Britons, and most migrants, want integration. Enoch Powell claimed that immigration had made white Britons “strangers in their own country”; Starmer echoed him yesterday with his reference to an “island of strangers”. We – not me, not my family with its mix of first-, second- and third-generation migrant backgrounds, and not the vast majority of Britons of all ethnic origins – are not “strangers” here. The rhetoric and policy we saw yesterday will take us backward to a much uglier, and more dangerous, place.Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servantExplore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumOpinionKeir StarmerLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

It’s no wonder they’re angryTue 13 May 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 06.35 EDTShareIt’s boomerang season again. Or to put it another way, the time of year when adult children you imagined might be flying the nest come home instead to roost, a ritual that seems to happen earlier every year.Though the university year isn’t formally finished yet, so many institutions are dumping written exams in favour of dissertations or online assessments (cheaper to run, apparently) that third years have started cutting their losses and their food bills by heading home not long after Easter. In a worrying number of cases, they’re leaving with no job to go to.Young people in line for good degrees from good Russell Group universities, who have for years obediently jumped through every hoop provided, are working in bars, going travelling, or despondently applying to companies that they know use AI not only to sift their CVs, but sometimes to conduct first interviews. Imagine sitting alone in front of a webcam, trying to land your first proper job and being evaluated by a bot with whom you can’t even shake hands, let alone kindle memories of how hard it was getting a foot in the door when they were young. Rejection is tough enough when it comes with an encouraging letter about how you were just pipped to the post, never mind being found wanting by an algorithm.Meanwhile LinkedIn – and yes, students have all been on LinkedIn for years – only feeds the gnawing fear that other people seemingly have their futures much more sorted, just as Instagram used to feed theirteenage anxieties about who was going to all the parties. You can covertly stalk whoever did get that grad scheme position, and beat yourself up wondering what they’ve got that you evidently haven’t.Last year’s Institute of Student Employersrecruitment surveyrecorded a ratio of 140 applications for every graduate job. Part of the reason for that deluge of applicants is perhapsbecause kids who suspect their forms won’t be read by humans anyway are using ChatGPT to fill in and fire them off en masse, to the point where AI is in effect talking to AI. That’s not making recruitment more efficient but the opposite, leaving employers swamped with poorly targeted CVs and jobseekers unsurprisingly resentful. And the hunger games may well be tougher this year, with thelabour market slowing downamid national insurance rises and trade war-fuelled uncertainty.Returning to my old Cambridge college recently, a place where you’d imagine students would feel they’ve won the golden ticket, I was struck by the number who still didn’t know what they would be doing when they graduated and by the sense that they had resigned themselves to a very long haul.If it’s tough for them, it’s invariably worse for others: student Reddit threads hum with angry, despairing stories about firing off hundreds of applications and trekking to endless assessment centres all to no avail, interspersed with frequent advice to move abroad because Britain’s finished.It’s the betrayal that hurts. We drilled it into them that if they worked hard at school and made it into university then the world could be their oyster, but our stagnant economy just hasn’t generated enough graduate-level jobs to match – especially outside London, where we have simultaneously managed to ensure most of them can’t actually afford to live. That translates into a glut of applicants, winnowed down to manageable levels by employers continually raising the bar: even a degree is no longer enough for the most coveted graduate schemes, with a master’s fast becoming the new expectation. But since universities can charge whatever fees they want for postgrad studies –more than £83,000for an MBA at Oxford’s swanky Saïd Business School, to take one extreme example – this risks making certain professions ever more the preserve of the wealthy, pricing everyone else’s children out of an educational arms race.And all the time,AI is stealthily creeping up on the entry-level jobsthey’re chasing. The tasks companies tend to give to young, green trainees – the routine grunt work they can’t easily mess up, which can be swiftly checked by someone more senior – are most vulnerable to automation precisely because they’re routine. Baby lawyers learn the ropes by drawing up endless contracts, but AI can do that in seconds. It’s probably capable of many things young journalists start out by doing too, like turning a simple press release into a story (or more depressingly, scraping clickbait content off rival websites). But if companies automate away the bottom rung of the ladder, how do you reach the next rung up? Tellingly, the job search site Adzuna reports a steeper drop in graduate opportunities than non-grad ones, according to an analysisshared this week with the Financial Times. The most critical shortages are in low-paid jobs such as care work, which can only be done for now by a real live human.If it’s any comfort to their anxious parents, most of this year’s boomerang kids will find their feet eventually. They might take longer to get where they want, and via more circuitous routes than in the past, but the current economic uncertainty can’t last for ever, and the jobs they’re qualified to do – if they can only get a foot in the door – still carry a lifetime premium. The ones to worry about are the kids who can’t, or won’t, go back home while they wait for something to turn up.We can’t keep doing this to young people and then be surprised when they’re angry. If we keep whipping them through the education system on the promise their efforts will be rewarded, and then fail to deliver, sooner or later, the consequences will boomerang back on us.Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsYoung peopleOpinionWork & careerscommentShareReuse this content"

How can this be ‘just another crime’?Rokhaya DialloIslamophobia is rampant in France. Official denial, even of the word itself,  is driving the hatredTue 13 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 09.03 EDTShareFriday is a holy day for practising Muslims – a time to observe the faith more deeply and, where possible, attend prayers at the mosque. That’s exactly what Aboubakar Cissé did early on Friday 25 April.In the southern French village of La Grand-Combe, Cissé, a 22-year-old carpenter originally from Mali, volunteered at his local mosque and was a familiar face among worshippers. So when he offered guidance through the prayers and rituals that Friday to a newcomer, a young manhe did not know, it was an entirely natural gesture. The stranger, however, had come to prayers with very different intentions.As Cissé bowed in prostration, he was stabbed with a knife 57 times. The assailant then posted a video on Snapchat of his victim writhing in agony in a pool of blood. In the video, a man can be heard saying “I did it” and insulting Allah.Yet in France, this death – and apparent targeting of a Muslim worshipper – has not been unequivocally understood as ahate crime.Ongoing controversy around the case is a dismaying reminder of how institutionally Islamophobic France is. For more than a fortnight, there have been public protests at the inadequacy of the investigation, thebiggest of which so fartook place in Paris on Sunday. But, with somenotable exceptions, in political and media circles more time has been devoted to debating whether a horrific killing in a place of worship deserves to be called “Islamophobic” than the terrifying implications of such violence for Europe’s biggest Muslim population.Right from the outset we can see double standards: following a misleading steer from the public prosecutor’s office, much of the French media including national news networkswrongly framed the atrocityas a dispute between worshippers,repeatingthis fake narrative over and over.After three days on the run, the suspect, a 20-year-old French national named as Olivier H, gave himself up to police in Italy. The suspect’s lawyerdeniedthat his client harboured any hatred towards “Muslims or mosques”. He has been charged in France with murder aggravated by premeditation on grounds of race or religion. Yet this was deemed insufficient to classify the case as a terrorist incident. The killing was an “isolated event”, the public prosecutor said, the suspect “driven by a violent urge, rather than ideology”.The political reactions one might reasonably have expected after violence of this nature in a mosque never came either.Bruno Retailleau, the interior minister who is also responsible for religious affairs, posted abrief messageof solidarity with the Muslim community on the day of the killing. But hedid not cancelany public engagements (numerous, as he is campaigning for the leadership of the conservative party Les Republicains) to immediately visit the town as he has done after otherviolent incidents.It took another full 24 hours for the prime minister, François Bayrou,to condemnthe“vile Islamophobia … shown on video” and another day after that for the president, Emmanuel Macron, topublicly comment, expressing condemnation of “racism” and “religious hatred” in France. He was quicker to express solidarityfollowing an attack in Vancouver – where a driver rammed a crowd – even though that tragedy, during a Filipino cultural event, occurred a day after the mosque attack in France.Aboubakar Cissé, who was stabbed in a mosque in the French town of La Grande-Combe on 25 April 2025.According to Mediapart, no member of the government nor any representative of the state took part in a silent march in La Grand-Combe. When Retailleau eventually showed up in the town on 27 April, alack of urgency criticisedeven within his own party, he limited his presence to closed-door talks at the sub-prefecture and announced security protection for mosques. He neitherwent to the mosquenor met the victim’s family.Asked in aTV interviewabout the delay, Retailleau blamed his caution on uncertaintyabout the motivationfor the crime, despite the video and the anti-Muslim sentiment the suspect had allegedly posted online. Throughout, Retailleau referred to the victim simply as “the individual”, never using his name, and laterblamedthe murder on our “multicultural society”.When a minute’s silence at the national assembly was proposed, the president of the chamber, Yaël Braun-Pivet,initially refused, claiming that minutes of silence were not observed for “individual cases”. Yet a few months earlier, silence had been observed for a young woman murdered by an undocumented immigrant, as well as for aFrench hostagekilled while being held by Hamas.Braun-Pivet eventually relented, but her counterpart in the senate refused to follow suit, claiming: “We only hold minutes of silence … for serious events, particularly terrorist attacks.”Why are France’s highest-ranking politicians so reluctant to call a horrendous assault a terrorist incident? The suspect apparently expressed a wish to strike at other Muslims in the video he allegedly posted on social media. Why does it seem so hard to see the obvious?Mourad Battikh, a lawyer representing Cissé’s distraught family, rightly described the decision not to have the case dealt with by thenational anti-terrorism prosecutor’s officeas “shocking”, and the first killing in a place of worship not to be treated as ideologically motivated.But there is a pattern here. When Muslims are targeted by hate crimes, the attackers’ motives are rarely, if ever, labelled as they should be.There is, as the journalist Widad Ketfi haspointed out, a glaring double standard for how attacks are reported depending on whether victims are in a mosque or at a synagogue.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Most of these crimes have gone unpunished by the justice system, were weakly condemned by political leaders and under-covered by the media. Islamophobia is rampant and yet, in its most violent expression, it is constantly downplayed as random crime and reported in forgettable headlines reserved for “faits divers” (news in brief), barely worthy of national news attention.Incredibly, the word Islamophobia itself isstill contested. Some ministers, including Retailleau,refuse to use it, alleging that it was created by Islamist extremists to prevent any criticism of Islam. That fake news wasdebunkedtwo decades ago. But the absence of a basic consensus on the term speaks volumes about the denialism surrounding the reality of Islamophobia as a form of racism.And yet, the facts are undeniable. Between January and March 2025, the number of recorded Islamophobic incidents in Francerose by 72%compared with the same period in 2024.In the days after Cissé’s death, a man wasarrested near a mosquecarrying a butcher’s knife, while a woman wearing a hijab says she was assaulted in the street and had herheadscarf forcibly removed. She was pushing her child in a pram. A man was run over and killed in front of his daughter last summer, after receiving explicitly Islamophobic threats. Yet his family isstill fightingfor the crime to be officially recognised as racially motivated.It is not that Islam is not discussed in the public sphere. It is constantly debated. Whether it’s banning Muslim women from wearingheadscarves in sports, thehyper-regulationof school dress codes, or thepassing of a lawwhose Islamophobic consequences have been condemned by human rights organisations, the daily lives of Muslims are increasingly hemmed in by an ever more intrusive political agenda.According to theNGO Sleeping Giants, in 2023 the words “immigration” and “Islam” appeared in the headline banners of CNews, the leading news network in France, 335 days out of 365.Meanwhile, Islamophobic rhetoric continues to proliferate and escalate. At a recent political rally, Retailleauopenly declared“Down with the veil”, which not only only breaches the principle of secularism but also undermines his role as minister for religious affairs and the state’s obligation to remain neutral.After Aboubakar Cissé’s brutal death, one might have expected the government to announce a plan to tackleIslamophobia.

Now it’s time to clear the air about what we have consented to and the nature of the relationship we will share with him over the next three years.Despite general dissatisfaction with the state of the field, we chose the steady guy whose main trick is his lack of tricks over the tough guy withradioactive ideas.While they had some performance issues in the lower house, the Greens, whose result in any other cycle would have been heroic, emerge as the nation’s preferred chaperone with the power to shepherd or stymie the government’s agenda.Different actors will interpret the election result to align with their own objectives; especially those who want Labor to be more ambitious after its thumping win. This week’s Guardian Essential report shows that proposition is contested.Which of the following is closer to your view Labor’s election mandate?Interestingly, while a strong majority of respondents want Labor to stick to the policies it took to the election, there is significant appetite among progressive voters, including those who actually voted for the government, to push harder.An election mandate is a tricky thing to articulate. At its heart it is what has been put before the electorate: the specific promises made, the declared no-go zones, the self-set KPIs. Within these parameters there’s a broader vibe that also demands respect.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailBeyond the specific transactions on cost-of-living relief such as Hecs debt reductions, cheaper medicine and childcare, energy bill support and a wafer-thin tax shave, the nature of the Albanese government’s mandate reveals itself like a pathway.The first element is embedded in Labor’s campaign tagline “Building Australia’s Future”, based on the proposition that the foundations had been set in the first term for a second term of focused delivery.Executing this part of the mandate is not about conceiving new policy, but building things: affordable homes, renewable infrastructure and the health services required to meet the ambitious promise of 90% bulk billing for Medicare.This shift in emphasis from regulating to doing embraces the provocation at the core of US commentators Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson’snew book Abundance, a compelling critique of progressives as the champions of inertia.Progressive lore, they argue, is laden with heroic battles for another piece of government regulation, another rule, another restriction. Many of these campaigns have been noble and necessary, but what happens when each victory places another constraint on action?Guardian Essential poll: PM’s approval rating surges amid calls to hurry upd housing and health reformRead moreObserving that the most progressive US states have the highest rates of homelessness, Klein and Thompson argue that while the right hates government and wants to render it impotent for ideological reasons, the left does as much damage by loving it to death.These words of caution may come too late for the US, where government has been Doge-d, but they are prescient for a Labor government setting itself hard targets the public now expect it to meet.A separate question shows the extent to which the public is up for acceleration, with very few believing that the key elements of Labor’s agenda should be slowed down or reprosecuted.With Labor now moving into their second term in government, do you want them to move quicker, slower, or at about the same pace to address the following issues?A second element of the mandate lies in the aspiration consistently invoked by the treasurer throughout the campaign to make the economy more “productive” – a woolly turn of phrase that vested interests use to promote their agenda.But if we take the productivity challenge at its true meaning – working smarter to get more value out of both capital and labour – this opens up a compelling case for the government to shape the way workplaces will be affected by AI.Last year’s Nobel prize in economics was awarded to Daron Acemoglu and Simon Johnson, who argue that technological change only renders genuine productivitywhen it is a tool designed by workers, not a cost-cutting magic bullet imposed on them.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Designing rights to empower workers becomes the key to unlocking the productivity the treasurer yearns.The third aspect of the Albanese mandate only fully emerged in the generous speeches of victor and vanquished on election night – when kindness, respect and civility, for a fleeting moment, took centre stage.While the election campaign was robust, it was not fought with hate; the centre held, the angry voices on the left and right underperformed in a time of global chaos. Clive Palmer threw millions of dollars at a vote that was never cast.The civility challenge is multifaceted : from protecting news media to addressing online harms, placing a duty of care on platforms and enforcing the social media ban on children. All will be vigorously opposed by the tech overlords who now have a tariff-wielding president to fire bullets on their behalf.Sadly, the two ministers who had done the work on two of the most important building blocks for building a more civil society, the former attorney general, Mark Dreyfus with his privacy reforms, and the former industry minister Ed Husic with his AI guardrails, have been replaced in a factional hit.Continuing their work and landing these important structural reforms is not just central to the government’s election mandate, but critical to its capacity to keep the public discourse tethered.While opaque, the Albanese mandate is neither lacking in ambition nor consequence: execution, productivity and civility, channelling the seismic changes in energy, technology and democracy for the common good.If the new government can find a way to weave these three strands into a coherent whole, rising above institutional inertia to embrace the complexity of emerging challenges in a collaborative way, this may become more than just a casual liaison.Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential, a progressive strategic communications and research company that conducts qualitative research for organisations including the ALPExplore more on these topicsEssential pollOpinionAnthony AlbaneseAustralian politicscommentShareReuse this content"

The Oscar-winning actor Juliette Binoche had barely begun her duties as Cannes jury president when she was asked to pass judgment on Depardieu and the wider culture of misogyny and sexual violence within the French film industry. “Interesting timing,” she said of the verdict.Depardieu denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted two women – a 54-year-old set dresser known only as Amélie and an unnamed 34-year-old assistant director – during production of the 2021 French drama The Green Shutters. But the judge ruled that the actor’s explanation of events was “unconvincing” beforesentencing him to an 18-month suspended jail term. Depardieu’s legal team said it would appeal the verdict.Speaking outside the Paris court, prosecuting lawyer Carine Durrieu-Diebolt celebrated the ruling and its implications. “It’s a victory for two women on a film set,” she said. “But it is also a victory for all the women behind this case and I’m thinking of all Depardieu’s other victims.” To date, more than 20 women have accused the 76-year-actor of sexual misconduct.0:33'Justice was done', says victim after Depardieu guilty verdict – videoTestifying in court, one of Depardieu’s victims, Amélie, recounted how the actor behaved like a “wild animal” on the set of The Green Shutters, trapping her between his thighs and groping her pubis, waist and chest. But speaking at Cannes, Binoche cautioned against labelling Depardieu as a beast.“He’s not a monster,” she said. “He’s a man who lost his aura owing to facts thatoccurred and were looked at by a court. The star of a film is a king for me. [But] what is sacred is when you create, when you act, and he is no longer sacred … Now the power lies elsewhere.”A French icon falls: Gérard Depardieu’s guilt will make his films hard to watchRead moreThe verdict dominated conversation on Cannes’ first day and threw an unwanted spotlight on an event that once welcomed Depardieu and Harvey Weinstein as honoured guests. Binoche, though, insisted that the festival has changed and has a duty of care to women who attend. “[The festival organisers] have a different awareness today,” she said. “They have an awareness of the actions they need to take and understand the need for people to speak out about the abuses they have suffered. It’s an important time. The #MeToo movement came [to France] later than it did to America, but it’s here now.” Depardieu’s conviction, she added, was “of course a result [of #MeToo].”Binoche – who won the 2010 Cannes best actress prize for her role in Certified Copy – presides over a majority-female jury that includes the actors Halle Berry and Alba Rohrwacher and the film-makers Leïla Slimani and Payal Kapadia. The gender make-up, she said, is further evidence of the festival’s progress. “That’s important to me and important for the whole world. It’s good to challenge the understanding of so-called male freedom.”The most lauded French actor of his generation, Depardieu was a Cannes regular for decades. He starred in the 1987 Palme d’Or winner Under Satan’s Sun, won the 1990 best actor award for Cyrano de Bergerac and played a behind-the-scenes role in the festival’s programme. Thierry Fremaux, Cannes’ delegate general, has admitted that he only agreed to screen 2014’s critically reviled football movie United Passions – in which Depardieu played Fifa founder Jules Rimet – because the star insisted on the film’s inclusion.Speaking to reporters ahead of the verdict, Fremaux wouldn’t say whether Depardieu would be invited to Cannes again. “If he has served his sentence as a citizen, what does one do?” Fremaux asked. “The festival – and public opinion – has to deal with these matters on a case-by-case basis.”Despite the ruling, Depardieu is likely to retain some support within the French film industry. The actor is reportedly currently shooting a film for the veteran actor-director Fanny Ardant, who had attended his trial. On Monday, moreover, 90-year-old Brigitte Bardot defended Depardieu’s behaviour on French television, criticising a world in which “talented people who touch the buttocks of a girl are consigned to the deepest dungeon.”Binoche was unmoved by these expressions of support. “I mean, we live in a country of freedom,” she said. “This is what it is. Some people [are still in] denial.”On the ground, away from the fray, it was defiant business as usual at the 78th Cannes film festival, where the opening night festivities include the presentation of an honorary Palme d’Or to Robert De Niro. Among the films in contention for this year’s top prize are Eddington, a modern-day western starring Pedro Pascal and Emma Stone, Richard Linklater’s Nouvelle Vague, about the making of Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless, and Die, My Love, a US-set drama from British director Lynne Ramsay. Other potential highlights include new work from Wes Anderson, Julia Ducournau and the dissident Iranian film-maker Jafar Panahi.Relishing her role as jury president, Binoche declined to speculate about this year’s lineup. “The secret is not to anticipate,” she said. “Judging the strength of a film is like acting. You know it’s good when you have it. You just have to trust what you’re feeling.”Explore more on these topicsCannes film festivalGérard DepardieuJuliette BinochenewsShareReuse this content"

As he takes over the Venice theatre biennale, the star lets us know what to expect: cut-up plays and a Pinocchio unlike any otherTue 13 May 2025 11.14 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 11.53 EDTShareSitting in his house in Rome, an overstuffed bookcase and a distressed wooden door behind him,Willem Dafoescrunches his hair as though kneading the thoughts in his head. The 69-year-old, Wisconsin-born actor could pass today for any genial, bristle-moustached handyman in checked shirt and horn-rimmed specs. (Perhaps he even built the bookcase and distressed the door himself.) But it’s that hand that is the giveaway: it keeps scrunching as he talks until the hair is standing in jagged forks. As a visualisation of what is happening in his brain, it is second to none.We are speaking in April on the anniversary of Shakespeare’s birth (and death), which feels apt given that it is Dafoe’s two-year appointment as artistic director of the international theatre festival at theVenice Biennalethat has occasioned our video call today. He looks sheepish when I point out the significance of the date, then reverts to his usual wolfish expression. “Ah, Shakespeare doesn’t care,” he says with a wave of the hand. Dafoe has never had much of a relationship with those plays. “There’s a lot of pointing and indicating when people perform them. A lot of leading the audience. Those are things I don’t think are very vital. But it’s such beautiful writing, and I’ve become interested in doing Shakespeare in my dotage.” Could there be a Lear on the horizon? “Why not?” he says with a goofy wobble of the head.In one play, he stands in the sea dressed as a nun and brandishing a fishThere is no Shakespeare in Dafoe’s Biennale selection. The accent, in a programme entitled “Theatre is Body. Body is Poetry”, is firmly on the experimental and avant garde. There will be work directed by Thomas Ostermeier and Milo Rau. Davide Iodice will present a version of Pinocchio in which young autistic actors and actors with Down’s syndrome will bring to life assorted incarnations of the title character. Dafoe has also included the European premiere of Symphony of Rats by Richard Foreman, the experimental playwright who died in January, and whom he counted as a friend. Nearly 40 years after its first production, the play will be staged by the pioneering New York companythe Wooster Group, which Dafoe co-founded. “Richard told them, ‘Do whatever you want with it. But I don’t want to recognise it,’” he says admiringly.View image in fullscreenBy a nose … Davide Iodice’s Pinocchio.Photograph: Renato EspositoThe actor will take part in Foreman’s No Title, during which he and Simonetta Solder will read phrases from cards drawn at random in what sounds like a theatrical cousin of the Burroughsian cut-up technique. “Richard was a loose thinker,” he explains. “His responses were always unpredictable.” Dafoe is approaching his Venice tenure with the same sangfroid he witnessed in Foreman. “Some of these pieces will sail, some won’t. What’s important is people talking about stuff, feeling that the theatre is alive.”A four-time Oscar nominee, Dafoe has been a transfixing screen presence ever since his Kabuki-like turns in the early 1980s in Kathryn Bigelow’s fetishistic biker movie The Loveless and Walter Hill’s pulp fantasyStreets of Fire, where he sported black vinyl hip-waders, a ducktail hairdo and cheekbones that could win in a knife fight. He was the sergeant who perishes to the sound of Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings in Oliver Stone’s Platoon, then made the messiah crushingly human in Martin Scorsese’s The Last Temptation of Christ. More recently he has appeared in films by Wes Anderson, Robert Eggers and Yorgos Lanthimos. In Lars von Trier’s Antichrist, he had his penis pulverised by Charlotte Gainsbourg. Well, it’s a living.His roots and his heart, however, belong to experimental theatre. Along with his former partner Elizabeth LeCompte, the monologuist Spalding Gray and others, Dafoe created the Wooster Group in the latter half of the 1970s from the ashes of Richard Schechner’s Performance Group. For nearly 30 years, Dafoe wrote, acted and helped build sets in the same converted factory in lower Manhattan that remains the group’s base today. He only drifted away in 2004 when he left LeCompte – with whom he has an adult son – and married the film-maker Giada Colagrande.Could those of us who have never seen him live on stage truly be said to “get” who he is as an actor? “I think I’ve given up on the idea of anyone getting me,” he admits. “I probably had it when I was younger. Now I like the idea of every project redefining you.”He pitched up in New York at 22, fresh from another experimental group, Milwaukee’sTheatreX. “I didn’t have anything up my sleeve. I was just a kid from the midwest going to the big, bad city. New York was rough then, but I saw these people who were making things outside of any commercial system. They stirred something in me intellectually, emotionally, romantically. That’s what I went towards. I made myself available to them and they liked that sense of availability. I started working very modestly, doing small parts and being a carpenter. Then Spalding invited me to work on the creation of a piece called Point Judith.”Nothing short of a time machine could return us to the intoxicating heyday of New York’s fringe theatre scene, but there are mouth-watering titbits available online showing Dafoe at work in pieces stretching back to the late 1970s. The clips don’t seem too far from his more berserk screen creations, such as the sleazy crook Bobby Peru, rotten of mind and tooth, in David Lynch’sWild at Heart, or the feverish seadog with a Popeye pipe in Eggers’ The Lighthouse. Aclip from Point Judith, for instance, shows Dafoe standing in the sea dressed as a nun while brandishing a fish. “Well yeah, that was a small part of it,” he concedes, perhaps eager not to have decades of intrepid theatrical adventures reduced to a trout and a wimple.Skip forward to the group’s 1991 showToday I Must Sincerely Congratulate You, and this time he is wearing a suit and a moptop like an early-1960s Beatle, and once again holding a dead fish. What gives? “I’m in to fish,” he shrugs. “So there.”View image in fullscreenDefinitely not Mr Bean’s Holiday … Dafoe with the Wooster Group in 2002.Photograph: Tristram KentonThe concept of a Wooster Group piece being “ready” was always elastic. The company would simply rehearse throughout the day and perform whatever they had that evening. The headline to a 2020 Harper’s article summed up the philosophy nicely: “The 40-Year Rehearsal: The Wooster Group’s endless work in progress.” Film was often incorporated into the shows, along with prerecorded audio to which the cast would sometimes lip-sync. The material featured unlikely bedfellows: Flaubert and Lenny Bruce, say, or a soap opera version of Thornton Wilder’s Our Town coupled with the vaudevillian skits of the African American comic Pigmeat Markham.Acclaim was not universal. Arthur Miller refused to permit the group to perform part ofThe Cruciblein their show LSD, but they carried on anyway until he threatened legal action. The estates of Harold Pinter and Tennessee Williams also withdrew permission. Brickbats rained down from critics, Dafoe tells me. “We were given a hard time. Eventually we found that word-of-mouth was better than a snarky review in the Village Voice, so Liz, in her infinite wisdom, stopped allowing the critics in. Once we started to have some appreciation in Europe, the New York critics began asking to come. This time they were more generous with how they placed us in the landscape.”The Wooster Group’s influence today is ubiquitous. Take the use of microphones in Ostermeier’s work, including his recent, vital production ofThe Seagullwith Cate Blanchett. “Yeah, the microphones were a thing we did that I started seeing crop up a lot,” Dafoe agrees. “We started out working somewhat in isolation. Once we started touring, we’d come back to places and say, ‘Wow,thatlooks familiar.’ I don’t mean that in a snotty way – it’s how things work. People came through as interns and then 10 years later they would be Broadway directors.”View image in fullscreenCheekbones that could win in a knife fight … Dafoe in The Loveless (1981).Photograph: Collection Christophel/AlamyAnyone who has seen productions byComplicitéwill have witnessed the Wooster effect. “Simon McBurney’s a friend, and definitely he saw the work. He’s a sponge.” McBurney was also one of the writers on Mr Bean’s Holiday, in which Dafoe plays a pretentious arthouse director whose Cannes premiere is hijacked by Rowan Atkinson’s slapstick hero. “Simon directed the film-makers toward me, so I can thank him for that particular experience,” Dafoe laughs. The traffic flows both ways: he in turn suggested McBurney for roles in Abel Ferrara’s Siberia and Eggers’ recent Nosferatu, neither of them half as much fun as Mr Bean.Dafoe is diplomatic today about whether he prefers acting for theatre or cinema. “Musicians are musicians – sometimes they play in the studio and sometimes they play live.” But evidently it is the stage that unlocks his deepest passion. “What you’re seeing isn’t going to happen again at nine o’clock, eleven o’clock. Something beautiful in the theatre stays with you for ever, because it happened toyou. Theatre puts your feet to the fire, it puts your finger in the wound.” The hand has stopped scrunching now. “And you can’t beat that.”TheVenice theatre biennale, directed by Willem Dafoe, runs from 31 May to 15 JuneExplore more on these topicsTheatreWillem DafoeVenice BiennalefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The wall behind me is stacked with a rainbow of yarns, and on her desk sit a collection of texts that point to the key themes of her work: femininity, magic and the uncanny. Perach’s life-size humanoid sculptures made of tufted carpet surround us, their presence equal parts eerie and warming. Their strange humanity seems steeped in narrative, which she draws from folklore and fairytales.The sculptures cry out to be touched, with their beautifully fluffy, varied and multicoloured surfaces. They are, as she says, “aesthetically overbearing”. Perach’s work is in part about the porous boundaries between bodies and the world. Their intense tactility, meanwhile, brings out a childish desire to sink your fingers deep into a comforting, if slightly spooky, softness. And their hollowness asks the viewer to imagine a body inside them – when exhibiting the works, performers do inhabit them and bring them to life.I grew up with tons of carpet. It’s heavy and weird – but creates cosinessPerach was born in Ukraine behind the iron curtain, and Soviet aesthetics are foundational to her work. But her medium of tufted carpet came to her intuitively. “I grew up with tons of carpet. It has an uncanniness: it’s heavy and weird, but it also creates cosiness and home.” She describes the tension between excess and scarcity in the history of Russian taste, and the way that desire for abundant patterns and textures has always influenced her. “I intuitively make work from what I know. I think we all do,” she says. The unexpected way she uses carpets or rugs brings to mind the phrase “sweeping it under the rug”; Perach smiles as she tells me that her work tries to show “what’s under the rug”.View image in fullscreen‘I make work from what I know’ … Anna Perach in her studio.Photograph: Linda Nylind/The GuardianFor her new exhibition at Richard Saltoun in London, Perach has made a series of sculptures and works on paper that respond to the 1817 ETA Hoffman story The Sandman, about a love triangle between a man, his fiancee and an automaton. There is a moment in the story when the automaton, Olympia, is singing in public and glitches, behaving strangely and revealing to the audience that she is only a machine. Inspired by this moment, Perach has made two identical sculptures in the shape of Victorian dresses that will be activated in the gallery space: one by a human hidden inside, and one by a machine. Perach wants to explore how viewers will respond to the disjuncture – the glitch – of realising that they can’t immediately tell which is which.“It’s not inspired by AI,” she is quick to tell me, but the discomfort the story raises is connected to the questions we’re dealing with today around automation and artificial intelligence. “The terror of automatons or AI is the way they play with your assumptions of humanity, which in turn makes you question your own humanity.” She has titled the exhibition A Leap of Sympathy, a phrase borrowed from philosopher Henri Bergson referring to the way that we are all constantly making the assumption that the people around us are fellow humans, so that we can connect with them. Perach’s work asks what happens when that assumption is called into question.This is the first time she has used mechanics or robotics in her sculptures. In previous exhibitions, as well as this one, Perach worked in collaboration with choreographer Luigi Ambrosio, sound composer Laima Leyton and performer Maria Sole Montaci. Perach has only performed inside the sculptures herself a few times. “I see myself more and more as a director – I can’t be master of all crafts,” she says. Working with her collaborators gives her access to a range of expertise to bring her work to life.View image in fullscreenProud legacy … Uncanny Valley by Anna Perach.Photograph: The ArtistPerach purposefully walks the line between craft and fine art. “I push the craft element to the extreme,” she says. That aspect of her work is another way she engages with femininity – after all, women have traditionally been associated with craft and especially with textile work. The way her carpet figures have peeled off their two-dimensional stretcher to take up space in the room makes a case against the hierarchy that has traditionally seen media other than painting or sculpting with marble or bronze looked down on. They sit proudly in a legacy of pagan eastern European visual traditions, with their monstrous masked beasts and colourful traditional folk attire.She has started to branch out into other materials – most recently glass – but can’t imagine letting go of carpet. “The material is so forgiving and malleable, and it can be manipulated in so many ways,” she explains. She started out by cutting up existing carpets to make sculptures with them, but wanted more control over the material. Her practice now incorporates both mechanical and manual processes of tufting, and allows her to control the supply chain feeding her work – “I know where my yarn comes from,” she says.Perach’s work takes a long view of history – and of life. “I’m fascinated by the split between spirit and matter,” she says. “I’m trying to go back to that place of trauma, of split.” The drift away from magical and mystical ways of understanding the world towards highly scientific ones is one of the defining features of modernity. “As we grow up – as individuals and as a society – we are forced to rationalise. There is an element of refusal to do so in my work,” she says.As we talk about the many new questions arising around AI and new digital innovations, she reminds me that many of those questions are actually old, if not ancient. Stories such as Hoffman’s, or Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein,grappled with the threat of non-human life long before we ever imagined the details of something like ChatGPT. Reflecting on the fundamental questions at the core of all those works, she says: “It’s really an ancient fantasy to give something life. Which in a way is what I do.”A Leap of Sympathy is atRichard Saltoun, London, 15 May to 24 JuneExplore more on these topicsInstallationArtTextile artSculpturefeaturesShareReuse this content"

All that time, she thought her missing little sister, Alison, might still be out there. Dez would watch documentaries about homelessness to see if perhaps she’d recognise a face, and even attempted the Salvation Army’s family tracing service. “It was hope,” she says from her home in the Netherlands.Hope faded one day in 1994. Calling her from the UK, Dez’s mother-in-law cried down the phone. There was panic, there was confusion, “so I had to ask her. And then she said it was in the papers that the remains had been identified as Alison.”Back in England, one story was gripping the nation: Fred and Rose West. With every detail plastered on news channels and filling newspapers, the country was obsessed with the serial killers who for nearly three decades had been on an undetected murder spree, abducting young women, torturing them, mutilating them, and burying the bodies in the garden of their Gloucester home. Some of those bodies were the West’s own children.Alison had gone missing in the late 1970s. A rough relationship with authority meant she ended up in care as a teenager, then ran away, social services told her family. She was taken in by a couple in Gloucester, looking after their children and doing housework in return. “They know that I was in care, and are more than willing to help me on my feet,” Alison wrote in a letter to her mother in the early 80s. “I have accepted them as a second family.”It was the worst second family she could have had: the Wests, whose gruesome crimes – and the people who were left to pick up the pieces – are the subject of Netflix’s new three-part documentary series, Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story.View image in fullscreen‘I agreed to do this to bring Alison to life, but also for myself – for the closure’ … Dez Chambers.Photograph: NetflixIt’s a documentary which, using unseen police video and unheard interview recordings with Fred West, brings new insight to some of the worst serial killers Britain has ever seen. The show reveals how the pair abused and murdered 12 young women, how the police carried out their investigation, and how the families coped, featuring interviews with relatives of the deceased – some of whom have never spoken in public before.Those interviews were the stories director Dan Dewsbury wanted front and centre. “I really wanted to make sure that people understood this was a real thing that still affects these people today,” he says. “It’s one of the world’s most known crimes. The hope is that [viewers] will come out of it thinking a lot of different things beyond just the crime that was committed.”It’s a new approach for the now omnipresent true-crime format. While most focus on the twists and turns, the mystery and bloodshed, Dewsbury’s version of this well-known case tries to put empathy for those affected at the heart of the storytelling. “They wanted to bring the victims to life, and I wanted to do that too,” says Chambers, who has turned down other interviews in the past for fear of objectifying her little sister and reopening traumatic wounds. “That’s why I agreed to do this one, to bring Alison to life, but also for myself – for the closure.”Despite Dewsbury’s victim-first approach, the series does still hit notes required for any Netflix true-crime series. There’s creepy music with reversed vocals, glossy talking heads mixed with grainy archive footage, and ghostly Polaroids frequently popping up on screen. Dewsbury says he had to pick his battles regarding how far he could shake up the format. “The advantage is you’ve got a readymade audience,” he says of the genre. “The disadvantage is they may have a predisposition of what they want that series to be. It’s up to me to push against some of that.”This is a story that has been told many times, and it required input from the lawyers, police and forensic experts involved in the case. How hard was it to keep these interviewees fresh? “They become desensitised to it,” Dewsbury says. He kept notes of what the contributors had said in previous interviews, and alerted them when they were repeating themselves. “I want people to give an authentic interview, really connect into what I’m trying to do – not resort to media-speak or what worked last time.”View image in fullscreenBehind the mask … Rose and Fred West.Photograph: NetflixThe previously unseen footage is bone-chilling. Viewers see tapes of West family home videos, police digging up bodies in the garden, shots from inside the “House of Horrors” punctuated by archive material of the media frenzy around the case. But perhaps most shocking is the police footage of Fred at his home, handcuffed to detectives, being forced to locate his victims buried in the foundations. “There was a bone in there last time,” West grunts in his thick Gloucester accent, pointing at a corner of his excavated garden and referencing a previous visit.In one scene, we’re carried via police camcorder through the house, into the bespoke voids where carpenter West filmed his crimes. “It was clear that Fred had been able to adapt the building to his sexual pleasure,” forensic psychologist Paul Britton says to the cameras.During the research period, Dewsbury digested hundreds of hours of grisly archive material, which included footage of locals expressing their disbelief that a friendly couple from the community was committing these atrocities under everyone’s noses. “I think about the reconciliation those people must have gone through, because it genuinely felt like a shock, to that road, to that street, to that town, to that country,” he says. “It made me come face to face with this idea of the mask that people can put on.”Those involved in the case make for compelling viewing. Some are cartoonish and others understated – it’s remarkable to think this motley crew were at the heart of the biggest murder story in the world at the time. There’s Howard Sounes, the caricature Fleet Street hack who pays sources for exclusive stories. There’s Howard Ogden, the small-time local lawyer brought in to represent Fred in a case that may have been above his pay grade. There’s even an appearance from Brian Leveson, at the time a rising star in the legal world and the prosecuting lawyer in the West’s trial. “I have prosecuted all sorts of crime,” he says. “But if I had to identify one case that lives with me the most, this is the case.”But this is not just a documentary about two of the worst killers in British history. It’s a story of miscarriages of justice, incompetent authorities who didn’t join the dots, and vulnerable young women – some runaways, some leaving care – who became easy to hide when the state wasn’t looking for them. The Wests had been in contact with social services since the 60s, and a string of sexual assaults had gone unpunished. Dewsbury believes the lessons of the case apply to 2025. “I think the process by which Fred and Rose got away with what they did might be slightly unique to that period of time, but the undercurrent of what was going on is really relevant to now,” he says.One truly staggering missed opportunity is the case of Caroline Owens, one of the Wests’ nannies who was abducted, raped and abused by the pair in 1973. She escaped and bravely reported the crimes to the police, but the Wests inexplicably got off with a £50 fine. “It was a missed opportunity to raise the profile of Fred and Rose and identify them as possible sex offenders who could carry out abductions, kidnapping and imprisonment,” says detective constable Russ Williams in the documentary. “They did get off lightly with it.”Chambers wouldn’t usually watch a documentary with “Fred and Rose West” in the title, but she plans on tuning in to this one. “It’ll be tough, because there’s things I likely didn’t know, and things I might have forgotten,” she says. “But I stand behind it, because it’s about the victims. I’ll have to watch it all in one go, because I won’t be able to sleep in between.”Fred and Rose West: A British Horror Story is on Netflix on 14 May.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Australia’sMilkshake Man by Go-Jois quite self-explanatory; the standout is Finland’s Erika Vikman with Ich Komme (“I am coming” in German). Set to a four-on-the-floor beat and Eurodance instrumental, the track bursts with unrestrained hands-in-the-air energy. Vikman sings of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance with a vigour reminiscent of Norway’s 2023 entry Queen of the Kings, by Alessandra. Vikman hails from a family of Finnish tango musicians – her mother and sister are both active in the genre – and she herself embraced it early in her career. Still, back in 2020, her breakout hit was another sex-positive, disco-inspired anthem: Cicciolina, which celebrates the boldness and self-determination of the Hungarian-born porn star Ilona Staller.Lucio Corsi – Volevo Essere un Duro (Italy)Italy’s entries have always portrayed masculinity in a way that’s more layered than meets the eye, with performers and songwriters such as Cristiano Malgioglio, Renato Zero, and Ivan Cattaneo challenging machismo. In 2025, Lucio Corsi takes the baton with Volevo Essere un Duro (I wanted to be a tough guy), which challenges gendered preconceptions. Melodically, it has hints of 1970s glam rock and Elton John’s ballads, and it conjures a fairytale-like atmosphere that’s amplified by Corsi’s elven-like self-presentation. There’s a bit of a fairytale to his place here, too: he placed second at the Sanremo music festival – to determine Italy’s contender – but got to compete after the winner Olly declined to participate.Emmy – Laika Party (Ireland)Upon learning about the bleak fate of the space dog Laika, Norwegian pop star Emmy tried to envision an alternate story: what if she had not been left to die in space but instead enjoyed dancing among the stars and comets? A delightful synthesis of Aqua, Grimes and a hint of Mario Kart’s Rainbow Road allows us to imagine her partying like it’s 1999. But why is a Norwegian singing about the Soviet space dog Laika representing Ireland, you may ask? Technically, Laika Party counts one Irish and three Norwegian songwriters. It had originally been submitted as a candidate to Norway’s national contest Melodi Grand Prix, only to be rejected by the broadcaster. Ireland’s Eurosong accepted it and it won both the national jury and the televote. Technicalities exist, and should be taken advantage of!Princ – Mila (Serbia)“Dear, you paid the price of me loving you,” goes the refrain of Mila, a heart-rending Balkan power ballad about the end of a toxic relationship. The artist is polymath Princ – frontman of the rock band Sisyphus, former karate champion, philologist and language instructor with a degree in Scandinavian languages, literature and culture, and Jesus in the 2020 Serbian production of Jesus Christ Superstar. While the lyrics portray a slighted man grovelling in the aftermath of the relationship – at one point calling his beloved’s new partner a “liar” – Princ’s delivery renders him tortured and sympathetic rather than pathetic.Laura Thorn – La Poupée Monte le Son (Luxembourg)Dolls and their agency – or lack thereof – are a great musical and artistic trope: look at the ballet Coppélia, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang’s Doll on a Music Box and Aqua’s Barbie Girl. The LuxembourgianEurovisionentry La Poupée Monte le Son (the doll turns up the volume) by Laura Thorn is a tribute to France Gall’s song Poupée de Cire, Poupée de Son, composed by Serge Gainsbourg, which won Eurovision 60 years ago. However, over a melody that combines strings, a four-to-the-floor beat and a vaguely eerie music-box melody, Thorn’s doll asserts “je ne suis pas ta marionnette” and lifts from Bizet to warn the man she addresses: “Prends garde à toi” – watch yourself.Tommy Cash – Espresso Macchiato (Estonia)Amore, spaghetti, mafia and espresso are the basis of Tommy Cash’s rap-dance ode to Italian cliches: “Mi like to fly privati / With 24 carati / Also mi casa very grandioso / Mi money numeroso.” It shares no thematic similarities with Sabrina Carpenter’s Espresso but rather DJ Ötzi’s après-ski anthem Pronto Giuseppe!, and in a year where a host of vaguely Italian-themed, AI-generated surrealist memes known as “Italian brainrot” are going viral, the nonsense of Espresso Macchiato fully embodies the zeitgeist. Cash co-wrote it with Johannes Naukkarinen, who gave us the metal-dance-pop fusion track and 2023 Finnish Eurovision entry Cha Cha Cha by Käärijä, in which the drink of choice is piña colada.KAJ – Bara Bada Bastu (Sweden)We don’t want to host if KAJ’s sauna song wins Eurovision, says Swedish city of MalmöRead moreAs the land of Max Martin and Abba, Sweden has historically sent legit – albeit perhaps too clean-cut – pop acts to Eurovision. This year they abruptly changed artistic direction, and along came KAJ, a Fenno-Swedish music/comedy group that credits the unapologetic weirdness of past Finnish acts for the inspiration behind their song, Bara Bada Bastu (let’s take a sauna), performed in the Vörå dialect and featuring that other traditional Eurovision sound, the folksy, pan-European accordion. (A line about dropping the soap was expunged from the final cut.) At this year’s Melodifestivalen – Sweden’s contest to name their Eurovision entrant – KAJ started as the underdog but ended up winning as well as topping Spotify’s global viral chart.Melody – Esa Diva (Spain)In 2001, age 10, Spanish singer Melody released the Euro-rumba tune El Baile del Gorila, complete with ape-channelling choreography: the start of a successful career in the Spanish and Latin-American market. In 2025, she’s representing Eurovision with the anthemic Esa Diva (that diva). It starts as an introspective ballad, similar to 2014 winner Conchita Wurst’s Rise Like a Phoenix, with Melody herself reminiscing on her career. Then the chorus hits and the beat drops, and she offers her own expansive definition of what makes a diva: not just someone who does not step on others in order to shine, or someone who can rise again “with more strength than a hurricane”, but a mother who wakes up early and a struggling artist. The thumping bass lines and lyrics celebrating a person’s own uniqueness irrespective of their life circumstances makes this 2025’s equivalent to Emma Muscat’s 2022 entry for Malta, I Am What I Am.Ziferblat – Bird of Pray (Ukraine)What would Bohemian Rhapsody sound like if it were composed for Eurovision by a Ukrainian alt-rock band in 2025? Ziferblat’s Bird of Pray feels straight out of a 70s rock opera; it balances various elements, including an all-female choir conjuring a sacred atmosphere, rock anthemics and the theatrics of singer Danylo Leshchynskyi, whose presentation echoes Bowie. The lyrics provide a sombre contrast to the high-octane production, telling the story of Ukrainians who have been separated by the war, with the titular bird conveying a message of hope – it’s a bird ofpray,not prey.Sissal – Hallucination (Denmark)With an electronic base reminiscent of Sia and David Guetta’s collaborations, and with powerhouse, Adele-lite vocals that stave off predictability, Sissal’s Hallucination is a neatly packaged EDM-scandi-pop record that feels like a welcome 2010s throwback (akin to Carola’s Invincible and Loreen’s Euphoria). This is not a coincidence: Sissal’s inspirations are Norwegian singer Dagny and Swedish singer Robyn. Is it a bit safe? Sure, but high camp, sexual innuendo and joyous nonsense need a counterpoint to avoid the contest descending into caricature. Plus, the obsessive posters on Eurovision forums and subreddits swear she is best on stage.The grand final of the Eurovision song contest 2025 will take place in Basel, Switzerland, on 17 May.

Inone image– including the artists Paul Thek and Eva Hesse – the writer Linda Rosenkrantz stands near the centre. “That was mostly people that I had gotten together, some who became very well-known,” Rosenkrantz tells me by phone from California. “Five or six of us would go ice-skating or dancing on Friday nights.”Rosenkrantz grew up in the Bronx in the 1930s. After university she moved to Manhattan to work in the publicity and editorial department of the Parke-Bernet auction house, becoming enmeshed in the city’s art scene. “I met Hujar in 1956. We hit it off immediately,” she says.Hujar and Rosenkrantzremained close until his death from Aids-related complications in 1987.View image in fullscreenIn crowd … from The Tribe by Peter Hujar, including Linda Rosenkrantz sitting on the floor.Photograph: Peter Hujar Archive LLC, Artists Rights Society ARS.In the 70s, when Rosenkrantz was an established writer, she asked various artists to note everything that happened to them on a specific day, and then read it out for her to record. The first two were Hujar and the painter Chuck Close . The latter’s day – 18 December 1974 – featured a job photographing Allen Ginsberg for theNew YorkTimes.The project eventually ran out of steam and Rosenkrantz didn’t give it much thought until decades later, when Hujar’s archive went to theMorgan Libraryin New York and she donated the material. Eventually the publisher Magic Hour Press discovered it and in 2021 released their discussion as the book,Peter Hujar’s Day. Now it’s been adapted intoa film by Passages director Ira Sachs, with Ben Whishaw as Hujar and Rebecca Hall playing Rosenkrantz.“When Ira Sachs signed up for the film, he got in touch and I instinctively felt that he was the right person to do it, because I had liked his other films,” says Rosenkrantz. “It’s been a great experience for me, and it was so serendipitous.”The film, which premiered to good reviewsat Sundance, is due for release later this year. It plays into a recent surge of interest in Hujar, with an acclaimed showat Raven Row in London, after an exhibition at the Venice Biennale last year. While Hujar has been celebrated in the decades since his death, Rosenkrantz remains lesser known.View image in fullscreen‘It’s been a great experience for me’ … Rosenkrantz (right) with Rebecca Hall at the Sundance premiere of Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: Charles Sykes/Invision/APAged 90, she is living in Santa Monica in California. Her husband of 50 years, the Guernsey-born writer and artist Christopher Finch, died three years ago. When I contact Rosenkrantz about an interview, she cautions that she’s not very articulate, which is ironic given how heavily speech features in her work.She is best known for the cult book Talk from 1968, a dialogue-only “reality” novel, in which she spent months taping her conversations with friends. She then transcribed hours of tape into 1,500 pages of text, eventually whittling it to a story of three friends in their late 20s, spending a summer by a Long Island beach.It was a raw, funny book presenting people from the Warholian art crowd talking about sex, drugs, psychoanalysis and much else. (Sample chapter title: Emily, Marsha and Vincent Discuss Orgies).The book captured the modern moment in a novel way. “That kind of thing was in the zeitgeist. Artists were painting from photographs,” she says. “It just struck me as I was getting ready to go to East Hampton that I should take a tape recorder and I always had it in mind as a book.”It caused a minor stir.New York magazineran two reviews, alongside a photo of Rosenkrantz on the beach in a bikini, tape recorder by her side. Not all responses were kind. “It was mocked for all the talk of sex, drugs and therapy. There was a minister or some church person in Britain who thought it should be banned,” she recalls.It had its admirers too; Harold Pinter sent a note of praise, George Romero’sproduction companywanted the film rights and Leonard Cohen was a fan. “He said that he had read it out loud walking on the beach,” she says, “and that he had tried to do something similar and decided that it couldn’t be done and that I had done it.”Through the 60s and 70s, she was an art world insider, encountering the likes of Susan Sontag and David Hockney, going to Andy Warhol’s parties at the Factory. While working at Parke-Bernet, then acquired by Sotheby’s, she set up and edited their art magazine.She met her husband while running the magazine. He was a friend of Chuck Close and later she was the subject of one of the painter’slarge-scale portraits, not that sitting for him was particularly dramatic: “He took a polaroid. It was very quick and not a lot of talking or direction.”View image in fullscreen‘We hit it off immediately’ … Rosenkrantz and Hujar in Florence in 1958.Photograph: Joseph RaffaelAfter Talk was published, she tried more tape experiments, including the day-in-a-life recordings, while another idea, Ex, had gallows humour: “I invited, one by one, about a dozen ex-boyfriends to dinner and taped the whole evening, and they’re pretty funny.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They co-wrote anovel called Soho, a multi-generational saga set in the Manhattan neighbourhood, and Gone Hollywood, a social history of cinema’s golden age. “We worked very well together,” she says, though Soho – written under the pseudonym CL Byrd – “did not make an impact.”In 1990, the couple and their daughter Chloe left New York for LA, shortly after Rosenkrantz started a new track. A friend, Pamela Redmond Satran was an editor at Glamor magazine: “I pitched the idea of doing an article about baby names. And she said, ‘You know, I think this could be a book’.”Before this, there were just books with lists of names; Rosenkrantz and Satran added more analysis with social context and trends. “The first one, which was called Beyond Jennifer and Jason, sold very, very well,” she says. This was followed by nine more books. They set up a website,nameberry.com, to collect everything. “It influenced the culture in a major way.”Whether anticipating thebabynaming industry, or developing new approaches to storytelling, Rosenkrantz always had a knack for the new. “My father used to say that I was ahead of my time when I was quite young,” she says. She has also “always been attracted to unusual forms”, which led her to publish a memoir in the style of a listicle, before they were BuzzFed to death.View image in fullscreenWry self-awareness … Peter Hujar’s Day.Photograph: © Ira SachsMy Life As a List: 207 Things About My (Bronx) Childhood waspublished in 1999. But by the 00s, her most significant work – Talk - was no longer in wide circulation. One reason for its muddled reception was that her publishers presented it as a straightforward novel, rather than a recorded rendering of reality. But in 2015, when New York Review Books revived Talk in their Classics strand, she says, “It was a complete reversal. It got great reviews and was seen for what it was. I kind of insisted that it had to be what it was meant to be, which was a taped book. I felt very redeemed.”The book was praised as a blast of 60s counterculture and for its prescient view of neurotic city dwellers. CriticBecca Rothfield wrotethat it “reminds us that wry self-awareness and anxious fragility are hardly a millennial invention”. It was seen as presaging the autofiction boom of the 2010s and likened to the TV shows Girls and Broad City.Then in 2018, Lena Dunham’s website Lenny Letter revived parts of the Ex project:publishing transcriptsof Rosenkrantz’s boyfriend dinners, rendered in comic strip form.Today Rosenkrantz wants to do more with Ex, and revisit diaries she kept years ago. When Peter Hujar’s Day was published, she was said to be working on a book called Namedrops Keep Falling on My Head, about the people she’s met through the years. She says now that it’s not enough for a book but perhaps it will appear in another form. It takes in everyone from Janet Malcolm, David Hockney and Fred Astaire, to the beat poet Gregory Corso with whom she had a relationship. Meanwhile, she hopes the new film prompts interest in a screen version of Talk. “It has real scenes as opposed to thePeter Hujar[book].”How does she feel about Rebecca Hall’s representation of her in Peter Hujar’s Day? “I’m very happy with it,” she says. “Most of it is Peter talking, but she doesn’t get to say very much, or I didn’t say very much. But she sort of captured the way I would have responded.” This hints at a self-effacing matter-of-factness to Rosencrantz. She doesn’t give off a sense of thwarted ambition or great regrets – just a life lived well.In the original Peter Hujar transcript, there’s a moment where Rosenkrantz explains her motive for the project: “To find out how people fill up their days, because I myself feel like I don’t do anything much all day.” The fact that at 90 she’s still developing work seems to prove otherwise.Explore more on these topicsArtPeter HujarPhotographyNew YorkFictioninterviewsShareReuse this content"

How did he bounce back?Tue 13 May 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 07.04 EDTShareAll stories of addiction are grim and harrowing, but Patrick Dougher’s memoir reads like a picaresque comedy at times – albeit one laced with trauma and tragedy. There are hilarious tales of eccentric characters, like the great-aunt with enormous buttocks who killed his kitten by sitting on it: “That booty made all the decisions, and Aunt Cat, she just followed obediently.” And there are almost unbelievable episodes from Dougher’s life: his near-death experience in a crashing elevator, playing drums in Sade’s band, being stalked by a serial killer, finding a kilo of cocaine hidden inside a stolen table football machine. It almost sounds fun. And yet Dougher’s life is also a story of emotional damage, homelessness, self-destruction, loss and regret.“The life of an addict, or at least my life, it is the full spectrum, it’s the polarities,” he says. “You can have incredible moments of exhilaration and joy and excitement, and it puts you in situations where you’re surrounded by unique characters, and then obviously the downside, which is pain and suffering and all of that stuff.” And yet, somehow, Dougher made it out the other side. “I would say I had a charmed life,” he says.View image in fullscreenDecomposition, by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAt one point he spent a month sleeping on a park bench; today he is a successful artist, speaking from a rented chateau outside Paris, where he lives with his partner and four-month-old daughter. He looks extremely well for someone who spent 20 years drinking, smoking and taking cocaine and whatever else he could get his hands on – he spent a whole year tripping on hallucinogens. His tattooed body looks remarkably well toned for a 61-year-old, and his mind is perfectly sharp. As with everything else about Dougher, the explanation for his condition is contradictory. “I would put anything you gave me into my system if you told me it would get me high,” he says. “If you said, ‘I got this white powder here, check this out,’ I would do it and not think twice about it. I would drink leftover drinks with cigarette butts in them. But I wouldn’t eat pork, or I went long periods where I was vegetarian, very mindful of diet. Even when I lived on the park bench, I would do push-ups.”Dougher became an addict through “a combination of nature and nurture,” he says. It was in his genes, he suggests, that he “didn’t have an off switch”. His father was Irish, hence the name; his mother is African American, “which I always say is the perfect ethnic cocktail for an alcoholic addict.”Dougher’s father was an alcoholic and so was his grandfather – but the root causes of their troubles were as much to do with socioeconomic circumstances and inherited trauma as genetics. When Dougher was a boy, his father told him one drunken evening how he had witnessed his father, Dougher’s grandfather, shoot himself. When Dougher was 13, his father decided to get sober, and became a kind, loving dad. A year later he died of a heart attack. On the way to the funeral, one of his father’s old friends took Dougher aside and told him that his grandfather, who was violent and abusive, had not really shot himself; his father had killed him, and had then married his mother “to punish himself.” His father was 22 when he met his mother; she was 19, and already a mother of two. After the funeral, Dougher poured himself a drink. “I got drunk,” he says. “That drunk lasted 20 years.”New York, and especially Brooklyn, was a very different place in the 1970s and 80s. Today it is an expensive middle-class enclave; back then it was a run-down, working-class neighbourhood. Today it is economically segregated; back then it was ethnically segregated. “You could literally walk one block in the wrong direction and be in a neighbourhood where you weren’t welcome,” Dougher recalls. “The Italians, the Irish, the Jewish, they had their own internal racisms and pecking orders, but they were very united against anyone that was Black or Puerto Rican.”View image in fullscreenDougher playing drums with ska band the Boilers at CBGBs, New York, 1985Photograph: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAs a mixed-race child, Dougher would be picked on and called “White Boy” by the Black kids, but he would also be attacked by the white Irish American kids. During one beating, he recalls, “I said, ‘Hey, I’m half-Irish,’ hoping that they would see me as something other than a Black kid that they hated so badly. And when I said that, the beating escalated – they really got angry. It was a clear reminder to me that the world is only going to see me as a Black person.”Soon after his father died, Dougher dropped out of high school, moved into his mother’s basement and started effectively fending for himself – dumpster diving to find food, doing small-time jobs for money, which evolved into burgling neighbours’ houses, drinking, listening to music, smoking weed, selling weed. “They say weed is a gateway drug; I think it’s a gateway only for those who were heading through the gate anyway,” he says.By his early 20s, as well as drinking heavily, he got into cocaine. It reached the stage where he was basically always on something – all of which required more money, more crimes, and a gradual disintegration of his life. “I worked, stole, borrowed and begged just to stay high,” he says.When he was 21 he got into psychedelics, in particular a synthetic form of mescaline known as “microdots”. “It was like LSD mixed with amphetamine,” he says. “You can just kind of keep moving, so you’ve got the buzz, the energy of someone on meth, and then the trippiness of somebody who’s doing acid.” He took it every day for the best part of a year – one long acid trip, punctuated by moments of lucidity. “I marvel over the fact that I have any brain cells left,” he says. Does he remember anything about it? “Well, I ended up with a son at the end of that year.”View image in fullscreenBasquiat meets Haring at Biggies Brooklyn Backyard by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherAnd yet, Dougher was also surprisingly active during this time. He took care of his son, Omari, on weekends. He had relationships – even at his least together, Dougher was always a fashionable dresser and a bit of a charmer, it seems. And he was always into music, not just the emerging local hip-hop scene (he was a terrible MC, he admits), but also reggae, and British rock like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones – “white boy music” – which led him to punk and new wave. He dressed like a punk, he says, in ripped skinny jeans and T-shirts held together with safety pins. He would go into Manhattan to classic venues like the Mudd Club and CBGBs to see bands like Bad Brains and Minor Threat. And to sell weed to white kids.On his 17th birthday a girlfriend gave him a drum kit, and he took to it, forming a reggae band, then playing in bands for decades. In 2003, for example, he played drums on the cult stoner albumDub Side of the Moon(exactly as it suggests, it’s a dub cover version of Pink Floyd’s entire Dark Side of the Moon album). “I got paid $600 and I got two CDs. That was it.”View image in fullscreenUbuntu by Patrick Dougher.Illustration: Courtesy of Patrick DougherOne time in 1992, a British guy approached him in New York and asked him if he would fill in for Sade’s drummer, who was stuck in England because of visa problems. They played one song, in a studio, for a Top of the Pops broadcast. He was utterly smitten with Sade, he says. “I really wish I had dated her.” She liked him too, evidently. She invited Dougher to play with them for the rest of their US tour. Call them the next day, she said. It was a dream come true. He got high to celebrate. Then he wondered if he would be able to keep on getting high if he was on the road. He never called back.He somehow avoided the crack epidemic that ravaged so many Black and brown communities in the 80s. He says his older brother overdosed, and that his cousin, also an addict, “got thrown out of a moving car”. The fact that he is still alive is as much down to luck as anything else, he admits. “There’s so many moments where I could have died or ended up in jail or just been disabled, and so many folks that have had the same opportunities as me and just haven’t made it.”And all along the way, there were many times when he tried to get sober, but just couldn’t. “Every addict and alcoholic, at some point, realises that this thing is killing them or ruining their lives, but they negotiate with it. They make deals like, ‘I’m going to figure it out. I’ll cut back. I’ll try a different drug. I’ll try a different alcohol.’ It took 20-odd years of daily use for me to surrender to the fact that none of that negotiation ever works, at least not for long.” Penniless, unemployable and alcohol dependent, he became homeless. After that month on the park bench, a friend let him sleep on the floor of his recording studio. He realised he had nothing.When he finally quit, it was almost a non-event, it seems. “Nothing particularly tragic happened that day. But you get sick and tired of being sick and tired,” he says. He describes it as a moment of “grace”: “I came to this moment where I realised it was black and white: I could continue living the way I was, with active addiction and alcoholism, and die miserably, and die lonely, and die as a burden to those around me. Or I could face this demon and gather the courage to try to imagine a life free of alcohol and drugs.”At 38 I had the emotional intelligence and coping skills of a 15-year-oldOne of the most pernicious aspects of addiction, he says, is “this idea like, ‘I’m alone. Nobody understands me, nobody’s going to help me.’” It is not true, he says. “I wasn’t able to break out of it until I was willing to ask for help.” Like his father did at the same age, he started going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and began to change his ways and rebuild his life. It wasn’t easy, he says. “At 38 years old, I really had the emotional intelligence and coping skills of a 15-year-old.” He had never had a bank account or a driving licence. He had also never dealt with what he now sees as his angst, his anger, his lack of self-worth, his grief – all of which began with his father’s death. One of his first sober jobs was as a counsellor to troubled teenagers. “They’re incredibly sensitive and insecure and I identified with them, because I recognised that.”He began to mend fences and rebuild relationships, including with his son, Omari, whom Dougher now describes as “my best friend”.View image in fullscreenDougher with his partner, Sélène Saint Aimé, and their baby daughter.Photograph: Magali Delporte/The GuardianHe became an art teacher and an art therapist, working with HIV positive children and community groups. And steadily he became an artist himself. “I was making art the whole time, but I never considered myself an artist,” he says. “It took me a few years of being sober to clean up my mind enough to get some direction and make the leap to realise, like, maybe all along I’ve been a creative and an artist.” His paintings often incorporate African American history and spirituality: often depicting Black figures with golden haloes, almost like religious iconography.Dougher was always a spiritual seeker. Throughout his memoir he hangs out with numerous religious groups: Jehovah’s Witnesses; Black, MuslimFive Percenters; Rastafarians, even Hare Krishnas (admittedly the free food and the music were the main appeal there). That hunger is part of what drew him to drugs in the first place, he realises now. “It was a shortcut to God, in a sense, or what I thought was God.” He still sees his life and his work in a spiritual context, “this idea that there’s something bigger than me, and yet I’m still part of that big thing.”As such, he is philosophical about how his life has panned out. “It makes you realise everything had to happen as it did. Obviously my life would have been completely different had I continued to play with Sade,” he laughs. “And there were so many times where I made the wrong turn, or in the moment that decision caused me more grief and suffering, but I kind of had to go through it to get where I ended up.”He spends a few months in France every year with his new partner, 31-year-old Sélène Saint Aimé, a French-Caribbean bassist. The rest of the time he’s working in his Brooklyn studio. He’s happier than he’s ever been, he says. “I’ve been given a second chance ​at life. It’s the best way I could put it.”Concrete Dreamland by Patrick Dougher is out now (Little, Brown, £28)Explore more on these topicsArtHow we surviveAlcoholismDrugsOpioidsReligionAlcoholinterviewsShareReuse this content"

HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Nathan FielderAlienating, awkward, anxiety-inducing: why The Rehearsal is TV’s most fascinating showThe second season of Nathan Fielder’s singular series takes even bigger swings and while there has been criticism of his techniques, it remains an act of magicAdrian HortonTue 13 May 2025 05.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 07.57 EDTShareWhat do couples counseling, a reality-singing competition, three cloned Yorkies, the content moderation of Paramount+ Germany and aviation safety all have in common? Virtually nothing, except the interest of television mastermindNathan Fielder, who braids such disparate concepts together in the galaxy-brained second season ofThe Rehearsal.In just four episodes, thegenre-bending show of elaborate simulations– essentially, extremely realistic role-playing in the name of preparing people for uncomfortable situations – has provided some of the most compelling, bizarre and dementedly brilliant scenes on television this year: a shy commercial airline pilot on a first date, accompanied by 20 actors mirroring his every move. Fielder, sporting his series uniform laptop harness, peering into a “wrecked” cockpit through pretend flames. The sight of the Lizard Lounge – an exact replica of Brooklyn’s Alligator Lounge, where Fielder wastending barjust last month – inside an exact replica of a section of Houston’s George Bush airport. And in a scene that was shockingly transgressive even for a docu-comedy auteur who has built a career on stretching the outer boundaries of reality television, the sight of Fielder, shaven, rubber-capped and diapered, suckling from the papier-mache teat of a puppet 50s housewife as part of a canonically insane, deeply sincere attempt to relive the life – and thus absorb the wisdom – of Captain Sully Sullenberger (of Tom Hanks biopic, crashing into the Hudson fame).Surreality TV: The Curse finds the horror in home renovation showsRead moreIf you haven’t seen The Rehearsal or aren’t acclimatized to Fielder’s ultra-cringe brand of experimental comedy, this probably sounds deeply off-putting, tedious and/or nonsensical. And it is – Fielder’s comedy, which could more accurately be described as Rube Goldberg-esque social experiments pursued to such absurd ends and with such deadpan narration as to produce laughter, is deliberately alienating. Zigging where others would zag, getting hung up on what others would glide past, building arcane in-jokes with long-simmering payoffs in the lane of erstwhile prestige TV dramas, it is television probing the human condition – how people think, why they behave a certain way, how they react to off-script social interactions – that is difficult to explain to other humans, difficult to follow and at times difficult to watch.And yet, it is appointment television, a truly singular meditation on artifice and authenticity, performance and sincerity, that has only improved with its second season. The Rehearsal’s first outing, which aired in 2022, introduced audiences to Fielder’s particular strand of neuroticism and apparent negotiating power atHBO; over six episodes, he constructed numerous simulations to approximate a potential real-life experience, primarily oriented around one woman’s deliberation over whether or not to have a child (in one of the show’s dicier and rightfully critiqued bits, Fielder played father to a real toddler). Fielder’s genius lies as much in episodic structure as in performance of his affectless producer persona – The Rehearsal marked a graduation, of sorts, from the harebrained business schemes of his Comedy Central seriesNathan For Youto becoming the Penn & Teller of television, pulling off sleights of hand while showing the strings and delivering the most monotone “abracadabra” imaginable, with a revelatory commitment to, as one fanput it, letting the camera linger long enough to reveal someone to be the weirdest person alive.With the six-episode second season, Fielder has leveled up the scale and stakes of his magic tricks, while further interrogating the production, assumptions and experiences that go into producing reality television, in service of a seemingly noble and topical aim: aviation safety. Fielder theorizes that the No 1 understudied cause of plane crashes is human error compounded by a breakdown of communication in the cockpit. Co-pilots, for whatever reason, do not correct pilots when they make a mistake. Based on the number of real crashes Fielder’s team re-enacts, with obligatory virtual explosions, via flight simulator in the first episode, this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis. But to prove it, Fielder embarks on a characteristically intricate and involved series of experiments, from recreating the life conditions of a 2011 dog for its clone – the better to test nature v nurture – to encouraging a co-pilot to confront issues with his girlfriend during a simulated flight.How The Rehearsal pushes the boundaries of reality TVRead moreThere’s a certain hyper-competency pleasure to seeing these scenarios play out, to seeing someone’s imagination given this much financial and legal runway. But the series is most satisfying, to this TV fan, as a grand deconstruction of the rules of reality TV through elaborate role-play. The fourth episode dissects the series-long assumptions behind hiring actors to say certain lines of dialogue or perform certain scenarios, questioning the logic behind any suspension of disbelief. And one of the series’ many side quests includes the elaborate staging of an aviation-themed singing competition modeled on Fielder’s experience as a 23-year-old junior producer for Canadian Idol – the northern spinoff of American Idol – where he was tasked with rejecting hopeful singers who did not exhibit “star potential”. The meditation on what makes would-be off-screen staff better at an unenviable task is at once fascinating and practical; theoretically, co-pilot judges – selected because they all share the quality of having not died in a plane crash – who practice rejection would be better prepared to stand up to stubborn captains.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: HBO/2025 Home Box Office, Inc. All rights reserved. HBO® and all related programs are the property of Home Box Office, Inc.Wings of Voice has, like all of Fielder’s work, drawn criticism for psychological manipulation and false representation. On Monday, participant Lana Love broke a show NDA toclaimthat she lost $10,000 and was tricked by the show’s producers into thinking she was on a real singing competition show and not, as Fielder calls it, “a singing competition as part of another TV show that has nothing to do with singing”. A level of manipulation is baked into the Fielderian worldview and school of acting, though I’d argue that, at this point, his methods are easily Googled and the subject of the show’s ultimate critique. The Rehearsal season two is, in my view, the least ethically fraught of Fielder’s output (and that includes his dramatic turn on the HGTV satireThe Curse). The show’s overarching illusion works because it serves an overall purpose more pointed than the original aim to “better understand the human condition” – it’s impossible to tell how serious Fielder is about changing Federal Aviation Administration training requirements around flight simulations to encourage better cockpit communications, but he seems serious enough about it to devote six episode of expensive television to the cause, with an added argument for pilots to get better therapy.Nathan Fielder’s TV show moves in mysterious ways – my ex laughed, I cried | Emma ForrestRead moreAnd with a sly, deceptive heart. In the most recent episode, which aired on Sunday, Fielder helps a shy co-pilot named Colin improve his nonexistent romantic life by practicing a first date, with a twist. Having watched enough nature documentaries to know that some animals function well in packs, Fielder recruits a dozen or so actors to hover around Colin, mimicking every move and word, the idea being that it’s easier to do things when you’re not doing it by yourself. It’s very possible that the bashful, social cue-averse Colin was also an unstated actor. Fielder, of course, has his own motives as master puppeteer; the image of Colin sipping coffee echoed by a chorus of other faces does indeed make excellent television. But it also made me tear up, this surreal, distinctly Fielder hack to the unavoidable loneliness of being alive, to the universal discomfort of social awkwardness and personal insecurity. It fails, of course. The show purports to believe that all human behavior can be taught, that all emotions can be simulated and thus controlled. Both the magician and the audience know that life doesn’t work that way, but what a wonder to pretend otherwise.Explore more on these topicsNathan FielderUS televisionTelevisionTV comedyHBOComedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The philanthropist will fund an estimated 100,000 museum visits, including school transport costs, for children around the UK.Last year the organisation ran a pilot scheme involving the Yorkshire Museum in York; the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter; the Great North Museum: Hancock, in Newcastle upon Tyne; Manchester Museum; and South Shields Museum and Art Gallery.View image in fullscreenThe Time Odyssey project aims to demystify museums and make them more accessible.Photograph: Art Explora/British MuseumIt also conducted research that found 60% of UK teachers said they had not taken their class to a museum on a school trip in the last 12 months, while 14% of teachers had never taken a class to a museum on a school trip. Of the 4,500 students who attended the pilot, 60% had not visited a museum in the past year.Jousset said a key part of the project was to demystify museums and make them seem more accessible, especially for children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. “Sometimes museums are too intimidating,” he said. “You need to have some education and some background to be able to experience this. It’s like a church. Children cannot mess up. They can’t run, they can’t touch the sculptures.”Jousset’s passion for art was fuelled by his mother, who was a chief curator at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. He launched Art Explora in 2019 and has been a donor to the arts in France. At 35, after making millions via his call-centre business Webhelp, he donated €1m to the Louvre.Time Odyssey is Jousset’s latest art-based intervention in Britain, a country he made his home 15 years ago. In 2023, Art Explora partnered with Tate Liverpool to create a mobile art gallery featuring work by JMW Turner, Barbara Hepworth and Claude Cahun, which made its way around sites in Merseyside.Jousset has also taken accessible art to the waves. In 2021, he announced Art Explora,a 46m-long, 300-tonne boat with capacity for 2,000 visitorsthat toured the Mediterranean accompanied by pop-up pavilions on shore, arranged with local cultural institutions.Time Odyssey has added NationalMuseumsLiverpool, Danum Gallery, Library and Museum in Doncaster, and Tees Valley Museums to its list of participating institutions, while the British Museum is also partnering.Bernard Donoghue, the director of the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, which tracks visitor numbers to UK institutions, said: “School group visits to attractions have recovered very well since the pandemic … [but] the cost of travel and the hire costs of coaches especially are the greatest barrier to more schools undertaking visits to attractions.”Explore more on these topicsMuseumsBritish MuseumArts fundingnewsShareReuse this content"

Before signing on, she watched archival video of the STC production, which opened at Sydney’s Roslyn Packer theatre in July 2024, starring Zahra Newman.

For them to connect in that way has been important for them because this is a show that they go and create together.”The original Sydney production will not “be a blueprint” for the West End version, Cassel told Deadline. “I think what’s so exciting, I think for her, and for us, while we know what the story is, they get to go and create this role in the rehearsal room in London together, and that was very appealing to Cynthia to put her own interpretation on the role and explore that with Kip.”Besides Dracula, Erivo’s roles include the count’s love interest Mina, his nemesis Van Helsing and his henchman Renfield.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSaved for LaterFree newsletterCatch up on the fun stuff with Guardian Australia's culture and lifestyle rundown of pop culture, trends and tipsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The report says many thatched roofs in Wales are becoming “more similar to English styles of thatch”. The Welsh style is different, with a rounder outside appearance.Another craft added to the critically endangered list is the carving of figureheads for ships. A few “master carvers” remain but the report says there are no trainees.Some of the skills needed in silversmithing are also vanishing, the report says, with “silver allied trades” added to the endangered category.Jackie Tear, the managing director ofBritish Silverwarein Sheffield, which makes objects ranging from cutlery to trophies, said people were keen to be silversmiths. “But the issue is all the associated skill sets and trades that go with it are lost or being lost.”For example, Tear said, the number of people skilled in buffing – removing lines created in the manufacturing process to create a smooth surface – could be counted on one hand.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They’re learning how to use a lathe but they’re not learning how to use it for something like our industry because it’s a very niche.”Among the resurgent crafts is pole lathe bowl turning. One practitioner,Sharif Adams, said: “A pole lathe is one of the earliest sort of machines that humanity ever used. The Vikings used them to turn their cups and bowls.”“As the bowl spins, the tool leaves a very fine groove, which is similar in some ways to the sort of texture on thrown pottery. And they don’t shine in the same way as machined bowls. They look more earthy, more rustic.” The technique produces a beautifully textured bowl.By the mid-20th century pole lathe bowl turning had died out but a small number of enthusiasts revived it. “I took photographs of lathes and built one and then connected through the green wood working forums with a few other people trying to do the same thing,” Adams said.He passes on his knowledge and there is an annual festival called theBowl Gathering. “It’s a really lovely thing to do. There’s so many emotional and physical wellbeing benefits from woodturning in this way. It connects you with nature and connects you with community of lovely people.”Explore more on these topicsCraftHeritagenewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a story that the director appeared to have chanced upon through following the blog of a brilliant photographer, Maria Vatne, who recorded her idyllic wilderness existence living on a farm in Norway withher British husband Nik Payne and their three home-schooled children, Ulv, Falk, and Freja, and an elder daughter Ronja, from Maria’s previous partner. Butone blogpost from October 2018, titled A New Kind of Wildernessrevealed that she had cervical cancer, and she died in 2019.The film shows us the family coming to terms with their terrible loss and grief, particularly Nik. For a start, they can no longer live on their beloved farm because without Maria’s photography income Nik cannot keep up the mortgage repayments; they must move to a much smaller place and the kids will go to regular school. (So their former existence was not, in fact, as “off-grid” as all that; Maria’s website reveals that she took photography assignments and the idyllic farm images perhaps functioned in a way as a shopwindow.) The film allows us to wonder if Nik’s emotional wretchedness is subtly complicated by feelings of self-reproach as a breadwinner. Also, he ponders taking the children home to England where his relatives have a farm, but the children would find that insupportable and it might be the ultimate disloyalty to Maria.Then there is Ronja, whom the film reveals to have moved back in with their dad, and her father’s absence is itself, incidentally, something to ponder. Ronja reveals she always felt a little estranged from her half-siblings, especially Freja, and there is a painful, emotional break between the two of them as Ronja decides to move away from them all to Bodø in the remote Nordland county to train as a midwife (perhaps in an unacknowledged, unprocessed spirit of anger).The film, with heartfelt sweetness, finally shows the children starting to grow up and move on, while for Nik it is not so easy. And then, over the closing credits, the director springs what is effectively a brilliant, subtle, extra-textualcoup de cinema; she directs the audience to Maria’s website, perhaps in the knowledge that they might well read Maria’s blogpost from June 2016, called The Letting Go, which will send you back to watch the film all over again. A deeply humane and emotionally literate piece of work.A New Kind of Wilderness is in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsFamilyParents and parentingNorwayEuropeDeath and dyingreviewsShareReuse this content"

It’s a distinctive US indie type, coloured by the sun-dappled green foliage, flavoured by the unemphatic presence of both beauty and danger. And heading for … what? An escalating series of scary moments, or just a low-key crescendo of epiphanies or emotional confrontations? Middle-class New Yorkers can journey through the wilderness in the movies but, unlike in John Boorman’s 1972 film Deliverance, they may encounter only the inner hillbillies of their own anxiety and discontent.This excellent film from first-time director India Donaldson is a smart, sympathetic and terrifically acted drama about 17-year-old Sam – an outstanding performance from Lily Collias – who agrees to go on a hiking trip in the Catskill mountains with her gloomy divorced dad Chris (played by James Le Gros) and his buddy Matt (Danny McCarthy), a failed actor who shares his friend’s marital status (divorced), his portly body type, his receding hairline and his habit of exhaustedly cracking wise about the awful way their lives appear to have worked out.This trip was supposed to have included Matt’s stroppy teen son Dylan (company for Sam, presumably) but he has pulled out after a quarrel with Matt – so now, a little weirdly, it’s just the two ageing guys and the teenage girl in what promises to be a non-bonding adventure before Sam heads off to college, a kind of platonic Jules-et-Jim or Butch-and-Sundance and Katharine Ross dynamic, only it’s just a vacation.Or is it? Donaldson sets a low-key tone of banter and backtalk, in which Sam has to ride in the back of her Subaru, making herself carsick by checking her phone and annoying her dad by asking if she can drive; he finds it annoying because she is actually a better driver than he is. Goofy Matt shows himself to as incompetent at hiking as he is at managing the rest of his life, and as they chat by the campfire under the stars, Matt is quietly awed by the wise, insightful way Sam sums up his problems and predicts how the rest of his life could well go. It’s a lovely moment – and then the mood goes terribly wrong.Another kind of director might have cranked the dial way up at this crisis in her relationship with both Matt and Chris but Donaldson decides to let it go, just as Sam effectively lets it go and the mood recedes calmly back to normality. It is subtly climactic, as if in a short story, and you can see how Sam, as she gets into her 20s and 30s, is going to look back on this as a strange last-moment-of-youth event. (I almost wondered if we were going to get a flash-forward of older Sam looking back on it.)In some ways, the father-daughter theme reminded me ofDebra Granik’s 2018 Leave No Trace, and I wonder if Donaldson has taken a little inspiration from that film. It is very intelligent and humane, and what a great performance from Collias.Good One is in UK and Irish cinemas from 16 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Brain scans revealed a damaged hippocampus and a tumour, probably benign. To improve her memory, doctors asked her to look at strings of numbers, and then reel them off backwards – an exercise she likens to “Cognitive Crufts”. She ruminates on the relationship between language, memory and time: “three gifts, co-dependent, that create and sustain each other”. Her first book, All of Us Atoms, is a memoir in snapshots, sketching a rough portrait of her life through a series of scattered recollections and reflections.Dawson’s story begins in an unnamed industrial town, where the closure of the local steelworks had produced a surplus of “angry bored men, making mothers out of their wives”; her family decamped to a Cornish fishing village, where she spent the best part of her childhood. As a youngster she was “serious and odd” – morbid, obsessed with the past, a little solipsistic. Hers was among the last generations of pupils to access private schooling via the Assisted Places Scheme, shortly before it was discontinued by the Thatcher government. She later moved to rural East Sussex, where she is currently “reader-in-residence” at Charleston.In a life marked by change and uncertainty, the family unit was the one constant. Dawson writes with tenderness about her younger brother, and credits her grandmother with teaching her to “hold real life lightly and imaginative life tight”. At the age of 16, she had been on the verge of joining a prestigious ballet school, but turned it down at the last minute because it would mean being away from her family. Although the admissions process had been long and arduous, she couldn’t go through with it. She has no regrets. She saw herself, her mother and her brother as three parts of a single entity: “Put them together, and their triangle keeps them safe.”All of Us Atoms is best understood as a sort of love letterThis all feels very intimate, and at times the reader has the uncomfortable sense of snooping on personal correspondence. The sentimentalism occasionally cloys; an extended metaphor about how children are a bit like satsumas is laboured to the point of embarrassment. In one three-page chapter, Dawson lists the most beautiful sounds she has ever heard in a series of unpunctuated, single-line paragraphs, written entirely in lower case. (“a japanese garden the breeze through the cherry trees the trickle of tea into porcelain cups”.)The narrative voice changes from one chapter to the next. Early on in the book, Dawson’s brain addresses her in the second person, reproaching her for running it into the ground through lack of self-care; later, she’s a third-person character, denoted by reference to her role – “The Sister”, “The Dancer”, “The Mother”, and so on. She adopts a slightly stunted vocabulary for childhood recollections: her body turns “erupty skinny red” and she “gets all sick hot dizzy volcanoey” during bouts of illness; she writes of her “you-ness”, “is-ness” and “we-hood”, presumably because her younger self doesn’t know the grownup words for these concepts.This reticence about using “I” in an autobiographical work is intriguing. The blend of second- and third-person voices imbues the narration with an evasive, deflective quality – it’s the literary equivalent of avoiding eye contact. Dawson mentions in passing that she tended to view the world in gendered terms (“Men/Bad, Women/Good”), but doesn’t feel the need to unpack this. Although her apparently formative obsession with Virginia Woolf is referenced at several points, we are not told what it was about Woolf’s work that resonated with her. It’s just not that sort of memoir; the author is more interested in aestheticising the process of recall itself than imparting information.All of Us Atoms is best understood as a sort of love letter. The central theme is human interdependence – the idea, hinted at in the book’s title, that our sense of self is largely shaped by the roles we perform in our relationships with others. Axiomatic, perhaps, and borderline platitudinous, but it bears repeating. Caring is the only truly important thing we do in every phase of our brief time on Earth – “This constant procession of becoming and unbecoming.

While the poor quality of his work, especially his computer game adaptations, is perhaps overhyped –are theythatbad?– there’s less dispute that his films are largely not financially successful, and his output has slowed after a now-abandoned retirement. (Like Steven Soderbergh, it seems Boll just can’t quit.) One of his weirder re-emergences recently was playing himself in Radu Jude’s acclaimedRomanian art film Do Not Expect Too Much from the End of the World from 2023– after which he made this lukewarm mess.As the title might suggest, the idea is that this follows the first shift worked by two detectives on their first day together in New York City; not unlike, say, Training Day, except without the sharp script (by David Ayer), the fluent direction (by Antoine Fuqua) or a knockout cast (Training Day’s killer combo of Ethan Hawke and Denzel Washington). Instead, First Shift supplies us with C-lister Gino Anthony Pesi in the lead as Deo, a gruff loner whose isolation is underscored by an unfeasibly long opening sequence showing him getting up in the morning and doing the most mundane of activities for long minutes of empty screen time. Clearly, Boll’s ineptitude for pacing has not waned.Eventually, Deo gets to the station where he finds he’s to work with a new partner, sunny Angela (Kristen Renton, serviceable) who’s only just moved to the Big Apple from Florida. Of course, the two very different personalities clash, with Deo sneering at Angela’s chirpy disposition while she bridles mildly at his sexist digs.Boll’s self-penned script and the machete-like editing throw some almost avant garde shapes as it contrives to abruptly intercut between the lead cops’ banter in their car and some gangsters bopping around town sadistically killing people – though these plotlines barely intersect at all in the course of the film. Presumably things are being set up for a future shift in which the duo – bonded at the end by mutual appreciation of a cute dog and a murder-suicide crime scene, storylines given roughly equal emotional weight here – bring the gangsters to heel. The clumsiness of the storytelling, presumably unintentional, is almost entertaining in itself but only if basically inept film-making is your idea of fun.First Shift is on digital platforms from 19 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersCrime filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s an almost lazy richness to the picture: the late afternoon sun, the “moss so lush between the wooden rail ties that, at a certain angle of thick, verdant light, it looks like algae”, the junkyard “packed with school buses in various stages of amnesia”.His poetic credentials established, the author of the bestselling autofictionalOn Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeousgives narrative its head. Instead of jumping from the bridge, Hai crosses it, to be adopted on the other side by 82-year-old Grazina, a woman suffering mid‑stage prefrontal lobe dementia. He will become her proxy grandson; they will be each other’s support in a crap world. It will be a disordered but productive relationship.Grazina, born in Lithuania, “an old country, far away”, lives on a street known locally as the Devil’s Armpit, takes 14 pills a day, and always eats Stouffer’s Salisbury Steak for dinner. She needs a carer; Hai, a pillhead in remission but longing to be back in the arms of opioids, needs a more constructive narrative of himself. Between them they invent a role-playing game to bring her down from the destabilising hallucinations and insomniac panics of her disease. Then, as she sleeps, he quietly ransacks her cupboards for prescription medicines.This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fictionSome of the themes of On Earth We’re Briefly Gorgeous echo through into this novel. We recognise the familial landscapes of the Vietnamese immigration to the US; the need to manage partly assimilated, dangerously unprocessed generational tensions; the sense of life as the pursuit of a second chance. Complex relations between story and backstory also feature, but at a less demanding scale, producing less of a dense lyrical flicker at the sentence level, more of a traditional juggle with larger narrative elements. This is a huge novel in terms of where it directs our attention: from gay self-discovery to the uses of fiction; from the industrial farming of animals to the drive to write yourself free of the parental experience.As well as chosen family, The Emperor of Gladness is also about the brutality of work. Hai takes a job at HomeMarket, a fast-casual diner chain out on Route 4. There, beside “smoking vats of vibrant, primary-coloured side dishes” precooked “nearly a year ago in a laboratory outside Des Moines”, he makes more new friends. BJ, the manager, “six foot three with a buzz cut fade and shape-up”, whose ambition is to become a pro wrestler under the pseudonym Deez Nuts; Russia, “a cuter version of Gollum from The Lord of the Rings”, who is actually of Tajikistani origins; Maureen the cashier, an ageing conspiracy theorist who relieves her arthritic knees each evening with a pack of mac and cheese from the freezer. Soon, they are his family too. Family outings include a visit to a slaughterhouse where the barbaric conditions are genuinely difficult to read, and an evening of wrestling at Hairy Harry’s dive bar: experiences and situations which move steadily towards surrealism as the novel comes to its climax.BJ’s crew are “just like the people anywhere else in New England. Weatherworn and perennially exhausted or pissed off or both.” The take-home from their state being that, whatever else, the HomeMarket chain offers a tacky but undeniably sensual experience to the customer; and a living, however minimal, for the crew. Where they converge, these two basic socioeconomic goods encourage the emergence of a third: a genuine if brief glow of gladness cast over a life of hopeless situations. Versions of this glow become the real subject of the story. Dwellers in precarity must provide themselves with a narrative future. Some are better at it than others. For Hai – who once told himself the story of “wanting to be a writer” – such support fictions aren’t maintenance-free: after every defeat, every incursion of reality, they have to be repaired and revised. It’s hard labour, carried out in addition to his daily struggles to manage Grazina’s illness and earn a living. He’s not good at it.We’re all writers now, Vuong seems to suggest. A cheap dinner eaten at HomeMarket under the kitsch but somehow menacing light of a Thomas Kinkade fantasy painting – “Beside Still Waters”, “Victorian Family Christmas” – is a story of reward. Two Dilaudid pills, crushed and snorted, are a story about time out. Any economic aspiration at all is so clearly a fiction. This condition is depicted with the authenticity of experience. At the same time Vuong takes it apart with patience and an ear for dialogue: “I like Nasa – the real kind, not make-believe like Star Trek,” he has Hai’s cousin Sony – named after the TV – say. “My mom likes make-believe, but I hate it. It makes things wobbly.” Heartbreaking, heartwarming yet unsentimental, and savagely comic all at the same time, The Emperor of Gladness is about just how wobbly things can become.The Emperor of Gladness by Ocean Vuong is published by Jonathan Cape (£20).To support the Guardian and the Observer buy a copy atguardianbookshop.com.

This results in an unusual and not unpleasant mixture of aesthetics: gangsters in sharp suits and wide-brimmed hats and a ragtag band of salvage divers whom they hire to recover their ill-gotten gains.The film also makes good use of its Australian setting, with attractive riverside locations which are again not typical in a shark movie. Hang on, you might think, what’s a shark doing in a river? But don’t worry, they’ve done their homework: this hungry fish is a bull shark, one of the most dangerous and aggressive sharks, and also one that is equally at home in fresh and salt water. (One of the most famous real-life shark attacks of all, atMatawan Creek in 1916, was over a mile upriver from the ocean.) So there’s a new nightmare, just when you thought it was safe to go back to the riverbank.Unfortunately where the film falls down is its human characters, who struggle to really come alive – and the galling thing is, it’s not for want of trying. This isn’t one of those monster movies where you don’t really need the humans to be memorable because they’re interchangeable fodder for shark attack sequences; this film is trying hard to make you care about the human element. In many ways, the shark storyline takes a backseat to plucky Clara (Hermione Corfield), taciturn Jacob (Jimmy Barriakada) and hard-drinking Ernie (Arthur Angel), whose travails as a diving company are the human interest story. But they’re not all that interesting, meaning you end up waiting around for the next shark attack. It’s a shame, because the idea of making a classy, character-driven shark movie is a fantastic one – it just lacks the vital charisma necessary to really reel us in.Fear Below is on digital platforms from 19 May.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersPeriod and historical filmsSharksAnimalsMarine lifereviewsShareReuse this content"

This exposé about him is truly stomach-churning stuffLucy ManganTue 13 May 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 13 May 2025 13.59 EDTShareWe don’t get to say “Only in America!”, complete with a wry smile and a shake of the head, enough any more. The things they have are either too serious (Trump, mass shootings, their police) or we are closing in on their achievements with our own (Boris, knifings, our police).Untold: The Liver King grants us this boon once more. For the Liver King – AKA Brian Johnson – is a phenomenon with “Only in America!” stamped through him like a stick of rock. Though in his case you would probably have to say “stick of salami”. Because the Liver King eats virtually nothing but raw meat. Usually beef liver, but other bovine organs – especially testicles – will do nicely as well. There is ample evidence available via his social media videos, should you wish to check them out. Many of them are played in this 70-minute documentary, which is how I know to advise you not to do so. I am both a committed carnivore and rarely nauseated by anything, but it turns out that even I have a hard limit on the number of bull testes I can see one man masticate over the course of an hour. If you think I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! has prepared you, it has not.Anyway. Johnson was born in 1978 in Texas, the only place a real Only in America American should be born. His father died when he was a toddler, his brother was the golden boy and little Brian was forever searching for ways to compete with the shadow and the shine. First he discovered the gym (“Like the most beautiful fucking playground”) and got strong. Then he discovered Arnold Schwarzenegger films andRambo: First Bloodand got inspired. “I made myself the exact man – a savage fucking king – that I always wanted to be. I could be my hero.”But can you be a true hero without an emotionally powerful origin story? By 2013, once-little-now-jacked Johnson had two boys of his own – Rad Ical and Stryker – with his wife, Barbara, who were constantly ill and being taken to hospital with life-threatening allergies.Johnson started reading up on health matters and came across the concept of “ancestral living”. You throw out everything processed and start living on raw eggs, bone broth and meat – the more hepatic the better – and abiding by the Nine Tenets, “the life forces that have nourished us for millions of years”: including sleep, eat, move, shield (yourself from wifi and phone radiation etc), connect (with the Earth by going barefoot everywhere), fight (or at least accumulate guns and mount some of them above your bed) and bond (with everyone willing to eat testicles with you).Ancestral living not only cured the boys but gave Johnson a mission. He would spread the word, rename himself The Liver King AND create a dietary supplements company for those poor unfortunates who couldn’t kill their own bulls and lay hands on fresh liver and balls whenever they needed to.The business was a wild success, and after he employed “hybrid marketing, talent and branding agency”, 1DS Collective, led by John Hyland, to school him in the ways of TikTok and Instagram, he became famous as its face and named his followers “primals”.After he started appearing on high-profile podcasts, however, the backlash began. Some people – weak people! People who doubtless threw away offal, cooked their steaks and fried their eggs! – began wondering if a physique like the Liver King’s could really be attained through raw food and nine tenets unless at least one of those nine tenets was “massive steroid intake”. The King denied the idea loud, long and publicly until the day incontrovertible proof was provided. The wheels duly came off.So, too, do they then come off the programme. The story of the Liver King is, in television terms, only half a story. He rose, he fell, and … that’s it. He not-too-reluctantly admits on camera to taking huge doses of human growth hormone, and in the closing minutes blithely describes the lucrative scam he ran at his very first job and how he moved into printing money, making drugs in his apartment then trading them internationally and how his perception of risk became distorted because he never got caught. He has Googled “repent” and “atonement”, he informs us chirpily, and assures us that he feels “shame, sorrow, guilt, regret … nothing’s more real than that”.Six months on he has started eating vegetables and wondering whether he was too intense before. “I love the man that I am now.”The only moment of wider reflection comes from the disillusioned chief executive of the supplements holding company, Ben Johnson, who asks “what we are risking through a reckless relationship with the truth?” It’s a good question, but there’s a lot of balls to get through first.The Liver King is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewFitnessDiets and dietingreviewsShareReuse this content"

And white and red ones, too? And that some are good for sweet recipes and others for curries? Our top cooks have all the spicy smartsAnna BerrillTue 13 May 2025 08.00 EDTShareWhat’s the difference between green and black cardamom, and when should I use pods or ground?“Cardamom is my favourite spice,” saysCynthia Shanmugalingam, chef/proprietor ofRambutanin London. “It smells like childhood puddings and sweets.” That’s not to say the papery pods filled with black seeds aren’t versatile, mind. Yes, cardamom can bring a “piney, eucalyptus-like fragrance and warmth” to desserts, Shanmugalingam adds, but it also “adds depth” to savoury dishes, meaning you can take it in multiple directions.With its origins in southern India and a relative of ginger, cardamom pods commonly come in green and black (also known as brown) form, as well as red (used mainly in Chinese and Asian cuisines) and white, which are bleached green pods. While Roopa Gulati, author ofIndian Kitchens: Treasured Family Recipes from Across the Land, often uses both black/brown and green in the same dish, she says you “have to be aware that they are totally different in flavour. You’re not going to make a lovely, aromatic rice pudding and stick some brown cardamom in it, because that will override all the other flavours.”That’s because black cardamom is earthy, smoky and more robust than its green relative, which is why Gulati puts it to work in the likes of meaty curries, lamb pilaf and rice dishes, as well as in garam masala: “It has a good, solid base note.” The Kashmiri stockyakhniis a good example: “That has loads of spices in it, but if you also chuck in a couple of brown cardamom pods, it just gives it that extra layer.” That’s not to say the bolder brown cardamom should stay in its lane, though: “It can also go with sweet things such as dates,” Gulati adds. As for red cardamom, which is similar in taste to brown, “in India, we don’t cook with it, but it’s interchangeable with brown, though our homegrown brown cardamom is a bit more pungent!”Green cardamom, meanwhile, is “quite fresh and citrussy”, so Gulati uses that in cake batters and desserts, such as rice pudding: “I’ll sometimes put green cardamom pods in a pan of milk and simmer to infuse.” And while Shanmugalingam is a fan of the lighter, sweeter spice inwatalappan(a Sri Lankan coconut caramel pudding), she’ll also put it to work in pilafs and biryanis, dals and marinades for chicken. Finally, with white cardamom, which is the more mellow of the bunch, again think creamy desserts and cakes.As for using whole pods versus grinding the seeds inside, Shanmugalingam leans towards the former, because, she says, “they retain flavour better and infuse sweet rice pudding and curries really well”. If you’re after something punchier, meanwhile, Gulati’s top tip is to drop the pods into hot oil: “Their volatile oils are released and you get a stronger flavour; always pierce the pod first, though, otherwise it might explode.”Ground cardamom, meanwhile, works best in cakes and marinades, Shanmugalingam says, although the process of grinding those seeds is, Gulati admits, “a real pain in the neck”. To grease the wheels, she suggests adding a pinch of caster sugar to proceedings: “It acts as an abrasive, so makes it much easier and quicker to pound with a pestle.” Thankfully, a little goes a long way, and always remember that freshness is key: “Once you’ve ground the seeds, use them quite quickly,” Gulati says, “otherwise they’ll turn musty.”Got a culinary dilemma?

Lemons are variously described as electric, fresh, optimistic, uplifting, zesty, spritzy, cheerful, sunny, lively. They are synonymous with freshness and optimism, and a happy lemon is full, pert and perky, and unapologetically, proudly yellow. Long live the lemon!Spring fregola salad (pictured top)Fregola is a Sardinian pasta made by rolling grains of semolina together to form small balls, then roasting them in an oven. The finished pasta has a toasty, smoky flavour, a wonderful, nubbly texture and is just small/large enough to provide a nutty chew. It is versatile and delicious, and can be cooked like rice or pasta. Here, it is boiled like pasta and left to cool before becoming the basis of a substantial salad. The smokiness works well with the sweetness of young raw courgettes, while toasted almonds top everything off. This is a great side dish for roast fish or white meat, or a nice summer salad on its own.Prep10 minCook20 minServes4as a side250gfregolaSea salt and black pepper150gfrozen peas50-60mlextra-virgin olive oil, plus extra to serveFinely grated zest and juice of 1 lemon3 small courgettes, sliced or peeled into strips1 handfulsweet herbs(mint, parsley, dill), roughly chopped, plus extra to serve150gfresh ricotta40gflakedalmonds, toastedCook the fregola in a large saucepan of boiling salted water for about eight to 10 minutes, until al dente, adding the frozen peas to the pan a minute before the fregola is done. Once the pasta is cooked, drain and rinse quickly under cold running water. Drain again and put in a bowl to cool, stirring occasionally to prevent the fregola sticking together. When the fregola has cooled, season it well with salt, plentiful olive oil and lemon juice and zest, then taste for seasoning and adjust accordingly (the fregola will drink up the oil).Toss the courgette ribbons through the cooled fregola and pea mixture, then add a little more seasoning if necessary. Toss through the herbs, then arrange on a platter and top with large blobs of ricotta. Sprinkle over some more roughly chopped herbs and the almonds, drizzle with a little extra oil to finish, then serve.Creamy fennel, lemon and pecorino bakeView image in fullscreenLetitia Clark’s creamy fennel, lemon and pecorino bake.At one of my favourite restaurants of all time,the Seahorse in Dartmouth, Devon, a small silver dish of sliced fennel baked in cream is often served alongside baked white fish. The fennel is pale, delicate, sweet and savoury, and provides the perfect accompaniment. It looks beautiful, too, in all of its elven, pale green-white splendour. This is a gilded version of that same dish, lifted by a double hit of lemon and given a savoury punch by garlic and anchovies; if you prefer to keep it vegetarian, leave out the anchovies and it will still be delicious (you might also like to add a few roasted almonds, for extra savouriness and crunch). This can be a meal in itself (with a sharp, lemon-dressed green salad, say) or a side for pork, chicken or fish.Prep10 minCook1 hrServes4-6Butter, for greasing2 large or 3 small fennel bulbs(about 1kg)Sea salt300mldoublecream50mlmilk1 lemon, zested and quartered1 garlic clove, peeled and bashed80ggrated pecorino(make sure it’s a vegetarian one, if need be)30gcoarse breadcrumbs, preferably from a rustic loaf (dried breadcrumbs would also work)Extra-virgin olive oil, for drizzling6 anchovy fillets(optional)Heat the oven to 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5, and grease a large gratin dish with butter.Trim the roots and stems from the fennel bulbs, chop off and reserve the fronds, then slice the bulbs lengthways into 3mm- to 4mm-thick slices. Bring a pan of well-salted water to a boil, drop in the sliced fennel and cook for three minutes, until just tender. Drain, dry and arrange in the gratin dish.Meanwhile, in a saucepan, heat the cream and milk with half the lemon zest, a pinch of salt, the chopped reserved fennel fronds and the bashed garlic clove. When it comes to a boil, take off the heat and stir in half the pecorino, until melted.Chop one of the lemon quarters into thin slices, then chop these into little pieces and scatter all over the fennel. Pour over the cream mixture, and remove and discard the bashed garlic.Mix the remaining lemon zest with the breadcrumbs and remaining cheese, sprinkle this over the fennel and cream, and drizzle with the olive oil. Dot over the anchovy fillets, if using, then bake for about 40 minutes, until golden and bubbling.These recipes are edited extracts from For the Love of Lemons: Italian-inspired Sweet and Savoury Recipes, by Letitia Clark, published by Quadrille at £28.
