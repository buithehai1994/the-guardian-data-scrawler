When she did, police dropped domestic violence inquiryAfter her death, police dropped a case examining Katie Madden’s former partner, despite evidence he had repeatedly told her to kill herselfRevealed: The true toll of female suicides in UK with domestic abuse at their coreGeraldine McKelvieandHannah Al-OthmanSun 15 Feb 2026 16.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTShareHours before Katie Madden took her own life, she had a tense phone call with her former partner Jonathon Russell. Russell was on bail after allegedly assaulting Madden – he was banned from contacting her – but the conversation took place nevertheless.There was a witness to the call who gave evidence to the inquest into Madden’s death. Mason Jones, a friend of Madden’s, said Russell was “vile” and “abusive”. Although Jones said he could not remember the exact words Russell used, he said: “I recall Jon saying at least once that he was in control of the town and would end her life if she didn’t do it herself.”In evidence, Russell denied saying this, but he did admit he had encouraged Madden to kill herself before this.In the days leading up to Madden’s death, her mother, Bernadette Sutton, had told police and social services that she was concerned about the threat Russell posed to her daughter. “By this point, I thought he would kill her or she would take her own life,” Sutton said, in a statement.Nigel Parsley, the coroner, concluded that Madden died by suicide while the balance of her mind was disturbed, but he also cited her relationship with Russell, with whom she had two children, as a contributory factor.“Kate’s toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate’s known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death,” he said.The circumstances surrounding Madden’s death are no doubt tragic, but they are also an example of an increasingly controversial area of UK justice, one which has been described as a blind spot in the law’s ability to see the growing numbers of suicides among domestic abuse victims as something more: evidence of potential crimes.Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests that growing numbers of victims of domestic violence are taking their own lives. Campaigners are now calling for the circumstances that led to these deaths to be investigated.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Barter’s death was judged by a coroner to be an unlawful killing.The Guardian recently reported onthe case of Georgia Barter, whose suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be unlawful killing – only the second time in English legal history that such a conclusion has been reached. Despite this, no police investigation into Bignell’s role in Barter’s death has ever been launched and the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.Inquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted.In Katie Madden’s case, although the coroner acknowledged that a toxic relationship contributed to her death, he did not make any finding of unlawful killing. Almost two years on, Madden’s family say Russell has not been investigated in relation to any of the inquest findings or any alleged abuse. This is despite admitting at the inquest that he gave Madden a black eye weeks before she died.Police closed the assault investigation just days after Madden was found hanged at her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk. “The idea that it would just be dropped because she died – it should never be the case,” her mother says.‘Her happy ever after’“You just couldn’t have wished for a better mum and person,” Sutton says of her daughter. “She was very generous. She would give anybody her last penny. She would give anybody a lift.”Growing up, Sutton remembers her daughter as a “bundle of fun and a very lively girl” who often had her head in a book. It was when Madden was about 12 that Sutton noticed a “massive change” in her daughter. “She wouldn’t get out of bed,” Sutton says. “She wouldn’t tell me anything.” Much later, Sutton discovered Madden had been sexually abused.As her teenage years passed, Madden began drinking heavily and going missing. Sutton felt powerless to protect her daughter and she spent a brief period in care. At 16, she dropped out of school after becoming pregnant with her first child, she began self-harming and using cannabis. She also tried to take an overdose – her first attempt at suicide.She was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Sutton says Madden had spells of stability, was devoted to her children, and eventually got her own house in Lowestoft.However, she also recalls that many people “took advantage” of her daughter, using her home to drink alcohol and take drugs. “Most of Katie’s friends, I wouldn’t even call friends, I would call them acquaintances,” Sutton says. “She never really understood how vulnerable she was. I said to her: ‘Can you not see that these people are taking advantage of you and your roof over their heads?’”However, by late 2016, Sutton remembers Madden as being in a “good place”. It was then she met Russell. She told her mother she thought she had finally got her “happy ever after”.Throughout the course of our three-hour interview, Sutton refuses to say Russell’s name, describing him only as the “alleged perpetrator”. She recalls being uneasy in his company from the outset. When she first met her daughter’s new partner over a meal, she says she “wasn’t 100%” but tried to convince herself she was being overprotective. “Mothers sit on the fence to begin with,” she says.Madden soon fell pregnant with the couple’s first child, who was born in 2018. It was around this time she received a disclosure through Clare’s law, otherwise known as the domestic violence disclosure scheme, warning Madden of Russell’s past.At Madden’s inquest, Russell agreed that he had “significant previous involvement” with the police, including one conviction for “physically assaulting a woman”.A referral was made to a multi-agency safeguarding hub in light of the Clare’s law disclosure but the case was closed before any safety planning took place. In evidence, a senior social worker from Suffolk county council’s adult social services said this was because it looked like “a misdirected referral” as it did not indicate Madden “was subject to abuse or a crime”.In a statement, the local authority said “lessons were learned by all agencies” after Madden’s death and added that it had “strengthened” its referral process “ensuring that safeguarding concerns about parents and children are shared promptly and appropriately” between departments. The council also said it had introduced “domestic abuse workers with dedicated training to better support adults in a child’s life who may be experiencing domestic violence”.Madden had a second child with Russell in 2020. From this point, Sutton recalls, their relationship was “on and off”, something she remembers her daughter found hard to navigate. “Katie fell in love, this was her happy ever after,” Sutton says. “And suddenly it’s all [fallen] apart for a number of reasons.”The next few years were punctuated by mental health crises. In November 2021, Madden spent four weeks in intensive care after crashing her car into a brick wall, scared her children would be removed from her. In June 2022, she asked for the children to be taken into care. “Katie’s children were her everything, but she felt that she was fighting so many battles,” Sutton says. A clinical psychologist suggested Madden would benefit from specialist cognitive behavioural therapy but she never received funding for it from any of the public services she was in touch with.Sutton told the inquest that during this time, Madden was “fenced off” by Russell, and would sometimes spend days in bed without her phone as Russell “would smash it”. The inquest was also told that, in February 2023, Russell struck Madden on the face with her phone. Two months later, the court heard, Madden arrived at a contact meeting with her children with a cut to her eye and told Sutton she had been assaulted by Russell after a night out.At the inquest, Russell accepted he had given Madden a black eye. He had been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and forbidden from contacting her.In the weeks that followed, Madden’s mental health problems spiralled. On 3 June, Sutton contacted her daughter to make arrangements for a picnic in the park with her children. Madden simply replied with a love heart.The following evening, Sutton’s doorbell rang. It was a police officer. She knew instinctively what had happened. “I told her that she didn’t need to tell me,” Sutton says. “I told her what she’d come for.”‘I said, go kill yourself’Mason Jones was one of the last people to see Madden alive. In a statement, he told the inquest that he had only been friendly with her for about a month before she died. On the morning of 3 June, he recalled waking up to a string of messages from Madden, who seemed upset by some social media posts suggesting that Russell was with another woman in a hotel. At 7am, Madden and Jones went on a drive. Jones said he wanted to buy drugs to manage pain related to a medical condition.Jones recalled that Russell “seemed to instigate” contact with Madden, despite his bail conditions. In his evidence, Russell claimed Madden called him. In response to Jones’s allegation that Russell said he was “in control of the town and would end [Madden’s] life if she didn’t do it herself”, Russell became agitated. “I didn’t say that,” he replied. “Get me the evidence … I wouldn’t say that. I’m a father. Why would I say that?”He was asked by the coroner what the “general contents” of the call were. He said: “It was very erratic at the start. She was crying … she was just very panicky … I tried to reassure her but then it escalated into an argument. I ended up saying bad stuff.”The coroner asked if Russell had told Madden she should hang herself. “I didn’t say hang herself,” he said. “There was a couple of references where I said, go kill yourself. Instantly, I went back on myself, and said, don’t be silly, don’t do that.”Jones said he and Madden went to another friend’s house, where Madden “continued to argue” with Russell by phone before returning home. At about 12.45pm, she sent a message to Jones which read: “Thanks for putting up with me.”Later that afternoon, Joe Hart, a friend of Russell’s, visited Madden’s home as she was looking after his dog. He told the inquest that Russell had told him Madden had “a noose around her neck”, but said: “At the time, I didn’t think it was a serious statement.”Hart did not get a reply at Madden’s house. He threw an empty milkshake bottle at her bedroom window to try to get her attention but there was no response.Neither man alerted the police, or Madden’s family. Hart said this was “because of what Katie was like … she’d quite regularly go off the map after she’d been wrecked”.Russell disputed knowing Madden had a noose around her neck. He told the inquest: “She said that she was going to kill herself, she didn’t say she had a noose around her neck.”When Russell was asked if he had failed to raise the alarm because he wanted Madden dead, he said:“You shouldn’t be speaking like that. I’ve got two children with her. Come on, man, that’s wrong. I didn’t want her dead. I dream about her every single day.”Hart returned to the property at about 5pm on 4 June, the inquest heard. He said he contacted Russell, who encouraged him to break in if there was no response. When he entered the house, Hart found Madden hanged and called the emergency services.‘There is no better detective than a mother’On the way to Madden’s home, PC Bradley Congleton was told there was a history of domestic violence between Madden and Russell, which had culminated in a live assault investigation. He recovered Madden’s phone from the property. When he charged it, he told the inquest, he found messages from Russell encouraging Madden to kill herself.“There is no doubt in my mind, that is what he said to her,” Congleton said.Congleton’s focus appears to have been on preparing a timeline of what had happened at the actual scene. In his evidence, Congleton said he considered it a priority to trace Russell to check his movements. At first, Russell would only speak to Congleton through an open window, the officer said. He recalled Russell saying that Madden had told him in her last hours that she “didn’t want to be alive any more” and was “intoxicated through drink and drugs”. Russell told Congleton he had been concerned but not been able to attend the address due to his bail conditions.“I just cannot even begin to think how Katie was feeling,” Sutton says. “I know she was feeling hopeless … she was made to believe that everything was her fault.”About a fortnight after Madden’s death, when Sutton was clearing out her daughter’s house, a letter arrived from the police, addressed to Madden. It said the assault case against Russell was being dropped.“They must have known that Katie passed away,” Sutton says. “And they sent her that letter for me to open. And I was so upset, angry and cross about it, I ripped it up and I was so gutted that I did.”Sutton says she contacted police as she had “a gut feeling there was more harm” in her daughter’s case. She was given Madden’s phone. “I read and listened to her messages,” she told the inquest. She described Russell’s messages as “awful”. “He told her to kill herself,” she told the court. “This is something he had said on many occasions.”“There is no better detective than a mother,” Sutton says. “What Katie was saying would haunt me for the rest of my life. I just remember Katie saying in one of those voice notes, ‘You are giving me more reason to do it. You are not welcome at my funeral.’”Sutton said she wanted police to review Madden and Russell’s communications in case they were able to build a case against Russell for coercive control; she claims officers told her they only had the capacity to examine a month’s worth of data.She recalls an officer who tried to “reassure us as a family” that the information about Russell would be held on file. “That’s no good to me,” she says.The Guardian sent Suffolk police a series of questions about Madden’s case. The force said it was unable to answer them as her death was the subject of a domestic homicide review that had yet to conclude. Domestic homicide reviews examine the deaths of adults suspected to have suffered violence, abuse or neglect at the hands of a partner or family member. They are intended to identify lessons for the multiple agencies involved, rather than decide on whether any criminal investigation is merited.The Guardian was not able to reach Russell for comment.Madden was cremated in an intimate family ceremony. “She was never the centre of attention,” Sutton says. “She would never have wanted to be on parade.”‘How many more women have got to die?’After Madden’s inquest Parsley, the coroner, issued a prevention of future deaths report addressed to the police, social services, the NHS, the home office and the Department forHealth. He said there was “no formal system in place” to support Madden, even though she was “known to be vulnerable” after the Clare’s law disclosure and that multi-agency safeguarding referrals made in respect of her children were “viewed in isolation, with no system in place to assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself”.He said that the public bodies Madden was in contact with each suggested another should pay for her cognitive behavioural therapy, which she ultimately never received.Sutton, who works in the NHS, says she hopes lessons will be learned after the tragedy and criticised “the lack of communication, the lack of empathy, the lack of professional curiosity, the lack of risk assessment, the lack of the standard stuff that should be happening” when it comes to dealing with alleged victims of domestic abuse.Despite the police finding messages on Madden’s phone from Russell in which he told her to kill herself, the Guardian understands no police investigation into their relationship or the circumstances surrounding her death has been launched since her inquest.“How many more women have got to die?” Sutton says. “Whether they take their own lives, or whether someone takes their life for them, how many more women, before something is done? How bad does it have to get before someone is prosecuted?”In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

Keir Starmer looks even weaker than he dida week ago, uncoupled from the aides who wrote his scripts and picked his fights, and only still in his job because the cabinet and parliamentary Labour party stared into a chaotic immediate future and decided not to pounce – for now. The high-stakesGorton and Denton byelectionarrives in less than two weeks’ time. Policy-wise, meanwhile, we are about to finally be presented with a set of plans that have been fitfully gestating for over a year, and causing a quiet chorus of jangling Labour nerves.That sound is now getting louder. Any day now, the government will publish theeducation white papercontaining its plans for sweeping reform of England’s provision for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, or Send. Amid rising fears aboutcurrent and future costs, that document will shine light not just on the government’s thinking about the system it wants to change, but even bigger questions about Labour’s views on disability and human difference, and the relationship between families and the state. And if the proposals misfire, this most fragile of administrations will find itself back in the nightmarish place it ended up in when Labour MPsrefused to pass its cuts to disability benefits– only this time, the resulting chaos could consume it.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson and her colleagues want tomaximise the numbers of Send kidstaught at mainstream schools, driven by a staunch belief in the ideal of “inclusion”, and the slightly less idealistic imperative to cut spending on comparatively expensive special school places, and hack down thetransport billsresulting from getting thousands of kids to scarce placements miles away from where they live. Over 10 years, £3.7bnwill be spenton buildings and facilities in mainstream secondary schools that will seemingly contain “inclusion bases”, where kids with the relevant needs will be given extra help.But the government says it wants its new Send model to go much further. It is about to implementwhat it calls“the most ambitious and comprehensive Send training offer ever seen by the English schools system”, which will apparently ensure that “every teacher receives training to support pupils”, in both these new facilities and standard-issue classrooms. So how much has been found for this great leap forward? Here we encounter a gap between lofty ambition and the likely reality that is one of this government’s specialities. The answer? Just £200m – which must cover not just England’salmost 470,000 teachers, but support staff, people who work in further education colleges, early-years workers and more. Even on the most generous estimates, that works out at no more than a couple of hundred pounds per head.There has been no talk at all so far about improving the chronically miserly pay and lowly esteemof teaching assistants, despite the fact that existing Send support in mainstream schools – let alone the kind of hugely ramped-up provision the government wants to create – depends on them. I have also heard precious little about the dire shortage of the speech and occupational therapists who will be needed for the kind of great transformation the government seems to want; nor anything at all about what will happen topost-18 provision. Current Send support can go up to the age of 25, but observing the current conversation, you would think everything starts and ends with schools.And so to a huge anxiety among parents – and many MPs – that will not go away. Some 638,000 children and young people in Englandhave education, health and care plans(ECHPs), those documents that set out needs and support as a matter of legally enforceable rights, and whose numbers have hugely increased largely because of the decline of ad hoc, everyday Send help. For many parents, they form one precious pillar of accountability: the other is the official Send tribunal, to which they can appeal against a council’s refusal to assess their child for an EHCP, or suggested provision that they feel is either lacking or inappropriate. On this score, ministers and their advisers have spent the last year refusing to deny that EHCPs might be on their way out for most families, but also declining to say what they are planning: even now, when asked about any of this, they tend to emit the kind ofnervous wafflethat fills parents with dread.Worse still, the informational vacuum this leaves has been filled by another one of the government’s grimmest habits: near-constantanonymous briefings, often greeted with the maddening Department for Educationmantra: “We do not comment on speculation.” One high-up sourcehas saidthe government may “cut the tribunal off at the knees”: there have been whispers about taking refusals to assess children out of its reach, and further restricting appeals to whether other council decisions have followed the right processes, rather than their actual content. On this evidence, with the caveat that change is likely to be gradually phased in, the plan will not be to restore the Send system to stability by ensuring councils can meet their responsibilities, but by drastically reducing the number of parents they have to deal with: a classic bureaucrats’ fix, which has nothing to do with outcomes for children.In some Westminster circles, such ideas are justified by attacking and guilt-tripping a familiar folk devil: the pushy, sharp-elbowed parent, who supposedly enjoys unfair Send privileges (in truth, fighting for help is agrinding trial, whatever your alleged advantages). Almost certainly, that notion is one key reason why the government seems to be set on limiting legal rights, perhaps encouraged byrecent researchshowing that wealthy areas in England have recently seen bigger increases in Send spending than their poorer counterparts. In this reading, accountability and legal entitlements are mostly a bourgeois sham. It’s telling, though, that people fond of such arguments never make the case for making systems of accountability more open and accessible: the prevailing idea, which often thinly conceals a drive to cut provision, is that because pursuing your rights tends to be less impossible for one layer of society than another, the only egalitarian solution is to ensure no one has any rights at all.All told, the government’s underlying vision seems to be of a great rebalancing, away from personalised support towards the kind of top-down system in which families basically get what they’re given.A reportlast week from Sky News held out exactly this prospect: ministers, it said, “ultimately want to restrict the number of children with specific per-pupil funding packages, and to curb the number of parents who end up taking their case to tribunal”.What that might say about the Starmer government’s basic instincts is both fascinating and depressing. In the midst of all its chaos, this sometimes looks like an oldLabouradministration, in the worst possible way. It has no modern versions of that tradition’s good stuff: massed council-house building, or the creation of the NHS. But what remains is a familiar and very old-fashioned mistrust of redress, choice and accountability, a tendency to side with officials and penpushers, and an apparent belief we should all be grateful for whatever favours the state can give us. At a moment when Labour is being regularly warned of the dangers of retreating into an ideological comfort zone, that would be quite some safe space in which to take refuge. It would also test a lot of people’s faith in a party they hitherto believed was on their side: in all likelihood, to breaking point.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionNeurodiversitySchool fundingChildrenSchoolsLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, our resident perfectionist is here to help you master your massamanFelicity CloakeSun 15 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleBickering pleasantly over the menu in a Thai restaurant with my family recently, I realised I was unable to explain exactly what a gaeng massaman was, beyond the fact it was probably a safe bet for those concerned about the three chillies next to the green curry (a dish I first tackled for this column back in 2010). The gap in my repertoire was explained later when I openedDavid Thompson’s pink bible ofThai Foodand learned that “a mussaman curry is the most complex, time-consuming Thai curry to make”. The fact the esteemed Australian chef also describes it as “the most delicious” is scant comfort given I’ve just promised my editor I’ll make at least six of the things … but then I remember how incredibly tasty it is, and knuckle down to my research.View image in fullscreen‘The most complex, time-consuming Thai curry’: David Thompson’s massaman. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.Though the first recipe dates from 1899, massaman, whose name suggests an association with the country’s Muslim minority, probably dates back to the 17th century, and reflects either Persian or Malaysian influence, or perhaps that of the Indian and Middle Eastern spice traders who travelled through southern Thailand on their way to China. It’s unusual in its use of dried spices like cumin and cinnamon, bay leaves and cloves alongside more classic Thai aromatics like lemongrass and galangal to create a richly savoury gravy that cloaks the protein and potatoes like a warm hug direct from Bangkok. Straightforward enough if you have a Thai specialist nearby, it’s still more of a weekend project than a weeknight dinner, but a very worthwhile one nonetheless.The curry pasteThe time-consuming part here is the paste, which, thanks to the additional dry spices, has alonger ingredient list than, say, a red or green curry version. The basic idea is the same, however, so once you’ve assembled everything you need, there’s not much more to it. That said, “as massaman curry paste is basically red curry paste PLUS some spices”, toquote Pailin Chongchitnant, the chef and author behind Hot Thai Kitchen, you can save yourself some time by using a ready-made red curry paste, asMeera Sodha suggests in her vegan weeknight version. (According to Chongchitnant, most commercial massaman curry pastes skimp on the pricier spices, which is why she doesn’t recommend them.)As long as you have a stick blender or a spice grinder, it’s easy enough to make your own (and, I’d argue, considerably more satisfying, unless, like me, you’re making several different versions at once). The basic ingredients will be familiar from other curry pastes: shallots, lemongrass, garlic, galangal, chillies, pepper, coriander root and shrimp paste. To briefly run through the less widely available ones, Thai shallots, or red onions, are smaller and more pungent than the varieties used in European cooking, but if you can’t find them, look for round, rather than banana shallots. Galangal is a pale, stubby rhizome with a peppery, slightly resinous flavour, which will probably be found in the fridge in south-east Asian specialists. Ginger is often mentioned as a substitute, but though there’s no harm in adding it instead, they don’t taste much alike to me – you’re better off rehydrating dried galangal if that’s all you can get.The chillies in question are the long red dried variety that you’ll find easily in any supermarket international aisle or Asian specialist (do not substitute chilli flakes; I can’t be held responsible for the consequences). Having done a tour of London in search of coriander root, I can tell UK readers that unless you get very lucky with a delivery (Khun Ya in Bermondsey tell me they tend to receive theirs, and sell out, on a Monday morning), you’ll need to buy it online or use the stems instead; as Kay Plunkett-Hogge explains in her book Baan, “it’s not quite the same, but it will do.” I do manage to locate the makrut lime called for in Leela Punyaratabandhu’s family recipe, which is quite the thrill – it doesn’t seem to be a common addition, but if you come across one, a few strips of rind lend a very pleasing zestiness to her dish.View image in fullscreenJohn Chantarasak’s massaman calls for a paste featuring the addition of cumin and coriander seeds, cloves, peppercorns and mace.To this basic mixture, the recipes I try, fromPlunkett-Hogge,Anglothai chef and author John Chantarasak,Punyaratabandhu’s book Bangkok, Sodha and Thompson, all add cumin. Like Hogge, Sodha also uses cinnamon (Thompson goes for cassia), and that’s it for her simple recipe. Everyone else includes coriander seeds and cloves; peppercorns (Plunkett-Hogge, Punyaratabandhu and Chantarasak); nutmeg (Plunkett-Hogge and Thompson ); mace (Thompson and Chantarasak); and cardamom (Plunkett-Hogge, Thompson and Punyaratabandhu).White cardamomis mentioned by some, which is a new one on me, and proves wellnigh impossible to track down – “very rare”, says my local Thai shopkeeper, presumably referring to their stocking policy, as I eventually manage to buy a large bag online. When they arrive, they look more like dried chickpeas than cardamom pods, and have a mildly peppery, slightly lemony flavour. As almost all of the recipes concerned suggest substituting green cardamom, this would be my advice, though if anyone would like an almost-full bag of the white sort, I’m not convinced I’m going to get through it in this lifetime.Massaman should be warmly spiced, rather than piquant, with a peppery heat that’s balanced by the mellow sweetness of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves (I haven’t included mace, because it’s slightly harder to get hold of and no one could pick it out in the finished dishes, but feel free to add a couple of blades). Everyone but Sodha toasts the spices before use, and everyone except Punyaratabandhu browns the fresh aromatics, too. Though clearly not mandatory, this step does seem to give the finished dishes a richer, deeper sweetness. To this end, I’m also, like Thompson, going to include ground peanuts, though you can leave this out if catering for allergies, or indeed use Sodha’s peanut butter to make life even easierA note: if grinding the paste by hand, then soak the chillies first, but unless you have both strength and patience, I’d strongly urge you to use a spice (/coffee) grinder for the spice mix if you have one, and an immersion blender to make the paste – if you only have a mini chopper, which requires liquid to work, then add a little of the coconut cream to grease the wheels. The paste can be made well ahead of time and refrigerated.The curry sauceOnce you have the paste under your belt, you’ve done the hard work. Most recipes then fry it* to use as a base for the curry’s gravy, but Chantarasak adds the fried paste to the pot much later in the process, an order that makes more sense when I read David Thompson’s warning that too much coconut milk “will dilute the intense flavours of the curry” … which is indeed what happens when I add his own paste to the litre of coconut milk called for by the recipe in his book. The results are still absolutely delicious, yet regrettably less pungent and aromatic than promised by the smell of the fried paste. When I watch himpreparing the same dish on YouTube, however, I discover he follows much the same method as Chantarasak, adding a little of the meat-poaching liquid to the paste, rather than watering down the paste with a whole pan of poaching liquid, which I think is the key to achieving a really full-flavoured result.View image in fullscreenLeela Punyaratabandhu’s massaman calls for the addition of Seville orange juice and peel.Once you’re happy with the consistency of the gravy, it’s time to adjust the flavour with that triumvirate of classic Thai seasonings: palm sugar, fish sauce and tamarind water, though pineapple juice is sometimes used instead of, or alongside the last, most notably by Thompson. My judges say this reminds them slightly of a pina colada, “but not in a bad way”. Nevertheless, I’ve left it out – but perhaps start with a dash, rather than a full cup if you’d like it. Alternatively, you might prefer the orange juice and peel (ideally a bitter Seville orange) in Punyaratabandhu’s version, which has noble precedent, as it pops up in the first recorded recipe by 19th-century chef and author Lady Plean Passakornrawong. Again add it at the end, so as not to spoil its freshness of flavour.*The paste is either fried in oil, or, as in Thompson’s recipe, in cracked coconut cream – cream that has been fried until the oil breaks free. Much room is taken up online by people bemoaning the stabilisers in much tinned coconut milk and cream, which prevent it separating – organic brands tend to be emulsifier free, but you could use coconut, or vegetable oil instead.The curried itemsView image in fullscreenKay Plunkett-Hogge suggests swapping chicken for goat.I would say meat, but Sodha’s recipe using extra-firm tofu is proof that you really don’t need it here – indeed, one of my testers complains that the slow-braised short ribs in Chantarasak’s recipe are distracting him from the deliciousness of the sauce. Tofu, a culinary blank canvas, is unlikely to have this problem. Massaman is generally made, however, with beef or chicken – as it’s a dish with Muslim origins, it’s never made with pork. Plunkett-Hogge suggests swapping in goat, for which I use diced mutton shoulder, which garners strong support from my testers; though I’ve stuck with chicken, the sweetness of the sheep meat works well with the spicing.Massaman is also unusual in that it tends to include large chunks of meat on the bone rather than bite-size pieces; Thompson hacks up chicken legs, but it’s probably easier, especially if buying pre-packed meat, to go with the bone-in thighs Punyaratabandhu recommends, piled high in a smallish pot, so they stay nice and juicy. Thompson deep fries the meat and vegetables – which “seals and firms the chicken and vegetables, as well as enriching the curry” – while Punyaratabandhu shallow fries hers, skin-side down. In a home context, I think just browning the meat before braising is sufficient. Like Chantarasak, I’m adding cinnamon and bay leaves to the coconut milk poaching liquid to perfume it – if you’re making a beef version, you might also like to include his star anise.Also unusual in a Thai context are the potatoes, though chef Bongkoch “Bee” Satongun of the Michelin-starred Paste Bangkoktold National Geographic Traveller magazinethat her mother favoured chunks of pineapple, and Chantarasak mentions daikon and sweet potato as potential alternatives. Don’t skip the whole shallots, though – as with Plunkett-Hogge’s raisins and Chantarasak’s golden sultanas, their sweetness echoes that of the curry, while roasted peanuts give the dish a finishing crunch.View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha finishes her massaman with sauteed chard and fresh red chilli.To finish, Sodha tops her curry with sauteed chard and fresh red chilli, which looks attractive, and Chantarasak a drizzle of coconut cream, which is a nice idea if you happen to have some leftove but isn’t worth cracking open a fresh tin for, plus a few caramelised shallots – again, if you have a pot open, by all means sprinkle them over the top, but I think it looks perfectly delicious without any garnish whatsoever.This can be made up until the addition of the potatoes, then reheated as required; indeed, Punyaratabandhu recommends making it a day ahead. Serve with steamed Thai rice and something fresh – Plunkett-Hogge’s snappy, zippypounded cucumber saladproves a popular pairing with my guests.Perfect massamanServes4-6Prep30 minCook50 minFor the paste (or use 6 tbsp red curry paste and the * ingredients)1½ tsp cumin seeds*2 tsp coriander seeds*2 cloves*4 cardamom pods*½ nutmeg, grated*1 cinnamon stick, roughly broken¼tsp white or black peppercorns6 long dried chillies, seeded and roughly crushed (soaked in water for 20 minutes if using a pestle and mortar)4 Thai shallots or 2 round shallots, peeled and chopped5 plump garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 lemongrass stems, trimmed and purplish section only chopped (save the trimmings)2 tbsp finely chopped galangal2 tbsp finely chopped coriander root or stems1 tsp Thai shrimp paste(kapi)25g unsalted roasted peanuts*, roughly choppedFor the curry8 Thai shallots or 4 round ones, peeled and halved or quarteredNeutral oil, to fry6 chicken thighs, bone inSalt1 cinnamon stick3 cardamom pods, lightly crushed3 bay leaves800ml coconut milk4 smallish waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into halves or quartersSalt180ml coconut cream(brands without emulsifiers work best)Palm sugar, to tasteFish sauce, to tasteTamarind water or puree, to taste30g roasted peanutsView image in fullscreenTo make the paste, toast the dry spices in a hot wok or frying pan for a couple of minutes until aromatic, then allow to cool slightly before grinding to a powder.

Ms Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,” her attorney, David Oskar Marcus,said. “Only she can provide the complete account. Some may not like what they hear, but the truth matters.”She added: “For example, both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing. Ms Maxwell alone can explain why, and the public is entitled to that explanation.”WhileDonald Trump’s team has denied he was considering such an act of mercy for Maxwell, her pitch rekindled discourse on whether a presidential pardon, or commutation of her sentence, were potentially on the table.Trump for months has dealt with political blowback over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files, as he waffled on campaign trail promises to release all documents amid growing attention on hisprior associationwith him.Legal veterans told the Guardian that any sort of clemency for Maxwell – albeit hypothetical at this point – would likely do little to provide insight into Epstein’s crimes. Attorneys for Epstein’s victims, meanwhile, have condemned her clemency pitch, with one calling it “twisted” and cast doubt on her motivations, and ability, to tell “the truth”.“She’s saying, look, what I’ll do is: I’ll clear you, Mr President Trump, I’ll clear whomever, if you let me out,’” said RJ Dreiling, a defense attorney and former prosecutor in Los Angeles. “If she’s saying, ‘Get me out of jail in exchange for this information’, it obviously undermines any kind of credibility for her and any information she provides.”“It’s kind of a game of chess between her and the administration, where she’s saying, ‘Help me out, and I can help you. Don’t help me out, and maybe I can hurt you,’” Dreiling said.“Obviously, the president doesn’t want to be seen granting clemency to someone who’s convicted of an extremely serious series of crimes. But at the same time, he’s got to be worried that he could do or say something that could really even more negatively impact his reputation and his standing with the American public.”Neama Rahmani, founder of West Coast Trial Lawyers, said: “As a former federal prosecutor, I think Maxwell’s proposal is distasteful, actually downright shameful, but there’s nothing unlawful about it. She realizes now that her supreme court petition has been denied, she is going to spend decades in federal prison unless she can get a pardon or sentence commuted.”Rahmani added: “She theoretically has potential habeas argument, but I think it’s very unlikely that she’ll be able to collaterally attack her conviction. This is her easiest way out.”Aside from credibility concerns – which also stem fromprior allegationsthat Maxwell lied under oath – clemency would not guarantee she would tell everything she knows.“When it comes to presidential clemency, I’m not aware of any conditional pardons or clemency that have previously been issued,” said Eric Faddis, a defense attorney at the Law Offices of Eric Faddis, and a former felony prosecutor. “What is the legal mechanism by which you can go back to Maxwell and say, ‘Hey, you didn’t give us enough. We’re pulling this clemency?’”“It doesn’t work like that, so there’s really a question as to how any conditions of a presidential clemency could be enforced.”Attorneys have also noted that information about Epstein’s crimes – and hissweetheart dealthat allowed him to skate federal prosecution in 2008 in exchange for admitting to state-level charges – could be revealed without Maxwell’s promise of help.“It’s clear that anything that comes out [from Maxwell] would be so corrupt and tainted that it’s worthless,” said John Day, a defense attorney who previously worked as a prosecutor. “If you don’t see that, you’re ignoring the realities of this case.”“The way to get to the truth is to follow the trails of victim statements [and] unredacted documents, and find out who was trying to protect all these rich and powerful men through the redactions,” Day said. “Stay with the victims. Look through the records. Ask who is protecting whom still, and [do] not believe anything that Maxwell says, because her story is up for sale. There’s a price on it.”Lawyers representing Epstein’s victims see Maxwell’s offer as little more than self-interested horse-trading.“Ghislaine Maxwell invoking the fifth while dangling the promise of testimony in exchange for a pardon is not courage or cooperation – it is leverage. This is a convicted sex trafficker with a documented history of deception attempting to trade on information she has withheld for years in order to secure personal freedom,” said Spencer Kuvin of Goldlaw, who has represented numerous Epstein victims.“Conditioning ‘the truth’ on clemency from Donald Trump looks less like a search for justice and more like the latest maneuver in a long pattern of manipulation,” he also said in a statement. “Victims have waited far too long to see accountability to accept another transactional offer wrapped in the language of disclosure.”Jennifer Freeman of Marsh Law Firm, who represents Epstein victim Maria Farmer, voiced similar sentiments.“It was no surprise that Ghislaine Maxwell – a convicted sex trafficker and felon who has been previously accused of repeatedly lying under oath – is now attempting to trade her version of her involvement in crimes against young women and girls, for a pardon or other leniency,” she said. “Maxwell’s statements are not to be trusted, designed to best suit her twisted agenda and continued concealment of her wrongdoings.”“Survivors ofJeffrey Epsteinand Maxwell deserve justice for the abuse and trafficking they have endured, which would be thwarted by crediting Maxwell, offering her clemency, pardoning her, commuting her sentence, or in any way limiting the hard fought conviction imposed after trial by a jury of her peers, and sentence delivered by a an experienced, well-regarded judge.”Maxwell’s team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. White House press secretary Karoline Leavittsaidof the pardon issue: “This is not something I’ve discussed recently with the president because frankly, it’s not a priority.”According to the Hill, Leavitt said: “He’s focused on many of the issues that the American people are dealing with and providing solutions to those issues.” Leavitt also noted that when she last spoke to Trump, it was “not something he’s considering or thinking about”.The president has denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.Explore more on these topicsGhislaine MaxwellJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

I clamber precariously up the stairs on the bus, and hang on for dear life down the escalator to the tube. At least I’ve been brought up well enough to never put my feet on the seat. Wouldn’t want to brick the upholstery.2pmNow for a real test: bowling atBloomsbury Lanes.Bes behind the counter assures me that rubber-soled shoes are fine, now that bowling shoes are a post-Covid relic. “Just not high heels,” he says. I’m usually rubbish, but – with my Crocs acting like two giant anchors – I fluke a split. Victory!

How will I fare with feet likeKrusty the Clown? “Not tonight, mate,” I’m told at my first velvet rope. “No trainers. No sportswear. No exceptions,” I’m told at the second. “Those are a health and safety violation and also hideous,” says the third gatekeeper. It’s like my Crocs come with built-in bouncer repellent. No wonder I was told to brick off.Back at home in my trusty Adidas, I realise these aren’t shoes; they’re a performance art piece about the triumph of novelty over sense.

Ahead of his prison drama Wasteman, David Jonsson discusses the pressures of being a leading Black British actorSun 15 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 07.56 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleDavid Jonsson is the kind of actor who disappears so completely into his roles that it’s easy to forget you’re watching the same person each time. In Rye Lane, he’s a lovestruck south Londoner; in Industry, an Etonian banker with ice in his veins; in Alien: Romulus, a paranoid android. He’s now starring as heroin addict Taylor in the ultraviolent British prison drama Wasteman and, for the first time, the 32-year-old actor claims he is playing something close to himself. “This is the most personal role I’ve done,” he says. “It’s so messed up because it’s a dark story about rehabilitation and addiction, but I know these men really well. Especially when you’re growing up somewhere like where I did.”We meet on a Friday afternoon at a photo studio in Islington, closer to where Jonsson lives now in north London than to Custom House in the East End, where he grew up. He arrives wearing a beanie pulled tight over his cornrows and a windbreaker. He looks stylish but carries a delicate shyness that mirrors his character’s air of desperation. Wasteman, which opens this month after a critically acclaimed festival run that netted five British Independent Film awards (Bifa) nominations including best lead performance for Jonsson, tells the story of Taylor, a young father who has spent 13 years in prison for a crime he committed as a teenager. In the film’s unflinching depiction of the British prison system, he’s referred to as a “nitty” – UK slang for a desperate, pathetic drug addict. Jonsson lost 1.8 stone to embody Taylor’s “wasted” physique. “I wasmawga, properly skinny,” he says, slipping into patois.Jonsson is the youngest of four children, born to working-class parents – his mother a police officer, his father an IT engineer at Heathrow. His background is Creole: Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Caribbean, with a Swedish surname that hints at truly global origins. But when he was 11, his parents separated and the one stable thing in his life collapsed. “When you come from a broken home, it changes you,” he says. “That’s part of what happens with Taylor.” It’s the knock-on effect of incarceration that Wasteman portrays with devastating clarity: punishment doesn’t end with the prisoner.At school, that instability manifested as trouble and he was expelled for fighting. “I wasn’t a bad kid at all,” he insists. “I was just a bit … distracted at the time.” He remembers coming home to tell his mother, who had just finished a night shift. She was one of the first Black PCSO officers in London, walking a beat in Islington for decades – the same area we’re sitting in now. Exhausted and extremely disappointed, she asked what he wanted to do with his life. It was one of those existential questions parents ask when you least want to hear it, and Jonsson surprised himself with his answer: he wanted to act. “My parents are hard workers: if you want something then prove it. There’s no point talking about it.” It seems that ethos is still with him; he refers to acting as “a job” rather than “a craft” or “calling” like many young actors.The irony of having a police officer mother isn’t lost on Jonsson: she spent a decade arresting boys like him, while he now plays a man brutalised by the very system she served. Does that complicate his thoughts on the prison system? “Of course. I have sympathy for everyone working to keep us safe. But growing up as a young Black man in London, I’ve had some weird things happen.” He won’t elaborate, but the implication is clear: his mother’s profession and his own experiences exist in uncomfortable tension – a tension present throughout Wasteman.After being expelled, he moved to a school in Hammersmith – a 90-minute commute across the city – and discovered acting through school plays and the National Youth Theatre. At 16, he won a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, spending much of his two years there skating in Washington Square Park before returning to London. After his mother suggested he audition for Rada, he promptly won a place.View image in fullscreenStreets ahead … David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah in Rye Lane.Photograph: Chris Harris/20th Century StudiosWasteman was, improbably, Jonsson’s first ever film audition. He was fresh out of drama school and focused entirely on theatre, when his agent sent him the script – not for Taylor, but for Dee, the more traditionally violent convict character eventually portrayed by Tom Blyth (a far cry from Blyth’s role in Netflix’s frothy romcom People We Meet on Vacation). “I got my girlfriend at the time to draw a tattoo on my neck,” he recalls. “The director threw a punch at me. I threw a chair at him. I thought I nailed it.” Then he heard nothing. “I was like, ‘Oh: I guess I’m not as good as I thought.’”The film had been with A24 and the Safdie Brothers, who ended up dropping the project to make the Adam Sandler-starring crime drama Uncut Gems instead, meaning the project sat dormant for years. In the meantime, Jonsson left Rada early to joinRobert Icke’s stage revival of Mary Stuart, playing opposite Juliet Stevenson. His screen breakthrough came with Industry in 2020, the BBC and HBO series about cutthroat young investment bankers. Cast as Augustus “Gus” Sackey, Jonsson visited Eton and Oxford to research the role of a privileged Black man navigating the overwhelmingly white world of high finance. The performance was revelatory, but after two series, just as the show was becoming a hit, he left. “You only get one life,”he told GQ in August 2025. “Life is short, art is long.”His first gig post-Industry was Rye Lane, a joyful south London romcom that premiered at Sundance to whatDeadline called “sunny, irreverent” acclaim. Then came BBC Christmas detective drama Murder Is Easy, in which Jonsson became the first Black actor to lead an Agatha Christie adaptation. That milestone resurfaces in the news on the morning we meet – a BBC-commissioned review warning against “tick box” diversity casting has just been published, explicitly citing Murder Is Easy as an example of diversity being “superimposed” on a story. The review argues that “unless it’s very skilfully done, there is a danger it will feel overly didactic and preachy.”View image in fullscreenPlane sailing … Jonsson as Gus Sackey in Industry.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Bad Wolf/HBOJonsson is diplomatic when I bring it up. “I’m always going to be British,” he says. “Britain will always be home for me. Even when I worked onAlien– this massive American studio film – they’d reference my British sensibility. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s part of it. We do things differently on this tiny island.’” He’s undeniably benefited from a shifting landscape; in the wake of Black Lives Matter, British broadcasters began addressing the whiteness of their output. What’s striking is that he’s already experienced different phases of the conversation – first subverting expectations in Industry, then receiving backlash as a Black lead in period drama.His casting as a Black robot in 2024’s Alien: Romulus engendered a predictable wave of criticism, too. But his race brought an unexpected edge to the film’s exploration of the ubiquitous sci-fi question, “What does it mean to be human?”, and the film’s $351m box office haul showed the value of inspired casting. When director Fede Álvarez asked him to deliver the franchise’s most famous line – the Sigourney Weaver battle cry “Get away from her, you bitch” – Jonsson understood the stakes. “I was like: ‘I don’t know – you’re kidding right?’” Jonsson recalls, laughing. “Fede said: ‘Just give me one.’ I did and that was the take that made it into the film.”He’s grinning through the anecdote, but the significance isn’t lost on him. Alien brought visibility, and visibility brought a 2025 Bafta rising star award. When he accepted it, he quipped: “Star, I don’t know, but rising – I guess.” Then he turned serious: “Growing up, I had the Denzel Washingtons and Idris Elbas, but they’re not me. There’s not enough space for diverse talent in this industry. I realise I have an important role in defining what Black is.”View image in fullscreenBreak out star … David Jonsson. Photographed at Angel Space; grooming: Asata Allen; stylist: David Larson.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianIt’s a responsibility he remains acutely aware of. “Every character I do, no matter what, I’m going to be a Black man first,” he says now, echoing the sentiment expressed in his acceptance speech. “Until we change what it is [to be a Black man], everyone’s going to have a certain view on it, you know what I mean? But I think that is evolving.”In Wasteman, Taylor’s Blackness is never explicitly discussed, yet it shapes everything – the way guards speak to him, the institutional contempt he faces, the lack of resources available to him. This feels deliberate: a crime drama with a Black lead where Blackness isn’t the story. Taylor faces no overtly racist guards or prison gangs. Instead, the racial dynamics are present but unstated, which makes them all the more insidious.The preparation for the role was intense. Jonsson worked with a charity that reintegrates former inmates and watched “folders and folders” of iPhone footage shot inside British prisons. Many of the supporting cast are former inmates themselves. He watched Steve McQueen’s Hunger – the film about IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands – multiple times in the lead-up. “This feeling of people doing something beyond themselves in a contained existence. That’s what’s happening with Taylor. He’s waking up, hitting the drugs, fighting for his life daily, going to sleep, rinsing and repeating. You’ve got to have something keeping you going,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe hard cell … David Jonsson and Tom Blyth in Wasteman.Photograph: Lionsgate UKThe idea of his character’s motivation clearly resonates: “Here comes the cringe,” says Jonsson, suddenly self-aware, “but I feel like I’m quite a complicated person. Sometimes I feel great and happy and sometimes I’m not. The darker stuff right now is interesting me.”Faith, he explains, helps him navigate that darkness. He grew up in the church and still attends, describing it as his “north star”, though he’s careful not to be preachy. “Faith is a personal thing for me. It’s what keeps me going. Life is tough enough without having something outside you … there’s a lot of darkness behind this wall, you know?”Perhaps the most devastating moment in Wasteman comes when Taylor speaks to his young son for the very first time – on FaceTime. Jonsson, too, met the actor playing his son for the first time during the scene. “The reaction I had is what made it into the movie. Imagine if that was your truth – for some people it is.” Taylor’s incarceration hasn’t just stolen his own life – it’s robbed his son of a father, perpetuating the exact cycle of absence that shaped Taylor himself.View image in fullscreenDavid Jonsson as Andy in Alien: Romulus.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosIf Wasteman represents one kind of intense male relationship under duress, The Long Walk represents another. The Stephen King adaptation follows a group of teenage boys forced to walk at a relentless pace until only one survives. Jonsson plays the buff Pete McVries opposite Cooper Hoffman’s Ray Garraty, a boy grieving his father’s death. The film’s premise is brutal – teenage boys walking themselves to death for public entertainment – but the real story is about what happens between Ray and Pete as exhaustion strips them bare.Shot in chronological order over six-and-a-half weeks in Winnipeg, the film required the ensemble to walk many miles each day. “We didn’t really know what we were getting ourselves into,” Jonsson recalls. “Baking sun, torrential rain, freezing cold. It was like a marathon.” By the end, he and Hoffman had covered about 350 miles together. The physical ordeal wasn’t method acting for its own sake – it was the point. “I don’t like acting tired. I’d rather just do it,” he says.But it’s the emotional landscape – and his relationship with Hoffman – that affected Jonsson most deeply. “I’ve never met anyone like him,” he says of his co-star, the 22-year-old son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. “He’s phenomenal. But there’s always more with Cooper. Always something deeper.” Filming a scene in which Hoffman’s character talks about losing his father, Jonsson found himself genuinely moved by what his co-star delivered. “They say our job as actors is to listen. And listening to him was transformative for me.” He pauses, choosing his words carefully. “You do stop and think, ‘where’s the line?’ And then you go, hang on, that’s incredibly brave, putting something of yourself out there for other people.”View image in fullscreenPartners in crime … Jonsson with Morfydd Clark in Murder Is Easy.Photograph: Album/AlamyNow Jonsson and Hoffman are reuniting for upcoming crime comedy The Chaperones. When Jonsson talks about their partnership, he invokes old Hollywood. “I think about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck teaming up, doing stuff again. I kind of dig that.” It’s a deliberate aspiration: two hungry young actors trying to recapture the magic of the late-90s indie boom that birthed, among other things, Hoffman’s father. “We’ve got a chance to go to places we haven’t been,” says Jonsson. “That’s a gift.”What’s next is characteristically ambitious. He’s currently filming Colman Domingo’s directorial debut Scandalous, playing Sammy Davis Jr opposite Sydney Sweeney’s Kim Novak. He’s also intriguingly set to star in Frank Ocean’s long-awaited directorial debut, though details remain scant. It’s a far cry from Custom House, yet Jonsson insists on treating it all as work rather than destiny. “That’s why I call it a job,” he says. “If I don’t, I’m in la-la land.”Sitting cross-legged, beanie pulled tight, he seems remarkably at peace with not having all the answers. “I wish I could say I know what I’m doing,” he admits when I ask about navigating this new level of visibility. It’s an unassuming approach and perhaps a helpful one when it comes to completely disappearing into a role. But with Wasteman, for the first time, Jonsson isn’t disappearing at all – he’s showing us exactly who he might have been.“It was scary, actually,” he says, hesitating slightly. The fear, he explains, wasn’t about the physical transformation or even the character’s darkness – it was about proximity. “I look at myself, someone who got kicked out of school, and I think: one wrong turn – one bad choice – that’s all it takes. Taylor made that choice. I didn’t – but I could have.”Wasteman is released in UK cinemas on20 February.Explore more on these topicsDavid JonssonAlienDrama filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

When she did, police dropped domestic violence inquiryHannah Al-OthmanandGeraldine McKelvieSun 15 Feb 2026 16.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe number of women who are driven to suicide by domestic abusers is being under-reported, and their cases overlooked by police, in what has been described by experts as a “national scandal”.Domestic violence suicides are already growing at such a rate that a woman in an abusive relationship is now more likely to take her own life than be killed by a partner.But research into the number of women who take their own life in such circumstances has suggested official statistics could track as few as 6.5% of the true number of cases.According to the Domestic Homicide Project, a programme led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), there were 98 suspected suicides following domestic abuse in 2024, compared with 80 intimate partner homicides.But research by a suicide prevention programme in Kent found that about a third of all suspected suicides in the region between 2018 and 2024 were affected by domestic abuse.If the numbers in Kent reflect the national picture, it could mean as many as 1,500 victims of domestic abuse are taking their own lives every year – up to 15 times as many as previously thought.Tim Woodhouse, the programme manager and a University of Kent academic, who led the research, said: “We need some sort of national taskforce to get a grip on this.” He added that it was “bonkers that we are basing national estimates on one researcher’s evidence”.He said his work was “just trying to open people’s eyes that this is happening way more often than people think – it is, in terms of numbers, a national scandal”.The data collected by the NPCC, he said, was a “good start”, but “they’re not counting very many of the right suicides, they’ve got very tight exclusion criteria so they’re massively underplaying the number”.Recording domestic suicides is just one part of campaigners’ struggle to have causes of death in these cases more thoroughly investigated. There has been only one criminal conviction for manslaughter in UK legal history where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse.Lawyers believe this number shows coroners may have been too quick to dismiss deaths as suicides without properly considering whether they could be unlawful killings.Campaigners have called for all suicides where domestic abuse is suspected to be investigated as potential homicides from the outset, in order to ensure the best evidence is collected and preserved, as well as more multi-agency work to protect victims from abusers in the first place.To illustrate the scale of the crisis, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles about the people, most of them women, who have died by suicide following domestic abuse.Inthe case of Georgia Barter, her suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be an unlawful killing.An inquest in Walthamstow, north-east London, heard evidence that Bignell had kicked, stamped on and sexually assaulted Barter, but he was never charged with any offences in relation to his alleged abuse. Despite the coroner’s findings, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.Today we also revealthe case of Katie Madden. At an inquest, her former partner Jonathon Russell admitted he had given Madden a black eye and, hours before her death, told her to kill herself. No criminal investigation into Russell’s role in Madden’s death has been launched.CPS to train staff on ‘spectrum of abuse’ in violence against women and girlsRead moreIn many cases, prosecutors do not see a basis for investigating wrongdoing and fail to bring any criminal charges at all after a domestic abuse suicide. It means alleged abusers are rarely investigated for offences such as violence or coercive control – despite a wealth of evidence often being presented to a coroner in an inquest. Families have also found police have dropped domestic abuse investigations after the victim has died.Pragna Patel of Project Resist said: “Too many bereaved families who have lost loved ones to domestic abuse-related suicides are being failed by a criminal justice system that is not fit for purpose.” Her organisation has brought together bereaved families to launch a campaign to seek changes in the criminal justice system.“At the heart of the injustice is not the failure of training, the absence of ‘professional curiosity’ or the lack of laws, but a systemic culture of discrimination, arrogance, indifference and apathy,” she added.More recently, there have been concerted efforts from the NPCC and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges in such cases.There are now two men being prosecuted for manslaughter following a suicide after domestic abuse, and both organisations have stressed they are keen to bring more cases to court.However, lawyers, campaigners and families have said there are issues with individual police forces and officers failing to understand the impact of domestic abuse or to adequately investigate cases immediately after a death.“Sadly, police forces too often miss opportunities to disrupt escalating domestic abuse and protect victims,” said Kate Ellis, the joint head of litigation at the Centre for Women’s Justice.“Too often we see police forces failing to take any criminal action against perpetrators, or consider protective measures that could be put in place, even when domestic abuse cases are graded as high risk. These errors can have fatal consequences.“We believe that some domestic abuse-related suicides are preventable, particularly in cases where the police are on notice of the abuse,” Ellis added. “Coercive and controlling relationships tend to follow similar patterns, so it is vital that police identify these patterns and act quickly.“We are also concerned that many suicides in apparent domestic abuse contexts are not recognised or investigated by the police as potential homicides, even when there is significant evidence of prior domestic abuse.”Southall Black Sisters has been campaigning for abuse-related suicide to be recognised as homicide for more than 40 years, and introduced an amendment in the crime and policing bill that was supported by more than 50 MPs.The organisation has specifically raised concerns about the possible overrepresentation of suicide driven by domestic abuse and “honour”-based abuse within Black, minority and migrant communities.“Women in these communities have additional barriers to overcome in order to escape abuse caused by intersecting racism and misogyny,” said Hannana Siddiqui, the director of policy, campaigns and research.To date, there has only been one criminal conviction for manslaughter where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse. Nicholas Allen pleaded guilty to the charge in 2017 after his former partner Justene Reece took her own life. Allen had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge.In March, Ryan Wellings was cleared of the manslaughter of Kiena Dawes by a jury at Preston crown court. Dawes took her own life, leaving a note on her phone saying: “Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.” Wellings was convicted of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six and a half years.Georgia Barter’s mother, Kay, said: “It’s been almost six long heartbreaking years since I lost my beautiful daughter Georgia. Still the fight for justice goes on. I would like to ask this government ‘when did this country stop respecting or protecting women and girls?’ Now is the time to show them you care.”She added: “The only successful conviction for manslaughter where a person’s partner died by suicide was in 2017 almost ten years ago. That is shocking. I’m sure I speak for myself and the countless grieving families out there – we demand change now.”Frank Mullane of the campaign group Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse said: “It might not be enough to rely on the police improving their investigations and the CPS optimising its prosecution, to ensure perpetrators face justice after domestic abuse related suicides.“The defence team will exploit the merest mention of mental health difficulties and the jury may struggle to convict for manslaughter. A new law, specific to suicide caused by domestic abuse, will make it easier for the jury to identify causation. It will give confidence to the CPS to bring cases and it will educate the public.”In the UK,Samaritanscan be contacted on 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they write.There is significant reluctance among voters in Britain and Germany to accept economic pain in return for rearmament, even while majorities in both countries believe the outbreak of a third world war is more likely than not in the next five years.In Britain,polling this month by YouGovfound that a minority favour tax rises (25%) or spending cuts (24%) to fund greater spending on the armed forces – including those who say it is very important to increase UK hard power.German and French voters are also now less likely than they were last year to support increased defence budgets if it meant a trade-off with other investment, according toa poll for Politicothis month.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said at the weekend that there wasan urgent need for Britain to have a closer defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.In a visit to the Munich Security Conference, he told the audience: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years” as he argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.Europe was, he said, “a sleeping giant” but there had been fragmented industrial planning and procurementKnighton and Breuer write: “If Russia perceives Europe as weak or divided, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. We know that Russian aggression and intentions extend beyond Ukraine.”Echoing language used by government figures in Britain, Germany and other European states, Knighton and Breuer said the complexity of threats demanded a “an honest continent-wide conversation with our publics that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone”.They called for a “whole-of-society defence” with resilient infrastructure, research and development in technology from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats.The UK and Germany have committed to deepening security and defence cooperation andsigned what became known as the Trinity House agreementin 2024.The German government is under pressure to meet its promise to revive economic growth after a prolonged downturn and to ramp up defence spending amid concerns over Russian aggression.Germany is permanently stationing a combat brigade of 4,000-5,000 troops to Nato’s eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence.Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has also started, alongside an expansion of industrial capacity.Britain is building as many as six munitions factories, which are aimed at generating what the Ministry of Defence describes as an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles.The debate about European security – almost four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and amid increasing ambiguity around the extent of US support for Nato after Donald Trump’s return to the White House – comes as the governments in Germany and the UK seek to rebalance spending after an era of investing a supposed “peace dividend” in public services.Nato leaders at last year’s summit in The Haguecommitted to spending 5% of GDP on defence and securityby 2035.Such a move would expand the British economy in the short term,according to research, but there is still opposition on the left of the Labour party to defence hikes at the cost of spending on health and alleviating poverty. That debate is even more polarised in Germany, with opposition to increased defence spending on the left and, to a degree, from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.Speaking on the opening day of the Munich conference, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, singled out the threat Russia posed to Europe, warning “freedom can no longer be taken for granted”.“We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom,” he said.Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyGermanyRussiaEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

It is unclear how long the meeting between Truss and Trump lasted and how it was initiated.Truss, who has increasingly adopted extreme positions to the right of the Conservative party she once led since she left office, and has attempted to relaunch herself as a podcaster, has made addresses in each of the last two years at the flagship annual conference of the US right.She told the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC)in Maryland last yearthat her own country was “failing”, as she appeared alongside rightwing populists from around the world planning deeper ties and cooperation.An increasingly marginal figure in British politics, who was prime minister for only 49 days and lost her seat in 2024’s general election, Truss has sought to secure a safe harbour at CPAC, a once mainstream conservative gathering that has embraced Trump’s brand of nativist-populism.At home in the UK, meanwhile, Truss has beentrying to get her own cluboff the ground and has been accused of wandering the premises of London’s exclusive club 5 Hertford Street in search of members to poach for her rival operation.The latter, called The Leconfield, asks “founding members” for £500,000 and was conceived by Truss and the property tycoon Robert Tchenguiz, who is transforming his Curzon Street offices for the venture.Explore more on these topicsLiz TrussDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

It demands an in-depth police investigation, and is by far the biggest scandal of all.”Vince Cable, the former Liberal Democrat leader, has also said the police should check whether criminal corruption took place while Mountbatten-Windsor was trade envoy. Cable, who was business secretary for some of that period, said the former prince’s alleged behaviour was “totally unacceptable”.“We need a police or DPP [director of public prosecutions] check on whether criminal corruption took place and a government investigation into how this was allowed to happen,” he said.Thames Valley police previously said they were reviewing allegations that Epstein provided Mountbatten-Windsor with a woman to have sex with at Royal Lodge in 2010, as well as the allegations of misconduct in public office.Mountbatten-Windsor, who served as the UK’s special representative for trade and investment between 2001 and 2011, has always denied any wrongdoing.Explore more on these topicsAndrew Mountbatten-WindsorJeffrey EpsteinnewsShareReuse this content"

But we were patient, we kept the vibe up. We kept very positive because we knew we were going to have opportunities to come.”It was not quite a perfect day for Team GB, however. Mia Brookes was seen as the snowboard slopestyle favourite, having won the world title as a 16-year-old. But she fell on both her runs in qualifying, finishing 16th overall, and misses out on the final on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or death.Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “Our latest data shows we are now seeing a big measles outbreak in north-east London, mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries, with some being hospitalised.“Measles is a nasty illness for any child but for some it can lead to long-term complications and, tragically, death, but [it] is so easily preventable with two doses of theMMRV vaccine.” The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) was replaced by the MMRV with the addition of chickenpox (varicella) to the vaccination.Saliba urged families to ensure their children have not missed any doses. She said: “With Easter holidays fast approaching, it is a timely reminder to families travelling overseas to ensure all family members, especially children, are vaccinated, as measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe.”Global health officials announced earlier this year that the UK wasno longer considered to have eliminated measlesafter reportingalmost 4,000 infectionssince 2024.The outbreak comes amid declining uptake of the MMRV vaccine across the UK, with only about84% of children receiving both dosesby the age of five, well below the 95% level needed to prevent outbreaks.Enfield has one of thelowest MMRV vaccine uptakerates in the country, according to UKHSA figures from last August, which showed just 64.3% of five-year-olds in the borough received both doses in 2024-25.The Sunday Times reported that more than 60 suspected cases of measles had been reported by seven schools and a nursery in Enfield.A message posted on the borough’s Ordnance Unity Centre forHealthGP surgery website described a “fast-spreading measles outbreak”. It said: “During this recent outbreak, one in five children have been hospitalised due to measles and all of them had not been fully immunised.”Alev Cazimoglu, Enfield council’s cabinet member for health and social care, said: “The current outbreak has mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital. Measles is one of the most infectious known diseases. It is approximately six times more infectious than Covid-19.“Catching the measles is entirely preventable, but it spreads extremely quickly where vaccination levels are low. By checking your family’s vaccination status and taking up the free NHS vaccine, you are protecting not only yourselves but also vulnerable members of our community.”Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health, is writing to every parent in the area to try to contain the spread of the disease. Temporary vaccination centres have been established in schools across the borough in an effort to boost immunisation levels.Sher-Arami told the Sunday Times the outbreak had the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” as people travel across the city for work and school.She said average vaccination figures – which are low across the city – masked significant pockets of very low uptake, which created prime areas for measles to spread.Modelling of a large measles outbreak in London by the UKHSA suggests between40,000 and 160,000 people could become infected. Last July achild died from measles in Liverpoolafter a small outbreak there.Since the start of the year there have been96 confirmed casesof measles in England, three-quarters affecting children under 10. Enfield has had the highest numbers, followed by Birmingham.There is no specific treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it.Although the vaccination has been proven to be safe and effective, now-debunked claims that the injection was linked to autism have persisted on social media and among some minority ethnic communities, contributing to vaccine hesitancy.Measles spreads through coughs and sneezes and by touching contaminated surfaces, making it extremely easy to pass on in schools. Earlysymptomsinclude a high fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and red, watery eyes. A blotchy red-brown rash usually appears a few days later, starting on the face before spreading across the body.Explore more on these topicsMMRChildren's healthVaccines and immunisationHealthLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The report contained allegations about Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, journalists at the paper, which then spread around Westminster.The paper reported that Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former Sunday Times employee, wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the Sunday Times story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.Harper was said to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the published story were likely to have come from a suspected Kremlin hack of the Electoral Commission.“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he reportedly wrote. Apco’s report was also said to have referred to Pogrund’s Jewish background and made baseless allegations about his faith, upbringing and personal and professional relationships.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

No other British journalists were investigated in any document he or Labour Together ever received, Simons said.The Conservative party chair, Kevin Hollinrake, said that Labour Together’s behaviour showed “a contempt for the free press”.“With its close and widely known links to the heart of government, serious questions must be answered about who was aware of these actions, including whether senior figures around the prime minister knew,” he said.Alison Phillips, the former Daily Mirror editor who joined Labour Together as chief executive three months ago, emailed its staff on Sunday evening.She said: “As a former journalist and editor, it should come as no surprise that I was horrified that investigators hired by Labour Together would look into the background and sources of reporters even if I am assured that this was not the intention.”The focus had to be on the future, and the organisation was “under new leadership”, she added.John McDonnell, the veteran Labour backbencher and former shadow chancellor, said on Saturday he had written three times in recent weeks to the general secretary of the Labour party to call for an independent inquiry into the affair.“I copied Keir Starmer into each request,” McDonnell said. “Clear to me as secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable.”Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, said the prime minister needed to look into the affair himself and should meet McDonnell to discuss it.The contract showed that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the US journalist Matt Taibbi.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

Shipwreck World, a group that works to locate shipwrecks around the globe,announced on Fridaythat the team led by Ehorn found the wreck about 20 miles (32km) offshore between Racine and Kenosha,Wisconsin.Ehorn’s Lac La Belle discovery took place in October 2022. The announcement was delayed because his team wanted to include a three-dimensional video model of the ship, but poor weather and other commitments kept his dive team from going back down to the wreck until last summer, hetoldthe Associated Press in an interview.Ehorn, 80, has been searching for shipwrecks since he was 15 years old. He said that he’s been trying to pinpoint the Lac La Belle’s location since 1965. He used a clue from fellow wreck hunter and author Ross Richardson in 2022 to narrow down his search grid and found the ship using side-scan sonar after just two hours on the lake, he said.“It’s kind of a game, like solve the puzzle. Sometimes you don’t have many pieces to put the puzzle together but this one worked out and we found it right away,” he said. The finding left him “super elated”.Ehorn declined to discuss the clue that led to the discovery.Richardson said in a short telephone interview on Sunday that he learned that a commercial fisherman at a “certain location” had snagged what Richardson called an item specific to steamships from the 1800s. He declined to elaborate further on how competitive shipwreck hunting has become and how the information could alert searchers to another way to conduct research.The luxury passenger steamer, called the Lac La Belle, set off from Milwaukee to Grand Haven, Michigan, one October night in 1872, with 53 passengers and crew as well as a cargo of 19,000 bushels of barley, 1,200 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork and 25 barrels of whiskey, according to Shipwreck World.‘We must protect and we must understand’: using shipwrecks to rebuild fish populationsRead moreAbout two hours into the trip, the ship began to leak uncontrollably. The captain turned the ship back to Milwaukee, but huge waves came crashing over, extinguishing its boilers. The storm drove the ship south. At around 5am, the captain ordered lifeboats lowered and the ship went down stern first.One of the lifeboats capsized on the way to shore, killing eight people. The other lifeboats made landfall along theWisconsincoast.According to an account on Shipwreck World, the Lac La Belle was built in 1864 in Cleveland, Ohio. The massive 217ft (66-meter) steamer ran between Cleveland and Lake Superior but sank in the St Clair River in 1866 after a collision. The ship was raised in 1869, and reconditioned.According to Ehorn, the ship’s exterior is covered with mussels and the upper cabins are gone, but the hull looks intact and the oak interiors are still in good shape.The Great Lakes are home to anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 shipwrecks, most of which remain undiscovered, Discoverreported. Shipwreck hunters have been searching the lakes with more urgency in recent years out of concerns thatinvasive quagga musselsare slowlydestroyingwrecks.The Lac La Belle is the 15th shipwreck Ehorn has located, the Associated Press reports.“It was one more to put a checkmark by,” Ehron said. “Now it’s on to the next one. It’s getting harder and harder. The easier ones have been found.”Ehorn will be presenting the discovery in person at the 2026 Ghost Ships Festival in Wisconsin in March, along with video and more images of the wreck.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

Advance UK, led by the former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by the far-right activist known as Tommy Robinson, said it would consider a merger.Such a force could cost Reform a number of seats – and potentially even power, in a wafer-thin general election result – by splitting support among those drawn to hard-right anti-immigration populism.One seasoned Tory strategist said: “We’ve had a general election with a big Labour win but where a lot of their MPs had margins of around 1,000 votes, so you could see small challengers on the right disrupting Reform’s attempts to follow that.” In 2024, 46 seats were won with a margin of less than 2%.View image in fullscreenThe audience for Lowe’s announcment in Great Yarmouth.Photograph: Jason Bye/The GuardianWhile Reform has placed great store in social media, Habib and, in particular, Lowe have significant presences on X, where each have been amplified by Elon Musk, who funded Robinson’s legal bills last year.Musk, who has taken a dislike to Farage in favour of Lowe, retweeted the latter on Saturday, saying: “Join Rupert Lowe in Restore Britain, because he is the only one who will actually do it!”A cohort of young rightwing would-be influencers pushing a more exclusive, ethnically nationalistic view of British identity have flocked to Lowe, who had attained a cult appeal among many Reform members.Among those at his event in Great Yarmouth was Lucy White, an activist and sometime GB News contributoraccused of racist tweets. Steve Laws, a prominent activist and “ethnonationalist” influencer, tweeted: “Rupert Lowe is our leader. GET IN LINE.”Other figures such as the millionaire businessman Duncan Bannatyne and the actor John Cleese have also given approving signals.Advance UK, meanwhile, has cultivated street protest. Large numbers of its flags – in some cases handed out to people unaware of the group – were prominent among the thousands of people who marchedthrough the town of Crowboroughlast month against the use of a former military base to house asylum seekers.View image in fullscreenAn anti-immigrant march in Crowborough, East Sussex, last month.Photograph: Andrew Hasson/The Guardian“Reform are vacating the part of the political spectrum on which it was founded. We’re the old Reform, and Reform is becoming the Tories 2.0,” Habib said before the launch of Advance’s first policies at the Emmanuel Centre, a Westminster venue let out by an evangelical church. The former Brexit party MEP says he has put £100,000 into the party and it has raised £600,000 from other sources.“We have people joining us because they’re fed up with the way Reform is run, or because they have an ideological conviction and see Farage changing the message,” he said. “Our original Reform manifesto had rejected the World Economic Forum and yet there was Farage taking anIranian billionaire’s moneyto go to Davos.”An early indication will come this month in the Gorton and Denton byelection where Advance is standing Nick Buckley, who received an MBE for his charity work but who has since become known for his extreme language on race and Islam.Lowe’s party, meanwhile, has adopted a decentralised structure that is likely to show up the top-down approach of Farage’s party. The Great Yarmouth First party is aiming to win all of the nine seats in the borough whenever postponed county council elections take place. This will be a pilot for Restore Britain, which will act as an umbrella for others.Separated from Reform, Lowe has proven himself able to attract attention. A self-styled “inquiry” that he set up into the grooming gangs scandal attracted the involvement of Tory MPs including Nick Timothy, Esther McVey and Gavin Williamson.View image in fullscreenThe former Reform rising star Maria Bowtell at the Great Yarmouth event.Photograph: Jason Bye/The GuardianIn Great Yarmouth, one of the English coastal towns with high levels of deprivation, which Reform used as a springboard for its 2024 breakthrough, a clash between Lowe and his old party looms at the next general election. “We won it last time and we will win again,” Reform sources said.But Lowe remains a rallying point for others. Rightwing activists and former Reform supporters had travelled from as far away as Scotland to attend the event. They included Maria Bowtell, an East Riding of Yorkshire councillor and single mother who was once regarded as a Reform rising star and who had driven down with her young son.“Reform used to stand for something hopeful but it’s clear they won’t really change anything, plus people like me just weren’t supported,” Bowtell said. “I went on Woman’s Hour and was hung out to dry.

Stateside telly responded to Sherlockmania with Elementary, which relocated Jonny Lee Miller’s Holmes to New York and made Watson and Moriarty female, but was in many ways a more faithful sleuthfest than the overblown Benedict Cumberbatch show and ran for scores more episodes. Long before that, the biggest drama in the world was House, which was set in a hospital but featured a mercurial genius solving baffling mysteries – once the House-Home-Holmes penny dropped, you knew you were watching Sherlock in disguise.Watson is the latest attempt by US network television to keep the Conan Doyle canon firing, and it’s a straight cross between House and Elementary. Morris Chestnut is Dr John Watson, who is an American practising medicine in present-day Pittsburgh, but is also a war veteran who, when the show aired its first season last year, had just finished a stint cracking crimes in London with Sherlock Holmes. Showrunner Craig Sweeny, formerly a writer/producer on Elementary, gave his new Watson a litter of eager doctor pups who, like the gang who used to trail around behind Dr House, were always a step behind their boss when it came to working out which arcane condition was about to kill that week’s patient.Season one began with an episode where Watson said both “The game’s afoot” and the line about the answer being what remains once the impossible explanations have been eliminated; from there it regularly fed Sherlockians little treats, with appearances by Irene Adler, Inspector Lestrade, Mycroft Holmes and, in an episode that told us exactly how seriously to take all this, an auditory hallucination of Sherlock himself caused by Watson going off his meds, with the voice of Sherlock provided by Matt Berry. For the real Holmes heads, a relatively minor character on the page is promoted to the regular cast here: off-books source/fixer Shinwell Johnson is Watson’s aide, played by Ritchie Coster as a growling hard nut with a heart of gold and an eye on whatever Guy Ritchie’s next project is.The first run’s major story arc, a blackmail plot orchestrated by Moriarty (Randall Park), ended with Watson killing Moriarty and, finally, moving on from his ex-wife Mary Morstan (Rochelle Aytes) by getting himself a new girlfriend. Could it be time for the series to ditch the fan-pleasing references and become more than just another trudge around the Sherlock Holmes museum?View image in fullscreenRochelle Aytes as Mary and Juanita Jennings as her mum, Elizabeth.Photograph: CBS/ParamountAs a House-style medical case-of-the-week show, Watson works well. Most of its charms are embodied by Chestnut as the titular doctor-detective: forever flawless in expensive cotton and linen, he gives the impression he could lift you on to a counter-top with one arm and smell divine while doing it. He is, indeed, enjoying some tastefully lit, high thread-count horizontal time when his phone goes and it’s Mary, reporting that the show has indulged in a classic season-opener stakes-raiser. Mary’s own mother has had a funny turn while baking, and is arriving in an ambulance soon.Tasked with saving his ex-mother-in-law, Watson schools his team by finding the most likely cause on the initially available facts – Mom makes her own bitter almond extract, which might have given her cyanide poisoning – before shifting into hunky listener mode when the patient develops a rapid memory loss that causes her to believe she is a younger version of herself. When the old woman’s memories, her changing physical symptoms and Watson’s incredible ability to uncover obscure documentary evidence all interact, they throw up a shamelessly emotional story that provokes the same warm, thick tears as a good episode of Long Lost Family. The junior doctors have romances and other soapy personal issues to top up the schmaltz. It’s solid weekly-procedural fare, with the odd flash of naughty wit: an otherwise expositional scene featuring the shaven-headed Shinwell is livened up by filming him standing in front of shelves full of the gleaming busts used to teach med students about different skull shapes.And then, as the end credits are just about to roll and we’re ready to forget any of this ever happened, up pops Robert Carlyle as … Sherlock Holmes! Just like Moriarty in season one, his plunge from the Reichenbach Falls has not killed him and here he is, in Pittsburgh, to become the millionth screen version of the world’s favourite crime-solver. The uneasy mix of medical drama and Holmes worship is set to continue. Perhaps it was unreasonable to hope a show in the Sherlock universe might tick off every other main character and ignore the man himself … but it was nice while it lasted.Watson aired on Sky Witness and is available on NOW in the UK, and Paramount in Australia.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewreviewsShareReuse this content"

She was 19 when she was shot dead by police officers while she lay unconscious in her car in California, in 1998, joining the long, appalling, litany of Black victims of police violence.Here she is named Myeisha Mills, still dead after an officer shoots 12 bullets into her body, but simultaneously alive or rising from the dreamscape of the title to tell us about herself with a painfully exuberant, sweet guilelessness.American writer-director Rickerby Hinds’ award-winning production, which played at last year’s Edinburgh fringe, is told entirely through beatboxing, spoken word, hip-hop and dance (excellent choreography by Carrie Mykuls). It is a dazzling, disturbing experience, its dream world bringing great non-naturalistic power.This is a two-hander mostly narrated from the point of view of Myeisha, but there is no mention of police violence or race from her. She is not a victim to herself but an aspiring hip-hop artist, determined to make it big as an MC. It takes a while to realise that this vital, sometimes funny and playful character is no longer alive, yet her narration pushes back out from her deathly limbo to speak of all she was and could have been. There is a recurring reference to dreaming – “Ever had one of those dreams/ Where nothing comes out when you try to scream?– but this is the only allusion to the violence of her death we get, from her.View image in fullscreen‘She floats, dances and comes to sudden wide-eyed stops’ … Jada Evelyn Ramsey with Josiah Alpher.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianJada Evelyn Ramsey, as Myeisha, speaks from her chair on a bare stage but also moves – she floats, dances and comes to sudden wide-eyed stops, maybe from the shock of another bullet? It’s an extraordinary performance filled with beauty. She sits back-to-back with Josiah Alpher, who is just as charismatic as he beatboxes, raps and narrates the part of characters including the police officer and voices the dehumanising language of her autopsy report.Through the description of the bullets and their entry points in her body, Hinds’ script brings Myeisha’s body to life, tracing its history and recorded experience: a bullet to the head sparks a story about hair (“Hands off the hair”), her first awkward but exhilarating sexual experiences are remembered when the coroner speaks of the bullet to her breast, and a tattoo when he arrives at the bullet to her lower back.There is a paradoxical but palpable sense of joy and zest for life among the unspoken, gruesome, injustice of her untimely death. It is a dream of hope and a nightmare from beyond the grave at once. Myeisha’s voice has no anger. Yet this is what you leave the show feeling: profound anger, deep, deep sadness.AtOmnibus theatre, London, until 28 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Heroin. Crack. Maybe meth or ket. Those substances that steal your soul and slowly wreak havoc on your body. They’re imagining Trainspotting; too-skinny frames and protruding hip bones, the physical effects of addiction that are impossible to miss.But that isn’t how it played out in my family.I was 13 years old when my parents’ marriage fell apart, disintegrating suddenly and seemingly without warning over a few grey November weeks. When I tell people that my mum, my brother and I had no idea my dad was addicted to drugs until after he left us, I can see the bewilderment in their eyes.How could you not have noticed? I ask myself the same question all the time.My dad’s drug addiction didn’t ravage his body. Instead, it built it. As a 17st 7lb powerlifter, he looked to my childhood eyes like something of an adonis. Friends fancied him. Boys in my class coveted his physique. There was never any question of “my dad’s harder than your dad” in my school playground. It was always my dad. And I loved him for it. Dad rarely drank alcohol and ate unfathomable quantities of protein and carbs. He went to the gym several times a week, a habit he had held on to, obsessively, since he was 15 years old. My mum jokes that he even skipped his own stag do to fit in an extra session.View image in fullscreenArthur White at his childhood home in Essex, mid-1960s.Photograph: courtesy of Emma FowleBorn six years after the end of the second world war, my dad grew up on a council estate in Essex after his family were relocated from London’s bomb‑battered East End. Theirs was an ordinary, working-class household. Four kids. Formica table. A budgie in a cage on the sideboard. They were poor, but happy. Like many successful sportspeople, Dad was something of a teenage polymath. He played semi-professional football for Leyton FC and broke the schoolboy sprint record in his last year of secondary school. But weight training was the thing that truly captured his imagination.In the mid-60s, my dad was a skinny kid with a shaved head who knocked around the estate in bovver boots and bleached Levi’s. By the time I was born 10 years later, he was unrecognisable. In 1977, Dad competed in his first British championships and Mum went into labour with me halfway through the presentation ceremony. Perhaps we should have known then that family life would always be overshadowed by lifting. Not even the day of my birth belonged to me alone.View image in fullscreenWhite training at Bethnal Green gym in the late 70s.Photograph: courtesy of Emma FowleA decade later, in 1988, he won his first world championships. He was 37 years old. We welcomed him home with banners that spanned the width of our house and articles in the local newspaper. He won Essex Sports Personality of the Year.Two years later, he went to work one day – and didn’t come back.Until that November in 1990, my parents – who had met at 14 and married at 19 – had seemed ridiculously happy. We were a close family, and alongside his weightlifting career my dad had spent the 80s building a successful construction business. With a villa in Spain and a brand-new red Escort XR3i on the driveway, we looked as if we had it all together. Then it fell spectacularly apart.View image in fullscreenWhite with Fowle’s mother Jacqui on their wedding day in 1971.Photograph: courtesy of Emma FowleShortly before he left, Dad sat me down and told me he was having an affair. I was 13, and felt as if the bottom had fallen out of my world. Then, despite promising me that he would not leave, he did just that. His abandonment came weeks before we were due to move house and was just the first in a long line of catastrophic betrayals that my mum would uncover in the coming months. First was finding out that he had gone to South Africa with the woman he’d promised he was no longer shagging. Second was that he had taken £35,000 in cash from the sale of our house. Two weeks later, after paying cash for a flat in Cape Town and burning through the rest in an extended drugs binge, he returned without a penny. He walked through the airport with only the clothes on his back, begged my mum to take him back, and confessed that he had become addicted to steroids and cocaine. To say that my mum was shocked is the understatement of the century. She knew that he had taken steroids on occasions, but she had no idea about the extent of his dependency. It quickly became clear.Sometime in the mid-80s, Dad had sustained an injury. A bloke at the gym offered him something to speed up his recovery; he was reticent, but nearly everyone was doing it. The dangers didn’t register or, perhaps, like most, he simply chose to ignore them.Over the years, Dad began to dabble in other drugs, too. He took amphetamines to give him a boost; at first for competitions, but soon much more regularlyAnabolic androgenic steroids (to give them their full and proper name) are a synthetic version of the male sex hormone testosterone. They are regularly prescribed to treat chronic and serious illnesses, such as cancer and HIV. But their ability to build muscle mass, reduce body fat and improve performance has often led to them being abused by athletes. They are highly addictive, and the side-effects are wide-ranging and potentially life-threatening, from mental (mood swings, anxiety, depression, paranoia, personality changes, aggression, rage, fatigue, insomnia and irritability) to physical (liver failure, cardiovascular problems, infertility, acne, gynecomastia – the growth of male breast tissue), water retention and kidney disease.Over the years, I saw many of these impact my own family.The irony is that the steroids didn’t make him that much stronger. In 1981, when I was four years old, he won his first European championships with a 340kg squat, a 197.5kg bench press and a 367.5kg deadlift. And there was not a drug in his system. It’s hard to put those sorts of numbers into context if you’re not a gym rat, but, at 110kg, being able to put more than three times your own bodyweight on your back, squat with it and then stand up again is a rare feat.View image in fullscreenA welcome home in 1988 after White won his first world title.Photograph: courtesy of Emma FowleThe truth is that there probably isn’t a performance-enhancing drug in the world that can take a bog-standard average Joe and make him into a world champion anything, but those drugs, they give you something else. Confidence. Arrogance. A sense of invincibility. For my dad, they allowed him to train harder and longer, and that alone was worth it. He would go straight from work to the gym at least three times a week, getting home long after we were asleep. The training, he said, was his God; the obsession to which everything else played second fiddle. The tribe that he found in those East End gyms reflected back to him his own desires, telling him it was normal, admirable and good. Their lives revolved around numbers: waist, thigh and biceps circumferences, one-rep personal bests, totals and bodyweight. The mirrors on the walls reflected bodies that were never quite ripped enough, muscles not quite as big as they could be, personal bests that could be better and lifts that could be heavier, with a few more reps and a vial of this or that to help along the way. It’s amazing what the mind can convince us of. I think of all those bodybuilders, powerlifters and hobby physique-honers and I wonder if it is any different now that we are more informed about issues such as reverse anorexia and body dysmorphia. Never big enough, never heavy enough, always more. They are addictions all right, albeit because they come with sporting success or fitness gains, no one sees it that way at first.When we talk about steroid abuse, we often centre conversations around the physical issues. We understand that it harms your health and damages your heart. Steroids cause the body to bulk, the heart to swell and the arteries to harden. It is a lethal combination. The year my dad won gold, Iceland’s Jón Páll Sigmarsson was crowned the World’s Strongest Man. Five years later, he died of an aortic rupture while deadlifting. Anabolic steroids were confirmed as a factor in his death. But far less attention is paid to the mental and emotional impact. The risk-taking and erratic behaviour. The cockiness and self-destructive sense of invincibility that can change a man’s personality beyond all recognition.Doctors said it was a miracle he was still alive. His heart had swollen to the size of a balloonOver the years, Dad began to dabble in other drugs, too. He took amphetamines to give him a boost; at first for competitions, but soon much more regularly. Amphetamines led to cocaine and, before anyone knew it, everything started to unravel. He began working as a nightclub bouncer. At first, it was an easy win for a man whose growing drug addiction required a little extra cash in hand. But soon he was swapping the relatively tame nightclubs of Essex, with their footballers’ wives and wannabe glamour girls, for much more lucrative – and violent – opportunities.By the time he left us, my dad had been making a series of increasingly drug-addled decisions for a fairly long time. As well as cheating on the woman he had loved since he was 14 years old, the amount of coke he was taking had made a sizable hole in my parents’ finances. When covering it up became impossible, he convinced my mum we needed to downsize – before scarpering off to warmer climes with the cash that was meant to repay his debts. It was the first of many catastrophic financial decisions that would mark the next tumultuous period of our lives.Over the following three years, my dad came and went with alarming irregularity. Sometimes staying for a few weeks, sometimes a month or more, my mum would attempt to clean him up and dry him out – always to no avail. It was heartbreaking and disorientating and so deeply disappointing. He tried to divorce her and then begged for forgiveness. He bounced between our home and the mistress he had left, somehow managing to convince both women to try again over and over and over. He sold his wedding ring for drug money, and my mum took to stashing what was left of her jewellery at a friend’s house whenever he came home. Immersed in an increasingly violent world, he was working as an illegal debt collector and fighting on the streets of London for a living. He became paranoid and depressed and, on three separate occasions, he tried to end his own life – once, on the night that he won his second world title. The drugs that were supposed to make him strong brought him to his knees.Eventually, miraculously, he got clean. Somehow, in the middle of all that mess, I found a faith. My mum and brother followed and, one day, my dad did, too. In the summer of 1993, they were baptised together and a few months later renewed their wedding vows. Slowly, they began to rebuild their life.In the mid-80s, little was known about the long‑term effects of consuming steroids in large quantities. Today, despite much more information about the harmful side‑effects, sales are booming. A recent study published in the European Heart Journal found “an unusually high proportion of deaths in male bodybuilders” – with the risk of sudden cardiac death five times higher among professionals compared with amateurs. But while anabolic steroids were once used almost exclusively by serious athletes, bodybuilders and weightlifters, new markets have now opened up.In 2020, theUK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) revealedthat some experts believed almost 1 million people in the UK were taking steroids. Most of them are men, and many are teenage boys. Emily Robinson, Ukad’s director of strategy and education, called it “a serious public health issue”.View image in fullscreenWhite with Jacqui, James and Emma, c1990.Photograph: courtesy of Emma FowleDigital communication and the dark web have made access to all illegal substances far easier. And social media has created the pressures and unrealistic expectations that drive many to take them. The internet is a phenomenal source of information, democratising knowledge and opening up avenues of learning. But all those buff, bronzed bodies on Love Island can lead to Google searches that you definitely don’t want your teenage son to know the answers to.In 1993, when my dad finally got clean, he went to his doctor and registered as a drug addict. Quite frankly, they told him, it was a miracle he was still alive. His heart had swollen to the size of a balloon, and scans revealed the long, thin striations of stretch marks throughout the muscle. The serious heart pain he was experiencing subsided, but the wild pursuit of strengthening his body has caused organ damage that can never be undone. He has had several heart operations but, still, he is one of the lucky ones. Many of his peers are no longer alive.Yet the physical effects are almost eclipsed by the emotional damage. Nothing can prepare you for the horror of finding out that your parent has tried to end their own life. I still cannot marry up the image of my dad that I carry in my head – the strong, successful, capable man who could do anything, beat anyone, who was always our protector and provider – with a man so crippled with pain that he would attempt that sort of violence against his own body.When my parents reconciled, they had to slowly reconstruct their lives in the aftermath of three years of separation and several more of chaotic, drug-fuelled decision-making. Dad reckons that he blew hundreds of thousands of pounds in total, when you take into consideration the house in Spain that was mysteriously “lost” as well as the flat in South Africa that he paid for in cash and then walked away from. Then there was the jewellery he sold, the cash he wasted, the credit cards he maxed out and the cars he crashed.View image in fullscreenFowle with her father last month.Photograph: James Arthur Allen/The GuardianRecently, I asked Dad how he looked back on it all. “I was fortunate to have survived, but still suffer from the consequences of my drug addiction. There are many things I have done that I’m not proud of, many things I’m ashamed of, but I am proud that I owned up to my mistakes, that I asked for forgiveness from my wife and children, and that they found it in their hearts to forgive.” He returned to competing, drug free, and still won, “proving that drugs were not and are not necessary to win”.In today’s internet age, the pressure on young boys – and girls – to look a certain way has never been stronger. All adolescents are deeply susceptible to the terrible triumvirate of fake news, peer pressure and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex (the brain’s centre for risk assessment, impulse control and long-term planning). Many teenage boys are just after an easy way to get big quick, to not feel embarrassed when getting changed for PE, to impress a girl, or to not stick out like a sore thumb among the gym bros. But, despite what the internet influencers may promise, steroids always have – and still do – come with a serious health warning. My dad was a tough kid from the East End who grew up on a council estate in Essex and became a world champion weightlifter. He was the hardest man I knew. His mistake – like many others before and since – was to think that his strength would protect him from the pernicious physical and personality-changing side‑effects of anabolic steroids.

Archive photograph: courtesy of Jason FoxBorn in 1976 in Plymouth, Jason Fox is a British television personality and former Royal Marine Commando and Special Forces sergeant. He joined the military at the age of 16 and left in 2012 following a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Three years later, he fronted Channel 4’s SAS: Who Dares Wins and went on to present documentaries including The Final Mission: Foxy’s War. He has written books such asBattle ScarsandLife Under Fire, and co-founded the charityRock2Recoveryto support veterans. He tours across the UK with his show Embrace the Chaos from 10 March. His brother, Mathieu, is a tree surgeon.JasonThat’s me in the red jumper. Our parents clearly loved to have a laugh at our expense. All the clothes would have been secondhand because we didn’t have much cash. Whatever clothes I wore, Mathieu would inherit as a hand-me-down two years later. People said we looked similar when we were kids, but I think he looks older than me now! We grew up on the outskirts of Luton, in a three-bed council house. My brother and I were pretty inseparable. We were outdoorsy and loved sport, and both of us struggled a bit with the academic side of school. He always went much further when it came to doing naughty stuff, whereas I had more of an inbuilt appreciation of risk. My nan and grandad had a tree in their back garden – we’d climb it, but he would always go too far up. One time, he fell out.Together, we tested our parents’ boundaries. At about 10, we came of fighting age. He is my little brother, so naturally I found him annoying, but in retrospect I was probably out of order. We slept in bunk beds. One time I must have irritated him, as he ended up kicking the ceiling and putting his foot through the plaster. I also pushed him through a school window. He didn’t hurt himself, thank God: he picked himself up, dusted himself down, checked for cuts and bruises, and pissed himself laughing. Whenever we did something bad, Dad would come home and dish out the discipline. Fortunately, our fighting phase didn’t last too long, as I left home at 16.Why did I join the Marines? Well, I royally mucked up my GCSEs. I didn’t apply myself. I didn’t want to be a failure, and I knew I needed to circuit-break what was going on. My dad was an inspiration, too. He had been in the Marines, but left when I was a baby. He’d tell us stories, and I loved the sound of it. He took us to see the Commando Training Centre when we were kids, and also took us on holiday to Scotland and Cornwall, where he taught us how to map-read, tie knots and learn about the great outdoors. We’d go out for long walks and he’d get us to retrace our footsteps. All of that had a huge influence on both of us.I’d be walking off an aircraft and see Mathieu walking on. Never once did I worry about him, and I doubt he worried about meA few years after I signed up, my brother followed suit. I joined the Special Forces in 2001, then 9/11 happened and I went away on deployment. I’d be walking off the back of an aircraft and see him walking on. We wouldn’t get time to talk – it was more, “Hey, how’s it going?” Never once did I worry about him, and I doubt he worried about me. It took me years to even think about the impact it had on our parents. My dad’s pretty stoical, but for my mum, having her two boys away for 10 years must have been incredibly difficult.The Marines taught me to have confidence in dangerous environments. They don’t just throw you in at the deep end – they nurture you. I spent a decade subconsciously conditioning myself to deal with very difficult, stressful situations.Cariad Lloyd and Rachel Parris look back: ‘We’ve been through a lot – trying for children, losing parents … but our friendship is constant’Read moreWhen I was diagnosed with PTSD, I left the military. Although I initially felt the diagnosis fit the bill, I have since questioned it. I was trained to cope with stress to an extremely high standard, but the real challenge was the transition back to “normal” life, not the severity of what we experienced in the military. I was coming home from faraway places and didn’t have the ability to reintegrate.When you’re a frontline troop doing six to nine months on little sleep, your cortisol levels are constantly firing and it offsets the rest of your internal organs. I would be shot to bits after a tour. Then I’d come home and struggle to establish a solid family base. There were arguments, and we had no money. I was still looking for that burst of adrenaline at two o’clock in the morning – the time you’d normally have a gunfight with the enemy – but the threat wasn’t there. I was miserable to be around and ended up getting divorced. Eventually, opening up to people about how I felt was a huge turning point.In 2015, I started working in TV. It was a strange career path for me, but one I’ve really enjoyed. Doing SAS: Who Dares Wins is always a surprise.Gareth Gates stands out. My perception of him was shaped by his time on Pop Idol – an underconfident teenager with a stammer – but he turned out to be incredibly impressive. And Bobby Norris from Towie went from being absolutely terrible to a frontrunner.I don’t get to see my brother as much as I’d like. He lives in Devon and I live in London. But when we do spend time together, we still connect like we did as kids. We went for a stomp around Dartmoor recently and did a bit of living off the land, just like we used to – only this time there was no fighting or falling out of trees.MathieuAt this age, my brother and I were really close – best mates. We hated each other for while, but once we were both in the military, that bonded us again. My earliest memories of Jason are playing in the snow or watching Dad play rugby. As energetic boys, we were often messing about and rolling around in the mud. Jason was protective of me at school. If someone started badmouthing me or being aggressive, he was the first to step in. He did push me through a window once, but I probably deserved it. Dad would have to pull over if we were scrapping in the back of the car. He’s a loving parent with a soft nature, but if you crossed him, he’d whip us into line. It clearly worked in the long run – just look at my brother now.What the military does to your brain isn’t normal – when you come home, it’s incredibly hard to adjustI wasn’t sad when Jason joined the military. I got his bedroom, so I was quite excited. But I did miss him. I really looked up to him, and when he came home he’d tell stories that inspired me – especially when he became a sergeant in the Special Forces. Some people scrape through and get in, but Jason did everything with flying colours.What the military does to your brain isn’t normal, but we were trained both physically and mentally. When you come home, it’s incredibly hard to adjust. I went from fighting in Afghanistan to arguing with my stepdaughters over whose turn it was to use the hair straighteners. I feel lucky my brother went through it, too, because he understands. There’s a mutual respect, which is why we’re so close now.How do I feel about Jason being “TV’s tough guy”? I don’t want to ruin his reputation – but off duty, at home, he’s just a gentle giant.Explore more on these topicsFamilyFlashbackPhotographyMilitaryfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He should take a page from Bad BunnyThe US president has twisted the 1823 doctrine to suit his quest for domination. It originally had a very different vision for the AmericasTed WidmerSun 15 Feb 2026 09.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 12.48 ESTShareView image in fullscreenThroughoutBad Bunny’s mesmerizing performance during the Super Bowl, the word “America” kept expanding, like an accordion, stretching out to embrace people of all nationalities. “Together we are all America,” his football read, and he obviously meant it, in the largest, most hemispheric sense. Near the end, after shouting “God bless America” (his only words in English), Bad Bunny ran through a long list of countries in the western hemisphere.That inclusiveness enragedDonald Trump, who erupted on social media, and tried to take the word back, declaring the half-time show “an affront to the greatness of America”. By which, of course, he meant the United States.It was refreshing to encounter this greater America – or more accurately, to welcome it back. It has always been there, since the word “America” first appeared, hovering over Brazil in a 1507 map.View image in fullscreenDetail of Waldseemüller’s 1507 map, the first known map to use the name ‘America’.Photograph: Library of CongressEver since he was inaugurated, Trump has acted as if he owns the word “America”. Throughout his secondinaugural address, he used it as a synonym for the US. (“America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.”) His “America first” foreign policy assumes the right to take possession of any part of the hemisphere he wants, whether it’s the oilfields of Venezuela or the frozen tundra of Greenland.This view is perhaps best understood through his repackaging of the Monroe doctrine, which Trump has increasingly invoked as a “big deal”to justify his desire to dominate the hemisphere. In his view, the doctrine appears to be a mantra for an amped-up foreign policy that may soon extend to other nations on Bad Bunny’s list, including Cuba, Colombia and Panama.So why is a 203-year-old footnote from American history,first articulated in James Monroe’s 1823 message to Congress, rattling around the president’s head?While Trump has not paused to define what he now calls the “Donroe doctrine”, it appears to be synonymous with a “Trump Corollary”, recently announced in the2025 National Security Strategy, that would update the Monroe doctrine by alerting all “non-Hemispheric competitors” – presumably China, Russia and Iran – that they will not be able to position forces or own “strategically vital assets” in our region. (That will come as news to the Chinese, who have spent years and billions of dollars building an enormous deep-water port in Chancay, Peru, announced in 2019. They will not be leaving anytime soon.)After introducing the Donroe doctrine during a rambling news conference after the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Trump promised that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”. A month earlier, the White House issued a celebratoryannouncementof the 203rd anniversary of the Monroe doctrine – not an anniversary noted by any previous administration, including Monroe’s. In his message, Trump announced: “I am proudly reasserting this time-honored policy.”These announcements were followed in short order by the Maduro raid, and the threat to annex Greenland, which revealed an administration suddenly anxious over the foreign domination of this hemisphere (despite no evidence, in the Greenland case, of Russian or Chinese naval activity).View image in fullscreenBad Bunny performs during the Super Bowl LX half-time show at Levi’s stadium on 8 February in Santa Clara, California.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Roc NationExcept that Trump has read history incorrectly. Trump sees the Monroe doctrine as a military threat, a way to bully other superpowers out of the western hemisphere and plunder the Americas for any resources the US might want. But in its original formation, the Monroe doctrine was a statement of pan-American solidarity – much closer to Bad Bunny’s than Donald Trump’s.View image in fullscreenSelf-determination, not dominanceThe original doctrine, as written out by a visionary secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, is irreconcilable with the Trump administration’s interpretation of it. It was a plea to give the nations of South America a chance to develop democratic institutions of their own, away from the great powers of Europe. It was more about self-determination than dominance, and more about allies than Trump’s go-it-alone attitude. Specifically, it pulled together the United States and the United Kingdom, who only recently had been at war with each other. In its way, the Monroe doctrine showed just how much nations could accomplish when they stopped quarreling and worked toward the same ends.There is almost a fun-house mirror quality to the way that the current version of the doctrine has been stretched out of all resemblance to the original. Words like “democracy” and “self-determination” were noticeably absent in the White House version, the Donroe doctrine. The 2 December statement was all about strength, claiming that the “mighty words” from 1823 marked the beginning of a “superpower unlike anything the world had ever known”. That statement overlooks the inconvenient fact that in 1823, the United States had no power to enforce its doctrine, and relied entirely on the British navy at a time when the American navy was a fraction the size of France’s.The Monroe doctrine was indeed a big deal when it was introduced, but not for the reasons being touted at the moment. In 1823, the United States was struggling to find its place in the world. It had fought two wars against the United Kingdom, including a recent one, between 1812 and 1815, that resulted in humiliation when British troops invaded the capital city of Washington DC, and torched most of the government buildings, including the Capitol and White House. The new country was growing quickly, but it could hardly be called a military threat to its neighbors. The US army had a little more than 6,000 troops, after a reduction in 1821. The navy had about 4,000. That total – 10,000 – is smaller than the number (12,000) Cyprus can mobilize today.These charts show how Trump is isolating the US on the world stageRead moreMaking matters worse, the progress of democracy, begun with so much fanfare in 1776, seemed to be stalling. The French Revolution had thrown Europe into more than a decade of war and convulsion, and after Napoleon’s final defeat at Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) reasserted a conservative vision of Europe dominated by kings and all that went with them. Suddenly, the principles of republicanism were decidedly out of fashion. The new power structure was strengthened by the 1815 creation of a “Holy Alliance”, linking the extremely old-guard monarchies of Prussia, Austria-Hungary and Russia. Together, they were determined to make sure that there would never be another democratic revolution.That put the United States at a disadvantage, except for the fact that John Quincy Adams was the secretary of state. The son of the second president, Adams had grown up in several European countries (his father, too, was a diplomat), and could speak French, Greek and Latin. He was variously the US minister to the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia and the Court of St James. At times, he lived in London, where he met and married his wife, Louisa Catherine Johnson, an American who had grown up in England.In other words, Adams was well prepared, by training and temperament, to advance America’s interests. At the same time, he was willing to buck protocol. He was known to swim in the Potomac wearing nothing but a skullcap and goggles. Later, he would be a brave voice against slavery when most of the US government went the other way. This was not your ordinary diplomat.Adams became secretary of state in 1817 and would stay until 1825, when he became president. In 1819, he negotiated the Adams-Onis treaty, which transferred a huge amount of land, peacefully, to the United States from Spain, which was impoverished by the Napoleonic wars. Without this treaty, which secured Florida, Mar-a-Lago would be in a foreign country today.Adams also resolved a host of issues relating to the wars that had divided Great Britain and the United States. As a child, he had witnessed the Battle of Bunker Hill, the first major engagement of the American Revolution. But as secretary, he helped to reduce tensions, charting the western boundary with Canada (then a part of the UK), and reducing naval armaments on the Great Lakes.View image in fullscreenJohn Quincy Adams in the 1840s.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThese acts of mutual respect improved relations, and the two powers began to see each other in a new light. In 1821 (the same year that the Guardian was founded), Adams gave a Fourth of July speech that praised the British, as a people “distinguished for their intelligence and their spirit”, and announced that the United States would never go abroad “in search of monsters to destroy”. In other words, Adams was announcing a policy of nonintervention – the opposite of Donald Trump’s interpretation of the Monroe doctrine. Although Adams was an expansionist in his own way – he felt that adjoining territories would eventually join the United States voluntarily – he was against the use of military threats to accumulate real estate.The warming of Anglo-American relations continued, and two years later, in 1823, the British foreign minister, George Canning, approached the United States with a proposition. As Spain’s power continued to ebb, it was losing control of its colonies in theAmericas, and local independence movements had achieved full or partial success in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina. This was troubling to the Holy Alliance, determined to fight the spread of democracy and maintain the rule of absolutism.But it was not so troubling to Britain. Though a king, George IV, certainly sat on the throne, the British government was more open to a world with diverse forms of government, including democracies. It had a growing middle class, and a strong parliament that represented merchants, mill-owners, and the people at large. In fact, Canning, the son of an actor, was such a person himself.Accordingly, Canning wondered if the United States and the United Kingdom might together indicate their joint support for the new republics, and warn the European powers not to send military expeditions into the Americas. Such a statement would bolster the new governments and deter any effort by Spain, France or the Holy Alliance to gain new colonies in the Americas.Adams saw merit in the idea, and drafted a statement, now known as the Monroe doctrine, that was included in James Monroe’s annual message to Congress in December 1823. It asserted that the Americas “are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers”. It added that if European nations tried to impose “their system” – monarchy – anywhere in the Americas, the United States would regard it as “the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition”.But it was hardly a sweeping statement of American power. It modestly promised that the US would not interfere in European affairs if Europe stayed out of the Americas. It did nothing to alter the status quo in the many places where European nations already possessed American colonies. And it needed the might of the British navy to be effective. In fact, no invasion from the Holy Alliance ever came, although Russia still had claims to the Pacific coast.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to the press before signing a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America aboard Air Force One on 9 February 2025.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThe new doctrine was welcomed by the leaders of Latin America’s independence movements, grateful for the help. It also brought the UK and the US together in a way that began to paint a way forward, for each, toward a world of greater freedom and rights, earned grudgingly, year by year.That mutual understanding would pay dividends for both. It helped the United States that Britain, after some slowness, refused to recognize the Confederacy during the civil war. It helped the United Kingdom that the United States, after some slowness, put all of its might into the fight during two existential world wars.The Monroe doctrine was not static during these years. It was a flexible instrument, serviceable for different messages. Expansionists could enlarge it into a call for aggressive action against the other countries of the Americas, as they did during the 1850s, when pro-slavery advocates argued that the US should acquire new territories around the hemisphere, and again in the 1890s, when the US plucked Cuba and Puerto Rico from Spain. The 20th century witnessed many interventions by presidents, well before Trump, in places ranging from the Dominican Republic to Haiti to Guatemala. That muscular approach feels closer to the Donroe doctrine.But its better angels were also available, as when FDR’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull,promiseda policy of nonintervention by the United States, and support for free trade and democracy, at a conference in Uruguay in 1933. That approach paid huge dividends when Latin America generally supported the allied cause in the second world war, and Venezuelan oil supplied allied convoys. Franklin D Roosevelt’s “good neighbor” policy was echoed by John F Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, a program of economic cooperation, education and support for democracy.View image in fullscreenA new orderIs Trump’s reformulation of the Monroe doctrine, in fact, a doctrine? His former national security adviser, John Bolton, recently told the Atlantic, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it’s whatever suits him at the moment.” It’s also true that presidents do not generally get to name doctrines and corollaries after themselves; that takes time – and consensus (Monroe’s doctrine was not named after him until 30 years later).Paradoxically, the closest thing to a recent doctrine was the speech delivered at the recent Davos meeting by Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney. It has already beencalledthe Carney doctrine.Trump’s not the first US president to fall in love with war. History shows where this is going | Peter BeinhartRead moreArguing for an alliance of the world’s “intermediate powers”, it proposed a “new order that encompasses our values, such as respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the various states”. It was coherent and pragmatic, seeking allies to resist a rising tide of reactionary thinking. That was very much in the spirit of John Quincy Adams and the original Monroe doctrine, a riposte to the great powers of its day, who were in their own way blind to the currents of history.It was also, in its way, aligned with Bad Bunny’s half-time show. On the surface, the Canadian prime minister’s sober speech and the Puerto Rican singer’s rollicking performance could not be more different. But they hit many of the same grace notes. By acknowledging that we are not alone in this hemisphere, by naming so many nations – he proposed a radical way to make America, in the largest sense of the word, great again.Ted Widmer is the author of Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington (2020), and the editor of The Living Declaration: A Biography of America’s Founding Text, forthcoming from the Library of America (spring 2026).Spot illustrations by Lucy JonesThis article was amended on 15 February 2026 to correct the date of the John Quincy Adams image."

But by working together, and by showing strength, Britain, Germany and the rest of Europe can preserve peaceAir Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton is UK chief of the defence staff. Gen Carsten Breuer is German chief of defenceTop British and German military chiefs press ‘moral’ case for rearmamentSun 15 Feb 2026 13.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 14.10 ESTShareWe write today not merely as the military leaders of two of Europe’s largest military spenders, but as voices for a Europe that must now confront uncomfortable truths about its security. Through the early years of our careers, Europe was emerging from the shadow of the cold war. Governments of all political colours chose to take what was known as the “peace dividend” – investing in public services and reducing spending on defence. That was an understandable choice at the time. Now it’s clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security. European leaders, along with military and civilian officials, have just discussed necessary consequences at theannual Munich security conference.As military leaders, we see every day from intelligence and open sources how Russia’s military posture has shifted decisively westward. Its forces are rearming and learning from the war inUkraine, reorganising in ways that could heighten the risk of conflict with Nato countries. This is a reality we must prepare for; we cannot be complacent. Moscow’s military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention.At the Hague summit last year, Nato leaders committed to spend5% of GDPon defence and security by 2035. This reflects our new security reality and requires hard choices and prioritisation on public spending for all members.As the chiefs of defence of two of Europe’s biggest security providers, we have a duty to explain what is at stake, so that people can understand why our governments have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war. That’s why it’s important that we communicate the threat. People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence.History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. IfRussiaperceives Europe in this way, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. Indeed, we know that Moscow’s intentions range wider than the current conflict. But the good news is that Europe is powerful. Nato is the most successful military alliance in history and today, together, its military might is unsurpassed. We have sophisticated capabilities across land, sea, air and cyber domains, and nuclear deterrence. And we have long been adapting to the new security reality: through building a new model for European security, underpinned by engagement, readiness and collaboration.This starts with Britain andGermanydeepening cooperation. Our landmark Trinity House agreement in 2024 is paving the way for unprecedented cooperation that benefits both our security and economies.Military readiness must mean a strong European defence industry. Ukraine shows us that industrial bases are key to sustaining and ultimately winning any major war. The increased defence spending under way across our countries proves that we are taking this seriously, as we cannot deter if we cannot produce. Our industries must be capable of sustained output – manufacturing the ammunition, systems and platforms our forces require at the pace modern conflict demands.Britain is building at least six munitions factories, which will generate an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles. Germany is permanently stationing an entire combat brigade to the eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence. Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has started, accompanied by an expansion of industrial capacity.Starmer stresses ‘urgency’ of closer defence ties with Europe at Munich conferenceRead moreIn addition, the European Union’s Security Action for Europe (Safe) initiative will inject €150bn (£130bn) to strengthen Europe’s defence industrial base.There is a moral dimension to this endeavour. Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace. Strength deters aggression. Weakness invites it.Finally, the complexity of threats demands a whole-of-society approach and an honest, continent-wide conversation with the public that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone. It is a task for each and every one of us.Whole-of-society defence requires resilient infrastructure, research and development in hi-tech from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats. The path ahead calls for courage and an honest conversation with our citizens. Europe’s security is our shared responsibility, and we intend to meet it together.When Europe acts together, we are a formidable force. And we act together, we are not Great Britain and Germany alone.Air Chief Marshal Sir Richard Knighton is UK chief of the defence staff.

But I will seize this momentJess Phillips MP is parliamentary under-secretary of state for safeguarding and violence against women and girlsJess Phillips calls for Epstein files to be catalyst for long-term legislative changeSun 15 Feb 2026 10.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 11.29 ESTShareIt always takes a calamity – a dreadful murder that reaches every front page, a mass paedophile ring being uncovered, or a political scandal unfolding – to make institutions sit up and act on violence against women and children. These windows of potential energy are never wasted by women’s rights activists. Historically, they have used them to build the#MeToo movement, to fight for legislation change and to push for greater resources for victims.I’ve done it, many times – “never waste a crisis” is my mantra. In the past few weeks, while the nation’s attention has been on thepolitical fallout from the Epstein files, I have seen the opportunity to push for more, for better. To move beyond the throwaway line about the victims being the most important thing – and to actually make them just that. Deeds not words are what matter. If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed; change is all that will suffice.That said, I am weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress. I wish that systems and institutions didn’t need us to bleed first and act second. Women ask for this at times of calm, we shouldn’t have to scream.When we were writing Labour’sviolence against women and girls strategy, this was always at the forefront of my mind. The fact that we couldn’t once again just have some nice prepackaged policy that we could pull off a shelf when the going got tough. It had to be long-term, systemic change in our police, in our courts, in our health services, our armed forces, our housing, our schools. We had to start really focusing on preventing the terrible harm from happening in the first place, not just trying to make nicer plasters to cover up the cuts and bruises. We had to get other government departments to realise that the safety, security and wellbeing of half the population wasn’t just a Home Office issue.I have worked on this issue under many governments – it always felt a bit one note, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment tohalve violence against women and children. Of course, I want to end all violence against women and girls, just like I want world peace, but committing to that would be nothing more than a throwaway line, an aspiration, a pipe dream. Our aim had to be actually achievable and practically measurable.No UK government has ever dared or cared to put a number on the problem before, because this issue has always been seen as too big to deal with or too likely to fail. Our target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade matters to me – it holds us to account, it focuses the minds of those with levers of power and demands that they pull them. Long-term, persistent, consistent, backaching and heartbreaking work is the only thing that is even going to remotely shift the dial on this issue.The NHS has to take responsibility for the consequences of this abuse just as it would with diabetes.Schoolsmust be given the tools to deal with how these incidents affect their pupils. If children grow up to be perpetrators of abuse or end up as victims, that will ruin their life chances and ability to function in the workplace more completely than not being good at maths. It’s no good having an engineering degree if you end up on the sex offender register – and the growing number of young people becoming perpetrators of these crimes should frighten us all.Want to tackle growth and productivity? Well, the annual socioeconomic cost for domestic abuse alone isestimated to be £89bn, without even including, rape, sexual harassment, stalking and other abuses. I could go on and cover every area of policy in every government department that would fail if it didn’t stop and think about how this issue will undermine its progress. This is what this government is seeking to do, to really change this thing once and for all – to change the system, not just react.Police set up national group to deal with UK-related Epstein allegationsRead moreEpstein’s victims don’t just need me to make sure no UK airport could ever be used to traffic them again. Thatloophole has been closed, and we will, of course, close any others we need to – but that isn’t enough. They need me to make sure that those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again. They need me to make it so there is less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today; they need me to make sure legislation stops abusers whouse naked images and online hideawaysto groom them in the first place. They need me to make sure that when they say that they have suffered, not only do they have recourse in the law – but also that their mental health is cared for with therapeutic and social support so that they can recover and live prosperous lives.I will use the momentum of the current political attention on this subject to get more; I always do and always will. It’s how I have been trained to operate over decades, like the scrappy kid at the dinner table of a large family that I am. But I am damned if I will let these pinch-point moments be the only time those calls are heard. The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term.I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the strategy with investment and system change at its heart; but even that we must stretch to meet our ambitions, and it must never only be cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.Jess Phillips is MP for Birmingham Yardley and parliamentary under-secretary of state for safeguarding and violence against women and girlsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Instead of slacking off while you hunt for something better, everyone’s scared about losing their jobs. With all the news about big corporate layoffs and the ominous and still-undefined threat of AI, it’s understandable that people are hugging their jobs.Arecent reportfrom job search site Monster.com found that nearly half of employed workers say they’re currently staying in their roles longer than they otherwise might, for comfort, security or stability, with three-quarters expecting to remain in the same job for at least two more years.Thinking of trashing a small business on social media? Please, think again | Gene MarksRead more“Workers are holding on tighter than ever, but not because they’re complacent,” said Vicki Salemi, a career expert at Monster. “It’s because they’re cautious. Job security and stability have become emotional safety nets. The new loyalty is about survival, not necessarily satisfaction.”If you’re one of these job huggers, then take it from me: you’re killing your future.I’m not saying you should leave your current job. If you really like the company you’re working at and the work that you’re doing and the people you’re working with, then good for you. But don’t just hug your job. Because – unless what you do doesn’t involve a computer – your job isn’t going to be the same in a very short period of time. It may not even exist at all. Tech companies are rolling out AI-based agents, bots and software that will – in the not-too-distant future – do everything from write press releases, answer customer questions, place orders and reconcile bank accounts. Hugging your existing job is like hugging your sick dog who’s about to be put down. There is no miracle that’s going to save either.The good news is that your employer is just as confused as you. I’d love to make time stand still. But I see big changes coming for my business too, and I don’t have all the answers. My business depends on my people. I want them to come to me with solutions. I want them to have my back just as much they want me to have theirs. Hugging their existing job may prove their loyalty. But it’s not helping my business. I know that my business will have to adapt to the technology wave that’s fast coming. I’ll be loyal to any worker who is willing to step up and adapt along with me.Which is why a job hugger hurts employers like me. People are so concerned about losing their job that they only think about what they can do for themselves and not my company. They make decisions to protect what they do. They don’t take risks. They avoid additional work. They are averse to taking chances. They’ll shun responsibility. This can only last for so long.Business owners like myself are never “hugging” our jobs. We’re constantly looking for new ways to make money. Or cut costs. Or run more efficiently. Job hugging is a form of suicide. If we stay still, we die. It’s no different if you’re an employee.If you’re not a big fan of the company, don’t just sit there. Look for something else while you still have your existing job. You’re much more marketable (and have a stronger negotiating position) when you’re still employed.It may seem that clinging to stability is the safe way to go. But it’s a perilous long-term strategy. You’re not learning new skills. You’re not adapting. You’re not taking strategic risks. Job hugging is a losing strategy. Now is not the time to stand still.Explore more on these topicsUS small businessAI (artificial intelligence)Work & careersUS economyEconomicscommentShareReuse this content"

Here in Yorkthe river is getting above itself yet againand the council hasfenced off large puddles in the park for health and safety reasons, to widespread mockery. Things currently taking in water include the letterbox (yesterday the postman told me with a manic laugh that he was leaving for the Philippines), the hens, my shoes and our car, which is growing moss around the windows. On the inside.But does it merit all the moaning? I don’t mean farmers, for whom it’s a catastrophe, flood victims or the poor folk ofCardinham,North Wyke and Astwood Bank, who endured a biblical 40 days straight of rain. They’re entitled to rend their garments and corral their pets into boats, two by two. But maybe the rest of us, just dealing with it being “quite wet”, could get a grip. When life gives you rain, make rain-ade (do not drink rain; it’sfull of forever chemicals)! After all – OK, not the cheeriest thought – this could be as good as it gets in future, given accelerating climate breakdown. At the very least, these wet patches will probably happen more often, so we need coping strategies. Here are mine.Romanticise itRomanticising is rife– we’re constantly exhorted to bring Byronic main character energy to the most mundane corners of our lives. And it’s easy to romanticise rain: brooding sky and lashing droplets are inherently romantic! Lean in – wear something ethereal, put on some Sigur Rós and stare at it enigmatically, like an unreliable female narrator in a Netflix mystery miniseries.Use it as a wellness hackIn 2024, the BBC explainedthat the negative ions created by rainfall may “help to relieve stress and even boost our energy levels”, which sounds like something an influencer holding a tiny microphone would say about a juice cleanse they’re trying to sell you, but rain is free. Add that to your gratitude journal.Write a rain songThere are great rain songs: byPrince,Eurythmics,Garbage,Rihanna… But why not make the weather your muse and compose your own? Rain has great rhymes – bane, pain, slain, vein, arcane – we’re halfway to a 70s prog rock epic already! Also, take a moment to be grateful it isn’t raining men – we have enough of those.Get craftyJapaneseteru terubōzudollsare DIY charms traditionally hung outside doors and windows to try to manifest good weather. Theylook really easy to make– it’s basically white tissue paper tied with red string with a face drawn on. Can’t hurt, right?Contemplate the CPEThat’s theCarnian Pluvial Episode, when it rained for two million years. OK,it didn’t actually, but it was a period of significant global warming where it rained alot. Way more than now. If sauropods managed two million years of the CPE, we can probably tough it out for a few more weeks.Invent a rain ritualWe’ve been trying to ward off bad weather for millennia: oneRoman anti-hail ritual involved crucifying an owl(please don’t do that). Less disturbingly, Japan’smizudome-no-mairain-stopping festival involves playing conch shells;Balinese rain stoppers pray, mediate and burn incense. Over to you.Reassess your rain wardrobePeople say there’s no such thing as bad weather, only bad clothes. But what does that mean, concretely? Maybe aponcho that makes you look like a slice of watermelonora giraffewould help? Or maybe it’s time to dance naked in the rain, per theBlue Pearl 90s dance track(maybe it’s not).Treat the rain as an all-you-can-hear Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR)buffetPeople lovetapping noisesand right now, you’re enjoying unlimited tapping on your windows, without targeted ads.RevoltThink about water companiesreleasing raw sewage into waterways(181 alerts last Monday) because they haven’t invested in infrastructure to cope with the rainfall.

If so, it could not come at a more propitious moment.There are a series of milestones over the next 12 months and more at which development campaigners argue that the government has a crucial opportunity to work for change, even with its drastically diminished aid budget.First, the development minister, Jenny Chapman, recently confirmed that the UK would host a summit on development cooperation in the first half of this year. She was at the African Union summit in Addis Ababa this weekend, hearing directly from the continent’s leaders. Another UK-convened summit, on illicit financial flows, will follow.Most importantly, though, it is the UK’s turn to chair theG20group of economies, in 2027, for which the buildup has already quietly begun in Whitehall. With members including Brazil, China and India – and so broader than the G7 – this is the forum Gordon Brown did much to promote following the global financial crash, convening its leaders in London’s Docklands in 2009 for a crisis-fighting summit.The G20 has since become the home of discussions about issues including debt relief and the world financial system. It was the G20 that agreed a standstill for government debt repayments in 2020, for example, as the Covid pandemic was ripping through the world economy.Yet this year the group’s chair is Donald Trump, who plans to strip away the focus on development and the climate emergency championed by the four preceding chairs, all from the global south – Indonesia, India, Brazil and South Africa.Indeed, fired up by false claims of widespread persecution against the white population, Trump has even suggested that he mayrefuse even to invitethe South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa.The Washington thinktank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace hascharacterised Trump’s approachas a shift towards a “narrower, more nationalised vision”, which “raises fundamental questions about the G20’s purpose, legitimacy and effectiveness at a moment when multilateralism itself is increasingly under strain”.That means the UK will have to pick up the baton next January at a fraught time, when the future of the institution is in flux, but that is exactly why it will be so important.One theme in particular where campaigners believe progress is possible is on easing the burden of unsustainable debt, a key aim of the Make Poverty History push, in which Brown was so closely involved.Analysis by the campaign group Debt Justice shows that average debt repayments for countries in the global south hit 19.2% of government revenue in 2025. That was the highest level since 1990, eating into spending on critical public services such as health and education.There is a G20 process for renegotiating unsustainable debts: the Common Framework. But it is lengthy and cumbersome and can be held hostage by private-sector bondholders.Five years on from requesting debt restructuring via the framework, the Ethiopian government is facing the threat oflegal action from its private-sector creditorsin London, which tends to be the backdrop for actions of this kind since so much international debt is issued under British law.One demand of campaigners is for UK legislation that would force private-sector creditors to take part in any renegotiation. But the bigger prize would be to secure a commitment to outright debt relief for some countries, perhaps capping their repayments at some percentage of revenues.There are also increasingly interesting global conversations, albeit driven by necessity, about the opportunities for greater global south sovereignty over development, in a world where aid flows are diminishing. These include, for example, the Ghanaian president John Dramani Mahama’s “Accra reset”.“Our world as we know it is at an inflection point,”he told an audienceat last month’s World Economic Forum in Davos. “Africa intends to be at the table in determining what the new global order will look like.”Romilly Greenhill, the director of Bond, the umbrella body for UK development organisations, says: “This is a timely moment for the UK to demonstrate its value as an inclusive convener and to rebuild relationships with lower-income countries following the UK aid cuts.” She argues that tax cooperation, and reform of the Bretton Woods institutions that wield such power over the global south – the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank – must also be on the table.Another veteran campaigner, Matthew Martin, the director of Development Finance International, argues: “The UK should focus on restoring the G20 to being a key decision-making forum for dealing with the three urgent crises of our time: debt, climate and inequality.”The issues are complex and nuanced, and will require deft politics, but the prize could be great – and show that new, fairer alliances can be forged in the ashes of the old global order. And even if Labour’s efforts are in vain, the hard diplomatic yards would have the happy side-effect of reconnecting the party with its internationalist heart.Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyEconomics viewpointForeign policyLabourKeir StarmerAidG20commentShareReuse this content"

But it’s unsuited to modern timesSun 15 Feb 2026 07.14 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 12.25 ESTShareLabour is a more complicated political party than most. For over a century, it has tried to contain warring traditions, philosophies and factions. Internal disagreements have been driven not just by personal rivalries, but by profound differences about how, and how much, to challenge Britain’s deeply embedded arrangements of power and wealth.The party’s current crisis, while most directly caused by Keir Starmer’s political shortcomings and the chillingly selective morality ofPeter Mandelson, is really the result of one Labour tradition demonstrably failing in government to meet the needs of today’s world. Often dominant in the party, especially over the past 40 years, you could call that tradition Labour minimalism.Labour minimalists believe that England is a fundamentally conservative, right-leaning country, in which the party can only succeed electorally and in government by appearing as moderate and unthreatening to powerful interests as possible. In 1985, in his first act as a senior party figure, Mandelson commissioned a report by a fellow Labour minimalist, thepolitical analyst Philip Gould. “Positive perceptions of the Labour party tend to be outweighed by negative concerns,” wrote Gould, “particularly [about] unacceptable ‘beyond the pale’ figures.” Provocative leftwing MPs, bold-sounding leftwing policies, fierce leftwing rhetoric: all should be pared back, marginalised or dropped altogether, the two men agreed, so that Labour could reposition itself advantageously on the centre ground.First under Neil Kinnock, then Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and finally Starmer, minimalism became the party’s operating principle. Labour politics became about discipline, self-denial and self-control; about saying no to spending commitments, selecting the least risky candidates and removing key areas of public life – such as the setting of interest rates – from politics altogether. Meanwhile less careful, more radical Labour leaders – Jeremy Corbyn, and to a lesser extent, Ed Miliband – were branded naive by the minimalists and viciously briefed against in the media.While the Tories veered around wildly in office, U-turning and switching between ideologies to barely a word of criticism from the rightwing press, the Labour hierarchy filled up with micromanagers, constantly trying to avoid negative coverage. Mandelsontold me in 1996: “The small things are very important in politics: you can trip up, fall flat on your face over the most unexpected things … My job as much as anything is to look for the small things, and make sure that others don’t trip over them.”Yet as Mandelson’srelationship with Jeffrey Epsteinand Labour’s often careless dealings with the rich showed, the party’s micromanagers did not always apply their cautious rules to themselves. This was plainly hypocritical, but also revealed a paradox: that this caution bred recklessness.One of Labour minimalism’s key characteristics was its acceptance of much of the social status quo, which increasingly meant accepting extreme wealth. “We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich,” as Mandelson famously said in 1998, “as long as they pay their taxes.” Since then, Labour governments have kept taxes on the rich low by European standards, while often praising them as wealth creators.The party has also deferred to other, more modestly privileged right-leaning voters, from prosperous home counties homeowners to socially conservative white men in the “red wall”. Minimalist Labour politicians rarely challenge the views or interests of such groups, or of the truly powerful, and are sometimes welcomed into elite circles in return – as Mandelson discovered to his initial delight and eventual ruin.In 1997, 2001 and 2024, this conciliatory approach helped Labour win huge Commons majorities, far bigger than those achieved by the Tories over the same period. In some ways, the last of these three victories was Labour minimalism’s peak: a list of candidates purged of almost all leftists, a new prime minister who had shed almost all his past radical commitments and a modest total vote concentrated for maximum effect. McSweeney, who had orchestrated Starmer’s rise to the leadership through a pressure group, Labour Together, which at times had barely any members, seemed the ultimate minimalist, narrowing the party to a sharp point.Yet since arriving in office, Labour has discovered to its bewilderment that, outside the party, politics has moved on. Populism is not minimalist but maximalist: huge promises, larger than life leaders, extravagant rhetoric. As well as the startling30% of the electoratewho now say they would vote for Reform UK, there are millions of others with great fears and yearnings, the products of economic, technological and environmental upheaval.The days when enough voters could be satisfied with gradual, understated reforms – as they often were under Blair – feel long gone. Many Britons may insist they hate politicians, or find politics incomprehensible or boring, but the anger they show in vox pops, at protests and online is an acknowledgment that politics, in its broadest sense, has become important again. In an inflamed atmosphere, Labour’s shrunken politics does not resonate.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting and Angela Rayner in 2024.Photograph: Jon Super/APStrikingly, the few popular Starmer policies are the more expansive, less minimalist ones, such asimproving workers’ rightsand rolling outclean energy. They naturally please green activists, trade unions and many progressive voters; but perhaps they also appeal more widely because they show some appreciation that, in a time of crisis, politics needs to be on a bigger scale.Whether or not Starmer’s premiership lasts much longer, and whoever wins the ever more obvious contest to succeed him, there suddenly seems agreement across Labour that the government should be bolder, more inclusive and truer to the party’s more egalitarian values. In other words, the minimalist politics practised so effectively and then so disastrously by Mandelson and McSweeney is out, for now at least.Since his political near-death experience,Starmer has sounded less constrained in public. Of his possible successors, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are probably too sweeping in their critiques of modern Britain to become wholly cautious prime ministers; and even Wes Streeting – long the preferred choice of Labour control freaks – has been speaking out on topics outside his brief, such asthe far rightand Gaza.Labour appears to have belatedly realised that the era of small politics is over. But to prevent what may be an epic political disaster – Britain’s first government of the populist hard right – it will almost certainly need to make alliances and compromises with other parties. In politics as in life, sometimes the more control you seek, the less you ultimately get.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

The radical clerics benefited then, but who would prevail this time?Sun 15 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 06.46 ESTShareAcritical moment looms for Iran, and so for the Middle East. The global consequences of any upheaval in Tehran have been made amply clear since therevolution in 1979that ushered in the rule of radical Islamist clerics. In Oman, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and his teamhave begun indirect talkswith a high-powered US delegation. Many analysts believe the gap between the two sides is too wide to be bridged, and that a conflict is inevitable. Just this weekend, having already threatened military action,Donald Trump saidregime change is the “the best thing that could happen” in Iran. The tension, and risks grow higher.The hold on Iran of those who came to power in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution is now at stake. The ultimate objective of the US appears to be regime change. This may, in fact, already be under way. In December 2025 and January 2026, the most extensive wave of protest since the early 1980sswept Iran, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets from Mashhad to Abadan.Such scenes prompted many to recall thelast days of the shahof Iran, when millions took to the streets. And as we live through contemporary events, there are striking similarities between then and now that should inform the debate about what may happen, about our hopes and our fears. One obvious parallel is the central role of economics. Soaring inflation was a key trigger for the most recent unrest. It was almost 50 years ago as well. In 1977, the price of basic consumer goods rose as much as 27%. Then, too, the key actors were shopkeepers and businessmen in Tehran’s bazaar whose livelihoods were threatened.A second parallel is emerging: a cycle of repression, grief and protest resembling that which unseated the shah. In 1978, this began when a conservative Iranian newspaper printed a scurrilous article aboutAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, prompting mass protests among his admirers. In the holy city of Qom, hundreds of religious students poured into the streets, attacking symbols of the shah’s rule and the modernisation he had sought to impose. Security forces used live ammunition to restore order and six students were killed. In Tehran there was further unrest.The protests might have died away but for the tradition among Shia Muslims, who still nominally constitute the vast majority of the Iranian population, to observe a 40-day period of mourning before a final collective commemoration.Ryszard Kapuściński, thecelebrated Polish reporter, described how family, friends, neighbours and acquaintances – “the whole street, the whole village, a crowd of people” – gathered in the home of the deceased. “If the death was natural … this gathering consists of some hours of ecstatic, pathetic discharge, followed by a mood of dulled and humble resignation,” he wrote. But “if the death was a violent one, inflicted by somebody” then “a thirst for revenge seizes the people [and] … they pronounce the name of the killer, the author of their sorrow, and it is believed that, even if he is far away, he will shudder at that moment [for] his days are numbered”.Exactly 40 days after the protests in Qom in January 1978, new demonstrations led to new killings, along with further mourning and commemorative processions that inevitably turned into new mass protests. These of course prompted further lethal repression. The cycle intensified until in January 1979 the shah, the “author of their sorrow”, left Iran – supposedly for a holiday – never to return.That cycle could well recur. Last Thursday, theWall Street Journal reportedthat merchants at Tehran’s grand bazaar had called on their counterparts across Iran to return to the streets at the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for killings in the first week of January. The aim of the protest will be to “simultaneously, in their cities, keep the memory of the dead alive and continue the national uprising,” a trade association of bazaar workers quoted by the WSJ said on its Telegram channel. The goal is to “avenge the greatest street massacre in contemporary history”.This may be a much bigger challenge to the regime than even the threat of US strikes if, as expected, talks fail.Ali Ansari, a leading historian of Iran, hasput the total death tollin opposition to the shah in 1978 as approximately 2,800. Some believeup to 30,000 may have diedin January. That means a lot of mourners and a lot of 40-day commemorations in the coming weeks.Kapuściński, along with hundreds of international reporters and photographers, was on the ground in Iran in 1978, but there are no equivalents today, and the regime continues to restrict the internet. This makes it hard to work out exactly who was on the streets of Iran last December and in January. That the unrest was widespread, and an authentic expression of profound anger and alienation, seems clear. But the tragic biographies of casualties that have emerged offer only a fragmentary glimpse of the identities of those risking death and injury in the name of freedom.We know that the 1978 revolutionary movement was a broad coalition. It included the radical clerics who followed Khomeini and the many millions of often poor, less educated Iranians who saw the exiled ayatollah as, sometimes quite literally, the answer to their prayers. But there were also others, many of whom had worked as hard and made as many sacrifices in the struggle to overthrow the shah.On the streets in 1978 and 1979 were liberals and nationalists of every possible ideological flavour, socialists and feminists, moderate clerics and their students, even a few old-school communists. There were representatives of Iran’s ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities too. This variety had advantages and disadvantages. As Kapuściński wrote: “Everyone opposed the Shah and wanted to remove him. But everyone imagined the future differently.”Even if the current regime is toppled, any new direction may not even be immediately clear, for it’s worth noting that Khomeini did not immediately seize power on his return. It took several years for his rule to be fully secured, built on war with Iraq, new institutions, a new constitution, and new security forces such as theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corpsand the Basij. These were deployed to methodically destroy every potential opponent in Iran between 1979 and 1988, and were also the bloody spearhead of the regime’s response to the most recent unrest.War, a Trump-imposed deal or internal regime collapse: for Tehran, none of the options are good | Sanam VakilRead moreThere is a lesson in this for the courageous men and women in Iran who seek the overthrow of their rulers today. Now, as then, their triumph can only come through the mass mobilisation of millions and the construction of a broad coalition. But though all will share many common goals, there will be as many different visions for the future of Iran today as there were among those who felled the shah in 1979. Back then, their sheer diversity became a weakness, allowing the one faction to impose an authoritarian rule and hardline vision at the expense of all others.So the regime may fall, but if it does, the future is as hard to predict as it was amid the tumult 47 years ago. The people may prevail and find that the real battle for freedom, prosperity and security has only just begun.Jason Burke is the international security correspondent of the Guardian and author ofThe Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970sExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionMiddle East and north AfricaRyszard KapuścińskicommentShareReuse this content"

The last three years have shattered previous records for such events. Last Wednesday, scientists said that we arecloser than ever to the pointafter which global heating cannot be stopped.Just one day later, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency,announced the eliminationof the Obama-era endangerment finding which underpins federal climate regulations. Scrapping it is just one part of Mr Trump’s assault on environmental controls and promotion of fossil fuels. But it may be his most consequential. Any fragment of hope may lie in the fact that a president who has called global heating a “hoax” framed this primarily as about deregulation – perhaps because the science is now so widely acceptedeven in the US.The administration claimed, without evidence, that Americans would save $1.3tn. Never mind insurance or healthcare costs; a recent reportfoundthat US earnings would be 12% higher without the climate crisis. The Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehousecalledthe decision “corruption, plain and simple”. In 2024, Mr Trump reportedly urged 20 fossil fuel tycoons tostump up $1bnfor his presidential campaign – while vowing to remove controls on the industry.In the same week as this reckless and destructive US decision, it emerged that China had recorded its 21st month of flat or slightly falling carbon emissions. As Washington tears up environmental regulations, Beijing isextendingcarbon reporting requirements. China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, though its per capita and cumulativehistorical emissionsare still far behind those of the US. But clean energy drovemore than 90%of its investment growth last year.The Carbon Brief website, which publishedthe emissions analysis, says the numbers suggest that the decline in China’s carbon intensity – emissions per unit of GDP – was below the target set in the last five-year plan, making it hard to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement. The shift in emissions may not prove enduring. There is fear that China’s focus may change; the next five-year plan, due in March, will be key. Some subsidies for renewable power have already been withdrawn. The installation of huge quantities of renewable energy infrastructure has been accompanied by a surge in constructing coal-fired power plants, though the hope is that these are intended primarily as a fallback.There are other grave concerns, including evidence of the use of forced labour of Uyghur Muslims in solar-panel production in Xinjiang. China’s chokehold on critical minerals hampers the ability of others to develop their own technology. And while its cheap renewables technology has resulted inthe cheapest electricity in history, it has also hit manufacturers in other countries.No one can compensate for the grim reversal of belated US action on emissions. There is also a vacuum in climate diplomacy that Chinashows no signsof filling. But Beijing has a vested interest in encouraging others to cut emissions, even if some nations now want to challenge its “green mercantilism”. In contrast, US billionaires look forward to prospering at the cost of wallets and lives – not only at home, but around the world.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionDonald TrumpChinaRenewable energyFossil fuelsPollutionEnergyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Regulate them now before the tech becomes too big to failSun 15 Feb 2026 12.25 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 15.40 ESTShareHardly a month passes without an AI grandee cautioning that the technology poses an existential threat to humanity. Many of these warnings might be hazy or naive. Others may be self-interested. Calm, level-headed scrutiny is needed. Some warnings, though, are worth taking seriously.Last week, some notable ground-level AI safety researchers quit,warningthat firms chasing profits are sidelining safety and pushing risky products. In the near term, this suggests a rapid “enshittification” in pursuit of short-termrevenue. Without regulation, public purpose gives way to profit. Surely AI’s expanding role in government and daily life – as well as billionaire owners’ desire for profits – demand accountability.The choice to use agents – chatbots – as the main consumer interface for AI was primarily commercial. The appearance of conversation and reciprocity promotes deeper user interaction than a Google search bar. The OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig haswarnedthat introducing ads into that dynamic risks manipulation. OpenAI says ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. But, as with social media, they may become less visible and more psychologically targeted – drawing on extensive private exchanges.It is worth noting thatFidji Simo, who built Facebook’s ad business, joined OpenAI last year. And OpenAI recently fired its executiveRyan Beiermeisterfor “sexual discrimination”. Several reports say she had strongly opposed the rollout of adult content. Together, these moves suggest that commercial pressures are shaping the firm’s direction – and probably that of the wider industry. The way Elon Musk’s AI Grok tools were leftactivelong enough to generate misuse, then restricted behind paid access before finally being halted after investigations in the UK and EU, raises questions about monetising harm.It is harder to evaluate more specialised systems being built for social purposes such as education and government. But since the frenetic pursuit of profit tends to introduce irresistible bias to every human system we have, the same will be true of AI.This is not a problem within a single company. A more vague resignation letter by the Anthropic safety researcherMrinank Sharma warned of a “world in peril”, and that he had “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions”. OpenAI was once ostensibly entirely non-profit; after it committed to commercialisation starting in 2019, Anthropic emerged promising to be the safer, more cautious alternative. Mr Sharma’s departure suggests that even firms founded on restraint are struggling to resist the same pull of profits.The cause of this realignment is clear. Firms are burning through investment capital at historic rates, their revenues aren’t growing fast enough and, despite impressive technical results, it’s not clear yet what AI can “do” to generate profits. From tobacco topharmaceuticals, we have seen how profit incentives can distort judgment. The 2008 financial crisis showed what happens when essential systems are driven by short-term needs and weak oversight.Strong state regulation is needed to solve this problem. The recentInternational AI Safety Report 2026offered a sober assessment of real risks – from faulty automation to misinformation – and a clear blueprint for regulation. Yet despite it being endorsed by 60 countries, the US and UK governmentsdeclined to sign it. That is a worrying sign that they are choosing to shield industry rather than bind it.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)OpinionOpenAIGrok AIElon MuskChatGPTChatbotsFacebookeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Your statement that the prime minister has “learned nothing and forgotten nothing” sums up much of his and our present situation. He was put where he is now by apparatchiks who failed to suggest that without any vision he would be at the mercy of people who would tug him to and fro – which they have. This weakness – which was shared by Boris Johnson, and why Dominic Cummings called Johnson “the Trolley” – means few people have any reason to trust him.That Starmer’s judgment is flawed is demonstrated by the number ofU-turnsthat he has been forced to make. I heard somebody on Radio 4 saying that Starmer “emanates blandness”. On the benches behind him are many stronger people. He needs to be ditched before the country is totally shrouded in gloom.Juliet SolomonFrome, SomersetYour analysis of Keir Starmer’s probable slide out of power quotes his use of the word “fight”. He was well trained byMorgan McSweeneyto appear aggressive. But aggression is for opposition. A prime minister should look to govern, aiming for communal unity. As you say, Starmer has learned nothing, instead bigging up the opposition. He has chosen a foolhardy path that will lead him, and perhaps his party, to oblivion.Andy JordanWirksworth, DerbyshireAs so often, John Harris illuminates the thoughts and feelings of disappointed and sceptical voters, and the political and ethical vacuum at the heart of the McSweeney-Starmer project (Politicians ‘don’t live how we live’, voters tell me, 8 February).The Starmer government’s disdain not just for critics of Peter Mandelson’s privileged lifestyle and friendships, but for advocates of anything resembling principled leftwing policies, has been responsible for numerous missteps that seem to confirm the “Politicians are all the same” narrative. This applies as much to the international as the domestic sphere.We should not forget that the main argument (accepted by bothLabourand the Tories) for appointing Mandelson as ambassador to Washington was the perceived need to appease Donald Trump. Let’s hope that the Mandelson-Epstein scandal will prompt not just a procedural inquiry into who knew what and when, but also a reckoning with Labour’s overriding obeisance to Trump and his foreign policy.Dr Chris SinhaCringleford, NorfolkA few of us predicted Starmerism would end, but not in the way that Owen Jones thinks (The left warned that Starmerism would end like this. Now all of Britain faces the fallout, 9 February). Labour’s left wing, the biggest election-losing machine in the party’s history, has lost no time in getting its knives deployed into Keir Starmer’s back.One expects confected outrage from the opposition to, well, anything, but it is particularly damaging when the party itself is publicly intent on destroying its leader – particularly one who is barely a year into delivering a huge programme of national renewal. If there was ever a time for the left and its supporters to keep their own counsel, this is it, because the only winners out of the current furore will be Reform UK.Des SeniorAylesbeare, DevonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Since then, the education, care and support provided to young players, both within academies and beyond, has evolved significantly (Letters, 7 January).ThePremier League, clubs and selected partners work collaboratively to support players from under-nine level through to the first team, with a strong focus on mental health and wellbeing.Academies operate under a robust framework of youth development rules, which are regularly updated to ensure high standards for players, families and clubs. Requirements include full-time education and player care staff, as well as safeguarding and psychology provision in all category one academies. They must also employ a full-time psychologist registered with theHealthand Care Professions Council, while the Premier League provides additional funding to category two and three clubs to support player care staffing.In addition, all academies must implement induction and transition strategies and deliver a life skills and personal development curriculum. To enhance this, thePremier League works with external partners to deliver sessions on a range of topics including next-step guidance, career advice and development opportunities.Academies are also required to provide a minimum three-year aftercare commitment for players released during the professional development phase (under-17 to under-21). The Premier League further supports these players through annual transition programmes for released under-16 and under-18 groups, focusing on holistic development, wellbeing and career planning.Mental health and wellbeing are shared responsibilities across clubs and are best supported through collaboration between key disciplines. Premier League academies are required to align medicine, psychology, safeguarding and player care teams to deliver coordinated, player-centred support based on consistent principles.The EPPP aims to educate, equip and empower young players throughout their academy journey and as they move into life beyond football. Research shows that 88% of parents view the academy experience positively. And while not all players progress into the professional game, the system is designed to ensure that every young person has a meaningful, life-enriching experience and leaves better prepared for their future.Neil SaundersDirector of football, Premier LeagueHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

One in four doctors told us that working in a single-handed practice has negatively affected their wellbeing or contributed to burnout.A striking 71% believe rural and remote healthcare is not properly understood by government and policymakers.Doctorshave told us that there is a “lack of rural-proofing policy”, with services increasingly centralised and general practice described as “defunded and salami-sliced”. Others describe the pressure of covering wide areas with limited staff and patients who face long journeys to access secondary care.Rural general practice remains professionally rewarding.

Volunteers do the heavy lifting at kitchen tables, translating complex policy into practical advice and managing the invisible burdens of governance and safeguarding.There is a disconnect between government rhetoric on “cheap local power” and the regulatory reality. To bridge this gap, we must move beyond short-term grants for physical infrastructure, such as heat pumps or solar panels, and provide long-term funding for the people behind it. Without stable support, vital local knowledge is lost each time a contract ends.Ultimately, this is a social project. One resident who was able to secure insulation and heating said that she was simply glad to be able to sit and sew in a warm room. If this funding is to be transformative, it must value the persistence and care required to ensure the transition is locally rooted and leaves no one behind.Dr Luke GoodingResearch associate, Stockholm Environment Institute, University of YorkExplore more on these topicsRenewable energyEnergyEd MilibandCommunitieslettersShareReuse this content"

He had been keeping it stashed in a spare sock in his top drawer since the moment he took it off that evening. As soon as it is out, he has a second one to put back in its place.The 28-year-old Weston became the first British athlete in history to win two medals at a singleWinter Olympics, after he and his 25‑year‑old teammate Tabitha Stoecker won the inaugural Olympic mixed team skeleton race in a combined time of 1min 59.36sec, 0.17sec ahead of the German pair of Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher.GB chiefs hail greatest Winter Olympics day after super Sunday delivers two goldsRead moreThe mixed team event is new for the Olympics. The fastest men and women from each country are paired together, and then race the track back-to-back for a combined time. The key difference from the regular race is that the mixed team event uses a reaction start in which the racers have to set off as soon as a light randomly turns off. There were two false starts among the 15 teams, but it did not make too much difference to Weston, who has dominated this field all week.“I’m extremely proud of what I’ve been able to achieve in the past couple of days, especially to win the first-ever team event,” Weston said. “It’s absolutely amazing, I’m over the moon, buzzing, and I’ve got no idea what’s next, to be honest. Probably the pub I guess.”They have plenty to celebrate. Weston and Stoecker describe themselves as each other’s best friends, her boyfriend is going to be the best man at his wedding later this summer. Weston said: “It’s like a family, really, because we all spend so much time with each other.”It took another astonishing run by Weston to pull it off. He and Stoecker were the very last pair to race, and by the time they started the track record had already been broken five times in a row.View image in fullscreenMatt Weston celebrates at the end of his decisive run.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersStoecker had a lightning-fast start, but made a couple of mistakes in the second half of her run that meant Weston needed to make up three-tenths of a second if they were going to overtake Jungk and Kreher. It might sound like the blink of an eye to you and I, but it is a huge deficit in a sport that comes down to hundredths of a second.“I’ve got a lot of trust in him,” Stoecker said. “He’s the individual Olympic champ, and his standard of sliding is insane, so I had a lot of faith that he was going to lay down another exceptional run, but it’s always nerve-racking when you have to watch the clock.”Up at the top of the track, Weston had pulled his helmet down low to stop him from watching Stoecker’s splits. “All I was doing was listening to my coach telling me the timings, and all I could think of was: ‘Don’t false start.’”He shot off the line in 0.12sec, the fastest reaction time of any of the 30 athletes competing. “The flow that he has on the sled, it’s just unmatched, so from about halfway down I could feel that the gold was coming,” Stoecker said. So could everyone else watching.Weston is so smooth on the sled he moves down the run like a bullet along the barrel of a gun. “I was just staying very calm, trying to be as boring as possible. Just tick the boxes, get the job done, and hopefully that will be enough.” It was more than that.Even then, Weston being the man he is, he was still nitpicking at what he could have done differently. “I think on corner nine, I wasn’t exactly smooth coming out …” he began, when Stoecker cut in over the top of him. “Stop it, Matt! Stop it! You don’t need to do that any more! You’ve got six months off!”Not to mention two gold medals. Weston laughed. “Yeah, all right, I’ve been told off now.” The only bittersweet note to it was that they knocked their friends and teammates Freya Tarbit and Marcus Wyatt down into fourth sport.Only one other British athlete has won two gold medals in the Winter Olympics, and that was Lizzy Yarnold, who won the women’s skeleton in both 2014 and 2018.“I mean, there’s some great names in the British Winter Olympic history, I think to even consider putting my name next to those is a massive honour,” Weston said. “A lot of those guys have been a massive inspiration. Especially within the sliding sports as well. The success that they’ve had has only opened the door for us.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It sounds like a typical Saturday night in Hemel Hempstead or Bolton. But it turned out to be the unlikely recipe behind Team GB’s first gold medal on snow at theWinter Olympics– after 102 years of trying.Amid dramatic scenes in Livigno, Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale carved their way intoTeam GBhistory with a staggering display of devilry and nerve to secure mixed snowboard cross glory.

Few had earmarked the British pair as gold-medal contenders after they both bombed out of the individual events. Such was their frustration that they ended up drowning their sorrows in a local pub. Yet on a magical afternoon in the mountains everything suddenly came together.It very nearly went horribly wrong right at the start. In Team GB’s opening round, Nightingale was accidentally punched in the face and finished third out of four riders, 1.09sec behind second place. With only the top two teams progressing to the semi-finals, Bankes needed to show all of the class that brought her a world title in 2021 to get them through.“The first round was a bit stressful,” Nightingale said. “I got punched in the face just in turn one, and I got a bit dazed. I knew it would be tough for Charlotte, but she did an amazing job.”More drama was to follow in the semi-finals. Nightingale had enjoyed one of the runs of his life, whizzing over ramps, banks and fiendish turns and finishing second. But just as Bankes was about to go, the binding on her snowboard broke and it needed an emergency repair with a screwdriver before the gate came up.View image in fullscreenCharlotte Bankes (right) takes the final jump in the lead to win gold.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian“I broke a binding in that start gate and it put a bit of stress on the coaches and the wax techs,” Bankes said. “But they were great.”The final presented a different challenge and when the British team looked across the start gate, they saw dangers everywhere.The Australian team were led by the Olympic champion Josie Baff. The Italians had Michela Moioli, the reigning world champion and Olympic bronze medallist. And the French Loan Bozzolo, who won the mixed world title last year. But Britain had an ace of its own in Bankes.Nightingale, who was born in Bolton but has spent much of his life in Austria, is regarded as a bit of a journeyman. But he was exceptional in securing second place behind France, just 0.14sec back, after his run. With Australia crashing, and getting a four-second penalty, Team GB knew a medal was pretty much secure. It was just a question of which colour.Bankes was now in her element. She lurked behind Léa Casta before building her speed and cutting inside her four turns from the end. The last three bends and a final ramp were then negotiated with aplomb as Bankes finished 0.43sec ahead of Italy, who pipped France for silver.“I knew Léa was going to pull away a bit in that start section,” Bankes said. “But I just focused on myself, and then used the draft and made the right choices.“I’ve been struggling all week but I really found my carving, found the speed out of the turns, which is one of my big strengths, and then it was just letting the instinct do the talking.”It has been some journey for Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but moved to L’Argentière-la-Bessée in the French Alps when she was four. This was her fourth Olympic Games, having competed for France in 2014 and 2018, and GB four years ago, and it seemed that her chance of Olympic glory might have gone when she came ninth in the individual event.It turned out, however, that going for some drinks with Nightingale on Friday night had helped the pair to relax – and create history. “It was one beer … well, two beers and go back again,” she said.“It really helped us to regroup and then we went riding yesterday, had fun, and enjoyed it.”As Nightingale left the venue, he hugged several of his friends who had made the three-hour journey from Austria. “I’m sure I won’t sleep very good tonight,” he said, with a smile that told you that the greatest day of his life was only just getting started.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSnowboardingTeam GBnewsShareReuse this content"

Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair the complex tibia fracture in her left leg.Lindsey Vonn’s crash is violent but honest ending to an unprecedented Olympic bidRead more“We’re working through all of that at the moment,” Goldschmidt said. “We’ve got a great team around helping her and she’ll go back to the US for further surgeries.”Spectators hoping to see Vonnwin a medal at the age of 41with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were shocked when she hooked a gate just 13 seconds into her run –resulting in a spinning crash.“The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury,” said Goldschmidt, who was at the course when Vonn crashed. “There’s a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.“I mean putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes actually on the broadcast it’s really hard to get that across. Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won’t have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports.”Vonn says she has no regrets. “When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences,” Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. “I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk. Because even if you are the strongest person in the world, the mountain always holds the cards.Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

That’s the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don’t try you’ll never know.Vonn added that people should not feel sorry for her. “Don’t feel sad,” she wrote. “The ride was worth the fall. When I close my eyes at night I don’t have regrets and the love I have for skiing remains. I am still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will.”Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, “She’s not in pain. She’s in a stable condition.“She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way,” Goldschmidt said. “But what she’s done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they’re winning.”Some users on social media said Vonn should not have been racing only a week after tearing her ACL. However, those who know the risks of skiing best supported Vonn’s decision.“People that don’t know ski racing don’t really understand what happened yesterday,” Vonn’s US teammate Keely Cashman said on Monday. “She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70mph, and so that twists your body around.”Cashman, who suffered a heavy crash of her own five years ago, said Vonn’s crash had “nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to do with her knee”, and people who think otherwise are “totally incorrect”.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026newsShareReuse this content"

France took silver and the bronze went to Italy.Klæbo’s gold puts him ahead of the Norwegian cross-country skiers Marit Bjørgen, Bjørn Dæhlie and the biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen, with whom he shared a previous record.“It was good to share the top with them for a couple of days, but it feels even better to be on the top. It’s a big achievement and will take some time to sink in,” Klæbo said. His ninth gold puts him level with six Olympic greats including Finland’s Paavo Nurmi and the US sprinter Carl Lewis. One more would lift him to second on the all-time list for any Olympics, but he would have some way to go to surpass the American swimmer Michael Phelps, who towers above all with 23.View image in fullscreenNorway celebrate atop the cross-country relay podium.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesNorway kept a steady lead for much of the race, which was seen as Klæbo’s easiest path to a gold medal of these Games. France’s Mathis Desloges, who has taken two silvers so far, pulled his team into a medal position during the third leg of the race, while Italy’s Federico Pellegrino overcame Finland in the anchor leg to take bronze on home soil in his last Olympics.“[Klæbo] is the greatest of all time. We knew that, and now it is also in the numbers,” said the Italian skier Elia Barp, while Canada’s Remi Drolet added: “I think he’ll go down as the greatest of all time. To be racing the same era as him - it is crazy to witness that and to fight against that.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

After her victory in the women’s Super-G on Friday, she won the giant slalom by just over six-tenths of a second.As small as that gap sounds, it was an enormous margin in a race where there were only six-hundredths of a second between the three women who finished behind her; Sweden’s Sara Hector, Norway’s Thea Louise Stjernesund and Brignone’s Italian teammate Lara Della Mea. The gap between Brignone and second place was the same as that between second and 15th.Winter Olympics 2026: latest medal table for Milano CortinaRead moreIt was a rare and beautiful display of high-speed skiing on L’Olympia delle Tofane by a woman who has found once-in-a-lifetime form at her home Olympics. After it was over, Hector and Stjernesund, who had tied for second place, both dropped to their knees and bowed down before her.“I crossed the finish line and I said: ‘I don’t know if it’s enough,’” Brignone said. “Then I heard the crowd and I said: ‘Oh, maybe yes.’ Then I turned around and I saw number one.”She was not the only one who heard them. The grandstands at the finish line were bouncing with overjoyed Italian fans, and the noise must have carried all the way across the other side of the valley.View image in fullscreenSara Hector (right) and Thea Louise Stjernesund (centre), the dual silver medallists, bowed down before Federica Brignone after the race.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters“I have too many emotions. I can’t believe it, this is just crazy,” Brignone said. “My attitude was that I would be happy just to be here. That was already an achievement. Just to be back as an athlete.”Three hundred days ago, Brignone could not say whether she would ever again be able to walk normally, let alone race in this fashion. Her crash during the giant slalom at the Italian national championships last April broke her left knee in four places and tore her anterior cruciate ligament.The 35-year-old had three rounds of surgery, a series of metal screws and plates inserted into the joint, then started out on seven months of intensive rehabilitation.For most of the past year, all Italian sport has been sweating over the question of whether she would be fit to compete here in Cortina or not. The physical recovery was only one part of what Brignone had to go through to be able to do it. The mental recovery was another.The great Mikaela Shiffrin, who beat Brignone in this event in 2018, has spoken openly about how she has been struggling with PTSD since abad crash at Killingtonin November 2024, when she sustained a puncture wound that very nearly killed her by ripping open her colon.View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin in the finish area after her second run in the giant slalom.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesShiffrin is 30 and has won more World Cup races than any skier in history but readily admits that she is relearning how to race in the way she took for granted before that accident. She finished 11th here, almost a full second behind Brignone.It was Brignone’s fifth Olympic medal after the silver and two bronzes that she won in Beijing and Pyeongchang.

But after being substituted at half-time during the disappointingdraw with Brentfordon Thursday, perhaps this competition could help to breathe new life into Eberechi Eze’s Arsenal career.As well as providing assists for Noni Madueke’s and Gabriel Martinelli’s goals – albeit against a poor Wigan side languishing in the League One relegation zone – the England midfielder’s swagger was back for the first time since he scored a hat‑trick in thenorth London derbyin November.Wolves show guts to edge past battling Grimsby and into FA Cup fifth roundRead moreWith doubts over the participation of Martin Ødegaard against Wolves on Wednesday after the captain was not part of the matchday squad on Sunday, and with Kai Havertz expected to miss at least four matches with a muscle injury, it could be a timely return to form for Eze before the rematch with Tottenham next weekend.“That’s what I want from him,” said Mikel Arteta, who confirmed Ødegaard picked up a knock against Brentford and admitted Arsenal’s growing injury list in attacking midfield is a concern.“We are still coping with that, but we need some players back and fit to give us not only numbers but different options in relation to the opponents that we have. The quicker the better.”Glenn Whelan, who is sharing interim management duties at Wigan with Graham Barrow, revealed beforehand that he had been in touch with his former Republic of Ireland teammate Keith Andrews to get some tips about facing Arsenal, the record 14-timeFA Cupwinners, after watching Brentford cut their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points.However, after this thumping kept alive Arsenal’s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple, the former Stoke midfielder might be relieved that their spell is not expected to last much longer. Gary Caldwell is tipped to leave Exeter and return to the club he helped to win the FA Cup in 2013 as a player before managing them to promotion to the Championship three years later.Having picked up only one point from their previous seven league games including a 6-1 hammering by Peterborough that cost Ryan Lowe his job, Wigan’s priorities are clearly elsewhere. They set up in a back five but that was abandoned when Arsenal raced into a 4‑0 lead after only 27 minutes.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke slots the ball past Sam Tickle to score Arsenal’s first goal.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArteta was forced into a change when Riccardo Calafiori picked up an injury in the warmup. That meant Myles Lewis-Skelly was denied a rare opportunity to start in midfield and reverted to left-back as Bukayo Saka was promoted from the bench to an unfamiliar No 10 position earmarked originally for Eze.It did not take for long for Wigan to be overwhelmed by Arsenal’s array of attacking ability. Eze, playing alongside Christian Nørgaard in a deeper midfield role than against Brentford, was given far too much space to pick out a perfect through ball for Madueke and his finish left the goalkeeper, Sam Tickle, flailing.Seven minutes later, Eze repeated the trick but this time the killer pass was executed with his left foot as Martinelli was the grateful beneficiary.Quick GuideFulham advance past StokeShowHarrison Reed's opportunistic finish carried Fulham into the fifth round of the FA Cup as they came from behind to defeat the Championship strugglers Stoke 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium.Stoke have not won a game since seeing off Coventry in the previous round, but started well against a Fulham side showing 10 changes from their midweek defeat by Manchester City.The South Korean midfielder Bae Jun-ho capped a fine move by putting Mark Robins's team ahead after 19 minutes but they were overpowered as their Premier League opponents settled after the interval.The Brazilian winger Kevin got his reward for a livewire performance in the 55th minute, sending a first-time effort into the bottom corner after cutting in from the left, and a self-inflicted error cost the hosts dear with six minutes remaining.Under siege for long periods, goalkeeper Tommy Simkin attempted a short pass to Tatsuki Seko, who was caught daydreaming by Reed, Fulham's captain for the day. He collected the ball as Seko tumbled to the turf, finished calmly and sealed the London club's place in the next stage.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Jack Hunt – the veteran who spent three seasons at Palace more than a decade ago but never made a first-team appearance – was the unfortunate culprit when Saka and Madueke combined to devastating effect down the right. Gabriel Jesus should have finished it but Hunt’s untimely header left the 35‑year‑old cursing his luck. He was caught out again by Nørgaard’s long pass to pick out Jesus and this time the Brazilian made no mistake. “Are you Tottenham in disguise?” the Arsenal fans mocked.Hunt’s miserable afternoon was completed soon after when he was withdrawn for Matt Smith – a product of Arsenal’s academy – as Whelan switched to a back four. At least they made it to half-time without conceding again, although Wigan’s mascot, Crusty the Pie, was on the end of a 3-1 penalty shootout defeat by a jubilant Gunnersaurus during the break.Saka, who returned from a hip injury against Brentford, made way for Viktor Gyökeres for the second half as Arsenal went back on the attack. The Sweden striker struck the post from Ben White’s pass before Eze fired into the side netting after a mazy run. Marli Salmon, a highly rated 16-year-old central defender who has already played in the Champions League, was brought on for William Saliba to make his home debut with half an hour to play and shifted across to right‑back when Ben White was taken off after receiving treatment.Martinelli now has 10 goals in the FA Cup and Champions League this season but he and Eze were both denied another by outstanding saves from Tickle as Wigan managed to limit the damage that had already been done. “A little tweak made a big difference,” Barrow said. “We’ve got to stick together and move on.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupArsenalWigan Athleticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Another match in what used to be rugby’s most passionate cauldron, another dismantling, another humiliation.France are good, really good, but we might as well have been in Paris, so loud was the travelling support, so gaping the rows of empty seats. The official attendance was just shy of 60,000. Maybe, but it looked and felt a good deal less than that.Wales 12-54 France: Six Nations 2026 rugby union – liveRead moreMore painful a statistic yet is the score. Another thumping defeat for Wales, maintaining their average of 50 points conceded in the past six Tests. France had their eight tries by the hour mark, before the game meandered towards its end. That Wales finished with a well-taken try, their second, by Mason Grady, put over by Louis Rees‑Zammit, will be of some comfort, as will a set piece that was rock solid. After their disciplinaryhorror show last weekendin Twickenham, Wales conceded far fewer penalties – and managed to play the whole game with 15 men. But a solid platform is the least of your requirements when taking on this lot.“We were much better [than in the 40-point defeat against England last weekend] for large parts,” the Wales captain, Dewi Lake, said. “France are a team at the very top of the world. They can create things out of absolutely nothing. They scored some world-class tries today.”France head into the Test against Italy in Lille next Sunday as the only team for whom a grand slam remains possible. And they are showing no signs of letting up, blooding more youngsters, each one seemingly as brilliant as the last. How Wales must envy such bottomless pools of talent.The home side were trading on the exchanges at as much as 175-1 for the win, with the conventional bookies giving them a 35-point handicap. So no one was seriously expecting anything other than a heavy defeat.If there had been any reason for Welsh hope, it might have been the removal of France’s centre pairing last week, the relatively experienced (insofar as neither is under 23) duo of Nicolas Depoortère and Yoram Moefana succumbing to injury along with their back-up, Kalvin Gourgues. In came the Pau centres, Émilien Gailleton (22 years old) and Fabien Brau-Boirie (20). Both scored within the first 15 minutes. France’s three-quarter line, in fact, are all under 23. Louis Bielle-Biarrey, incredibly, is only 22. He scored in-between his mates in the centre and the other three-quarter, Théo Attissogbe, would have completed the set in the first half-hour had he not been slightly offside when Antoine Dupont chipped ahead.Never mind, France had the bonus point by the break, when Attissogbe sent Matthieu Jalibert away. Attissogbe had his try eight minutes into the second half and another just before the hour, France’s sixth and seventh, by which time the agony of this latest humiliation in Cardiff was deepening with every twist.View image in fullscreenFrance’s Charles Ollivon dives in between Josh Adams (left) and Eddie James for a try.Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty ImagesThe first cut came within 90 seconds, when Gailleton was on hand to finish after delicious interplay between Dupont, Attissogbe and Charles Ollivon. Rugby looks so easy when played with such class by players so divinely gifted. Wales were nowhere near them.Indeed, they were so far away from Bielle‑Biarrey when he caught Jalibert’s cross-kick in acres of space after 10 minutes, straight from a lineout, that one wonders what Shaun Edwards, defence coach of France these days and once of Wales during their pomp, must have thought of it. Bielle-Biarrey then stepped Lake with such ease down the left, you wondered if this were sport or choreographed performance. Jalibert looped round Oscar Jégou seconds later, and Brau‑Boirie was on his inside shoulder to receive the pass. The 20‑year‑old debutant looks class personified, already hailed as the next Yannick Jauzion, big and skilful. Later in the match he was joined in the centre by another debutant, Noah Nene, who is 6ft 4in and more than 100kg. On it goes.Quick GuideSix Nations standingsShow1 FranceP2 W2 L0 Pts 102 ScotlandP2 W1 L1 Pts 63 EnglandP2 W1 L1 Pts 54 ItalyP2 W1 L1 Pts 55 IrelandP2 W1 L1 Pts 46 WalesP2 W0 L2 Pts 0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Adam Beard, one of those solid technicians at the set piece, tried a spot of tactical kicking, which did not end well for him. Attissogbe gathered the scuffed chip and sent Jalibert away for the bonus point and a 26-7 lead at the break.Wales had scored at the end of the first quarter, a tapped penalty by Lake, followed by a close-range score for Rhys Carré. It was almost a relief when France resorted to something as unseemly as close‑quarter rugby, Julien Marchand finishing a lineout and drive for their fifth just after the break.Over to Attissogbe. Thomas Ramos’s overhead pass sent Bielle-Biarrey clear down the left, and he found Attissogbe in support for the sixth try. Then it was his turn to find himself at the end of a Jalibert cross-kick in acres of space. Ollivon completed France’s blitz with the eighth on the hour. The stadium looked even emptier then. These are dark times for Welsh rugby. It doesn’t help when France are burning so brightly in contrast.Explore more on these topicsSix Nations 2026Wales rugby union teamFrance rugby union teamSix NationsRugby unionnewsShareReuse this content"

Arundell’s first yellow was shown for not releasing after a covering tackle on Rory Darge, the second for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air.‘Something to smile about’: Townsend salutes Scotland after shocking EnglandRead moreBorthwick’s wing options are already depleted with Immanuel Feyi-Waboso nursing a hamstring injury, and Arundell’s expected unavailability would leave the head coach without any express pace for the visit of Andy Farrell’s side. Elliot Daly is in the wider squad but has been out of form this season while Cadan Murley, who endured a torrid debut against Ireland12 months ago, is another option.Alternatively, Borthwick could shelve his strategy of picking Tommy Freeman at outside-centre, restore the Northampton player to the wing and select Ollie Lawrence in midfield. Marcus Smith and George Furbank are also likely to come into contention given they both offer a creative spark that was sorely lacking against Scotland, who brought England’s 12-match winning run to a juddering halt.Borthwick did his best to avoid overreacting in the aftermath of the defeat on Saturday but a third successive loss at Murrayfield has burst his side’s bubble and ended England’s grand slam pursuit for another year. They will now have to beat Ireland – who got back to winning waysagainst Italy– to have any realistic hope of securing a first Six Nations title in six years.View image in fullscreenJames Lowe leads the charge for Ireland, palming off Italy’s Louis Lynagh in the home side’s Dublin victory.Photograph: Evan Treacy/Getty ImagesIreland were made to work by an impressive Italy side before completing a 20-13 victory in Dublin at the weekend. The manner in which they were beaten on the tournament’s opening night by France was further evidence that this Ireland side appear to be in decline but Borthwick was full of praise for Farrell’s men.“They’ve got such enormous amounts of talent,” the England head coach said. “How many starting British and Irish Lions do they have on their team? The whole Lions coaching team. They play together so often, given the Leinster influence and only coming from a limited number of teams. They’re a very good team. They’ve been at the top of the world rankings for a long period of time.”After tournament organisers opted to remove a fallow week from the competition this year, England have the opportunity to put things right immediately against Ireland.“You’d hate to go into a fallow week now and be licking your wounds after a result like that,” the scrum-half Alex Mitchell said. “So it’s perfect we’ve got another chance to go at Ireland on Saturday to right some wrongs. So, yes, it’s perfect timing.”The England squad reconvened at their Bagshot base on Sunday night with some uncomfortable reviews ahead before attentions turn to Ireland. Furbank is fit again after recovering from a head injury, as is Billy Sela, who replaces George Kloska.Quick GuideSix Nations standingsShow1 FranceP2 W2 L0 Pts 102 ScotlandP2 W1 L1 Pts 63 EnglandP2 W1 L1 Pts 54 ItalyP2 W1 L1 Pts 55 IrelandP2 W1 L1 Pts 46 WalesP2 W0 L2 Pts 0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I always will try to review a game from a neutral standpoint,” the centre Fraser Dingwall said. “I think that after a win or a loss, you’ve got to be incredibly honest so you kick on and grow and develop, irrespective of the result.

You’ve got to be honest and confront those in both senses.“The emotional side will be around the contact stuff, the physicality stuff, the moments which are based upon desire and effort.

The Italianjoined on 2 Septemberfrom Paris Saint-Germain for £26m and became Guardiola’s first choice.Guéhi scores first Manchester City goal but Guardiola labels Salford win ‘boring’Read moreWhile Trafford started all of City’s opening three Premier League games of the season in August, he has not done so since in the competition, with his other eight appearances being in the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and the Champions League.Trafford joined the club aged 12 in 2015 and, afterCity’s 2-0 win over Salfordin the FA Cup fourth round, he was asked about returning. “Yeah, it’s been good,” he said. “I didn’t expect the situation [with Donnarumma] to happen but it happened, so just get on with it. So it’s happened so I work very hard every day and see what happens, give it my best shot.”Before Donnarumma joined, Trafford was not informed he would be the No 1. “No, it wasn’t that,” he said. “So it is what it is. It’s football, you’ve got to keep grafting every day and the games that come, play as hard as you can. This is just another experience to add to my career and it has been a good learning experience.”While agreeing a five-year contract with an option of an extra year, Trafford is uncertain if he will remain at the club beyond the summer. “Who knows, it’s football. Let’s take it a day at a time and try and work as hard as I can and whatever happens, happens,” he said. “I’ve obviously got a contract, so don’t know what happens next season. I just know that I’ll just take it a day at a time and try and improve.”Trafford was called into Thomas Tuchel’s England squad in November after Nick Pope dropped out, but has had no conversation with the manager regarding his prospects of going to the World Cup in June.“No, obviously everyone knows what’s going on with me,” he said. “So I’ve just got to, whenever I play, play as well as I can. I haven’t spoken to them about if that’s enough, but I play as well as I can and train every day very hard and it’s just down to me.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

India coasted to victory in what became global cricket’s most lucrative mismatch after a superlative innings from the opener Ishan Kishanskewed it definitively in their favour.In its second half a game that was dramatically offand then on againbecame one where a parade of Pakistan batters were dramatically in and then out again. Chasing a target of 176 they were seven down before they even got halfway, and were eventually skittled for 114 to lose by 61 runs.India v Pakistan: Cricket T20 World Cup – as it happenedRead moreKishan’s innings was a glorious anomaly, the 27-year-old thriving on a surface with which few came to terms. Only one other player struck more than three fours; Kishan hit 10. No one else produced more than a single six; Kishan managed three. In all he hit 77 runs off 40 balls, the extent to which he stood out illustrated by the fact that when he was dismissed he had scored 88.5% of his team’s runs.“Ishan thought something out of the box. Someone needed to take responsibility and he did that amazingly,” Suryakumar Yadav, the India captain, said.Pakistan won the toss and very little else. Yadav said he had been planning to bat first anyway, but for Salman Agha a turning pitch was a gift that he could not wait to unwrap. The Pakistan captain insisted on getting his hands on it before anyone else, bowling himself at the start of the match – the first time in eight games this year that he has bowled at all – and for a few halcyon moments his team were on top.That opening over brought only one run and the wicket of Abhishek Sharma, who came into the tournament as the most feared batter in world cricket but in two World Cup appearances has now faced five balls and not scored. Perhaps things would have been different had Salman’s luck not flipped in his second over, when Kishan twice miscued the ball into the air: the first time it flew just too far for the fielder at backward point to reach, the second it flew not quite far enough for the man at long-on to catch.Pakistan’s array of spinners – they bowled only two overs of seam – rarely discomforted Kishan after that. “Our spinners had an off day,” Salman said. “The pitch played better in the second innings but we did not bowl according to the situation and we did not apply ourselves with the bat.”View image in fullscreenBabar Azam (right) is bowled by Axar Patel for five as Pakistan’s top order collapses against India.Photograph: Lahiru Harshana/ReutersBut while Kishan was motoring at nearly two runs a ball, Tilak Varma at the other end was barely managing one, as did Yadav after his dismissal. It was clear from those batters’ travails that India had posted a challenging target, and Pakistan’s chances of overhauling it existed only briefly. It would be tempting to note that their response started in the worst possible fashion were it not for the fact that if anything it got worse after that.Hardik Pandya started and finished it, opening proceedings with a wicket maiden, and ending them by ripping out Usman Tariq’s middle stump with the last ball of the 18th over. Jasprit Bumrah bowled the second over of the innings and after he dismissed Saim Ayub with his second ball, a brilliant inswinging yorker, for the second time in the game Salman was required to lead by example. He flubbed his fourth delivery, in a slow and miserable arc, to Pandya at mid-on. Realistically, for Pakistan to have stood any kind of chance, they needed their top four to produce at least one lasting partnership. Those key batters combined scored 15 off 17.Victory confirms the co-hosts’ qualification for the Super Eights with a game to spare, and if the extent of this defeat means that, with one game to play, Pakistan sit below USA in the Group A standings on net run rate, however, they will only surrender their place in the next round if they lose their final match to Namibia across town at the Sinhalese Sports Club on Wednesday.“We have a game in a couple of days and we have to look forward to it,” Salman said. “We need to win that and qualify. Then it is a new tournament.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026India cricket teamPakistan cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

In an era where world-class athletes tend to wrap themselves in cotton wool for fear of injury it was unusual to see one so accomplished run an additional three times in three hours when there was no particular need.That Azu triumphed – in a personal best of 20.77sec – came as little surprise given his accolades include world and European 60m gold medals. He will defend the first of those at the World Athletics Indoor Championships next month.With Keely Hodgkinson opting not to take her place in the 800m final, and the Olympic medallists Georgia Hunter Bell and Josh Kerr late injury withdrawals from their races, Azu’s presence added some sparkle to an afternoon that otherwise lacked some sheen.“It’s mainly for the training,” Azu said of his decision to contest a sprint double.“There’s a level of speed you get from competition that you don’t get from training. It’s three good rounds and it’s adding to the base. It was a good session.”Asked whether more athletes should take the chance to run at these events, he said: “We travel around the world so much, and we represent Great Britain, so if there’s an opportunity to do it, for [the crowd] to come and see us, I think people should grab that. But obviously people are based in different places.It’s not easy to just break up training and come here. I’m two hours away [in Cardiff]. Everyone’s got different things to juggle.View image in fullscreenIssy Boffey continued her breakthrough season with victory in the 800m.Photograph: Alex Livesey/British Athletics/Getty Images“For me, it really works. I think people should definitely make use of these championships. You get some great work from it, and you get to come out and run in front of the British crowd.”Those at the Utilita Arena certainly appreciated it. Hodgkinson had blitzed her way to a scintillating British record when winning her 800m heat on Saturday but, with designs on challenging the world record at a high-profile French meeting next week, chose to sit out the final. That left Issy Boffey to take the title, a fortnight after entering the all-time global top 10. The triumph on Sunday was not quite as quick, coming in 1min 59.64sec, but it continued a whirlwind season that has seen a necessary change of plans.“A couple of weeks ago, I really wasn’t sure about doing the world indoors,” Boffey said. “But now I’m feeling more confident. Ultimately, I want to be in that [world] final. You take one step at a time, but I definitely want to be there.”Hodgkinson will head there as the overwhelming favourite, especially if she claims a world record that has stood since the day she was born: 3 March 2002. Of Hodgkinson’s absence from the final, Boffey said: “I was super excited to race against her. She’s the Olympic champion and deserves so much respect.“It would have been so nice to run with her and really try to hold on for as long as I could. But I absolutely respect her choice to not do the final. A lot of people don’t really understand there’s a lot of things going on behind doors. If you’re racing again next week it’s a short season. You’ve got to do what’s best for you.”There was a surprise defeat for the reigning world indoor 400m champion, Amber Anning, who could only win bronze behind Yemi Mary John. The former world medallist Ben Pattison claimed 800m gold, and Jemma Reekie won the 1500m.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

The scale of celebration that met Rangers’ victory decreed they had not defeated also-rans. Danny Röhl, theRangersmanager, went cavorting down the touchline as his team scored a fourth.This proved the game of the season in Scotland. A genuine thriller. It was also one Rangers dare not lose; that they took three points properly fuels hopes of snatching the league from Celtic’s grasp. An inspired second half from Rangers was sufficient as their visitors wilted.As if to prove nothing in this city happens in isolation, it was also pertinent that Celtic had scored a 97th‑minute winner at Kilmarnock before Rangers andHeartskicked off. Hearts lead Rangers by two with Celtic, who have a game in hand, a further point back.Should Rangers prevail in May, some apologies will be due towards Kevin Thelwell. The former Rangers sporting director was ridiculed for bestowing £8m on Everton for the services of Youssef Chermiti last summer. As Chermiti toiled during his early months in blue, Thelwell lost his job. A double at Celtic Park in January, coupled with this hat-trick against Hearts, means Chermiti has discovered a useful knack of being the man for the big occasion. Thelwell might yet have the last laugh.“We fully deserved over the 90 minutes to win,” Röhl said. “We have developed a lot of resilience since I came here.” The German was keen to point out Rangers’ points haul since he was appointed in October is the best in the league. He seemed to take umbrage with criticism of his team selection for the draw at Motherwell on Wednesday night. Recovery in the Hearts fixture meant the 36-year-old was in the mood to jab back.How Hearts respond to this blow will be fascinating. Context must be applied. Chermiti’s transfer fee remains a multiple of what the Edinburgh club will spend on anyone. Hearts have rattled the Old Firm over a matter of months, merely at the start of a journey as assisted by Tony Bloom and world-renowned analytics. They may well have to learn to lose before they can win. Back-to-back home games – Falkirk and Aberdeen visit Tynecastle – provide scope for Hearts to prove they can rebound from the ropes.Rangers host Celtic on the second of those weekends. Writing off Hearts’ challenge at this point would be both folly and premature. They have delivered the story of this campaign.Derek McInnes, the Hearts manager, said his players reminded each other of their league position in the dressing room as the dust settled before he had to.“We don’t feel as if we are going to go anywhere,” McInnes said. “We are disappointed, clearly, but not too despondent. There is still a lot to win and we are still in it.”Hearts had an early blow with the loss of Oisin McEntee, who damaged his shoulder with an awkward landing. The Irishman’s replacement, Michael Steinwender, slashed the ball into his own net after a Mikey Moore close‑range effort had rebounded from the Hearts bar.View image in fullscreenHearts’ lead at the top the Scottish Premiership is down to two points after defeat against their closest chasers, Rangers.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersHearts were a goal up by that point, Marc Leonard the gleeful recipient of an Emmanuel Fernandez pass intended for Nico Raskin. Leonard played a one-two with the excellent Cláudio Braga before slamming home. Hearts snatched the lead again through Braga, who met Steinwender’s cross while beating John Souttar to a header. An expectant Ibrox was silenced.Parity was restored by the interval. Craig Halkett dived to block a Chermiti shot when the centre-back may as well have stayed on his feet. After the ball flew back to him via Halkett’s back, Chermiti was handed a second try; this time he made no mistake.The simplicity of Rangers’ third will infuriate McInnes just as it is bound to delight Rohl. Andreas Skov Olsen – whose afternoon was otherwise notable for two comedic dives – found the unmarked Chermiti at the near post. The striker still had to leap and connect; he did precisely that to leave Alexander Schwolow helpless.Hearts never really looked like summoning an equaliser. Rangers added gloss to their win through the man of the moment, who strode on to Djeidi Gassama’s pass after a rapid counterattack. Cue bedlam. “I always believe in him,” Röhl said of Chermiti. “My job is now to keep him hungry and he will be hungry because he’ll want to score more. Big games are for big players and today he showed how big he is.”Rangers believe they can win this title all right. Hearts’ motivation will derive from showing their race is far from run. Stand by for more, much more, twisting and turning.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipRangersHeartsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lauren James inspired Sonia Bompastor’s side to victory at Kingsmeadow, setting up Sjoeke Nüsken’s opener before making sure of the result with a goal in the second half.It has been a turbulent month for the Blues on and off the pitch. Back-to-backdefeats against Arsenaland Manchester City all but ended their title defence and it was announced last week that the club hadparted ways with Paul Green, their long-term head of women’s football.Chelsea 2-0 Liverpool, Aston Villa 3-7 Tottenham and more: WSL clockwatch – as it happenedRead moreThe news sent shockwaves through the game. Green had been part of the fabric of Chelsea for the past 13 years, playing an instrumental role in the success that included 19 trophies.A hard-fought victory against a re-energised Liverpool was much needed respite as Chelsea battle to play Champions League football again next season.“It was a tough week,” Bompastor said. “We are all humans and it hurts when you lose a member of your staff. It was an emotional week for everyone … I think we did well considering everything that happened. Being able to come here, focus on the game, put in the performance and get the result proved a lot about our character. I am proud of my players and all the members of my staff.”Asked whether she was happy with the decision not to replace Green, she said: “We have had many conversations with the CEO and the sporting directors. I think we are on board with what we want to do for Chelsea’s future.“I felt a lot of support from them since I joined and I feel the support right now. The fact that they were able to extend my contract in the period where the results were a little more difficult shows a lot.“My main focus is trying to perform at our best level and try and give clarity to the players for them to perform at their best. Getting good results helps a lot.”Chelsea had to remain patient against a buoyant Liverpool side who travelled to Kingsmeadow on the back of a big win against Aston Villa. Gareth Taylor made only one change from that success, bringing in the more defensive-minded Alice Bergström for Mia Enderby.View image in fullscreenSjoeke Nüsken slots home Chelsea’s opener in the 40th minute.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersBompastor equally made one change to the Chelsea team who hadbeaten Tottenhamlast weekend. An injury to the captain, Millie Bright, forced the manager into switching her backline around, bringing Sandy Baltimore in at left-back.The hosts had to weather early pressure as Liverpool started the better. Positive in and out of possession, Taylor’s side had an early goal from Bergström disallowed for handball while the tireless Ceri Holland tested Hannah Hampton.Chelsea struggled to gain momentum. Despite having more of the ball, they were careless with it, disrupted by Liverpool’s high press, and lacked movement in the box. VeerleBuurman and Naomi Girma had efforts blocked while Erin Cuthbert was denied a goal thanks to superb defending by Alejandra Bernabé, but clearcut chances were hard to come by.That was, however, until James sparked into life. It has been a frustrating season for the 24-year-old, who has made only six starts because of injury, but when fit she remains one of the best in the league. She was instrumental in Chelsea taking the lead just before the break, losing her defender before floating in a pinpoint cross that picked out the run of Nüsken at the near post.Liverpool then produced a series of chances. Cornelia Kapocs sent a shot just wide while Martha Thomas had two big opportunities that came and went.Just as the visitors looked as if they were going to find a way back into the game, James struck with one of her trademark moves. With 25 minutes left to play, she cut inside before unleashing a curling right-footed shot that gave Jennifer Falk no chance. She wheeled away to celebrate with her fingers in her ears, a clear signal about shutting out the noise.It was a strike that took the sting out of Liverpool’s defences and they failed to mount a challenge in the closing stages. Chelsea, meanwhile, could breathe a sigh of relief having navigated a difficult situation to remain third in the table. Focus now turns to a difficult tie against Manchester United in the fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup next weekend.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballChelsea WomenLiverpool FC WomennewsShareReuse this content"

But after scoring a last‑gasp equaliser to take the tie to extra time and then a penalty shootout, Birmingham could draw some consolation from pushing their top-flight opponents.Sean Longstaff converted the clinching penalty, after Patrick Roberts, who had scored in the 89th minute to gain parity for Birmingham, blasted his kick over the crossbar; the Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri also saved from Tommy Doyle, Birmingham’s best player.Wolves show guts to edge past battling Grimsby and into FA Cup fifth roundRead moreThe home side’s status, two points outside the Championship playoff zone, means this result would not have counted as an embarrassment. Leeds are consolidating back in the Premier League and have now lost only once in seven games – and thatagainst Arsenal– and here they showed the character to recover from a shoddy first half to make it through to the next round.There was a sense that Birmingham needed to score while Leeds were so poor. Facundo Buonanotte, on his full debut for the visiting side after joining on loan from Brighton, typified their ineffectiveness and was withdrawn at half-time.“No question Birmingham were the better side in the first half,” the Leeds manager, Daniel Farke, said. “We had rotated more players than we would normally do and had a lot of offensive players on the field, so if you don’t dominate the ball, you can get outmuscled. We changed it for the second half and [Ethan] Ampadu gave us more physicality.”Jay Stansfield, Birmingham’s top scorer, had produced a superb left‑footed half‑volley that would have nestled in the top corner if Perri had not tipped the ball on to the post early on. Ibrahim Osman also shot against the inside of a post, Kanya Fujimoto unable to convert the rebound, with the last action of regulation time.Both teams had made six changes to their starting lineups from Tuesday night league action but, even after Leeds led through Lukas Nmecha, this felt like a special day for Birmingham. They wore a bespoke kit for the match, replicating the blue with a white central stripe first worn by the team of the former England striker Bob Latchford in 1971-72, and the crowd were impassioned throughout.View image in fullscreenBirmingham’s players, in their retro shirts, react to their shootout defeat.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesLeeds had to weather a storm, on and off the pitch. Birmingham, bolstered by six signings in the January window, have strength in depth and, in St Andrew’s, the archetypal fortress. They have lost only once in 40 league games at home.The regular Leeds captain, Ethan Ampadu, came on for the second half and changed the complexion of the game; the Premier League side adapted their mentality as well as their shape. Within four minutes they were ahead.There was a question over offside when Noah Okafor played the ball in for Nmecha but, in the absence of a video assistant referee until the next round of this competition, the striker was able to capitalise on Christoph Klarer’s slip and strike his seventh goal of the season inside the near post.Quick GuideFulham advance past StokeShowHarrison Reed's opportunistic finish carried Fulham into the fifth round of the FA Cup as they came from behind to defeat the Championship strugglers Stoke 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium.Stoke have not won a game since seeing off Coventry in the previous round, but started well against a Fulham side showing 10 changes from their midweek defeat by Manchester City.The South Korean midfielder Bae Jun-ho capped a fine move by putting Mark Robins's team ahead after 19 minutes but they were overpowered as their Premier League opponents settled after the interval.The Brazilian winger Kevin got his reward for a livewire performance in the 55th minute, sending a first-time effort into the bottom corner after cutting in from the left, and a self-inflicted error cost the hosts dear with six minutes remaining.Under siege for long periods, goalkeeper Tommy Simkin attempted a short pass to Tatsuki Seko, who was caught daydreaming by Reed, Fulham's captain for the day. He collected the ball as Seko tumbled to the turf, finished calmly and sealed the London club's place in the next stage.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Birmingham did not lose belief, though Leeds had become a different proposition. With Dominic Calvert-Lewin and, especially, Brenden Aaronson coming on to add to their counterattacking threat, the chances of a Cup upset appeared to be receding – especially with Osman, on as a substitute, spurning a series of presentable chances from the left.With a minute of regulation time remaining, a corner was recycled to Roberts who let fly, left-footed, from 25 yards. The ball flicked off James Justin and past Perri to take the tie into extra time and penalties.Farke conceded that this was “far from champagne football” but he was proud that his Leeds side “showed again resilience”.Chris Davies, the Birmingham manager, expressed pride in his team but struck a note of disappointment at the result.“I’m proud of [my players],” Davies said. “Of course there’s a tinge of frustration because I thought we were deserved winners. We had all the grit, effort and determination but the quality to match.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupBirmingham CityLeeds Unitedmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

They said any suggestion Powell had been offered the role of chief of staff was untrue.View image in fullscreenMorgan McSweeney resigned last week over continued controversy around Peter Mandelson’s latest role in government.Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PAPowell is credited with playing a key role in shaping Starmer’s policies on the world stage. The prime minister’s efforts to build a relationship with Donald Trump and act as a self-styled bridge between the US and Europe are seen as one of the more successful elements of his tenure at No 10.In a continued Downing Street clear-out after the controversy over the decision to make Peter Mandelson the ambassador to Washington, it wasannounced on Thursdaythat Chris Wormald, the cabinet secretary, was stepping down “by mutual consent” after just over a year in the job.It is understood that Powell very strongly advised Starmer not to appoint Mandelson as ambassador, an opinion that could emerge in internal government memos due to be published after aCommons voteearlier this month.Downing Street sources said they would not comment on advice given to the prime minister.The mass of documentation, which ministers agreed to release after the controversy overMandelson’s long-term linksto the child sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, will be released after sensitive items are filtered by parliament’s intelligence and security committee.Powell’s recommendation did owe to any special knowledge of Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein but was because he felt from his personal experience during the Blair government that Mandelson courted controversy and would represent trouble for the prime minister.As Blair’s chief of staff, Powell had to handle two cabinet resignations by Mandelson and on both occasions felt Mandelson did not handle the controversy as well as he could have done. His opposition to Mandelson underlines the extent to which Starmer and McSweeney ignored top-level foreign policy advice from inside No 10 and the Foreign Office over the appointment.The slow implosion of Keir Starmer’s government is the ultimate repudiation of ‘Labour minimalism’ | Andy BeckettRead moreDavid Lammy, who was foreign secretary at the time of the appointment, has also let it be known that he opposed the plan, but he may have been reflecting a Foreign Office view that such a high-level diplomatic appointment should go to a professional diplomat and not a formerLabourminister.Powell has been regarded as a highly effective national security adviser, acting as a key liaison between No 10 and the European “coalition of the willing” built to support Ukraine. He has also been at the centre of the controversy over thedecision to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius.His consultancy, Inter-Mediate, specialises in working behind the scenes to bring together parties in a conflict. Powell always regarded the highly demanding national security job as a fixed-term appointment.At Inter-Mediate, Powell – considered to have been one of the key architects of the 1999 Good Friday agreement – played a role in supporting negotiations to end the Basque conflict and demobilise the Eta separatist group. In addition, he served as a peace adviser to the former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos on his Nobel prize-winning settlement with the Farc rebels.Powell also worked alongside Mozambique’s former president Filipe Nyusi to end the country’s long civil war through a landmark agreement signed in summer 2019.Explore more on these topicsJonathan PowellKeir StarmerLabournewsShareReuse this content"

It means that any changes to children’s use of social media, which may include other measures such as restricting infinite scrolling, could happen as soon as this summer.But the Conservatives dismissed the government’s claim to be acting quickly as “more smoke and mirrors” given the consultation has not yet started.“Claiming they are taking ‘immediate action’ is simply not credible when their so-called urgent consultation does not even exist,” said Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary. “Labour have repeatedly said they do not have a view on whether under-16s should be prevented from accessing social media. That is not good enough. I am clear that we should stop under-16s accessing these platforms.”The moves come after the online regulator Ofcom admitted it lacked powers to act against Grok because images and videos that are created by a chatbot without it searching the internet are not in the scope of the existing laws, unless it amounts to pornography. The change to bring AI chatbots under the Online Safety Act could happen within weeks, although the loophole has been known about for more than two years.“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up,” said Starmer. “The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass. Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action.”Companies that breach the Online Safety Act can face punishments of up to 10% of global revenue and regulators can apply to courts to block their connection in the UK.If AI chatbots are used specifically as search engines, to produce pornography or operate in user-to-user contexts, they are already covered by the act. But they can be used to create material that encourages people to self-harm or take their own lives, or even generate child sexual abuse material, without facing sanction. That is the loophole the government says it wants to close.The chief executive of the NSPCC, Chris Sherwood, said young people were contacting its helpline reporting harms caused by AI chatbots and that he did not trust tech companies to design them safely.In one case, a 14-year-old girl who talked to an AI chatbot about her eating habits and body dysmorphia was given inaccurate information. In others, they have seen “young people who are self-harming even having content served up to them of more self-harming”.“Social media has produced huge benefits for young people, but lots of harm,” Sherwood said. “AI is going to be that on steroids if we’re not careful.”OpenAI, the $500bn San Francisco startup behind ChatGPT, one of the UK’s most popular chatbots, and xAI, which makes Grok, were approached for comment.Since the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life after, his family allege, “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, OpenAI has launched parental controls and is rolling out age-prediction technology to restrict access to potentially harmful content.The government is also to consult on forcing social media platforms to make it impossible for users to send and receive nude images of children – a practice that is already illegal.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, said: “We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media.”The Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up by the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing harmful content online, called the steps “a welcome downpayment”. But it called on the prime minister to commit to a new Online Safety Act “that strengthens regulation and makes clear that product safety and children’s wellbeing is the cost of doing business in the UK”.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

She wasreported missingthe following day, after she failed to arrive at a friend’s house to watch a church service.Authorities have been investigating her disappearance as akidnapping, and as of Sunday morning, two weeks since she was reported missing, no arrests have been made and no one is in custody.A missing woman, bloodstains and a masked intruder: tantalising clues but few leads in hunt for Nancy GuthrieRead moreOn Sunday, the FBI said instatementreported by several news outlets,that the gloves found around two miles from Guthrie’s home – one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days – “appear to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video”.The agency said that they sent the gloves to a lab in Florida for DNA testing, and that they received preliminary results on Saturday and “are awaiting quality control and official confirmation today”.“This process typically takes 24 hours from when the bureau receives DNA,” the FBI added.Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is “different”, according to the FBI statement.Investigators have released doorbell camera footage recovered from Guthrie’s home, which showed a masked individual arriving in the early morning hours of 1 February, carrying a backpack and what appeared to be a holstered handgun.On Thursday, the FBI released newdetailsabout the person in the video, describing them as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build”.As the search continues, authoritiesare requestingthat residents within a two-mile radius of Guthrie’s home submit any surveillance footage recorded between 1 January to 2 February. They haveaskedneighbors to provide “all video footage that includes vehicles, vehicle traffic, people/pedestrians, and anything neighbors deem out of the ordinary or important”.As the investigation enters its third week, and continues to draw huge national attention, some crime bloggers and true crime podcasters have traveled toArizonato cover the case.On Saturday night, Arizona state representative Alma Hernandez, released astatement, saying that she was “sick of watching” the “insane speculation, lies, and BS by random wannabe journalists and YouTubers who have now caused more harm than good to this entire situation and put this serious case in jeopardy.“Please GO HOME,” she said. “Let law enforcement do their jobs. Stop following them during swat operations and playing detectives.”Late on Friday night, law enforcement converged on an area around two milesfrom Guthrie’s home, where they searched a home, and also investigated a car at a nearby Culver’s parking lot.On Saturday, the Pima county sheriff’s department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant had been carried out at a residence in connection with the case. But they said that no arrests were made during the operation.Police seal off road near Arizona home of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s missing motherRead moreAuthorities hadbriefly detaineda man earlier in the week, but he was released after questioning.Investigators havesaidthat splashes of blood found on the front porch of Guthrie’s home tested positive for her DNA. They also said that additional DNAcollectedfrom her property, that does not match Guthrie or those in close contact with her, is undergoing testing, along with several gloves reportedly discovered several miles from her residence.“All collected evidence has been submitted for laboratory analysis,” officials said this week.The FBI hasincreased the rewardto $100,000 for information that helps find Guthrie, or leads to an arrest and conviction of those involved in her disappearance.

A philanthropic bridging loan enabled the sale.Fundraising efforts to begin early restoration work and community activities on the rewilding site – Wales’s largest – are ongoing.The naturalist and broadcaster Iolo Williams, an ambassador for the charity, said: “I am hugely excited by their efforts to purchase land and showcase the benefits of rewilding, not only to wildlife and the physical environment but to farming, Welsh communities and culture. Nature needs this.”Tash Reilly, Tir Natur’s chair, said: “This site will demonstrate what’s possible when we allow nature to take the lead and work for people again. It’s a hopeful, practical vision anyone can contribute to.”Elk could return to UK after 3,000 years in rewilding projectRead moreTir Natur says the project will restore Cwm Doethie’s natural landscape, which includes rivers, peat bogs and ancient woodland, acting as a carbon sink and reducing the risk of flooding downstream. It aims to encourage the return of red squirrels, pine martens, polecats, curlews and hen harriers, and to create new nature corridors and habitats for beavers and butterflies.The charity plans to use a wild grazing system involving traditional cattle, pony and pig breeds to act as “ecosystem architects” that kickstart natural regeneration by turning over soil.The site had previously been considered poor for grazing and unsuitable for commercial forestry owing to its location in a site of special scientific interest (SSSI).Map of west WalesIan Rickman, the president of the Farmers’ Union of Wales (FUW), told Cambrian News the union had concerns over “the scale and transparency of this project”.He said: “While it is positive that the role of livestock has been acknowledged, questions remain over how such a large area of land will be managed and funded in practice.” He said the FUW would seek to work with the charity “to ensure the voices of local farmers and rural communities are properly heard and considered”.Reilly said Tir Natur was seeking a long-term approach and was “keen to engage with farmers and their representatives as the project moves forward”.“We respect that there are different views about rewilding,” she said. “The recent Natural Resources Wales and Welsh government reports show nature in Wales iscontinuing to decline, which is our motivation … We will improve this site’s ecological health while ensuring it is a working rural landscape.”The valley in the Cambrian mountains is set to become Wales’s largest rewilding site by far: some of the biggest in the UK are Cairngorms Connect at 60,000 hectares,RewildingAffric Highlands, currently 80,000 hectares, and the Lake District’s Wild Ennerdale (4,400 hectares).The UK ranks 229th out of 240 nations, with an average score of 50%, in the Natural History Museum’s biodiversity intactness index.In 2017, another major rewilding project in Wales, Summit to Sea, aimed to establish a protection area stretching from the Pumlumon massif in Elenydd to Cardigan Bay, encompassing 10,000 hectares of land and a 28,000-hectare marine zone, but it faced criticism from the local community.It was re-established as Tir Canol (Middle Ground) in 2020 and is now focused on a smaller area of mountainous Elenydd.Explore more on these topicsWalesRewildingnewsShareReuse this content"

Their Goliaths are a Norwegian energy company and a UK energy secretary with renewable targets to meet.A fierce battle has begun over one of England’s tallest windfarms, proposed for deep peat moorland overlooking theYorkshire Dales national park, in what residents say will mark the irrevocable industrialisation of their rural landscape.Alocal sculptorhas constructed a scale model of one ofHope Moor windfarm’s 20 turbines, whose blade tips will reach 200m – as high as the “skyscraper” in Deansgate, Manchester, which is the tallest building outside London.“It’s all very well talking about 200m but it’s hard to visualise it,” said Michael Kusz, who lives in Reeth, NorthYorkshire. He has based his model on the model railway 00 gauge; a model person at this scale is 22mm tall.“I’m absolutely horrified,” he said of the proposed windfarm, which would power 81,000 homes and constitutes a key part of the Labour government’s renewable energy targets and planning revolution. “I’ve been on walks where you can have a 360-degree view with nothing man-made and it brings a profound depth of relaxation I’ve never experienced before. There are so few places in Britain where you can connect to the natural world in its own state.”chartThe battle over Hope Moor is set to be repeated across the country as the government’s unprecedented drive to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 clashes with local people’s fears for wildlife, landscape and countryside.This week, the UK’senergy secretary, Ed Miliband, announced contractsfor 157 new solar farms, 28 new onshore windfarms, eight offshore windfarms and three tidal projects. Together with other offshore windfarms announced in January, they will generate enough clean power to supply 16m homes.Labourlifted the “ban” on onshore windfarmsin 2024. Among the onshore projects approved this week is Imerys in Cornwall – the largest onshore windfarm in England for a decade at 20MW. But that will be dwarfed by 100MW Hope Moor.In the pretty village of Barningham, County Durham, on the other side of Hope Moor, rebellion is coalescing around a coffee table book produced by Sir Anthony Milbank, the bird-loving former owner of one of two large moorland estates where the windfarm is proposed.The book describes the bountiful wildlife – from breeding curlew and nightjars to rare black grouse and hen harriers – found on the moor and was published in tribute to Sir Anthony, who died in 2016. His son, Sir Edward Milbank, is one of the two landowners who will profit from the windfarm planned byFred. Olsen Renewables.Suzy and Tim Wilson moved from Warwickshire three years ago, convinced that Barningham, where Suzy grew up, and its surrounding moorland wildlife was in safe hands next to the national park and theNorth Pennines National Landscape.View image in fullscreenCampaigner Suzy Wilson.Photograph: Gary Calton/The Guardian“We live here because of this – it’s priceless. It’s paradise. It’s heaven,” said Suzy Wilson on a walk across the moor, where we saw rare black grouse and heard endangered curlew calling. “We want to share it with people. There’s a carpet of sphagnum moss. In the spring, it’s heaven – all the curlew and oystercatchers, and the grouse are doing their little dance.”The moorland where the windfarm is proposed is outside protected national parks but much of it is designated by Natural England as blanket bog, apriority habitatfor conservation, with extensive areas of “deep peat”, classified as deeper than 30cm.Locals question the logic of damaging this carbon sink with large concrete turbine bases and access roads in the quest to reduce carbon emissions. “It’s a complete joke,” said Simon Thompson, who has lived in the moor-edge village of Newsham since he was 11 and now owns a caravan park. “The fact they are digging up peat to save carbon emissions is ridiculous. The size is ridiculous. The location next to the Yorkshire Dales national park is ridiculous. It just doesn’t make sense.”View image in fullscreenLocal campaigner Simon Thompson.Photograph: Gary Calton/The GuardianAn application for 54m-high turbines on the same moorland was rejected in the high court in 1999 when the judge supported the planning inspector who concluded that the “special character” of this area of “high landscape value” would “be seriously harmed”.But to speed up renewable projects, schemes such as 100MW Hope Moor are designated a “nationally significant infrastructure project” (NSIP), meaning that the planning decision is not made by local councils but by the national Planning Inspectorate – with Miliband having the final say.While onshore turbines once reached 100m in height, newer more efficient turbines currently in planning are closer to 200m. “Turbines of this scale are becoming increasingly typical for new schemes and it is unlikely that the proposed turbines would be among the tallest onshore turbines by the time they are constructed,” said a Hope Moor windfarm spokesperson.Locals Chris Thurgar-Dawson and Christine Gonsalves are both Labour voters. “It’s easy to say: ‘It’s green, full-stop’. We’re not against green energy and our friends who are Tory supporters agree with green energy, but when we heard about the scale of it – it’s off the scale,” said Gonsalves. “It’s the scale and where it’s being built that’s the problem.”According to Hope Moor, the turbines will deliver £500,000 to the local community each year for 30 years.“It’s as if everybody is motivated by money,” said Gonsalves. “The people who live here aren’t necessarily motivated by money. They are motivated by nature and the countryside.”Opponents of the scheme, who have formed anaction groupand plan to tour their region with the model turbine, insist they are not nimbys. “Of all the people we’ve spoken to, only one has mentioned the impact on house prices,” said Tim Wilson.Instead, local concerns include the new access roads required, the pylon and cable routes to connect into the grid, the impact on “pristine” water supplies, and noise and flicker from the turbines.Local Steve Myers, an academic researcher, has conducted a sightlines analysis that concludes the turbines will be widely visible from the Yorkshire Dales and even the Lake District in clear weather. Hope Moor said: “These factors will be assessed comprehensively through a detailed, robust, evidence‑led environmental impact assessment (EIA), which will be presented at future stages of public consultation, alongside how potential impacts will be minimised.”But Myers also fears the “scoping” – deciding what will be examined by the environmental impact assessment – will be determined before the community can give its view.“We will hold two stages of public consultation later this year to gather local views and feedback, which will help shape the project and inform the environmental assessments,” said the Hope Moor spokesperson, who pointed out that scoping is administered by the Planning Inspectorate, not the developer. “There will be many opportunities for the public to have their say on their proposals and nothing at this point in the project is fixed.”Kelly Wyness, senior project manager for Hope Moor, added: “Hope Moor windfarm is a proposal to strengthen energy security by delivering home‑grown renewable power. It will provide long‑term investment in the land and the traditional practices that have shaped this landscape for generations.“At a time when rural skills and land‑management traditions are under increasing pressure, the project offers a modern, balanced approach – combining renewable energy generation with the active stewardship of the moors. Alongside clean energy, Hope Moor aims to support established farming and moorland management practices, sustain traditional skills, and enhance habitat restoration.”For locals, the prospect looming over their working landscape is already spoiling their enjoyment of it. Simon Thompson said he used to walk on the moors to clear his head but hasn’t done so since the windfarm was proposed. “I’ve been walking up there for years, among the buzzards and hares. But my mind is no longer clear when I go up there, it’s just focused on this all the time.”Explore more on these topicsWind powerEnergyRenewable energyYorkshirefeaturesShareReuse this content"

But on miles ofLancashirecoast the frontline is rather more festive.Tens of thousands of discardedChristmastrees have been partially buried on beaches south of Blackpool as a frontier against rising sea levels.In a biting February wind, hundreds of volunteers haul the tinsel-free trees into shallow trenches and let nature do its work. Within weeks, or sometimes days, they morph into sand dunes to protect homes on the seafront.It might sound like a peculiar festive tradition but conservationists say their work is increasingly vital: since the mid-1800s, the Lancashire coast is believed to have lost 80% of its sand dunes due to the rapid growth of seaside towns such asBlackpooland Lytham St Annes.“Sand dunes used to extend for miles and miles inland but we’ve colonised and built the towns so now they’re a very thin fragment of what they used to be,” said Amy Pennington of LancashireWildlifeTrust, which runs the sand dunes project with funding from the Environment Agency.View image in fullscreenThe Lancashire coast is believed to have lost 80% of its sand dunes since the mid-1800s due to the rapid growth of seaside towns such as Blackpool and Lytham St Annes.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian“They’re important because this is the only form of sea defence that the local community has.”Volunteers began burying Christmas trees along these beaches more than three decades ago – the Guardian photographer Christopher Thomond first captured the effort in 1994 – but the project has ramped up in the past decade as sea levels have risen.The UK isestimatedto have lost about 30% of its sand dunes since 1900, while sea levels have increased by about 19.5cm. Two-thirds of this rise occurred in the last 30 years, according to arecent study, which is higher than the global average.Pennington said an increase in storm surges had accelerated the loss of sand dunes, potentially exposing coastal houses to flooding: “We’ve noticed with storm surges, the tide pushes a lot further up the beach so the dunes get washed away more regularly.”As well as being a natural climate frontier, they are also a vital habitat for wildlife.View image in fullscreenSand lizards not seen in the area for about 60 years, were released into the sandy mounds in 2020 and are now thriving again.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBurrowed among the vast Christmas tree dunes in Lytham St Annes are one of the UK’s rarest reptiles.Hundreds of sand lizards were released into the sandy mounds in 2020, having not been seen in the area for about 60 years, and conservationists say they are beginning to thrive.“Each year we’ve spotted more and we’ve seen lots of young which means they’re breeding on the dunes,” said Andy Singleton-Mills, the area conservation manager for Fylde council.Day trippers hoping to spot one of the stripy green and brown reptiles may be disappointed though, he said. They run a mile from humans, meaning tracking them was like “trying to find a needle in a haystack”.Last week, 650 volunteers got to work on Lytham beach, in sight of Blackpool’s big dipper, burying about 2,000 Christmas trees donated from across Lancashire.Minus the odd rogue plastic tree and an occasional bauble, they sit along a two-mile stretch of beach decorated with tufts of marran grass, the roots of which can grow as long as 100 metres and help hold them in place.Pennington said the new dunes, which can grow to about 3 metres (10ft) high, should withstand the elements “hopefully indefinitely”.View image in fullscreenOne of the 650 volunteers drags a Christmas tree to be buried on Lytham beach to form a sand dune.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianBut as sea levels rise, she said, they will within the next five years have to start building the dunes upwards, rather than out towards the Irish sea. “Eventually we will get to a point where the tide is regularly meeting the work we’ve done so they will just be swept away. But that doesn’t mean we have to stop building them out, we will just start building them up.”For some, sand dunes may be an annoying obstacle to getting to the beach. For others, they are place for windswept games of hide and seek.Holly Moeller, an artist who has painted a watercolour of the Lytham dunes, said people were “in danger of taking them for granted”.“The sand dunes can look quite sparse and bare but they’re such an amazing habitat – there’s so much going on that you don’t see at first glance,” she said.“At difficult points in my life when I’ve struggled with mental health, there’s something about the coast and the dunes that is big enough to hold that. It’s a place to come for solace.”Explore more on these topicsCoastlinesSea levelLancashireBlackpoolConservationClimate crisisChristmasfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But its own analysis indicates that the new rule will push up gas prices, and that the benefits of the rollback are unlikely to outweigh the costs.On Thursday, the president and his environmental secretary, Lee Zeldin, announced the finalizedrepealof the endangerment finding, a legal determination which underpins virtually all federal climate regulations. He claimed the rollback would save the US $1.3tn by 2055.Late on Thursday night, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published aregulatory impact analysisto back up that number. The savings will come from two places, the document says: some $1.1tn will stem from reduced vehicle prices, while another $200bn will come from slashed electric vehicle purchases and lowered spending on charging infrastructure.Democratic senators launch inquiry into EPA’s repeal of key air pollution enforcement measureRead moreBut a chart within the analysis indicates that the US will through 2055 incur $1.4tn in additional costs from increased fuel purchases, vehicle repair and maintenance, insurance, traffic congestion and noise. An additional $40bn in costs will come from reduced energy security, increased refueling time and lowered “drive value”, or costs associated with operating a vehicle.In total, this means the repeal of the endangerment finding will impose an estimated costs of $1.5tn, overshadowing the projected $1.3tn in savings. And that’s before you take into account the huge social and climate costs.“Their own analysis shows that the costs outweigh the benefits,” said Kathy Harris, who leads clean vehicle programming at the environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council.In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson said: “The Trump EPA is following the law, ending the bogus overreach of previous administrations done by agenda-driven climate zealots.”Deregulation could increase gasoline pricesIn a scenario which assumes severely lowered fuel prices, the benefits of the repeal would outweigh the costs, the analysis says.That low fuel price case is based on report from theEnergyInformation Administration (EIA). It was included in the document to properly account for the other “policies being implemented by President Trump that are intended to drive down the price of gasoline”, the authors write.But that imagined circumstance is “not really realistic”, said Harris.“That EIA’s low oil price [scenario] was never meant to show the effect of any policies that Trump would implement,” she said. “It’s designed to showcase the uncertainty and the volatility of domestic oil prices due to international forces on the global oil market that drives gas prices in the US and abroad.The EPA also fails to provides evidence to support the claim that Donald Trump’s policy will “or even could” drive down fuel prices to the extent envisioned in that scenario, Harris said.“They’re cooking the books here,” she added.Trump has repeatedlypledgedtolowergasoline prices for Americans. But when the analysis compares a case study in which vehicle regulations continue, versus one where they are repealed, itdoes not appearthat promise will be met.Eliminating the greenhouse gas standards, the regulatory impact analysis shows, will increase gasoline prices by some $0.75 per gallon by 2050.“That’s about a 29% increase in gasoline prices compared to if we maintain the policies that are in place,” said Harris.Social and climate costs not consideredThe administration’s analysis also fails to examine the additional costs that deregulation could create due to increased global warming, which experts say could be massive.“This is aligned with what we’ve been seeing from this administration, where they focus on the cost to industry while completely ignoring the costs to the health and climate costs,” said Harris.Repealing the endangerment finding could increase the country’s greenhouse gas emissions by a stunning 10% by 2055, andimpose up to $4.7tnin additional expenses tied to harmful climate and air pollution by that time, according to projections from advocacy group Environmental Defense Fund.How Trump’s EPA rollbacks could harm our air and water – and worsen global heatingRead moreCritics say the repeal will benefit Trump’swealthyoil-boss donorswhile harming the working class and vulnerable Americans.‘Like most actions within this administration, this decision lacks any regard for everyday people and seems to be a play to deepen its loyalty to fossil fuel companies and billionaires who have proven that they are willing to take actions that endanger human life,” said Abre’ Conner, the director of climate and environmental justice at the NAACP.The EPA spokesperson said: “These activists picked winners and losers and regulated our economy to the tune of trillions at the expense of the American people with zero measurable environmental impact to show for it. The people who expressing outrage now are simply upset that their preferred ideology can no longer bypass Congress and the will of the people to dictate how Americans live, work, and drive.”The person did not address questions about the agency’s economic analysis.The subheading of this article was amended on 15 February 2026 to refer to a figure of $1.3tn rather than $1.3bn.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

These included his suggestion that “60-70%” of transgender people were paedophiles, that he would “never touch a Jewish woman”, and his use of the n-word.The Guardian also found tweets published by Mitula where he claimed there were “Muslim no go ghettos in the UK”.

Just this week, he wasaccused of wanting a “Handmaid’s Tale future”after YouTube footage was discovered from 2024 in which he called for “young girls and women” to be given a “biological reality” check.It has also emerged that Goodwin said last year it was “insane” that a man had been jailed for social media posts calling for people to “start the slaughter” of migrants.Goodwin made the comment in December after Luke Yarwood, of Christchurch, Dorset, was jailed for 18 months for inciting racial hatred. The original post by Yarwood called for British people to head to hotels housing migrants and “burn them to the ground”.Goodwin posted: “Welcome to the UK. Where you go to prison for 18 months for anti-immigration tweets. This is insane.”In her letter, Powell said Goodwin may not have been aware of the comments “when they offered to help your campaign, but you are aware of it now”.“You can ensure that they are not part of your campaign in the future, make clear that you disagree with their vile views, and state clearly that racism and conspiracism like this is not welcome in Reform and not compatible with campaigning for you,” the letter read.“If you do not now distance yourself from the views of these supporters and take action to remove them from your campaign, people will conclude that you and Reform UK are happy to be associated with them.”Reform UK and Mitula have been contacted for a response.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

Previously, BAE imported RDX explosives, which are used in artillery shells, from the US and France.Donald Trump’s unpredictability on Ukraine, and threats to impose tariffs on Nato countries over Greenland, haveheightened concernsover relying on US defence equipment in the future.View image in fullscreenThe delay at Glascoed is believed to be related to a decision to double the amount of capacity the new factory would deliver.Photograph: Maxar/DigitalGlobe/GettyBAE has said Glascoed will drastically increase production of 155mm artillery rounds, delivering 16 times as many as in 2023. The Nato-standard shells are typically fired from mobile field guns.Francis Tusa, a defence analyst, said 155mm rounds were “the bedrock of all armies when they go into war”, so having the right stocks was “essential”.He said the failure to open Glascoed on time was a blow to those plans and that the delays were “obviously very frustrating, not least for the British army”.The delay comes as the governmentdithers over military spending. The defence investment plan, which was originally expected last autumn, has faced repeated pushbacks amid warnings that the armed forces face a £28bn funding gap over the next four years.That has already put on hold contracts for Britain’s next generation fighter jet programme, known as Tempest, and for new military helicopters. The pause on the latter hasled to doubt about the future of 3,000 jobsin Yeovil, where the Italian manufacturer Leonardo has a factory.View image in fullscreenThe Tempest fighter jet is unveiled at the Farnborough airshow in 2018. Contracts to build the plane are on hold.Photograph: Peter Nicholls/ReutersBAE was producing 3,000-5,000 of the 155mm rounds a year, meaning that even a promised “sixteenfold” increase would only take it up to 80,000 annually, the Guardian understands. By comparison, Germany’s biggest arms manufacturer, Rheinmetall, opened a new factory last year that will allow the country to make 1.1m rounds by 2027.Tusa said: “The lack of a ramp-up of UK onshore in 155mm ammunition means that any army deployments to eastern Europe, or reinforcements to Estonia, would have, currently, enough 155mm ammunition for [only] a few days. Even with 64,000 shells, they could fight for maybe a month.”When asked about Glascoed in early February, Luke Pollard, the minister for defence readiness and industry, said: “When it comes to energetics, the stuff that goes ‘bang’ in our weapon systems, we need more of that … I want to see more munitions produced in the UK.”View image in fullscreenThe Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, visits Rheinmetall’s new munitions factory in Germany before it opened last year.Photograph: Fabian Bimmer/APBAE’s wider Glascoed explosives complex stretches over about 405 hectares (1,000 acres) in Monmouthshire and employs about 870 people. Ammunition that is made at another site in Washington, in north-east England, is sent to Glascoed to be filled with explosives. The new site is not expected to create new jobs because it is mostly automated.The factory is part of a wider £150m investment in munitions sites by the defence company in recent years that encompasses Washington and Radway Green in Cheshire, which makes ammunition for small arms. Glascoed is the only one yet to be completed.A spokesperson for BAE Systems said: “Our fully automated munitions facility is structurally complete and has entered the testing phase.“After construction began, we took the strategic decision to double the output capacity beyond our original design to increase our 155mm production capacity by up to sixteenfold, which had an impact on the schedule.“This is a state of the art facility and as such its essential to take the necessary time to ensure absolute precision and safety for our people. We are also continuing to supply munitions through existing facilities.”View image in fullscreenExamples of 105mm and 155mm artillery shell casings at BAE Systems in Washington, Tyne and Wear.Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/GettyBAE declined to comment on when the factory is due to open.Separately, the government has said a further six new munitions factories will be built in the coming years, but has yet to provide details on where they will be.A government spokesperson said: “We do not comment on speculation around our munitions stockpiles, which only serves to benefit [Vladimir] Putin.“We are meeting this new era of threat with the largest sustained increase in defence spending since the cold war, including investing in building the UK’s munitions production to ramp up supplies for our armed forces.”They added: “The Glascoed site’s ongoing development has had no impact on our continuing ability to provide the support Ukraine needs in its fight against Russia’s illegal invasion.”Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

We found 24% of autistic children met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism.Why the debate about a ‘profound autism’ category?The category is intended to help governments and service providers plan and deliver supports, so autistic people with the highest needs aren’t overlooked. It also aims to re-balance theirunder-representationin mainstream autism research.Autism should not be seen as single condition with one cause, say scientistsRead moreThis new categorymay be helpful for advocatingfor a greater level of support, research and evidence for this group. Butsome have raised concernsthat autistic people who don’t fit into this category could be perceived as less in need and excluded from services and funding supports.Others argue the category doesn’tsufficiently emphasiseautistic people’s strengths and capabilities, and places too much emphasis on the challenges that are experienced.What did we do?We conducted thefirst Australian studyto examine how the “profound autism” category might apply to children attending publicly funded diagnostic services for developmental conditions.Drawing on the Australian Child Neurodevelopment Registry, we examined data from 513 autistic children assessed between 2019 and 2024. We asked:How many children met the criteria for profound autism?Were there behavioural features that set this group apart?Because we focused on children at the time of diagnosis, most (91%) were aged under eight years. We described these children as being “at risk of profound autism”.What did we find?About 24% of autistic children in our study met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism. This issimilar to the proportion of children internationally.Almost half (49.6%) showed behaviours that were a safety risk, such as trying to run away from carers, compared with one-third (31.2%) of other autistic children.These challenges weren’t limited to children who met criteria for profound autism. About one in five autistic children (22.5%) engaged in self-injury and more than one-third (38.2%) showed aggression toward others.So, while the category identified many children with very high needs, other children who didn’t meet these criteria also had significant needs.Importantly, we found the definition of “profound autism” doesn’t always line up with the official diagnostic levels which determine the level of support and national disability insurance scheme funding children receive.In our study, 8% of children at risk of profound autism were classified as level 2, rather than level 3 (the highest level of support). Meanwhile, 17% of children classified as level 3 did not meet criteria for profound autism.Our concernWe looked at children when they first received an autism diagnosis. Children were aged 18 months to 16 years, with more than 90% under the age of eight. This aligns withour earlier researchshowing that the average age of diagnosis in public settings is 6.6 years.From a practical perspective, our biggest concern about the profound autism category is the age threshold of eight years. Because most children are already assessed before age eight, introducing this category into assessment services would mean many families would need repeat assessments, placing additional strain on already stretched developmental services.Talk with clinicians about supports for yourself as well, including respite care or family support groupsSecond, modifications will be needed if this criteria is going to be used to inform funding decisions as it didn’t map perfectly on to level 3 support criteria.On balance, however, our results suggest the profound autism category may provide a clear, measurable way to describe the needs of autistic people with the highest support requirements.Every autistic child has individual strengths and needs. The term “profound autism” would need to be promoted with inclusive and supportive language, so as to not replace or diminish individual needs, but to help clinicians tailor supports and obtain additional resources when needed.Including the category in future clinical guidelines, such as thenational guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism, could help ensure governments, disability services and clinicians plan and deliver supports.What can you do in the meantime?If you’re concerned your child requires substantial support, here are some practical steps you can take to ensure their needs are recognised and addressed:Explain your concernsWhat is autism? How the term became too broad to have meaning any more | Tom ClementsRead moreNot all clinicians have experience working with children with high support needs. Be as clear as possible about behaviours that affect your child’s safety or daily life, including self-injury, aggression or attempts to run away. These details, while difficult to share, help give a clearer picture of your child’s support needs.It can also be a challenge to find and access clinicians with appropriate expertise. Another potential benefit of having a defined category is that it can better help families navigate care.Ask about support for the whole familyOur studies show that many caregiverswant more supportfor themselves but don’t always ask. Talk with clinicians about supports for yourself as well, including respite care or family support groups.Reach outComing together with other carers and families can reduce your own isolation and normalise many of the unique challenges you face. Connecting with like-minded people can provide a supportive, empathetic and empowering community.Plan for safetyFor children with high support needs, prioritise safety planning with your child’s care team. This can include strategies to reduce risks, as well as planning how best to support your child’s interactions with health, education and disability services.Kelsie Boulton is a senior research fellow in child neurodevelopment at the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre.

The commission did not respond to requests for comment from CNN about the removal.The ballroom project has generatedheadlinesandoutcryfrom the outset. In October, Trump sparked public backlash when he abruptlybegan demolishingthe East Wing, to clear space for his ballroom,before construction planshad been submitted to oversight bodies.At the time, White House officialssaidthat demolition did not require the commission’s approval, and said that they would present plans for any construction to the proper commissions.View image in fullscreenRendering of the new East Wing, containing Trump’s new ballroom.Illustration: National Capital Planning Commission/ Shalom Baranes AssociatesIn December, the National Trust for Historic Preservationfiled a federal lawsuit, seeking to block the construction of the new ballroom, arguing that the administration violated multiple laws by tearing parts of the White House “without any review whatsoever”.Also in December, Trumpreplacedthe architect originally selected to design the gilded ballroom, following reports of disagreements. The White Housesubsequently choseShalom Baranes Associates to lead the project.The most recently reported cost estimate for the ballroom stands at$400m. The project is beingfinancedby private donors and large corporations including Meta, Apple, Amazon, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Palantir Technologies, Google and Comcast.Earlier this week, Trumpsharedtwo renderings of the ballroom on social media.“It is on budget, and ahead of schedule!” Trump wrote. “When completed, it will be the finest Ballroom ever built anywhere in the World, one that has been sought by Presidents for over 150 years – and now they are getting THE BEST!”.“Because of its unprecedented structural, safety, and security features, it will also be used for future Presidential Inaugurations,” he added.In a5 February memoto the NCPC, Joshua Fisher, director of the White House Office of Administration, defended the administration’s decision to demolish the East Wing.View image in fullscreenRendering shows new East Wing will feature many columns.Illustration: National Capital Planning Commission/ Shalom Baranes Associates“Based on analysis, demolition of the existing East Wing structure and reconstruction of a new East Wing provided the most effective solution to many longstanding issues affecting the White House and delivered the best long-term risk reduction,” he wrote.Fisher said that that preservationists from the National Park Service and General Services Administration “advised on and documented the removal of historical elements of the building and oversaw the manner in which the removals took place” and that “significant historical items associated with the buildings have been meticulously preserved”.Trump administration says White House ballroom construction is matter of national securityRead moreSome of the preserved features include the East Wing cornerstone and plaque, movie theater furniture, the East Colonnade columns, interior wood paneling, chandeliers, historic windows and doors, and more, he said.“Our goal is to ensure that some of these items will be integrated into the new structure,” he added.Fisher also stated that “all heavy equipment has been kept at a safe distance from the White House mansion as based on industry standards to prevent inadvertent damage to the structure” and said that “to date, the government evaluation following the removal of the East Colonnade and the East Wing buildings is that the condition of the east façade of the White House Mansion is excellently preserved.”Later in the memo, Fisher said that beyond the ballroom, the administration has plans “for beautifying the visitor experience” including in areas such as Lafayette Park, Sherman Park, First Division Park, and the Ellipse, and said that they are also working to establish a “superior, more efficient, White House visitor security screening center”.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

The Pentagon did not say whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control. It told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond its post.Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II.

You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?For a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.No, this is not a story about humans falling in love withsexy computer voices– and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and someAI featuresinto their offerings over the past few years.But dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.Jasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”Fate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.Fate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.Rakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”Naidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, whichmonetisethe time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.Other startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitchleveragesthe power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keepersaysit can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.Part of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.AI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.Amelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.A recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.Miller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.The appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”Jeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”The app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”He and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)DatingComputingAppsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can be demanding, inconvenient, stubborn, complicated, troublesome, baffling, illegible. Black womanhood is one place where all these forms of difficulty overlap. I feel like I have always known this; I have been called difficult more times in my life than I can count. But I only began to understand – to discover the meanings and uses of – my own difficulty because ofToni Morrison.Morrison has shaped the way we think about everything from literature to politics, criticism to ethics, to the responsibilities of making art. In 1993 she became the only black woman ever to win the Nobel prize in literature. But the facts remain: she is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach. Notwithstanding the voluminous train of profiles, reviews and scholarly analysis that she drags behind her, she is difficult to write about. More to the point, she is our only truly canonical black female writer – and her work is highly complex.In a 1981 Vogue profile, Morrison spoke of a reader who had “told her how difficult it was to understand black culture in her books – it was so removed from his experience”. She had responded: “Boy, you must have had a hell of a time with Beowulf!” The Vogue interviewer, missing the wit in this retort, commented: “Morrison has no patience with people who plead ignorance; but then, she does not pride herself on being a patient woman. ‘I find myself being more and more difficult,’ she says. ‘It’s something I really relish.’” Morrison’s literary difficulty was often translated this way into a personal difficulty, a moral failing:How dare she be impatient!Well, wouldn’t you be?One reason for Morrison’s air of pique was surely the strain of trying to balance the demands of multiple careers simultaneously. She was an editor, a professor, a writer, a critic and a public intellectual. I have worked in these fields as well, so I know that extending many branches can be a way of distracting yourself from the core vocation. The commitment to writing over all else is often viewed as selfish; when gender is factored into the equation, the charge can carry the stigma of illegitimacy. “For a woman to say, ‘I am a writer’ is difficult,” Morrison noted succinctly.Morrison’s childhood stories read like photo negatives of the standard American race narrativesShe struggled to accommodate these forms of often underpaid literary labour with the unpaid domestic labour of raising two sons as a single mother: “It was very difficult writing and rearing children because they deserve all your time, and you don’t have it.” This occupational difficulty was exacerbated not only by the fact that she was unique in her fields but also by the fact that she often wilfully chose to go it alone. For example, she didn’t tell anyone at her first job in trade publishing that she was writing a novel untilThe Bluest Eyecame out at another house.As troublesome as difficulty may have been for her professionally, Morrison genuinely delighted in the difficulty of other black women artists, such as the novelist Gayl Jones, whose works she edited and published, and the jazz pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams. For Morrison, the fact that they were considered difficult was a sign that they had insisted on their art being taken seriously.To read Morrison herself with the seriousness that she deserves requires that we account for the knot – or bind – of gender and race she shared with them. It is not an easy one to untangle. AsMorrison wrotein a 1971 New York Times op-ed about feminism, “one must look very closely at the black woman herself – a difficult, inevitably doomed proposition, for if anything is true of black women, it is how consistently they have (deliberately, I suspect) defied classification”.Morrison’s childhood stories read like photo negatives of the standard American race narratives. She spoke of her father’s “defensive racism”, which prompted him to throw a predatory white landlord down the stairs. She spoke of her mother’s insistence on integrating every new movie theatre in town. She spoke of how when her “pitch-black” great-grandmother had first set eyes on Morrison and her sister, she said the girls had “been tampered with”, which was meant racially: “We were not pure and she was.”The dynamics of my mixed-race family didn’t match the norms, either. My black Zambian grandmother, for whom I’m named, initially disapproved of my mother’s decision to marry a white man; my mother’s older sister refused to attend the wedding. Our moves to the UK and then to the US when I was a kid – with a year back in Zambia when I was a teenager – were punctuated by moments of racial absurdity: “What are you? Black or white?” (As if I had a choice!) Yet even now, at my grown age, my first response to racism is surprise.Despite our respective births in disparate times and places (Lorain, Ohio, in 1931; Lusaka, Zambia, in 1980), I think Morrison and I both lucked into the strange privilege of zooming out from or boomeranging around race. This perhaps explains why neither of us tends to capitalise the word black when referring to people in writing. It concedes too much; it protests too much.How dare she demand to be taken seriously? How dare she be a black artist with real ideas?Morrison temperamentally disliked being pigeonholed. She was willing to accept “the labels” of race and gender only because, as she put it in a profile in the New Yorker, “being a black woman writer is not a shallow place but a rich place to write from. It doesn’t limit my imagination; it expands it.” She often complained that literary criticism was unequipped to read black writing, which gets read as merelyrepresentative, in both the tokenistic and identitarian senses: “Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form,” she said.Indeed, the ultimate source of Morrison’s renowned difficulty was not, I would submit, her prickly personality, her intersectional identity, or even her sometimes contrarian politics. It was her commitment to reflecting the range and depth of black aesthetics – as epitomised by jazz, which she called “very complicated, very sophisticated, and very difficult” – in her own writing.Her close friend, the writer Fran Lebowitz, said upon Morrison’s passing in 2019: “I know it sounds like a crazy thing to say, but I always thought Toni’s writing was underappreciated. Because people always looked at it through the prism of her being black and being a woman. But Toni was a very experimental writer. There were a lot of things Toni did through her writing that just went unremarked upon.”Many still dismiss Morrison’s stature as either undeserved or obvious, as if surely so much praise either begs the question or settles it. They justify their disinclination to engage with the art itself by gesturing to what we might call her DEI-fication or her Oprah‑priation, as if Toni Morrison became Toni Morrison through some kind of literary affirmative action plan.Toni at Random by Dana A Williams review – Toni Morrison’s editing yearsRead moreIt’s rumoured that a black woman novelist on the board voted against Beloved receiving a National Book Award in 1987. A white colleague of mine at Harvard once told me he found Beloved sentimental – it never occurred to him that Morrison had intentionally leaned into sentimentality for effect. I’ve heard eminent black male scholars joke about whether she had stolen the book’s plot about a fugitive slave, and about whether her literary ambition had made her a bad mother.Morrison incensed all kinds of people. How dare she be a difficult writer and a black woman? How dare she refuse to placate or translate? How dare she demand to be taken seriously? How dare she be a black artist with real ideas? How dare she ask that we actually read her writing, and on its own terms?It could not have been easy to be Toni Morrison. Yet I aspire to it. I yearn for that freedom she so beautifully embodied: to feel at ease to be difficult.This is an edited extract from On Morrison by Namwali Serpell, published by Chatto & Windus.

And we also know stories about relationship transgressions, of partnerships tested or broken by infidelity.As an evolutionary biologist who studies sex and relationships, I’m fascinated by these two truths. We humans make romantic commitments to each other – and some also break those commitments by cheating.This might sound like a modern problem, but for me, it raises questions stretching far back in evolutionary time. Why did we evolve botha tendency to stayanda tendency to stray? If some among us will inevitably cheat, does that mean humans are hardwired for infidelity?Answering those questions requires us to understand two key urges that propel our romantic and sexual behaviours as a species: the drive for a romantic bond and the drive for sexual novelty. Research shows that humans have evolved to seek secure partnership in the form of close pair-bond relationships, but it also shows, just as compellingly, that we’ve evolved a separate appetite for variety. Both drives are alive in us modern human beings, despite being at cross-purposes.Yet some of us seek novelty more than others. In 2010, my research colleagues and I made a shocking discovery when we found that some people’s genetic makeup does indeed create a predisposition to engage in infidelity. We conducted behavioural surveys and collected DNA from a sample of young adults. We then compared the subjects’ reported behaviours against their genetic variations. Specifically, we looked at genes that influence the function of dopamine receptor cells in the brain.In the brain, dopamine creates feelings of excitement and anticipation, and past research had shown that people who had the “long” version of specific dopamine genes, rather than the “short” version, tended toward thrill-seeking and risk-taking behaviour. This includes associations with alcohol abuse and gambling. In our study, we found that people who have the “long” version of the dopamine D4 receptor gene were 50% more likely to report having engaged in infidelity, and they were more likely to have done so multiple times.Of course not everyone with the “infidelity gene” will betray their partners – biology isn’t destiny, genetics being just one of a myriad of factors that influence us – but the study does suggest our ancestors evolved in such a way that some of the population would be more predisposed to sensation-seeking, and specifically sexual novelty, than others.View image in fullscreenMacaques are among the species that exhibit “mate guarding”.Photograph: Greg HillWhy did we develop such a range of personalities and tendencies, and what does it mean for us today? Evolutionarily speaking, in any given population, it can be adaptive for some individuals to be inclined to take a risk and for others to play it safe, and for yet others to fall somewhere in between. This has shown to be true in all kinds of species: fish, for example. Studies show that in a given pond, it can be adaptive for the population to evolve some shy fish who stay safely in the deep end, and some bold ones who spend time in the shallows where, though they may get eaten, they also have access to more resources.In other words, I think of infidelity as a phenomenon that can be understood at least in part as evolutionary adaptation – that is, a trait that can promote greater reproductive success. If some of our forebears were unfaithful, that might have led to more offspring, or more diverse offspring with different genetic mixes.I still wouldn’t say we’re “hardwired” for infidelity, though. From an evolutionary standpoint, yes, we did inherit the potential to have sex outside our primary relationships. And yet in the modern social context, I think the more helpful framework is this: we’re wired not for infidelity, but for sexual novelty.Because let’s not forget the other, equally powerful romantic drive our ancestors passed on to us: the adaptive motivation to form committed pair-bonds and protect them. This is a drive many species share: some animals attempt to enforce their mate’s sexual fidelity by screaming, biting and clawing any interloper who gets too close to their pair-bonded partner, a behaviour known as “mate guarding”.When we look at human pair-bonds specifically, we see that we’ve evolved to seek out a trustworthy co-pilot and to protect that connection. I would argue that this was a way that humans managed uncertainty in our ancestral conditions, and still do today. In order to weather a storm with someone, you want to know that you can count on that person when the going gets tough.Infidelity is by definition non-consensual, a betrayal of the expectations of the relationship. When the drive for novelty is expressed that way, it can erode and even destroy trust in one’s partner and in the relationship. In other words, it threatens the pair-bond and can be devastating for both individuals.I don’t believe we’ve evolved to have to endure betrayal and pain. The better question, then, is this: what do we do with these two drives that, in the course of a long relationship, may grow to be at odds with each other? Can the human drive to seek novelty be explored in healthy ways?I believe so. For some people, that may mean opening their relationship. For others it can mean finding ways to integrate novelty into their existing bond. This in itself can be a way to cultivate greater closeness.Doing new things with your partner is great fuel for passion over time. In our research on long-term passion in couples of all sexual orientations, we found those who maintained sexual satisfaction engaged in a range of behaviours associated with intimacy and closeness. These might include giving or receiving a massage, going on a romantic getaway or planning a date night. And when it comes to a desire for sexual novelty, it could include talking about or acting out fantasies, trying new positions, or using a sex toy together.On the surface, this might read as though the trick to sustaining interest is simply lots of sexual variety, but I believe the findings actually tell a deeper story about connection. Experimenting outside your comfort zone demonstrates interest in being intimate, and in so doing it communicates trust, vulnerability and attachment. That goes beyond any particular act of sex. Its power lies in the commitment to advancing passion, together.Dr Justin Garcia is executive director of the Kinsey Institute and author of The Intimate Animal: The Science of Love, Fidelity and Connection(Penguin Life).Further readingThe State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity by Esther Perel (Yellow Kite, £10.99)Secure Love: Create a Relationship That Lasts a Lifetime by Julie Mennano (Penguin, £12.99)Why We Love: The Definitive Guide to Our Most Fundamental Need by Anna Machin (W&N £10.99)Explore more on these topicsSexualityThe big ideaSexSociety booksGeneticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is a weird-wave contrivance concerning a messed-up US plutocrat clan living in Spain, freely remade fromMarco Bellocchio’s 1965 film Fists in the Pocket. Their bizarre and cartoony secrets, involving sex abuse, manipulation and self-harm, are satirically symptomatic of capitalism and the patriarchy, and how the rich, however entrepreneurial and smart, create a next-gen class of useless drones, on whose behalf all this wealth has supposedly been accumulated. I have to admit to finding it heavy-handed and clumsy more often than not, although there are some good performances, notably from Jamie Bell and Elle Fanning.A strange extended family lives in a luxurious modernist house; the father (Tracy Letts) is a blind widower haunted by the memories of his late wife (Pamela Anderson) who was savaged by wolves in a nearby forest. His grownup children, infantilised by wealth, all live there: highly strung Robert (Lukas Gage) has epilepsy, and is entrusted with supervising his father’s horse riding; Anna (Riley Keough) is a talentless singer-songwriter; and Ed (Callum Turner) is a would-be fashionista. First among equals is Jack (Jamie Bell), who has the intimate honour of helping his father with his nightly teeth-cleaning; their mother’s teeth were always dazzlingly white.Jack, however, infuriates the family by planning to move out of the compound and into an apartment with his girlfriend Martha (Fanning), who nettles the musically aspirational Anna by being a gifted classical guitarist. When Martha comes for a family lunch, the mischievous father asks Anna to describe Martha – to her intense discomfiture – and even asks about the size of her “bosom”.Ed also learns to fabricate Jack’s voice so he can fake his presence in the bathroom for the paternal teeth-cleaning, and to make impostor phone calls to Robert to glean further secrets. Anna has a whimsical crush on the butcher who delivers the dead lamb that they place next to the cross on the exact spot where their mother is said to have died, to feed the wolves. And everyone starts following Jack on his periodic mysterious excursions out of the house, leading to the film’s one amusing revelation.This is a movie with a certain amount of visual style and it does hang together, but it tries the patience with its assumption that there is something rather seductive, amusing and entertaining about all these people. In fact, the satire is pedantic and overworked, and its dramatic effects are unearned, generating a strange sensation of pointlessness.Rosebush Pruning screened at the Berlin film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festival 2026Drama filmsJamie BellElle FanningTracy LettsPamela AndersonreviewsShareReuse this content"

And now … she has given these ideas a retread with this programmatic and unsubtly acted film, a scary movie about a monstrous newborn that is very much less interesting and original than Hatching; the paganism is cliched and the element of black comedy – so often the alibi for not being scary in films like this – is really not all that funny. The face and body of the screeching VFX model devil-baby itself is mostly never shown to the audience, an omission that does not seem disturbing but rather an admission that this prop wouldn’t look convincing in plain sight.Saga (Seidi Haarla) and her stolid British husband Jon (Rupert Grint) have come to live in Saga’s dilapidated family home in the remote Finnish forest, planning to fix it up so that it can be a lovely place to bring up what they hope will be a big family. (Fixing up this place would in the real world take a couple of years while they lived somewhere else, but they more or less manage it unaided in about two weeks.) Saga is obscurely moved and excited by the vital subterranean forces throbbing in the dark depths of the forest that surrounds the house. They have passionate sex there but the resulting baby is a brutal, hirsute, bloodsucking troll that destroys Saga’s marriage and happiness.Saga’s unsentimentally down-to-earth mother (nicely played by Pirkko Saisio) is pretty callous, remarking that as a baby Saga was herself a vampiric, nutrition-sucking nightmare. Jon’s parents, played by John Thomson and Rebecca Lacey, are not much more help; the dad is a clergyman who insists on baptising the child in a fireside ceremony with ghastly results. And where is it all leading? Well, to nothing but grief for poor Saga, who unlike pregnant Mia Farrow in Rosemary’s Baby, doesn’t break through to an extended period of calm or acceptance. Some amusing moments, but a disappointment after the excellent Hatching.Nightborn screened at the Berlin film festivalExplore more on these topicsFilmBerlin film festival 2026Horror filmsFinlandRupert GrintBerlin film festivalEuropereviewsShareReuse this content"

It has vigour and clarity, combined with a frank acknowledgment of sex and sexuality. It makes The Children’s Hour look prissy and mealy mouthed.Marianne Woods (Clare Dunne) and Jane Pirie (played by the film’s co-screenwriter Flora Nicholson) are two women who run a private girls’ school in Edinburgh in 1810. They are thrilled, if a little nervous, by a financial and social coup. They are getting three new fee-paying pupils – granddaughters of the imperious Lady Cumming Gordon, resoundingly and wittily played by Fiona Shaw, who as ever puts the grande dame smackdown on everyone else in the vicinity. Her connection with their academy will clearly be advantageous.One of the girls Lady Cumming Gordon entrusts to the care of the Misses Woods and Pirie is Jane Cumming (Mia Tharia), a young woman of colour whose father, an official in the East India Company in Calcutta, was married to an Indian woman. Tharia shows us a difficult, proud young woman who is bullied and mocked by the white girls; Jane finds it easier to spend time with the two teachers who are made a little uneasy, sensing that their leniency and kindliness could backfire.Jane – no fool – senses something between them; she admires them, wants to join them as a teacher and wants what she considers her own superiority to the other girls to be acknowledged. When it isn’t, she concocts a spiteful tale tricked out with imagined sexual details that she has gleaned from the smutty dorm whisperings. Lady Cumming Gordon withdraws her girls from the school, circulates a letter among other parents and the teachers take her to court.One way to tell this story would, in fact, be to dramatise the court case in the present tense – something likeRattigan’s The Winslow Boy – interspersed with flashbacks. Heldman and Nicholson have chosen to give us the events more straightforwardly, with the libel trial merely acknowledged over intertitles before the credits.The advantage of this approach is that it allows the movie to speculate and imagine the nature of the two women’s actual relationship – and fascinatingly, the drama shows us their sexual attraction only becoming a reality after the row has detonated: the accusation has brought their love into being. Pirie vomits in agony when their solicitor reads aloud to the two women the lurid fake details of what they are supposed to have done – her nausea is triggered by the grisly irony of the accusation being partly right in a way that it wouldn’t have been before the scandal.But what then is Jane Cumming’s “education”? Perhaps what she ultimately learns is that racism trumps homophobia. Her testimony, as someone from India, was considered fundamentally suspect. In fact, another way to present and reimagine this story would be to assume that she was in fact right, she and other girls were abuse victims and that the official record was rigged in favour of the overclass. But as it stands, this very well acted film is an astringent and commonsensical account of what in all probability happened in private as well as in public: a story of race, class, sexuality and empire.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsPeriod and historical filmsBerlin film festivalFestivalsFilm adaptationsreviewsShareReuse this content"

Leonard Bernstein, born to parents of Russian/Ukrainian heritage, wrote West Side Story as a plea for tolerance in a society riven with prejudice. It was a canny opener for this American-themed concert and a showcase for the BBC Symphony Orchestra’s brass and percussion in particular. Conductor Daniele Rustioni held back at first, as if wary of too much schmaltz, but by the hip-wriggling mambo the players had found their groove.The UK premiere of the collaboration Concerto No 2: Anthem found bass-baritone andBarbicanartist in residence Davóne Tines weighing the current state of the US in the balance and finding it sorely wanting. What if, he suggested, the nation code-switched, moving on from a bloody past built on the backs of immigrants and slaves to embrace a more inclusive society inspired by today’s Black American experience. In the brassy first movement, composer Michael Schachter’s arrangement of The Star-Spangled Banner puffed up the US national anthem until it choked on its own pomp and patriotism (probably a criminal offence in Trump’s America). But wait, argued the voice of poet Mahogany L Browne, what signifies freedom when “the noose is still hanging from democracy’s tree”?View image in fullscreenBarnstorming workout … Daniele Rustioni conducts the BBCSO.Photograph: Mark Allan/BBCCaroline Shaw’s contribution dissected fragments of musical Americana, from Simple Gifts to the excruciatingly racist minstrel song Pickaninny Heaven. Tyshawn Sorey’s discordant funeral march followed, leading into the stirring Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing, dubbed the “Negro national anthem” by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People back in 1919. With his rich, wide-ranging tones, Tines should have been the ideal advocate, but frustratingly the orchestrations were so loud, and the vocal amplification so wanting he could often barely be heard.Rachmaninov’s Third Symphony, written during the composer’s US exile, made an odd bedfellow, riven as it is with nostalgia for a Russia that likely never existed. Rustioni and the orchestra gave it a barnstorming workout regardless, even if they failed to dispel the feeling of a Hollywood score in search of a film script.Explore more on these topicsClassical musicBBC Symphony OrchestraBarbicanlive music reviewsShareReuse this content"

Nor are two widowed South Asians dealing with declining health in their later years conventional romantic leads. But this is where Karim Khan’s quietly passionate play takes us. Despite its overlong running time, it’s a story that cuts straight to the heart.Khan is a whiz at writing authentic multilingual conversation. From their first meeting, Liaquat and Hema zoom between Hindi and English, building a vivid soundscape of diasporic life. In their sessions, Hema (played with sharp fire by Shobu Kapoor) is initially exasperated by Rehan Sheikh’s gentle, teddy-bear-like Liaquat and his blithe refusal to take his diabetes seriously. Over time, though, their chemistry starts to crackle, as they steal and feast on mangoes, and Hema forgets, for just a second, about their rising sugar levels.These scenes of tentative companionship are in stark contrast to the isolation of both elders’ wider lives. Natasha Kathi-Chandra’s production takes us inside their respective empty houses, where Liaquat replays old tapes of his late wife’s voice, and Hema sips chai while knitting in silence. The pacing slackens here, but the stillness deepens the dull ache of loneliness.View image in fullscreen‘They tease, spar and teach each other new ways to see the world’ … Kapoor and Sheikh.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWith Kapoor and Sheikh at the helm, the dialogue hums with easy, lifelike warmth. They tease, spar and teach each other new ways to see the world, nudging open doors they thought had long closed. Grief may linger, but what unfolds between them pulses with renewed life. Food becomes their first love language as they prepare recipes for one another, while Liaquat clings to the memory of his wife, storing the last meal she cooked for him in an ice-cream box in the freezer.Still, some elements of the script feel unresolved. The emotional fallout of a fire at Liaquat’s house is brushed aside, and we gain only fleeting insight into either character’s relationship with their children. For audience members seated on the sides of the stage, sightlines can prove frustrating, with much of Aldo Vázquez’s detailed set orients forward.Yet even with these niggles, Khan’s play remains one that gives voice to those from whom we rarely hear. As diabetes disproportionately affects the South Asian community, it paints a defiant, timely portrait of lives too often pushed to the margins.At the Bush, London, until 21 MarchExplore more on these topicsTheatreBush theatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

I was rooting for you, we wereall rooting for you, how dare you!”‘Abject horror’: the troubling history of paedophile-hunting TV showsRead moreThe confrontation might have happened in 2005, before gifs and memes were as deeply embedded within our culture, but it’s managed to survive and mutate, a copy-paste punchline easily found on many a social media thread. Yet it doesn’t take much to figure out that something darker is happening in the scene and something even darker was taking place off-camera.“There was a lot more that was really said,” says Jay Manuel, one of Tyra’s ex on-screen right-hand men, in a new docuseries. “I will probably never repeat the lines that were actually said in the room that day … People have tried to make it something funny but it really wasn’t.”The re-assessment of America’s Next Top Model, from revolutionary reality show to hotbed of toxicity, had slowly been taking place in the years since it ended but it gathered steam during the pandemic when so many of us had much more TV watching time on our hands. It’s not as if the millennials who grew up with the show, which aired from 2003 until 2018, weren’t aware of how problematic so much of it was but it took a younger generation to look at it with fresh eyes, and what Banks now calls “a 2020 lens”, to bring about a social media reckoning. The cavalcade of aghast YouTube and TikTok breakdowns of crucially awful scenes (bodyshaming, racism, pretty much everything judge Janice Dickinson said) forced Banks, who created and hosted the show for 22 of its 24 cycles, to respond. Snippets, from panels or elsewhere online, showed her to be overly defensive, highlighting the good in an attempt to paper over the bad, but it wasn’t enough and finally, she’s agreed to be part of Netflix’s juicy three-part series Reality Check, the most substantive ANTM autopsy to date.“There was a lot of beauty in this show,” co-director Mor Loushy says to the Guardian in a video interview. “There was a lot of ugliness in this show. But let’s talk about all of it.”It’s understandable why Banks would have an initial impulse to play defence. She’d grown up in the fashion industry at a time when there were very few Black women allowed in and while she had opened doors (she was the first Black woman on the front of Sports Illustrated and GQ and was one of the very few women of colour to achieve supermodel status) she’d also had plenty closed in her face. “I would go home and just feel defeated,” Banks says of her early modelling days in Paris. “I was constantly being told no you can’t do this because you’re Black. There were not a lot of Black models back then. We were being paid so much less just because of the colour of our skin.”The idea of a reality show about models – pitched as The Real World meets American Idol – was her way to not only find “payback” as she calls it but also show that diversity within the industry was essential. The process of trying to sell it to a network led to yet more rejection for Banks (models were seen as “unsympathetic” characters) but after it was finally sold to Paramount offshoot UPN, it became a surprise ratings hit and provided an underserved young female majority audience with something unusually relatable.But while the show did offer up the idea of diversity – women of colour, queer and trans contestants, plus-sized models – it also upheld the same standards Banks was apparently railing against.“They started as misfits with very good intentions,” co-director Daniel Sivan says. “They were starting as disruptors but as power grew, they became bullies.”The series documents how Banks and her panel of judges, including two gay men of colour in Jay Manuel and J Alexander aka Miss J (another revolutionary addition at the time), found ways to make magnetic television (in its heyday, the show was watched in 170 countries) but often at the expense of the women, who were as young as 18, at its centre. “They did these girls so dirty,” says an influencer clipped in a montage.View image in fullscreenTyra BanksPhotograph: Barbara Nitke/Cw Network/Kobal/ShutterstockThe ways in which they were done dirty go from micro to macro and denigrating to downright dangerous. There was Dani Evans who was told she needed to close her tooth gap in order to stay on the show, something she eventually allowed them to do as part of a “makeover” (“It’s my life and it was toyed with consciously,” she says while Tyra says she was “between a rock and a hard place” when she gave the advice). There was Keenyah Hill who went from being bullied at school for being too thin to her exaggerated “overeating” being turned into a cruelly edited storyline (comments graduated from “shaped like a boy minus the breasts” to “Keenyahneedsto lose weight”). There was Dionne Walters who had to pose as a shooting victim in the “crime scene” week after she had told producers that her mother had been shot years earlier (“I think they wanted to see some type of mental breakdown,” she says).There was a weight test for contestants in earlier seasons, making young women like Shannon Stewart, who was struggling with an eating disorder, even more conscious of her body. There was also the infamous “race-swapping” week which saw contestants wearing make-up and styling to cosplay as other races, a genuinely shocking clip to rewatch (“This was my way of showing the world that brown and Black is beautiful,” Banks says of her initial intention before later admitting “It’s an issue and I understand 100% why”).Then there was Shandi Sullivan who says what was framed as a drunken indiscretion with a male model was in fact sexual assault and the cameras kept filming anyway (“No one did anything to stop it,” she says, tearfully).“It was definitely one of the most difficult interviews I’ve ever done in my life,” Loushy says. “It was a really a red line that was crossed in so many ways.”One of the most chilling moments in the series is a shameful defence for the decision to keep the camera rolling, not just during the assault but after as Shandi calls her boyfriend in tears. The makers were filming a “documentary” so they shouldn’t interrupt what’s taking place.“Being a documentary film-maker is not a get out of jail free card,” Sivan says. “Even in this interview, which Mo conducted, Shandi broke down crying and Mo said cut and we stopped because you don’t just keep filming because it’s good TV.”When Banks is asked about this particular incident, she says “it’s a little difficult for me to talk about production because that’s not my territory”.Banks was not alone in making Top Model of course, the show became a collaboration between her and producer Ken Mok as well as those involved with the network. It makes blame “complex”, says Loushy. The women they speak to clearly have a great deal of anger for Banks, who flipped between protective house-mother and betrayer-in-chief, but the show existed at a corrosive pop culture moment where women’s bodies were being scrutinised and ridiculed and reality TV was in its wild west era (“You guys were demanding it,” Banks says. “The viewers wanted more and more and more”). Banks was an easy fall guy, according to Loushy and Sivan.“Tyra was one of the only women who was a show-runner back then,” Sivan says. “The misogyny goes in both directions, not just to justify the harm that was done on the show.”He adds: “The whole concept of telling someone that she is too fat wasn’t even badmouthing back then. It was just part of the culture. And harassing people, having a man grab a woman’s ass is something that you would see on Home Alone 2, it was a joke.”There may now be a more formalised duty of care for some reality shows but is our culture, with social media now a prevalent force, really that much better now?View image in fullscreenAmerica’s Next Top ModelPhotograph: Evan Giordanella/Cw Network/Kobal/Shutterstock“The show did present and showcase so many different images of beauty,” Sivan says. “And now, even when you look at Instagram and it’s supposed to be all so democratised, everybody’s extremely skinny, fit, going to the gym, getting plastic surgery. Our own daughter is obsessed with make-up and she’s 10 years old.”Banks does show more self-awareness than we’ve seen from her before when talking about the problems that arose. She even addresses the uncomfortable clip of her screaming at Tiffany. “I went too far,” she admits. “I lost it. It was probably bigger than her. It was family, friends, society, Black girls, all the challenges we have. So many people saying that we’re not good enough. I think all that was in that moment. That’s some Black girl stuff that goes real deep inside of me, but I knew I went too far.”Perhaps her most surprising admission is that we might not have seen the end of America’s Next Top Model. “You have no idea what we have planned … for cycle 25,” she says.When I ask Loushy and Sivan if they think the show might actually return, they seem sure that those involved would want to do it again. “Cycle 25 is Tyra’s dream,” Sivan says. “I think it’s also the judges’ dream. I think they all want to do another cycle.”Loushy admits that even in her research, binge-watching all 24 cycles, she still understands why it was a success. “I couldn’t stop watching,” she says. “It still works even with the lenses of today and I enjoyed every second of it.”But is it possible to resurrect and avoid the same problems? What would that show even look like in 2026?Sivan says: “Our only tip that if anybody revives this show I hope it focuses more on the personality of the contenders and not on how they look.”Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model is available on Netflix on 16 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryReality TVFactual TVTelevisionNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Even a ride or a water park – things have weight limits,” says Melody Ewert, 44, from Minnesota.Ewert has just switched from Eli Lilly’s Zepbound weekly injection to Novo Nordisk’s new daily Wegovy pill. Analysts believe the arrival of easy-to-take tablets could push weight-loss treatments further into the mainstream in a year that has been described as “pivotal” for the booming anti-obesity market. The new pills, like the jabs, mimic the gut hormone GLP-1 that regulates appetite.Denmark’s Novo set down a marker last month, with the USlaunch of its daily pill– the first oral GLP-1 drug for weight loss.The Wegovy pill has got off to a strong start in the US, with 50,000 prescriptions a week by late January, more than for the Wegovy shot after launch in June 2021 and rival jabs at that stage. It was “the fastest drug launch ever”, according to health analysts at Leerink Partners, after the US regulator FDA gave the green light on 22 December.However, concerns over the price, global supplies and side-effects of treatments persist in the rapidly growing sector, estimated to be worth$200bn (£145bn) by the end of the decade.View image in fullscreenMelody Ewert from Minnesota switched from weekly Zepbound injections to the new daily Wegovy pill.Photograph: suppliedMaking the switchDetermined to lose weight, Ewert initially lost 16.6kg (37lb) without medications, but quickly put most of it back on, and started taking Zepbound in late July. She shed 22.7kg, enabling her to ditch the seatbelt extender on planes. “To be able to shop in the normal shop is a big deal; before I would have to just order clothes, try them on at home and then return them,” she says.She switched to the Wegovy pill because her health insurance changed, meaning that she would go from paying $25 a month to $449 a month for Zepbound. Ewert, who runs a graphic design and video production business with her husband, says she feels better on the medications and has been eating more protein, fibre and vegetables, and avoiding deep-fried food.Unlike with the Zepbound jab, when she had higher appetite in the last two to three days before her next dose, on the Wegovy pill “it is consistent every day how my appetite feels and the food noise is very low, even on the starter dose”, although she “loved only needing to take the shot once a week”.Dr Eric Perakslis, chief science officer at the US weight-loss tracking app Shotsy and a former chief scientist at the FDA, says there has been “a flood of both” new patients and people switching to the Wegovy tablet from jabs.“It’s very simple, just to take a pill,” says Patrick, 33, a parts manager for a fire truck repair facility from New Jersey. He has been on the Wegovy tablet for a month and has lost 6.8kg on the starting dose.He had used the weekly Wegovy injection a couple of years ago and lost 34kg in six months, but stopped taking it because his new health insurance did not cover it after he changed jobs.He regained three-quarters of the weight and, when the Wegovy pill came out, decided to pay for it out of his own pocket, at $150 a month for the starter dose. He is hoping to lose as much weight as last time by taking higher doses that cost up to $300..A growing marketPills are likely to attract people who are averse to needles; they are also cheaper than injections, and do not need to be kept in the fridge.In the UK, the Wegovy pill is being assessed by the medical regulator and expected to hit the market later this year, but it is too soon to say whether it will be available on the NHS. There are alreadyfears that fake versions could flood the marketbecause pills are easier to manufacture for fraudsters than jabs.Despite many reports ofBritish users secretly taking the drugsor appearing to have“Ozempic face”, there are signs the stigma is fading and more people are open about taking them.There were 1.6 million usersin England, Scotland and Wales between early 2024 and early 2025, twice as many women as men, typically people aged 45 to 55, according to a study by UCL researchers. Many are paying out of their own pockets as NHS coverage is limited to the most obese. Nearly two-thirds (64%) of adults were overweight or obesein England in 2022.Another 3.3 million people were interested in using weight-loss drugs in the near future, especially people who are struggling financially, among whom obesity is more prevalent, the study said. This means nearly one in 10 adults in Britain have recently used a weight-loss drug or would like to use one.This compares with one in eight users in the US, a recent KFF poll showed, even though half say the drugs are difficult to afford.View image in fullscreenThe Wegovy pill has got off to a strong start in the US, with 50,000 prescriptions a week by late January.Photograph: UCG/Universal Images Group/Getty ImagesThis week, high street retailer Boots launched a pilot of an in-store service which will allow customers in London, Manchester and Edinburgh to be assessed to see if they are eligible for a weight loss jab.With global obesity levels forecast to accelerate rapidly this decade, particularly in lower-income countries, demand for weight-loss medications is soaring. The GLP-1 market is expected to ramp up from $75bn at present to $200bn by the early 2030s, JPMorgan Chase analysts predict.More than half of adults are predicted to be overweight or obese by 2050, according to astudy in The Lancet.Researchers at the University of Chicago Medicine foundlast summer that, despiteother health benefits such as reduced risk of strokes and heart attacks, GLP-1 injections fell well short of standard benchmarks for cost-effectiveness for governments because of their high cost. However, researchers, led by Dr Jennifer Hwang from the university, believe pills could be more cost effective for the US government.A recent study showed people who stop taking GLP-1 jabsregain all the weight they lost in under two years.There can be significant side-effects, and experts have called for more research into a potential link between GLP-1 jabs and a rise in gallbladder removals by NHS England.Big pharma’s raceThe cash price of the Wegovy pill ranges from $149 to $299 a month depending on the dose, less than the recently lowered cash prices for injectable products afterpressure from Donald Trump.Novo shares plummeted 17% in a single day in early February whenthe company forecast a steeper-than-expected dropin sales and profits this year, after meteoric growth that made itEurope’s most valuable company, worth more than the entire Danish economy. It issuedseveral profit warningsandcut 9,000 jobslast year.There was some scepticism that Novo could quickly ramp up manufacturing of the tablet, which is a reformulation of semaglutide, the same ingredient as in the Wegovy jab, but at a much higher concentration. This means it has to be taken on an empty stomach “with a small sip of water”.Novo’s main rival, Eli Lilly, the maker of the popular Mounjaro and Zepbound jabs, is not far behind, with the US launch ofits weight-loss pill orforglipron expected as soon as April. Unlike the Wegovy pill, it is a small molecule, not a peptide (large protein), and more easily absorbed by the body, without a fasting requirement.Many people have been opting for Mounjaro over the Wegovy shot because clinical studies show it leads to greater weight loss.View image in fullscreenEli Lilly, the maker of the popular Mounjaro and Zepbound jabs, is Novo Nordisk’s main rival.Photograph: Brendan McDermid/George Frey/ReutersAnalysts at Goldman Sachs predict 2026 will be a “pivotal year for the development of the obesity market” with the launch of the Novo and Lilly pills, “potentially significantly increasing the addressable population for obesity medications”.Crucially, the US Medicare health insurance programme willstart covering GLP-1 medicationsfor the first time from April.Analysts at UBS forecast peak annual sales of $3.25bn for the Wegovy pill, compared with $16bn for the injection in the coming years, pointing to a higher drop-out rate in studies (one in 10 stopped taking it because of side-effects, including nausea and vomiting).Both the Novo and Lilly pills are less effective than GLP-1 injections. Analysts say obese people who need to lose more weight will probably stick with jabs, while pills could attract new patients who are overweight or mildly obese.There are other pills in development, notably from the California biotech companies Structure Therapeutics and Viking Therapeutics. Britain’s biggest drugmaker AstraZeneca’s obesity and diabetes pill, acquired fromthe Chinese drug developer Eccogene, is in mid-stage clinical trials.Companies such as AstraZeneca are also working on injectable drugs targeting the hormone amylin for enhanced weight-loss regimes, combining different drugs and medicines designed to preserve muscle mass.Dr Sophie Dix, head of medical affairs at the UK online pharmacy MedExpress, who previously worked for Lilly, says: “If we’re looking at the global impact of these [GLP-1 drugs], we haven’t even scratched the surface yet in terms of the global eligible population.” She takes Mounjaro. “I personally prefer to take a weekly jab rather than a daily pill, just in terms of remembering.”“We still have a lot of people to reach,” says Hwang. “Because the price is coming down, and there are more options in terms of formulations and very high efficacy drugs, hopefully it will go in the right direction.”Explore more on these topicsWeight-loss drugsPharmaceuticals industryObesityDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

After itsLED face mask, theCryoglow, made every beauty lover’s 2025 wishlist, Shark’s latest beauty launch, the FacialPro Glow, promises access to the sort of hydrofacial tech previously reserved for professional facialists.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.If you’re familiar with hydrofacials (AKA hydradermabrasion), then you’ll be aware that they have impressive pore cleansing and hydrating powers when performed in a clinic by a trained facialist. However, I was intrigued to see whether a portable device could be powerful enough to rival a facial that costs more than £100 – and concerned it would be unwise to put such power in the hands of non-professionals.View at SharkView at John LewisHow I testedView image in fullscreenReady to glow: Writer Sarah with the Shark FacialPro Glow kit.Photograph: Sarah MatthewsI’m a beauty writer who has tested a huge range of skincare products, but testing the FacialPro Glowwas on another level, involving layered skincare serums alongside physical exfoliation and temperature therapies with which I’m less familiar. So, as well as testing the device over the course of a month to see if it actually does what it promises, I also sought the expert opinions of cosmetic dermatologistDr Nora JaafarandDebbie Thomas, skin specialist and founder ofD.Thomas Clinic, who does regular in-clinic hydrofacials, which gave me the background knowledge I needed to safely test the device.Testing the Shark FacialPro Glow over several weeks gave me plenty of time to get to grips with the device’s features, strengths and any drawbacks. For each of the weekly treatments I completed, I followed the device’s instructions to the letter and noted down any changes in the texture and appearance of my skin.What you need to knowView image in fullscreenFace time: ‘Each attachment clips into a base, which has enough juice to last for roughly a week of treatments.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianView at SharkView at John LewisThis two-in-one device aims to achieve a hydration-boosting, sculpting facial in just nine minutes. When used correctly, Shark claims the FacialPro Glow can clear dead skin cells, minimise pores, support skin-barrier repair, brighten the complexion, boost hydration and depuff the skin. Lofty claims indeed.The hydrofacial exfoliation attachment has two water tanks: one to fill with clean water or infuse liquid, and another to collect the dirt and oil extracted from the skin. You get four treatment tips in the set – two for normal skin, two for sensitive skin. These slide on to the front of the device and provide light suction and a gentle jet of liquid to exfoliate and cleanse. The exfoliation attachment should only be used once a week because any more will over-exfoliate the skin. The tips and water tanks need thorough cleaning after each use.The DePuffi attachment uses hot and cold therapy that’s supposed to enhance lymphatic drainage, depuff the undereye area, calm the skin and contour. It can be used daily. The attachment itself comprises one smooth, gently curved metal surface, which either cools down or heats up, depending on the effects you’re hoping to achieve.“Contrast therapy is a lovely way to calm inflammation, reduce puffiness and stimulate microcirculation,” says Jaafar. “Cooling and warming cycles can temporarily boost lymphatic drainage and reduce fluid retention, which can make the skin appear more toned and refreshed. It isn’t permanent contouring, but it’s a great quick fix for puffiness or tired skin.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianView image in fullscreenAbove: the infuse and detox products supplied with the kit; and a close-up image of the FacialPro Glow’s tanks.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianEach facial attachment clips into a base power hub, which has enough juice in it to last for roughly a week of treatments, including one exfoliation and seven daily temperature therapy sessions. This hub is also home to the device’s controls; there’s a power button and a temperature level or suction power button. The three indicator LEDs make it clear which setting is selected.The kit also comes with two skincare products: a 20ml exfoliating AHA/BHA “detox” gel and an 80ml BHA “infuse” hydrator. These have been designed to use alongside the FacialPro Glow, and instructions on how to use them are included with the device. Replacements cost £39.99 for the pair (although they’re currentlydiscounted to £29.99).“AHA- and BHA-based gels can help prepare the skin by loosening dead cells and allowing active ingredients to penetrate more effectively,” says Jaafar. “However, pairing them with exfoliating devices should be done mindfully. Listening to your skin’s response is really important.” I didn’t experience any negative side effects in my tests, but always watch out for stinging, burning, peeling or itching.Furthermore, you’ll need to replace these serums often. The device uses 10ml of the infuse hydrator in every exfoliation treatment, which means you’ll have to repurchase these serums every eight uses. If you do treatments weekly as recommended, these refills will cost you £260 a year at full price.And that isn’t the only ongoing cost. The exfoliation attachment comes with replaceable treatment tips that Shark recommends refreshing as soon as performance changes.Replacement tips cost £15.99 for a pairand should last up to nine months.SpecificationsPrice:£299.99 RRP(currently £242.99)Running costs:skincare, £39.99 RRP(currently £29.99)every eight uses; replacement tips,£15.99every nine monthsRecommended usage:Exfoliation once weekly, DePuffi dailySettings:three hot, three cold, three suction levelsTreatment time:four minutes (DePuffi) or nine minutes (Exfoliation)Suitable for:all skin typesBattery life:one week of use (1 x weekly Facial Glow Routine and 5 x daily depuffing routines)Charging time:four hoursWaterproof:Power hub and Exfoliation Attachment areIPX5 ratedContents:Power hub, DePuffi Attachment, Exfoliation Attachment, Derm Detox AHA + BHA Exfoliating Gel (20ml), Hydro Infuse BHA Hydrator (80ml), Normal Wide Tip, Normal T-Zone Tip, Gentle Wide Tip, Gentle T-Zone Tip, Storage Case, USB-C cable, Self-Rinse Cap, Cleaning BrushWhat we loveView image in fullscreen‘During my daily tests, I found the DePuffi’s curved surface fitted comfortably into the contours of my face.’Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianThe FacialPro Glow is straightforward to use. It took a little time for me to get to grips with the many steps, but the instructions were clear, and the controls were simple. By my third time using the device, I was familiar enough to use it without instructions.There are various steps involved with the facial itself, starting with applying the AHA/BHA Detox gel. To my surprise, a pea-sized amount of gel sank into my skin quickly without any irritation, stinging or burning. It’s rare for my tantrum-prone, sensitive skin to have such a mild reaction to a chemical exfoliant, so this was a strong start.After three minutes, it was time to do the first pass of the hydrofacial, using 10ml of water. This three-minute step decongests the impurities that had been loosened by the gel. As recommended, I used the wide tip for most of my face and switched to the thinner tip for my T-zone. The tip provided just enough suction with the water jet for me to feel like it was exfoliating my skin, without being overpowering. It felt gentle and lightly ticklish, but never uncomfortable. The next step was to repeat this using the Infuse BHA toner in the water tank.As both exfoliations took place, the “gunk” tank filled with murky water. This was water from the clean tank mixed with the excess oil, sebum and dead skin cells extracted during exfoliation. I also noticed a few specks in the dirty tank – which Shark refers to as “floaties” – a sure-fire sign it was cleansing more from my skin than my usual cleanser.I noticed my skin getting a little red during this step, which was alarming but short-lived. My experience aligns with Debbie Thomas’s hydrofacials in clinic: “A little pinkness is common and should settle within a few hours; very sensitive skin can take up to 72 hours.”View image in fullscreenThe FacialPro Glow with its exfoliating attachment.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianImmediately after the facial, I applied a barrier-repairing moisturiser. The bumps on my forehead felt smoothed, while the rest of my face had a supple, healthy glow – impressive, considering my lack of professional training and my typicallysensitive skin.It’s clear that Shark has considered different skin types, both with the interchangeable tips and the adjustable intensity settings. As per the experts’ recommendations, I started using the gentle tips and lowest suction. By my final treatment, I was able to tentatively progress to the second intensity setting, since my skin wasn’t showing any signs of damage (sensitivity, peeling or bruising).It was easy to switch between the exfoliating attachment and the DePuffi by pressing the button on the back of the power hub. During my daily tests, I found the DePuffi’s curved surface fitted comfortably into the contours of my face. I didn’t notice a huge improvement in facial contouring over a normal gua sha routine, but I liked the facial massage. The cool settings were perfect to revive my skin in the mornings, and the warm setting was a dreamy addition to an evening wind-down.What we don’t loveView image in fullscreenThe back of the base power hub. The device is charged – it takes four hours – using a USB-C cable.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianOne of the biggest pitfalls of the FacialPro Glow is a fundamental part of its design – the suction. “Moving too slow or using too high a setting can bruise, irritate, disrupt the barrier or break superficial blood vessels (telangiectasia),” warns Thomas. To avoid user error, “start low, keep the head moving smoothly, and hold skin taut for better glide”.Thomas was also unsure about some of the product’s pore-shrinking marketing claims. “You can temporarily make pores look smaller by clearing and hydrating, but you can’t permanently change their genetic size. That’s tricky to do even with professional treatments,” she said.One of my main gripes was the timer function. This automatically stops the exfoliation attachment after three minutes, indicating it’s time for the user to refill the tank with the Infuse toner. When you get used to how quickly you need to move the tool over your face, the timer works well, but I found it tricky to keep up in the first few tries. A countdown timer would have made this far easier.Furthermore, every time you switch on the exfoliation device, it defaults to the highest intensity setting. I wish there were a memory function to remember your preferred settings for next time.The (tiny) 10ml tank was tricky to fill without getting the device wet, and the tank would leak if I overfilled it even slightly. This isn’t a major problem, since the power hub and exfoliating attachment are waterproof (IPX5), but having the gunky Infuse tank leak on my face was an experience I’d rather not relive.I liked using the DePuffi attachment, but I found that it dragged on the skin if I didn’t use a facial oil or a thick cream to give my skin some slip. This wasn’t mentioned in the device’s instruction manual, but Jaafar confirmed that: “The undereye area is delicate, so using a lightweight eye gel or serum before treatment will help the device glide smoothly.”My final frustration is with the case. It’s brilliant for keeping the device clean and neatly packed away, but it’s not big enough to fit the accompanying skincare products, which means they ended up clogging up my vanity table. I also wish the skincare came in refillable containers to cut down on plastic waste. If consumers must buy repeats every eight weeks, the absence of refills feels like an oversight.Warranty and repairsView image in fullscreenTip top: the kit comes with four treatment tips: two for normal skin, two for sensitive, which need replacing about every nine months.Photograph: Sarah Matthews/The GuardianThere are the aforementioned extra costs associated with the FacialPro Glow, including replacing the tips and repurchasing the skincare. At £15.99 and £39.99 respectively, this is certainly not cheap.You may be tempted to use other toners in the device, but this isn’t recommended by Shark, which claims it will not give the same results and may break the device – it also invalidates its warranty.The device itself isguaranteedfor a year without registration, or five if you register your device online within 28 days. If you have problems with your device, you can contact Shark’s customer service helpline (0800 862 0453) or try theShark support website.Should I buy the Shark FacialPro Glow?View image in fullscreenBright Shark: ‘My complexion was brightened, hydration was boosted, and the cooling attachment was brilliant at depuffing the skin.’Photograph: Sarah MatthewsThe FacialPro Glow is an effective at-home facial device that you shouldn’t be afraid to try if you follow the instructions carefully. Jaafar suggests people “use [the exfoliation] as a treat rather than a daily ritual. […] Consistency and care will give the best long-term results.”In my experience, it made my skin feel smoother and more glowy than it has in a long time, especially after four weeks of treatments. One exfoliation can’t match the smoothing results of a professional hydrofacial, but four weeks of treatments got me most of the way there, from the comfort of my sofa.As expected, I didn’t notice my pores shrinking, but my complexion was brightened, hydration was boosted, and the cooling attachment was brilliant at depuffing the skin and bringing down redness. And, if the contents of my gunk tank were anything to go by, it did a good job of clearing dirt and impurities from my skin, too.But as much as I liked using the FacialPro Glow, it didn’t feel like a necessary addition to my skincare routine. That might be true of many beauty products, but it feels particularly salient here.“Less space-age routines can still be as, if not more, effective. BHA [beta-hydroxy acids for exfoliation, such as salicylic acid], retinoid andsunscreenare still the gold standard for long-term clarity and refined texture,” says Thomas. While I like that the hydrofacial attachment can extract impurities and add a dose of hydration, I’m not convinced my results were significantly more impressive than anything I’d get from a good exfoliating and hydrating skincare routine.I’d definitely keep the DePuffi attachment in my nightly routine – its temperature therapy was a solid upgrade to my existing wind-down. The exfoliation is impressive, so I’d love to continue using the FacialPro Glow before big occasions, but I don’t think I could justify the cost of the skincare every week.View at John LewisView at AmazonFor more:The best LED face masksThe best anti-ageing creams, serums and treatmentsThe best eye creams for banishing bags, puffiness and fine linesSarah Matthews is a consumer journalist who specialises in giving health and beauty recommendations.

It was an utter delight, but then, Korean sweet bean paste, which is made with adzuki beans, is so very satisfying: pleasantly claggy, almost nutty, and a little decadent, while at the same time still convincing you that it might count as one of your five a day, were it not stuffed inside a hot fresh doughnut with a whopping great dollop of whipped cream. It was a cold winter’s day – the sort where, by lunchtime, my own umbrella had blown inside-out twice and everyone else’s seemed determined to poke my eye out. Against that backdrop, this doughnut was a moment of pure bliss.Koba, a Korean restaurant byLinda Lee, has been providing moments of such joy for 20 solid years, not least with its traditional tabletop barbecue hot plates on which guests could grill their own dinner. Or, in many cases, have their dinner grilled for them by a kindly server, because nothing says: “Lord God, what time does my shift finish?” more than the face of a tired Korean server watching a gang of tipsy non-Koreans trying to work a tabletop hot plate. After you’ve dropped that first plate of onions into your handbag, you’re often more than grateful for the help. To celebrate reaching 20 years, however, and after an elegant revamp, Lee has now ditched those hotplates altogether. Koba 2.0 has also slung out the black tables, the dangling extraction vents and much of the dark wood, and replaced it with awabi sabicolour palette that’s pale, dreamy and, in places, even twinkly.View image in fullscreen‘Insta-friendly’: Koba’smul hweistarter features mixed raw fish, prawn, trout’s roe and an icy gochujang vinaigrette.Small, elegant snacks and starters include the likes of deep-fried cuttlefish, neatjeonshrimp, vegetable and fermented sauce pancakes and a really very lovelyyook hweiraw beef with pear, seaweed and egg yolk. These starters come with a generous serving ofbanchan,featuring different types of kimchi, beansprouts and spicy cucumbers. Perhaps the old crowd will miss the grill-your-own element, but, especially with something like Koba’sdak galbibarbecue chicken, I feel it’s much better to let an expert take the strain, not least so you don’t mess up the chicken in its heady marinade of gochujang paste, chilli and garlic served with mixed leaves, pickles and sauces. It’s pretty great, too.Rest assured, also, that the beefbulgogiwith mushrooms is still on the menu and, should you really wish, you can even grill it yourself on one of the few remaining tabletop grills in the downstairs private dining room.View image in fullscreen‘Gorgeously staged’: Koba’sdubu sotbabof tofu, wilted greens, nori, mushrooms, green beans and rice.Other parts of Koba’s new menu, however, lean towards delicate, modern fine dining. Themul hwei, for instance, is a pretty bowl of prawn, raw salmon and white fish topped with a generous scoop of vivid orange trout roe and dressed in an iced gochujang vinaigrette. It’s a dish wherethe Koba reboot goes Insta-friendly, as does thedubu sotbabtofu and vegetable rice pot, which doesn’t sound like much on paper, but which turns up gorgeously staged with piles of wilted greens, sliced nori, green beans and mushrooms on top of rice, all waiting to be mixed in.That’s a nice touch, and one of many in this new incarnation of a handy little dining spot that has weathered so much change to this area over its two decades. It’s peculiar to think how many great, seemingly invincible restaurants have thrived but then vanished around Charlotte Street, Rathbone Street and down towards Goodge Street.Elena’s Etoileis long gone, and not even the OG Spaghetti Housecould survive the current climatein this little patch off theatreland, but Koba is somehow still kicking it. Will the decision to whip out those hot plates finally finish the place off? I don’t think so. Thego galbigrilled mackerel is just as great as ever, and in fact it’s all the better for not having to endure my amateur antics.View image in fullscreen‘An utter delight’: Koba’s Korean bean paste doughnut.But let’s go back to those desserts. Korean restaurants and the words “let’s linger over pudding” aren’t traditional friends, but at Koba I think it’s worth making time not just for that doughnut, but also for the vast scoop of fresh vanilla ice-cream that’s served with slices of sweet, fresh persimmon and a drenching of spiced, sticky syrup. Absolute joy.Ripping up your own rulebook after 20-odd years is something only the bravest souls would ever dare to do, but I admire Koba’s chutzpah. More power to its elbow.

We talked and talked – about books, architecture, family, relationships – and haven’t stopped since. I assumed I’d never see her again, but she gave me her number and after texting furiously for a week she invited me to stay with her, and our instant intellectual connection became an intense physical one. We didn’t get out of bed for three days. I practically moved in that weekend and never left.We had three kids in four years. It was intense. Making space for sex has become harder as they’ve got older. But we’re a team, so we always find solutions. And in the past year, we’ve started renting a room in a local sex dungeon for a few hours every couple of months. It relaxes us to know there’s not going to be a knock on the door or a creaking floorboard to distract us. We have a cup of tea and a chat with the receptionist about knitting or what they’re watching on TV, then go into a leather‑clad room. It’s all surprisingly mundane, which is how sex truly is and should be.I’m just over six feet tall and muscly, so I’ve never felt physically vulnerable with a partner beforeI’ve always known I wanted to be penetrated, but as a heterosexual man, especially in a politically regressive, male-dominated work environment, that comes with shame. I’m just over six feet tall and muscly, so I’ve never felt physically vulnerable with a partner before. Pegging is a way to give my vulnerability to Zoe. The pleasure is even more intense than I imagined, but mostly I like the intimacy of it.I didn’t think I’d be having more sex in my 40s than in my 30s, or that we would find an entirely novel thing to do. From the outside, it’s a small, quiet life, but inside it feels like an adventure. Whether it’s kinky sex in a dungeon or shopping in Costco, it’s always about the bond between us, and the amazing luck to have come across my soulmate when I wasn’t even looking.Share your experienceIf you’re keen to talk to us about your sex lives you can get in touch by filling in the form below.

I had booked a seat in a different carriage. He was meant to be on an earlier train. It was the first time in my life that I had given someone my number, and he texted three minutes later: “This is Dan off the train.” The early days were exciting, but there was also a deep familiarity and ease that was unique for me; a calm undertone that meant I trusted it.I get a huge amount of pleasure from giving Dan so much pleasure. It really turns me on to turn him on that muchI had lots of fun and one-night stands in my 20s, but I was always part of the orgasm, touching myself at the same time. Dan was the first person I trusted enough to let go. The sex was amazing, but not particularly adventurous – it was the connection and honesty that made it extraordinary.This is how we do it: ‘Having threesomes has totally transformed us – in and out of bed’Read moreKinky sex is a newer thing, which started four years ago with a proposition from Dan. I’d only heard people talk about pegging in regards to a power shift, which is why my initial answer was no – I don’t want to dominate Dan. But I don’t feel like the powerful one when I’m penetrating him, it just feels like us. People assume it’s about the woman taking on a masculine role, but I feel just as feminine when I’m pegging Dan as when he’s penetrating me.I get huge pleasure from giving Dan so much pleasure; it really turns me on to turn him on that much. It’s poignant and loving. The intimacy of it makes everything feel special for weeks after. I’m so lucky to have a partner who says: “Do you want to try something new?” It would be easy to just continue having the sex we always have, but our ability to change together means we’ll carry on doing that for ever.He makes me feel desired and adored, and I know he’d do anything for me and our family. To trust somebody is the most loving thing you can do. That’s the beautiful thing about pegging – for him to be so vulnerable and to trust me to do that is a gift.For a limited time only, the Guardian Print Shop presents a curated selection of Ryan Gillett’s This is How You Do It illustrations.

We have been married for 40 years, some of it happily, some not so much. Our children are grown up and gone, and we have recently retired. Some of our tensions over the years have been around my husband’s tendency to be underminingand belittling. He claimsnot to understand why I might find certain things upsetting, yet refusesto engage with couples counselling (apparently I would tell lies). We have muddled through and mostly get on well now, thoughhedislikes most of my friends and siblings, andwon’t socialise with them. To be fair, he isself-contained anddoesn’t seem to need friends in the way I do– he has one friend.A few months ago, an ex-colleaguegot in touch withmy husband and asked to meet for coffee. They met, had a long lunch, and my husband mentioned a few weeks later that they were arranging to meet again as he had enjoyed the catchup. I was a bit thrown. I found it odd that she couldn’t confide in her partner orfriends, but my husband exploded and we had one of our worst, most vicious arguments in years. He accused me of not wanting him to have friends (the opposite is true) and threw up the fact that I have platonic male friends; true, but my male friends and I go back 30-plus years and we don’t meetone-to-one. This just feels a bit out of character and potentially inappropriate.I have never feltatwinge of jealousy before in our 40 years together, but I donow. I accept it could just be thatI’m not used to him having friends, as he said. I think what is upsetting me most is that he just can’t(or is pretending not to)see that I may have a point. Anyway, they remain in touch by text and are meeting again. I don’t know what to think. Am I going mad?No, you’re not going mad. Of course people can have platonic friends of either sex. This really isn’t the issue here. The problem is that you aren’t comfortable and your husband isn’t reassuring you.I went to the UKCP-registered psychotherapist Sumeet Grover. “From what you describe,” he said, “there seems to be a pattern in your relationship where your needs and concerns have been devalued and dismissed by your husband.”What I see repeatedly is when one partner has too much shame and guilt, they can deflect that on to the other personMaybe he does want new friends, maybe his new friend makes him feel needed and he’s embarrassed about that, maybe he’s realising that having friends outside the main relationship is actually quite nice, and doesn’t want to hear you say: “I told you so.” But whatevermightbe happening between your husband and his new friend, it’s whatishappening between you and him that matters here.I adore my husband but I feel a fraud at his church | Ask Annalisa BarbieriRead more“You are left with questions, and quite valid ones,” points out Grover, “because a healthy and secure relationship requires a couple to communicate openly, with respect, while holding each other’s feelings and concerns in mind.”What I see repeatedly is when one partner has too much shame and guilt, they can deflect that on to the other person, which is what your husband is doing here. Grover and I thought your concerns were valid.Perhaps you are putting the doubt back on to yourself because you are used to it. And maybe it is time to stop doing this. If my husband had a history of undermining me and not wanting to make me feel better, I might see this as an opportunity to ask myself why I was with this man. I repeat: you’re not going mad.

You put it to one side and wait to see if anyone claims it or contacts you to ask if you got their gift, but no one does.While it is far from unusual for parcels to go astray, if one arrives with all your details on it, it is possible you have become an unsuspecting cog in a large-scale “brushing” fraud, a scam that is on the increase, according to online security experts.Fraudsters need your postage details, which they will often obtain through a data breach. They then set up a false online account in your name on the shopping site they are selling their goods on and post a fake verified and positive review, apparently from you, about the products you have received.These positive five-star reviews “brush up” their online ranking on the shopping site and also their credibility. In theory, this can then increase their sales. Oliver Devane of the security company McAfee says the goods need to be sent to the customer in order for a purchase and review to be verified. These fake verified reviewsare often paid for.While it may appear to be a victim-free scam, it could highlight that your personal details have been hacked. It also risks bringing potentially harmful toys or cosmetics into your home, says Devane.“If it is some little toy that you give to your child, you’ve got no idea of the quality … which is a risk in itself. You have no idea where it came from and what it contains,” he says.What it looks likeThe package will come out of the blue and could contain anything from a key chain gadget to random homeware or even plant seeds. The contents will be cheap and likely to be of poor quality. This could happen at any time of the year, although deliveries of the goods peak at busy shopping periods.In some cases, says Devane, the fraudsters may send QR codes or USB sticks with the product in the hope that people will scan them or put their into their computer. These will invariably lead to some malware being added to a phone or laptop that could result in data being stolen.What to doIf you get something unexpected in the post, do not use it or consume it as it may be dangerous. For example, a toy may not be produced to proper standards or perfume may have harmful ingredients.Check your online accounts to make sure there has been no unauthorised order and then report it to the marketplace that it was sent from.Amazon says third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and have a way toreport them here. If you can identify the fake reviews in your name, then you can inform the shopping site you are dealing with and they can take action.It is worth changing the password on your online shopping accounts and enabling two-factor authentication, says Devane.Do not try to return it to the retailer as this may prompt them to engage with you more and initiate more scams. Instead, simply throw it away after reporting it, he says.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchShoppingConsumer affairsInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Over 75% of people suffer from burnout - here’s what you need to knowDoes it only affect weak people? Is work always the cause? Burnout myths, busted by the expertsZing TsjengSun 15 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleOnce, after surviving yet another round of redundancies in a former job, I did something very odd. I turned off the lights in my room and lay face-down on the bed, unable to move. Rather than feeling relief at having escaped the axe, I was exhausted and numb. I’m not the only one.Fatigue, apathy and hopelessness are all textbook signs of burnout, a bleak phenomenon that has come to define many of our working lives. In 2025, a report from Moodle found that66% of US workershad experienced some kind of burnout, while aMental Health UK surveyfound that one in three adults came under high levels of pressure or stress in the previous year. Despite the prevalence of burnout, plenty of misconceptions around it persist. “Everybody thinks it’s some sort of disease or medical condition,” says Christina Maslach, the psychology professor who wasthe first to study the syndromein the 1970s. “But it’s actually a response to chronic job stressors – a stress response.” Here we separate the facts from the myths.Burnout is just tirednessFALSEExhaustion isn’t the only key symptom – another is depersonalisation, or a sense of emotional detachment and cynicism. In medical staff, that might show up as compassion fatigue (leading to diminished empathy and increased irritability). For those not in healthcare, “they may find that it’s hard to care as much about their colleagues”, and their work, leading to feelings of irritation, says Claudia Hammond, the author ofOverwhelmed: Ways to Take the Pressure Off. The third sign is decreasing productivity and competence – whether real or perceived. “You get less and less done, which can often result in feelings of great shame or guilt,” explains burnout coachAnna K Schaffner.Burnout is different from depression or anxietyTRUEThe WorldHealthOrganization (WHO) doesn’t consider burnout a mental health condition or illness. Having said that, “anxiety and depression can be signs of burnout”, says Hammond, “but not everyone with burnout will be feeling as hopeless as people feel when they’ve got depression.”It’s always work-relatedFALSEWhile the WHO classifiesburnout as an “occupational phenomenon”related to long-term, badly managed work stress, scientists are now expanding their research toinclude parents and caregivers. “It’s a job that is incredibly emotionally draining, taxing and physically demanding,” explains researcher and Burnout Immunity authorDr Kandi Wiens. “Regardless of whether you’re getting paid for it, that can all lead to burnout.”Only weak or unmotivated people get burnoutFALSE“If working hard cured burnout, so many of us would be cured,” says Amelia Nagoski, the co-author ofBurnout:The Secret to Unlocking the Stress Cycle, who was hospitalised twice by stress-induced illness from their high-pressure musical conservatory. The syndrome can actually be an indication that you are overinvested in a job, notes Wiens. “We see this a lot with people who work for mission-oriented institutions or nonprofits. People who feel very passionately about their job will overly emotionally commit themselves; that can create emotional exhaustion.” Paradoxically, loving your job can make it harder to recover from burnout. “People often struggle to step away … If you didn’t care, you wouldn’t burn out,” explains Prof Gail Kinman from the Society of Occupational Medicine.View image in fullscreenSet design: Millar Models. Michelangelo’s David candles: Candle Monkey.Photograph: Tal Silverman/The GuardianIt’s not a personal failingTRUE“It isn’t the job itself that causes burnout,” Kinman says. “It’s often the way the organisation is managed and the support that people get.”Research on healthcare workershas found that organisational factors play a much bigger role in burnout than the person themselves. These include intense workloads, long hours and lack of support and agency in decision-making. Maslach points out that any meaningful response involves re-evaluating work conditions. “Too often the response is to figure out how to deal with burnout – rather than addressing chronic job stressors.”Taking a holiday will fix burnoutFALSE“One myth is that a very short break will make a difference,” says Hammond. You need “a reasonable amount of time away”, advises Kinman, but the length depends on the severity of the burnout. Most of Schaffner’s clients recover with three to six months off work. While physical rest is important, she cautions against going into hermit mode and swerving social connection: “Don’t let your life shrink – make sure you reintroduce good things.” If you can’t take time out, try to build “micro-recoveries” into each day to regulate your nervous system and stress levels. Avoid scrolling mindlessly on your phone – try listening to music, doing some chair stretches or looking at family photos. “It could be something as simple as a walk outside for two to three minutes,” Wiens suggests.You can push through if you try hard enoughFALSE“People used to talk about type A personalities who worked all the time and had heart attacks in their 40s,” says Maslach. We now know why. Soldiering on can mean gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal and cardiovascular problems. The Harvard physician and author of The 5 ResetsDr Aditi Nerurkarexperienced this herself when she developed heart problems during medical training. “I thought: ‘Stress doesn’t happen to people like me, I’m resilient.’ Now we know that that’s scientifically untrue – resilience, while protective, is by no means preventive for burnout.”Peopleuse burnout as an excuse to avoid workFALSE“Burnout has become a buzzword,” Nagoski acknowledges, but decades after it was first observed by Maslach, “there’s overwhelming evidence that burnout is becoming more and more common”. According toTUC research, a “perfect storm” of factors is to blame, including intensifying work demands, chronic staff shortages, worsening work-life balance and the use of surveillance tech to monitor productivity. People are also feeling the effects of an economically and politically unstable, screen-obsessed world, says Schaffner: “We live in worrying, wearing times.” The idea that burnout has been weaponised to avoid work is one Maslach strongly rejects: “It’s easier [for employers] to say there’s something wrong with staff, they’re weak and lazy, and they don’t want to work, rather than saying: ‘What would make the work more doable?’”Physical symptoms aren’t part of burnoutFALSEYou can experience physical side-effects such as muscle tension, headaches, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure and more. That’s because stress is an age-old biological response designed to help escape emergencies like running away from a predator. The problem is when the body is placed under chronic stress, explains Kinman: “These adaptive responses tend to become maladaptive and cause all kinds of problems.”Burnout is a sign you need to quit your jobFALSENot necessarily. Broadly speaking, Schaffner says, you have three options: leave; improve your working conditions; adapt by prioritising your wellness – or a combination of the last two. That can mean tackling perfectionism, putting down boundaries or scheduling downtime. “Studies have found that even just 10-minute breaks can make an incremental difference in your brain and your body,” says Nerurkar. But don’t beat yourself up if it doesn’t work. “Sometimes people are in horrific working environments that are making them ill,” Schaffner explains. “They can have all the self-mastery skills in the world and it won’t help. If I discover that [with my clients], they need to get out.”Everyone’s a little burnt outFALSE“The data right now shows that about76% of people experience burnout,” says Nerurkar.That doesn’t mean that everyone has it severely enough to need months off work. “Proper burnout is a really serious and existentially threatening condition,” says Schaffner, in which sufferers “are chronically tired, but continue to be high-functioning at work at a really high cost”. At its worst, she says, those with burnout “sometimes can’t even get out of bed and suffer brain fog, meaning they can’t read or write any more”.You can fix burnout by reducing your work hoursTRUE AND FALSEThis depends. If your case was related to work hours, then reducing them may alleviate early symptoms – though not if it comes with the expectation that the same amount of work still needs to be done. “Reducing workload may help a little bit if they’re able to use that time to reconnect to the things and people they really love,” cautions Wiens, “but not if they’re just getting thrown back into a work environment that’s not healthy.”You can’t return to the same job if you’ve already burnt outTRUE AND FALSEIf, by “the same job”, you mean the exact same work environment, then no. People can make a full return, but adjustments such as tweaking your job spec, seeking occupational health support or a gradual ramp back up to work may be necessary. If that’s not possible, it may be time to wave goodbye. “One woman I interviewed said it very well: she finally realised that she could not recover in the place that was making her sick,” says Wiens.Breathing exercises/meditation/yoga will solve burnoutFALSEPractices such as yoga or breathwork may help calm a stressed-out nervous system, but no amount of savasana will compensate for a toxic workplace. “Burnout is a very complex phenomenon,” says Nerurkar. “Focusing on a little bit of breathing is not going to do it.” Other than eliminating the chronic stressors in your job, there are some smaller things you can do: protect your sleep; minimise screen time; introduce some form of movement into your daily life. Wiens encourages her clients to revisit the people and experiences that made them happiest. “Positive reconnections help people change their perspective on the work environment,” she explains. “They suddenly start to see they have options that they might not see when they’re immersed in it.”Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingHealthMental healthWork & careersfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But doing everything yourself can be a sign that you are scared of intimacyEmine SanerSun 15 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 00.02 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleWhen a relative was seriously ill and in intensive care for more than a month, Cianne Jones stepped in. “I took it upon myself to be that person in the hospital every single day – chasing doctors, taking notes, making sure I understood why they were doing things.” It was so stressful, she says, that at one point her hair started falling out, but she ploughed on.It was Jones’s therapist who gently questioned whether she was going to ask for help. Jones laughs. “The hair falling out didn’t suggest to me that I needed help, it was somebody else looking in and saying that.” She has a large, close family who would have helped immediately – and did, once Jones asked – it’s just that it didn’t occur to her to ask. “I had taken that role on: ‘I’m just going to get everything done.’ I just took off, and that was it.”It’s an experience many of us with so-called hyper-independence will recognise. I’ve behaved in similar ways, from more serious situations (I too have shouldered care responsibilities) to ridiculous ones, such as moving house alone, and the time I bought some weightlifting equipment then realised I wasn’t strong enough to carry it home. For most of my life, I’ve prided myself on my hyper-independent lone-wolf status – not relying on anyone but myself. But in recent years, I’ve come to see it not as a sign of my superior capabilities, but fuelled by fear of burdening others with my requests – or worse, being rejected – or of losing control.Anything that shows that I’m not capable, I don’t think I’d askCianne JonesIt is well established thatthe quality of your relationshipsis key to happiness, and also has a big impact on health. “We are wired for connection,” says clinical psychologist Dr Stephen Blumenthal. “It’s bad for you to exist alone.” There may be those whose hyper-independence is more innate, and less of an issue, but for many people it can lead to isolation and loneliness. Blumenthal sees it in his clinic every day. Often, hyper-independent people are successful at work, “but then it’s a disaster when it comes to interpersonal relationships”.For Jones, it has been more of a learned behaviour. She saw her single mother raise four high-achieving children while leading a charity. “She did everything herself, and it was very much me watching that that suggested this is what you do, you just get on with it. I was always inspired by my mum.” It spurred Jones on to qualify as a solicitor, run a company, found a charity –Women in Leadership, based in Uganda – and start a PhD. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given all that, as well as her propensity to shoulder everything herself, Jones has experienced burnout. “I didn’t realise how much I was taking on until I had a panic attack one morning and had to go to hospital.” She smiles at herself. “Even then, I thought I would take my laptop with me.”She resists asking for help in general. “Anything that shows that I’m not capable, I don’t think I’d ask.” She is close to her family and has strong friendships, some going back decades, but she thinks her hyper-independence has affected romantic relationships. “There’s this narrative with quite a few women in my age group, our 30s: we’ve got everything, jobs, our own homes. Then, considering romantic relationships, you feel a little bit lonely, but do I really need anyone?”This was the same for Urvashi Lad, who had run businesses and was, she says, “single pretty much until I was 43” – much of which she puts down to her hyper-independence. “It gives you a feeling of control.” But, she says, it “can keep you alone because you don’t feel safe to find that love”.It took more than a year doing journalling and other therapies, she says, “to feel safe, to let that guard down and let somebody in”. Then she met someone (they’re getting married this year). She still catches herself trying to reject her fiance’s help, even with small things such as checking the screenwash in her car. “It got my back up initially, until I went: ‘No, it’s OK, he wants to do something nice for me, and it’s really nice that he wants to do this.’” She has tried to curb her hyper-independence in other areas of life. “It can really lead to burnout, brain fog and overload. We can’t do everything ourselves, no matter what we tell ourselves.”In western society, independence and individualism is encouraged over community and relying on one other. For men, especially, says Blumenthal, our culture celebrates the hero forging his own path, from the characters of 19th-century novels to the cowboy archetype to the “sigma male” internet trend of the past decade. Hustle culture and “girl boss” goals similarly prize individualism in women.There are other cultural forces at play. Jones, who is Black, sees a lot of hyper-independence among other Black women. It comes from the stereotype of being “strong”, she thinks, and is “very much a narrative that’s placed on us”. Her PhD is on domestic abuse in the Black community in London, and the response by the Metropolitan police, and this stereotype feeds into it. “So will women actually go out and ask for help in the first place? And do police officers think that you need help?”She sees how successful Black women in the workplace are often placed in “saviour” roles – for instance, as an incoming CEO of a struggling company – which creates added pressure. “On top of that is care responsibilities,” says Jones of her Caribbean cultural heritage. “I know others in the Black community understand that. So you’re ‘strong’, you’re a carer, you’re a saviour, you’re a survivor. And you’re working.” It is, she says, “having a detrimental impact on many Black women’s lives”.Lad thinks hyper-independence is about “protection – from being disappointed, being hurt by someone – or having had an experience that’s led someone to believe that it’s actually easier to do it all themselves. It’s not that a hyper-independent person doesn’t want help. In fact, they crave that help, but they want to feel safe enough to receive it.” In the past, she says, whenever she has let her guard down, “someone would take advantage, or expect [something in return], and so I put my guard back up, and I put myself in a fortress and it can be a lonely place”. If someone did her a favour, Lad would feel indebted – even letting someone buy her a coffee would feel uncomfortable. She thinks her hyper-independence partly has roots in her Indian heritage. “[Women] have been conditioned to do it all ourselves – to cook, to clean, to get a good job, to have our own money, all of that kind of stuff.”Hyper-independence tends to start in childhood, says Kathleen Saxton,psychotherapist and author of My Parent the Peacock. Perhaps parents or caregivers were inconsistent, unreliable or emotionally unavailable. “Maybe they were working very hard and couldn’t give you the attention, so you learned to cope well on your own. It could have been that you had somebody who might have had an addiction, or maybe just a very dismissive parent for various reasons. Maybe they were brought up in quite an unemotional environment themselves.”Or perhaps you are the eldest child and took on care for a parent or siblings early on. As an adult, it could develop from an experience of betrayal. Hyper-independence, she says, is “a coping mechanism. It’s a sense that: I can’t rely on anybody, so I will rely on myself. We sometimes wonder if there is suppressed grief and anger in there.”Her hyper-independent clients are often proud of it, she says. “The positives are you’ll be seen as the fixer or the organiser or the rescuer, and that also allows you to be in control quite a bit, but underneath that you may feel exhaustion. You may offer to do it all, but in the end, you may feel resentful.”The fact that her clients have recognised it, and are seeking Saxton’s help, shows hyper-independence has its downsides. “The negatives I see are emotional isolation, so you don’t share your vulnerability with other people. You share very selectively – you worry about burdening others. But it means that nobody ever really gets to know you, and people aren’t ever able to help you, and you start to have a belief that your needs can’t or won’t be met by other people.” This can also lead to cynicism and emotional numbness.Hyper-independence has typified Phil Rowe’s life, he says. “Certainly, when I was younger, it was feeling not important enough to warrant anyone’s effort. I think I just had zero confidence for that kind of thing. It was a case of, ‘Who am I to ask?’” In his late teens, he was hospitalised with depression. “A part of that was probably my inability to discuss what was going on. I think it was very much that I didn’t want to burden people.”Though he was an academic child, Rowe left school at 14 to work in a factory, because he was keen to start earning his own money. Now in his mid-50s, he has been married for 35 years, so it didn’t affect his chance of creating a strong partnership, but it has only been in the past 10 years or so that Rowe has become more comfortable asking for help from others.I think, generally, people are a lot nicer and forthcoming than they are in my head at timesPhil RoweFive years ago, inspired by his love of drama at school, Rowe started a new career as a voiceover artist, which required him not only to ask people for help and advice but to work in a collaborative, creative way. Sometimes he still feels uneasy, he says, but “not only does the world not fall apart, it gets infinitely better. Looking inward is kind of negative, compared with reaching out into the world. Usually, people are quite happy to help. I think, generally, people are a lot nicer and forthcoming than they are in my head at times.”Independence verging on the extreme is, says Saxton, “a great thing to have in the locker, but I would challenge someone: what would it be like to begin to state what your needs are and seeing whether or not they could be met?” If your hyper-independence is something you’d like to change, try to understand where it might have come from. A therapist could be helpful, but Saxton says you can do a lot of this yourself. A person may have “lots of reasons and excuses as to why and how they like being independent, but if they’re able to drop down into whether or not there might be an inner wounded part that was let down, then you can work on being able to be with that part that felt nobody was there for them. Where did I learn I was better off to be on my own? Who might have failed me? Who didn’t give me maybe some of the support that I needed? And then we can begin to move towards tolerating some level of vulnerability.”One way would be to start practising bits of “micro-dependence – asking for help with a small task that maybe isn’t so important, sharing a worry with somebody, letting somebody in a little bit. Micro-dependency or micro-vulnerability is stepping out and seeing what it feels like, just to show a little bit of your underbelly.” Healthy intimate relationships, points out Saxton, require reciprocity.It was challenging herself to let someone buy her a coffee, remembers Lad, that allowed her to start to shift some of her hyper-independence three years ago. As well as leading to her relationship – which she thinks wouldn’t have worked before – the change has also improved her friendships. Shenow works as a coach, helping “hyper-independent women heal so they can feel safe, open up and receive that love and support that they crave”.Jones has experimented with reaching out more, for instance by trying a local running club. “This sort of accountability and having other people around to support you with your goals I know is important.” Although she does lean on close friends, this is about being more vulnerable with people she doesn’t know well, and accepting that “those people could be supportive”. She is a little sceptical about how much of her hyper-independence she really wants to give up, but she is considering it. “You take on this role where you just do everything and get on with it.” As she gets older, she says, “the more I start to realise that I’m not sure I particularly like that role all the time”.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingFriendshipPsychologyMental healthHealthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today it makes a picture-perfect alternative to the Italian lakesAnnabel AbbsSun 15 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe ancient settlement of Chiavenna, in Lombardy, near Italy’s border with Switzerland, was once well known among travellers. “Lovely Chiavenna … mountain peaks, huge boulders, with rippling miniature torrents and lovely young flowers … and grassy heights with rich Spanish chestnuts,”wrote George Eliotin 1860.Eliot wasn’t the only writer to rhapsodise about this charming town. Edith Wharton described it as “fantastically picturesque … an exuberance of rococo”. For Mary Shelley it was “paradise … glowing in rich and sunny vegetation”, while Goethe described it as “like a dream”.View image in fullscreenFor those pioneering travellers, gentle, sunlit Chiavenna marked their arrival in Italy, having crossed the Splügen Pass, one of the earliest transalpine routes connecting northern Europe to the south. Today, few tourists bother with Chiavenna, heading instead to the better-known Como that lies 60 miles (100km) to the south. They are missing a treat.Intrigued by the praise once heaped upon this mysterious town, with a picture-perfect location at the foot of the snow-flecked Alps, I decided to spend a week here with my husband. Surrounded by thick chestnut woods and bisected by the crystal-clear River Mera, Valchiavenna (the town’s valley) holds numerous surprises too, from the area’scrotti(natural caves), to a B&B in the ornate villa once inhabited by the great 18th-century painterAngelica Kauffman. It also has dozens of magnificent hiking and cycling trails through a spectacular landscape of waterfalls, glacially sculpted rocks, mossy woodlands, ancient mule tracks and abandoned villages. With barely a tourist in sight.The network of cobbled alleys containing ornate frescoed buildings and elaborate fountains is testament to its past as a wealthy trading townI travelled from Zurich, taking a train to St Moritz, then a bus over the spectacular Maloja Pass, down 20 vertiginous hairpin bends (known astornanti) carved from the rock face of the Alps, with sweeping views – lakes, peaks, forests – in all directions. This €20 one-hour bus ride also stops off at the Swiss village of Stampa (birthplace of the artist Alberto Giacometti and home of theMuseo Ciäsa Granda, which is dedicated to him), as well as Sils Maria village, home of theNietzsche-Haus, where Nietzsche spent seven formative summers in the late 19th century, and now a museum. Meanwhile, my husband travelled to Chiavenna by train from Milan, a journey that skirted the scenic shores of numerous lakes, including Lake Como.View image in fullscreenThe remote Rifugio Uschione.Photograph: Paolo ValentiniOur first day was spent hiking 6 miles upriver along the beautiful Via Bregaglia, a 24-mile hiking trail running from Soglio in Switzerland to Chiavenna, to reach one of the region’s best-known restaurants, the family-run, Michelin-starredLanterna Verde. After feasting on trout caught minutes before from their own lake, we took the bus back to explore Chiavenna’s old centre, which dates from the 15th century (the medieval town was destroyed by fire). Described by an Italian friend as “like Verona but without the amphitheatre, crowds and chain stores”, the network of cobbled alleys containing ornate frescoed buildings and elaborate fountains is testament to its past as a wealthy trading town.At Rifugio Uschione, a rustic yet stylish priest’s house, we spent an utterly silent night of perfect sleepChiavenna is home to dozens ofcrotti, natural cellars embedded in the rocky flanks of the surrounding mountains. Before the advent of refrigeration, thecrottiwere used for storing wine, cheese and cured meats, and often as places to socialise. Today several operate as restaurants and bars: atCrotto UbialiandCrotto Ombra, we tucked into two of the town’s signature dishes:sciatt– melt-in-the-mouth buckwheat fritters stuffed with cheese – andgnocchi alla chiavennasca– bread-based dumplings served with melted butter and crispy fried sage. AtCrotto Belvedere, we sipped local wine – try Opera, a delicious white from nearby vineyards, that arrives in a bottle labelled with the work of a local artist.On our second day we explored the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti (“giants’ cauldrons”), which slopes up from the town’s eastern edge–a mass of mineral-rich green stone (pietre verdi) natural craters, caused by glacial erosion over thousands of years. From here, hiking trails fan out, tantalisingly, in all directions. We took the 50-minute path to Uschione, an empty, roadless village of stone houses, a church and cemetery, perched high above the valley and wreathed in soft wisps of cloud. Four hundred people once lived here, but today the only inhabitants are long‑eared sheep and Mendi who runs theRifugio Uschione(doubles from €160), a rustic yet stylish priest’s house where we spent an utterly silent night of perfect sleep. The next morning we took a mossy path upwards to explore abandoned forestcrotti, before turning northwards to bask in panoramic views across the valley and up towards the soaring Rhaetian Alps.View image in fullscreenPalazzo Vertemate Franchi in Piuro is the only building that survived a landslide in 1618.Photograph: AGF/AlamyBack in Chiavenna, we headed to thePalazzo Salis B&B, once home to Angelica Kauffman. Here, a lavish frescoed room, complete with antique furniture, painted ceiling, chequered marble floor and breakfast on the terrace costs from €130. After stopping for cups of cappuccino andcioccolata calda(melted dark chocolate with a splash of thick cream) in Sierra Nevada, the town’s cutest roastery, we walked a mile north to Piuro for a tour of the most eye‑popping renaissance villa:Palazzo Vertemate Franchi. The sole surviving building from a 1618 landslide that destroyed the entire village and killed more than 1,000 inhabitants, the palazzo (advance booking and guided tours only) boasts exquisite marquetry, fantastical frescoes and elaborately carved panelling.Palazzo Vertemate Franchi is the most eye‑popping renaissance villa, boasting exquisite marquetry, fantastical frescoes and elaborately carved panellingGiddy from all these unexpected delights, we strolled a further mile to the dramatic Acquafraggia waterfalls. This double waterfall tumbles 1,300 metres in a series of cascades, and was described by Leonardo da Vinci as “making a beautiful sound and a marvellous spectacle”. With our cheeks gently misted, we climbed the ancient mule path (2,867 stone steps) up to the abandoned village of Savogno, where old stone houses cling precipitously to the mountainside.A day later, we drove up the 51 tightly twisting, hairpin bends to explore the Splügen Pass. This 40-minute journey climbs 1,780 metres and propelled us into an utterly different, much chillier landscape. We spent a contented night at the legendary coaching innAlbergo della Posta, (doubles from €130) in the tiny hamlet of Montespluga. Little has changed here in 75 years – the 10 bedrooms are cosily panelled in pine, and retain their original furnace stoves.View image in fullscreenLeonardo da Vinci was among admirers of the Acquafraggia waterfall.Photograph: Aerial Vision/AlamyWith Shelley’s words about the pass in our heads – “naked and sublime … dim mists, chilling blasts and driving snow” – we walked a three-hour circular path to the Lago di Andossi, revelling in the landscape’s bleak austerity, with its eerily turquoise lakes, luminously green lichen and treeless, craggy peaks. This route also forms the beginning of the 20-mileValchiavenna cycle path, which took third place in the Italian Green Way Cycle Road awards of 2022. Bike hire is available fromAdam’s Bike Tours, and we vowed to return one day to cycle the route.And then it was back to Chiavenna to investigate the Saturday market, sample its three gelaterias, explore the toweringParco Paradiso(a terraced botanical garden built on the site of the original castle), and to amble around the cloistered church of San Lorenzo, with its gloriously carved 12th-century font. We finished at Chiavenna’s high-security Museo del Tesoro or “treasure museum”, home to the extraordinaryLa Pace– a jaw-dropping, 11th-century bible cover with the finest goldsmithing and enamelling imaginable, encrusted with emeralds, rubies and pearls. It is yet another reminder of the important role Chiavenna once played in Europe’s history.We ended our trip by pigging out on the locally inspired tasting menu – it was our wedding anniversary – at the family-runVilla Giade(which also has sleekly modern, reasonably priced bedrooms with the best views in town). Over glasses of wine from the local Nebbiolo grape, we pondered Chiavenna’s many hidden charms, before agreeing that this could be the most quietly romantic town we had ever visited.For more information, visitvalchiavenna.comExplore more on these topicsItaly holidaysEurope holidaysMilan holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was moved by the recent story of theAustralian boy who swam to landfor several hours in rough waters to raise the alarm that his mother and siblings had been swept out to sea. Despite his exhaustion, he then ran several kilometres to find a phone.But I’m also thinking of the lesser demands for courage – such as standing up to a friend, or family member, or tackling a company that’s ignoring your polite requests when you’re suffering from its actions. Or I also wonder how people do certain jobs that, to me, require buckets of courage: starting a business or any other sort of professional risk-taking; reporting from a war zone like Lyse Doucet or Jeremy Bowen. Or just being a police officer knocking on the door of a suspect and not knowing what is on the other side.View image in fullscreenAustin Appelbee, right, with his brother, Beau, left, his mother, Joanne, and sister Grace, in Gidgegannup, Australia, after Austin swam to raise the alarm for his family earlier this year.Photograph: Briana Shepherd/APWhat brings courage in all these situations, and if you don’t have it, can you get it?Sam, Exeter, DevonSend new questions tonq@theguardian.com.Readers replyCourage is more a decision than anything else, especially the first time. That old saying, “Feel the fear and do it anyway” is important. You don’t need courage if you’re not afraid, so don’t wait for the fear to go before you try. The first time is the hardest, then you start to realise the sky doesn’t fall in, and it gets easier and easier.I started out really shy. Essentially, I still am. But I learned to refuse to be pushed around, to challenge people, to write really good, logical letters to companies who tried to mess me around. You can do all these things quite gently. There’s no need to be loud or angry. Just realising that quietly stating your case can move mountains is liberating.LorLalaAsk the Dutch …MarkHaingeI believe it’s available in liquid form.eibhearIt comes from realising, and focusing on, the fact that another person or the moral value of something is bigger than yourself.

I said: “Yes.” He said: “Good man, I don’t want to work up there with someone who’s not afraid since they are very dangerous to be around but, rather, someone who can temper the fear with courage.”FreddyStEadygowThat’s the sort of bold question I’d be afraid to ask.sparklesthewonderhenHopefully I can. Will keep you posted.NextstepsI’m not sure courage is the appropriate word for the examples in the article. Preparation and practice are important. There are still nerves, obviously, but training lets you deal with them. For example, making a public music performance (especially a solo one) is scary. And it never stops being that. However, I look through my practice notes, and my post-event write-up and I see that every time I am ready to piss in my pants beforehand. But I rely on my training.WindydayNothing physically happens for one to “gain” courage; you relinquish the egoic structure that requires protection. The distinction between courage and grit is the difference between wisdom and willpower.shakercoolaI once knew a guy who wouldn’t get on a rollercoaster, citing the very few times they have resulted in deaths. Yet he experimented wildly with drugs, which is more risky. He could not assess the risks of each activity accurately because one did not give him pleasure and the other did.lmllr1Can you acquire courage? Yes, I think we can see that happening all around us as people age and mature and begin to question their own worlds. It takes courage to fire the boss, toss toxic friends, dump the spouse, trade in the car for a bicycle, let the hair go grey, ignore the spurious claims of “health” and “beauty” marketeers and advertising in general and, “to thine own self, be true”.OikazeA mother who’s son was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross was once asked to define courage. She simply said that courage was about caring more for others than one did for oneself.Jima19Never underestimate “challenge” in forming those who run towards trouble, who take on things bigger than themselves. If you survive the worst that can happen – caregiver abuse, trauma of all kinds – some survivors go on to “extend their hand” and take risks on behalf of others, on behalf of the underdog. Being a trauma survivor often results in “courage” which is really a refusal to give in to outside pressure.foxinwinterMy ancient Greek philosophy lecturer told us she’d once set an exam where one of the questions (alluding to one of Plato’s plays) was: “What is courage?” One of her students wrote nothing except “PTO” on the bottom of every page of his answer booklet, and on the final line of the final page, wrote: “This is.”Courage is something you practise and hone. That creates a reaction in you that it will feel better to act than to stand by. Do something small that takes courage every week and you will start to learn that action generates good feelings. That way, when you are faced with danger you are more likely to act than freeze. As the saying goes: shit your pants and do it anyway. Most people we view as brave don’t necessarily feel that way about themselves.1mikegardner7View image in fullscreenMstyslav Chernov, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and director of 20 Days in Mariupol on an assignment for Associated Press in Sloviansk, Donetsk, Ukraine, in 2023.Photograph: Anastasia Vlasova/The GuardianYes, especially under fire. Adrenaline is a very powerful hormone and plays an essential role in the fight-or-flight response by increasing blood flow to muscles and assisting our cognitive processing and decision-making.Sagarmatha1953Courage in the battlefield comes from accepting that you are already dead. Courage in the face of the true reality of the human condition and our inevitable animal death is the greatest, most elusive prize of all, a lifelong practice to get anywhere near acquiring, and carries the real risk of descending into open psychosis. The best method I know of is contemplation and reading: Kierkegaard, Freud and the post-Freudians, the poets, Péguy, Tolstoy, et al.tinearsCourage v resilience v innate personal nature? Courage is evocative. Resilience is experiential. Innate personal nature is routine.snazpizaz2True courage often comes from having no other choice. Sink or swim. Our first baby died in 2018. Someone said to me: “I couldn’t live if that happened to me. I don’t know how you find the courage to go on.”But, the truth is, if you choose to live (as I did, thankfully) you have to find the courage. I’m now a funeral celebrant and the skill set required presents externally as courage, but it’s simply solidarity and support for those who are now the ones with no choice but to be courageous.Lucy_Biggs_Necessity, as they say, is the mother of invention.DorkaliciousHaving had no other choice but to keep going in the face of tremendous difficulty, courage has always shown up. What else am I going to do? Collapse in a heap and wait for a nonexistent saviour? It’s about keeping going, despite everything.GrasmereGardensView image in fullscreenOn the path to courage with yoga …Photograph: Sergei Chaiko/AlamyIf you think that you cannot do something, eg hold a handstand, then find that you can, this can help to develop courage, so that maybe you’ll try a headstand.

But I didn’t put it in my apartment straight away. My plan was to swap the old couch for the new one right before my parents came to visit from overseas, so the dog wouldn’t have a chance to destroy it before their arrival.My apartment was upstairs and the new couch was in storage on the ground floor, so I hired removalists to swap the two couches the day my parents arrived. They took the tattered old couch down – but didn’t carry the new one up. Instead, they left it on the street for anyone to grab, and were gone before I had the chance to correct them.My neighbour, who was a lovely guy, saw what happened and offered to help me get the new couch up. But manoeuvring the bulky couch up a narrow set of stairs was a two-person job, and I just wasn’t strong enough to lift the other end. Neither were any of my friends.The kindness of strangers: my teenage son was on a date at a fancy restaurant when a fellow diner helped pay the billRead moreI was frantic – I had to get this new couch up before my parents’ flight landed! So, in sheer desperation, I drove to the nearby gym and asked the receptionist if anyone there could help me out. I figured it was a room full of people lifting heavy weights, so where better to look for strong men? The receptionist told me she didn’t think she could ask anyone on my behalf, but that I was welcome to approach people directly.Just then, a big, burly guy started walking out. I stopped him, frantically explaining I had a beautiful leather couch stranded on the side of the road, and asked if he could help. Looking mostly amused, he hopped in his car and followed me a kilometre back to my place.There, he and my neighbour shooed me away, sending me off to pick up my parents from the airport. When I got back, the couch was safely in my apartment.I thanked my neighbour profusely but never saw that man from the gym again. I wish I’d been able to tell him that he had restored my faith in people. Without any judgment or even asking me how I’d gotten myself into such a predicament, he offered his assistance.I took a photo of the new couch, put it on Instagram and captioned it: “If I ever feel like giving up on the universe, show me this!” Now, any time I start doubting humanity, I look at that photo to remind myself of the kindness of strangers.What is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?Share your experienceWhat's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?From making your day to changing your life, we want to hear about  chance encounters that have stuck with you.Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

But his speech was a stern warning that if Europe wanted to continue on its path of civilisational decline, as this US administration sees it, America would not be interested and has different hemispheres on which to focus.“Yesterday is over,” he said, and then he spelled out what yesterday meant. Mass migration threatening civilisational erasure and the continuity of Christian culture, unfettered trade, massive welfare states, weak defences, climate cults, the outsourcing of sovereignty to international institutions, the rationalisation of a broken status quo by people “shackled with guilt and shame”. Unlike Vance, he did not laud rightwing European populist parties, but he nonetheless wrapped himself in their ideology. His next stop after Munich was Budapest, whereViktor Orbán faces a battlein April to remain in power.And yet there were some, such as the organiser of the conference, the distinguished German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who claimed to be reassured by the conditional offer to join this journey into a new era with Donald Trump. If Europeans were reassured by Rubio, it was, as Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, observed, “a classic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations”. One reference by the US secretary of state to his country being “a child of Europe” and the older romantics of transatlanticism melted.But that was not the dominant European mood at this sprawling conference. An iron has entered the European soul about Trump, egged on by the many Democrats attending, and there is a willingness if not to confront him then at least to end the dependence and learn the lessons of thestandoff over Greenland.1:52Danish PM believes Trump still wants Greenland – videoTalk of a stronger independent European pillar of Nato was heard repeatedly, and even adopted byKeir Starmerin his speech pledging greater integration on defence with Europe. His Valentine’s Day speech to Europe was remarkable for two other reasons. He declared the Brexit era was over and, unlike Rubio, he praised societal diversity and a Britain where “people who look different to each other can live peacefully together”. So much for Rubio’s risk of civilisational erasure.But the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is due to go to China in April, said theera of US hegemony was coming to an end, and more quickly than many thought if the US believed it could act alone. “We don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism but in free trade. And we stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we are convinced that we can only solve global challenges together,” he said.Merz signalled Berlin was already preparing for a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the US. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer, left, Friedrich Merz and Emmanuel Macron, right, are about to discuss how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe as a whole.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPAThe dispute over Ukraine and Trump’s leniency towards Vladimir Putin still appals much of Europe and is at the centre of what is driving Trump and leaders on the continent apart. It was an American, Hillary Clinton, who expressed the anger best: “The effort that Putin and Trump are making to profit off the misery and death of the Ukrainian people is a historic error and corrupt to the nth degree … He’s betrayed the west. He’s betrayed human values.”The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now a leading contributor to European defence technology, said “war reveals forms of evil we did not expect” and asked why it was, he felt, Ukraine and not Russia being asked by Trump to make the concessions. He admitted he felt keenly the mistake of Europe’s absence at the negotiating table.Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, further made the point. He said it was natural for the US to take the lead in the negotiations when it was providing the bulk of the military assistance. “But we are now paying for this war. The US outlay for the war last year was close to zero. We are buying the weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no prospect of a package in Congress. If we are paying, and it is affecting our security and not just Ukraine’s, we deserve a seat at the table.”Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, rebuked Mark Rutte, theNatosecretary general, for telling Europe to dream on if it thought it could defend itself without the US.At one level, the US and Europe vehemently agree that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own conventional defence. Elbridge Colby, the deputy secretary for war and the nearest thing the Trump administration has to a theoretician, said: “People get it, 2025 was the year to reframe and reorient, and now we have a lot of buy-in. Look at what Germany has been doing with a massive increase in spending.”But what the US and Europe have only started to debate is what this more independent Europe will be permitted to do by the US. For the moment an interregnum exists.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in a speech that lost some impact owing to its late scheduling, was the one who spelled out the wider consequences of Europe becoming its own protector. With new responsibilities came new rights, some of which Trump may dislike.Not only did Europe deserve a place at the Ukraine negotiating table, since it was Europe’s existential challenge, it had a right to speak to Putin directly apart from the US, Macron said. Ideally, the US should be weaned off its belief that a just deal is acceptable in the short term.In any negotiations about what may replace the collapsed arms control agreements with Russia, Europe could not again be a bystander while the US unilaterally withdrew from agreements such as the INF treaty. He had learned of the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in the newspapers, as did all allies, Macron complained.Starmer stresses ‘urgency’ of closer defence ties with Europe at Munich conferenceRead moreMacron argued that to be credible at such a negotiation, Europe needed better deep strike capacities to match those of Russia. European defence firms should not be browbeaten into buying US military hardware. “We will be credible only if we are able to procure and produce what we need, without foreign strings attached.”Europe could strengthen its own rules on tech and AI. It would be “crazy” if free speech meant giving “the mind, the brain, the heart of my teenagers to the algorithm of big guys with whom I’m not totally sure I share their values”, he said.Above all, Macron, Merz and Starmer referenced the deeply sensitive discussions on which they are to embark as to how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe, thus reducing the need for the US nuclear umbrella. It is a hugely expensive and politically fraught undertaking.Merz made a brief but deliberate reference to the initial talks he had held with Macron, and in an article for Foreign Affairs he said he hoped to agree the first concrete steps this year. Macron was also an enthusiast, pointing to the cooperation with Britain.If European sovereignty ever extends this far it will make the US uncomfortable. But it is a sign of the times that it is on the agenda. Yesterday is truly over.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsEuropeNatoMarco RubioFriedrich MerzKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronanalysisShareReuse this content"

They set shops on fire and forced the whole village to flee,” Ibrahim said.He added that many villagers fear returning as the gunmen remain nearby.With Reuters and Agence France-PresseExplore more on these topicsNigeriaAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

He packed his bags and boarded a plane for the community 700 miles away. “I wanted to be here to bring some level of comfort,” he said. “I wanted to hug people, pray for them and, most importantly, to cry with them.”On Tuesday, a shooter opened fire in the town’s secondary school,killing eight people, most of them young children. It was one of the deadliest attacks in Canada’s history and has left the country reeling.But it has also elicited a wave of support for the British Columbia town from acrossCanada, in the form of civic resources, grief and trauma counsellors, therapy animals, food and donations. Hotels are fully booked, pushing new arrivals to towns more than a hour’s drive away.Caruso, who retired four years ago, worked as a paramedic, pastor and police chaplain – a career at the nexus of grief, tragedy and compassion that he said made him suited to the moment.“It’s hard but I’m wired for this. I spent my life with first responders. And so I know the police, firefighters, paramedics – they’re just wrecked. They’re destroyed,” he said. “But so are the people here in Tumbler Ridge. And how they’re cared for right now is so important.”On Friday, police said the shooter had been, “for lack of a better term, hunting”. Armed with two guns, “they were prepared and engaging anybody and everybody they could come in contact with”.Investigators have identified the suspect as Jesse Van Rootselaar. Police said Van Rootselaar is a transgender woman.The prime minister, Mark Carney, who travelled to Tumbler Ridge with other federal party leaders in a show of national unity, praised the heroism of first responders and the courage of students and teachers who had been trapped in the school as the shooter stalked the halls..View image in fullscreenMark Carney visits a makeshift memorial in Tumbler Ridge on Friday.Photograph: AFP/Getty Images“Standing here together in your home, we wanted you to hear that Canadians are with you and we will always be with you,” Carney said. “Whatever portion of your sadness that Canadians can bear to help you ease your heavy load, we will gladly do so.”‘What word is there for this?’ Tumbler Ridge reaches for unity in storm of griefRead moreCaruso said the grim details of the attack would add a layer to how counsellors and support workers would help victims and the broader community navigate the unpredictable and turbulent nature of grief.“It’s not like there was a car accident. It’s not like it’s a terminal illness. This was murder. Someone did this in cold blood. And as a result, something innocent was stolen,” he said. “I’ve learned over the years that life will go on. But it will also take a piece of you.”Caruso and his wife intend to spend the next months in town to help residents rebuild emotionally. “It’s hard to not to ask what if I had been here earlier, if we could have been here to bring compassion,” he said. “But there is hope. It might not feel like there is for the parents who lost their kids, or the victims that are gone. But there’s hope for those that remain. That’s what funerals are all about. It’s not for the person that’s gone. It’s for the people around you.”View image in fullscreenA sign reading ‘Tumbler Ridge Strong’ in the town on Saturday.Photograph: Christinne Muschi/APSpeaking at a vigil, Carney said Tumbler Ridge was defined by people who cared for each other. “You held each other – as you’re holding each other right now. This is grace. It’s what we do for each other; it’s what we receive from each other,” he said. “Open hearts when the world falls apart.”That the tragedy occurred in a community of less than 2,500 people means first responders knew the victims and not a single person was untouched by loss. In a part of the province known as the Peace region, when the residents of Tumbler Ridge hurt, the pain is felt deeply nearby.“I just wanted to be part of the solution and to do whatever I could to help people,” said Milo MacDonald, the city manager of nearby Fort St John, who had recently arrived in Tumbler Ridge with colleagues. “There’s an awful lot of people right now that want to help. They want to reduce suffering.”Neighbouring communities are sending large-scale resources and small gestures that have an outsized impact. MacDonald said lifeguards and skating technicians had been sent down from his community to ensure places such as the community swimming pool and ice rink could remain open for children.MacDonald, who worked as a police officer for 25 years, including relief stints in Tumbler Ridge, said he was devastated by the horror inflicted on a group of “genuinely good” people.“I experienced tragedies as a police officer, but never anything close to this magnitude,” he said. “And I’ll admit it’s incredibly hard because my sons are a similar age. My hope is that these kinds of things make us focus on our humanity and our common ground. In moments like this you need a confirmation of humanity.”View image in fullscreenA mother and son pay their respects at a memorial for the victims.Photograph: Christinne Muschi/APWhile the droves of people arriving from outside the community have overwhelmed the town’s infrastructure, their presence is nonetheless welcomed by residents.‘No words that capture the horror’: small Canada town shattered by mass school shootingRead moreLynn Way, 82, who has lived in the town for more than three decades, said: “When I lost my son not too long ago, I wanted to just shut the world out. I wanted to just die. He didn’t want a service but I had a get-together and people came from all over. People I didn’t even know. I knew then how much my son was loved. And they wanted to come and let me know. That’s what’s happening in this town right now.”Way said there was a “heaviness” in the air when she stepped outside, but Tumbler Ridge was still a safe town. “You can still leave your door unlocked. That hasn’t changed. This town will get through it, but those poor people that lost their children and their loved ones, it’s going to take longer. That’s a fact of life. All we can do is just say: ‘Hey, if you need something, I’m here for you.’”In recent days, a logo with mountain peaks and a red heart has appeared with the words Tumbler Ridge Strong, a nod to the collective resilience needed in the town and a confidence that it exists within each resident.“What feels so hard right now is that none of this is real,” Way said. “It won’t be real until the first funeral. Then you see the grief you never thought possible. When you lose someone close to you, it takes a year before you can really live with it. And you do. But you don’t ever forget. Ever.”Explore more on these topicsTumbler Ridge school shootingCanadaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Donald Trump ordered a quarantine of sanctioned tankers in December to pressure the president, Nicolás Maduro, before Maduro was apprehended in January during a US military operation.US military says it seized another Venezuela-linked oil tankerRead moreSeveral tankers fled the Venezuelan coast after the raid, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight. The defense department said in a post on X that US forces boarded the Veronica III, conducting “a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction and boarding”.The Pentagon said: “The vessel tried to defy President Trump’s quarantine – hoping to slip away,.

The Pentagon did not say whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control. It told the AP in an email that it had no additional information to provide beyond its post.Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II.

Already reeling from a four-year economic slump, worsened by hyper-inflation and the migration of nearly 20% of the population, the 67-year-old communist government is at its weakest. After Washington’s successful military operation against Cuba’s ally Venezuela at the beginning of January, the US administration is actively seeking regime change.The Guardian spoke to more than five top-level officials from different countries, and heard complaints that the US charge d’affaires, Mike Hammer, has failed to share any sort of detailed plan beyond bringing the island to a standstill by starving it of oil. One said: “There’s talk of human rights, and that this is the year Cuba changes – but little talk of what happens afterwards.”Some hope that rumoured high-level discussions in Mexico between the Cuban government – in the form of Gen Alejandro Castro Espín, son of Cuba’s 94-year-old former president Raúl Castro – and US officials might produce a deal, but as yet there are no signs of progress.Others hope that comments in Munich this weekend by Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, show that the US is willing to stop short of regime change. In an interview with Bloomberg, he said giving the people of Cuba “more freedom, not just political freedom but economic freedom,” was a “potential way forward”.But diplomats in Havana are preparing for an alternative tactic: the country being starved until people take to the streets and the US can step in. “We’re trying to keep a cool head,” said one ambassador. “Embassies are built on planning for the unexpected – hopefully before it becomes expected,” said another.Stoking concerns is news that lack of fuel is hampering the UN World Food Programme’s efforts to relieve suffering fromlast year’s Hurricane Melissa. The organisation, which keeps a low-key presence on the island, is now having to draw up plans for a new, far larger crisis. “We’re already seeing the impact in the availability of fresh produce in the cities,” said Étienne Labande, the WFP’s country director.Diplomats expressed concern at how fast the lack of fuel – for electricity, water and the transport of food – could cause extreme suffering. “It’s a matter of weeks,” said one. “The view is that people in rural villages like Viñales may be OK, but those in the cities would be at terrible risk.”View image in fullscreenThe lack of fuel means fewer cars on the roads and frequent power shortages. This barber uses hair clippers powered by a rechargeable battery.Photograph: Jason P HoweCuba’s latest crisis follows an executive order signed by Donald Trump in Januaryimposing tariffson any country supplying Cuba with oil. Despite outrage from Cuba’s traditional allies China and Russia, the threat has proved effective.Even Mexico, which last year supplanted Venezuela as the island’s largest supplier, has ceased sending tankers, although its president, Claudia Sheinbaum,warned of a humanitarian disasteron the island and sent 800 tons of aid. “No one can ignore the situation that the Cuban people are currently experiencing because of the sanctions that the United States is imposing in a very unfair manner,” she said on Tuesday.Cuba on the brink as Trump turns up the pressure: ‘There is going to be a real blockade’Read moreAt a party at the US residence on 28 January, Hammer referred to the 68-year US embargo on the island, telling guests: “The Cubans have complained for years about ‘the blockade’, but now there is going to be a real blockade.”He began a tour of eastern Cuba shortly afterwards, distributing US aid, during which small groups of government-backed protesters met him with abuse. He is now believed to be heading to Rome for discussions with the Vatican, increasingly a force on the island.A spokeswoman for the embassy said they regularly meet with diplomatic colleagues, but “We of course do not discuss the details of our meetings.”The consequences of the US oil blockade have arrived faster than anyone expected, adding to diplomats’ concerns. All three airlines flying tourists into Cuba from Canadasuspended their services this weekdue to a lack of aviation fuel on the island. Two Russian airlines followed. All five carriers have begun the process of repatriating travellers.Three-quarters of a million Canadians visited Cuba in 2025, by far the largest group. Russians are the third most numerous category of visitors, after Cuban expatriates. On Wednesday, the UK Foreign Office adjusted its travel advice to recommend only essential travel to the island.View image in fullscreenA man sells handmade bags to tourists in Havana.Photograph: Norlys Perez/ReutersAs the oil blockade’s crippling effect on the Cuban government’s ability to earn foreign exchange takes hold, Cubans outside the diplomatic enclaves have begun preparing for life without fuel. “It is starting to feel like the 1962 missile crisis,” said one. “The sun was shining then too, and people went about their business, under a cloud of anxiety.”Cuba’s government has already shut universities, secondary schools and non-essential state offices and pulled back on public transport in order to preserve resources.Adrian Rodriguez Suárez has been studying nuclear physics at Havana University. The 22-year-old is from Holguín, a city in Cuba’s east, but lives in student accommodation in East Havana. He has been told to head home to continue his studies by distance learning.“We heard the news on Thursday and since then, those who can have left,” he said. “Many are using their own means to get home. What worries me is the situation in my province. Although I like the idea of returning to my family, studying is going to be difficult. Outside Havana the electricity availability drops a lot.”Others have been taking to social media to express their worries. One Facebook user wrote: “I’m getting married in March and I was just advised that the weddings for that month will be cancelled. Does anyone have information?”Others try to help. “People with chemotherapy, dialysis and emergencies at Calixto hospital [in Havana] travel free,” posted a motorcycle taxi driver.Then there are those leaning into the situation. A man in La Lisa neighbourhood in Havana is making cast aluminium and galvanised zinc burners for people to cook over wood. At $8 for a single burner and $15 for a double, his tools are proving popular.“My mother is going crazy with this cooking on charcoal,” said a woman in the rural mid-Cuban town of Sancti Spíritus, who then asked to remain anonymous because otherwise she would have to “make a will to bequeath the charcoal stove to my daughter as her only inheritance”.Meanwhile, diplomats have been making plans to leave if the situation quickly deteriorates. “What is the point of us being here if we can’t work?” asked one. “We’re prepared, vigilant, and hoping common sense keeps winning a few rounds,” said another.In the centre of Havana, hotspots that have made the city one of the world’s most loved tourist destinations are falling quiet. Yarini is one of the hippest rooftop bars, named after a famously anti-American pimp of the early 1900s.Usually it seethes, but on a warm weekday night, only two tables were occupied. Neither of the groups turned out to be local people or regular tourists. Instead they were war correspondents taking a break from winter in Ukraine, in the hope of covering the fall of one of the world’s last communist states.Additional reporting by Eileen Sosin"

Images shared on social media showed vast semirural neighbourhoods submerged and collapsed sections of road where flood waters had receded.Extreme rainfall is more common and more intense because of human-caused climate breakdown across most of the world,particularly in Europe, most of Asia, central and eastern North America, and parts of South America, Africa and Australia. This is because warmer air can hold more water vapour. Flooding has most likely become more frequent and severe in these locations as a result, but is also affected by human factors, such as the existence of flood defences and land use.Six peoplewere killed in Januaryafter heavy rains triggered a landslide at Mount Maunganui on the North Island’s east coast, bringing down soil and rubble on a site crowded with families on summer holidays.Explore more on these topicsNew ZealandAsia PacificFloodingnewsShareReuse this content"

Rearmament is not warmongering; it is the responsible action of nations determined to protect their people and preserve peace,” they write.There is significant reluctance among voters in Britain and Germany to accept economic pain in return for rearmament, even while majorities in both countries believe the outbreak of a third world war is more likely than not in the next five years.In Britain,polling this month by YouGovfound that a minority favour tax rises (25%) or spending cuts (24%) to fund greater spending on the armed forces – including those who say it is very important to increase UK hard power.German and French voters are also now less likely than they were last year to support increased defence budgets if it meant a trade-off with other investment, according toa poll for Politicothis month.The UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, said at the weekend that there wasan urgent need for Britain to have a closer defence relationship with Europe, covering procurement and manufacturing, so that the UK would be at the centre of a stronger European defence setup.In a visit to the Munich Security Conference, he told the audience: “We are not the Britain of the Brexit years” as he argued that the long-term threat posed by Russia and the need for Europe to take greater responsibility for its own defence required the UK to integrate more closely on defence procurement with European allies.Europe was, he said, “a sleeping giant” but there had been fragmented industrial planning and procurementKnighton and Breuer write: “If Russia perceives Europe as weak or divided, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. We know that Russian aggression and intentions extend beyond Ukraine.”Echoing language used by government figures in Britain, Germany and other European states, Knighton and Breuer said the complexity of threats demanded a “an honest continent-wide conversation with our publics that defence cannot be the preserve of uniformed personnel alone”.They called for a “whole-of-society defence” with resilient infrastructure, research and development in technology from the private sector, and national institutions prepared to function under increasing threats.The UK and Germany have committed to deepening security and defence cooperation andsigned what became known as the Trinity House agreementin 2024.The German government is under pressure to meet its promise to revive economic growth after a prolonged downturn and to ramp up defence spending amid concerns over Russian aggression.Germany is permanently stationing a combat brigade of 4,000-5,000 troops to Nato’s eastern flank and has amended its constitution to make essentially unrestricted funding available for defence.Procurement of several thousand armoured vehicles has also started, alongside an expansion of industrial capacity.Britain is building as many as six munitions factories, which are aimed at generating what the Ministry of Defence describes as an “always on” capability to sustain munitions stockpiles.The debate about European security – almost four years after Vladimir Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and amid increasing ambiguity around the extent of US support for Nato after Donald Trump’s return to the White House – comes as the governments in Germany and the UK seek to rebalance spending after an era of investing a supposed “peace dividend” in public services.Nato leaders at last year’s summit in The Haguecommitted to spending 5% of GDP on defence and securityby 2035.Such a move would expand the British economy in the short term,according to research, but there is still opposition on the left of the Labour party to defence hikes at the cost of spending on health and alleviating poverty. That debate is even more polarised in Germany, with opposition to increased defence spending on the left and, to a degree, from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland party.Speaking on the opening day of the Munich conference, Germany’s chancellor, Friedrich Merz, singled out the threat Russia posed to Europe, warning “freedom can no longer be taken for granted”.“We have to understand that in the era of big powers, our freedom is no longer a given. It is at stake. We will need to show firmness and determination to assert this freedom,” he said.Merz also disclosed he had held initial talks with the French president, Emmanuel Macron, over the possibility of joining France’s nuclear umbrella, underlining his call for Europe to develop a stronger self-standing security strategy.Explore more on these topicsDefence policyGermanyRussiaEuropeMilitarynewsShareReuse this content"

The UK and its allies said Navalny could not have ingested the poison accidentally as it is not found in Russia and is generally produced only by the frogs in the wild.The five European countries have reported the Kremlin to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons after accusing Moscow of breaching its conventions.Cooper said the incident showed that “the cold war peace dividend we all believed in and hoped for has gone, and we need to be ready for Russian aggression continuing towards Europe”.She suggested further sanctions could follow. “We continue to look at coordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime. As you know, we have been pursuing this as part of our response to the brutal invasion of Ukraine, where we are also coming up to the fourth anniversary of that invasion as well.“We believe that it is the partnerships that we build abroad that make us stronger at home. It is by acting alongside our European allies, alongside allies across the world, that we do maintain that pressure on the Russian regime.”Noting that the government would continue to provide military support to Ukraine and remain vigilant towards other different, hybrid threats, Cooper added: “The other thing that I would say, specifically aboutAlexei Navalny, is one of the things he said was ‘tell the truth, spread the truth’, because that is the most dangerous weapon of all.”The US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said on Sunday that Washington had no reason to question the “troubling” conclusions of the five European allies.“We obviously are aware of the report. It’s a troubling report. We’re aware of that case of Mr Navalny and certainly … we don’t have any reason to question it,” Rubio told reporters at a news conference in Bratislava during a visit to Slovakia.When asked why the US had not joined the five countries in making a statement on their findings, Rubio said this was an endeavour by them. “Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. [It] doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn’t our endeavour. Sometimes countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they’ve gathered.”He added: “We’re not disputing or getting into a fight with these countries over it. But it was their report, and they put that out there.”The UK’s shadow foreign secretary, Priti Patel, warned of an “axis of authoritarianism” comprising Russia, China, North Korea and Iran faced by the UK and other western nations.Speaking on Sky News’s Sunday Morning With Trevor Phillips programme in advance of making a speech at the Munich Security Conference, the senior Conservative said the US remained a “natural ally” and partner for European powers.A statement from the Russian embassy in London denied any involvement in Navalny’s death. It said: “There is no reason whatsoever to credit such ‘findings’ by western ‘experts’. As withthe Skripal case, there are strident accusations, media hysteria, zero evidence, and a host of questions the accusers would rather ignore. So what was it in the end – poison derived from the skin of a South American frog or novichok?“We have become accustomed to the feeblemindedness of western fabulists. One must ask what kind of person would believe this nonsense about a frog. Yet what truly shocks is the method now favoured by western politicians – necro-propaganda. This is not a quest for justice but a mockery of the dead. Even after the death of the Russian citizen, London and the European capitals cannot allow him to rest in peace – a fact that speaks volumes about those who instigated this campaign.”Explore more on these topicsForeign policyYvette CooperRussiaVladimir PutinAlexei NavalnyEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

In fact, people still want to join our club, and not just fellow Europeans. In Canada, I was told over 40% of Canadians have an interest in joining the EU.”She challenged the US criticism of media freedom in Europe, pointing out that her own country, Estonia, ranked second in the world press freedom index and the US 58th. Given the EU’s record on human rights, she said, she found some of the criticisms very hard to take.“We are, you know, pushing humanity forward, trying to defend human rights and all this, which is actually bringing also prosperity for people. So that’s why it’s very hard for me to believe these accusations.”Kallas, a fierce opponent of Russia, has repeatedly clashed with the Trump administration. She said she did not think the EU was ready to give Ukraine a date for membership, suggesting accession as early as 2027 is unrealistic.The previous day, Rubio made an emotional but highly conditional offer of a new partnership, insisting the two continents belonged together and describing America as “a child of Europe”.In a much-anticipated speech, he said the US was intent on building a new world order, adding: “While we are prepared, if necessary, to do this alone, it is our preference and it is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe.”Offer to join Trump’s new era is met with growing sense of European steelinessRead moreAdmitting the Americans may come across as a little direct and urgent, he said this was only because the US was profoundly concerned by the fate of Europe and knew their destinies were intertwined.Rubio travelled to Bratislava in Slovakia after the conference where he skirted around why the US intelligence agencies had not been involved in the report prepared by five European intelligence agencies, including the UK’s, that found the Russian opposition leaderAlexei Navalny had been poisoned. The agencies concluded he was poisoned with a toxin derived from dart frogs found in South America, and accused the Russian state of being responsible.View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio, left, gives a press conference alongside Slovakia’s prime minister, Robert Fico, on Sunday.Photograph: Zuzana Gogova/Getty ImagesWhen asked why the US had not joined the statement, Rubio said this had been an endeavour by the agencies. “Those countries came to that conclusion. They coordinated that. We chose – doesn’t mean we disagree with the outcome. We just, it wasn’t our endeavour. Sometimes, countries go out and do their thing based on the intelligence they’ve gathered,” Rubio said.Keir Starmer said on Saturday that cooperation between the UK and the US on intelligence was closer than ever.Explore more on these topicsEuropean UnionEuropeMarco RubioUS foreign policyNatonewsShareReuse this content"

But his speech was a stern warning that if Europe wanted to continue on its path of civilisational decline, as this US administration sees it, America would not be interested and has different hemispheres on which to focus.“Yesterday is over,” he said, and then he spelled out what yesterday meant. Mass migration threatening civilisational erasure and the continuity of Christian culture, unfettered trade, massive welfare states, weak defences, climate cults, the outsourcing of sovereignty to international institutions, the rationalisation of a broken status quo by people “shackled with guilt and shame”. Unlike Vance, he did not laud rightwing European populist parties, but he nonetheless wrapped himself in their ideology. His next stop after Munich was Budapest, whereViktor Orbán faces a battlein April to remain in power.And yet there were some, such as the organiser of the conference, the distinguished German diplomat Wolfgang Ischinger, who claimed to be reassured by the conditional offer to join this journey into a new era with Donald Trump. If Europeans were reassured by Rubio, it was, as Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, observed, “a classic example of the soft bigotry of low expectations”. One reference by the US secretary of state to his country being “a child of Europe” and the older romantics of transatlanticism melted.But that was not the dominant European mood at this sprawling conference. An iron has entered the European soul about Trump, egged on by the many Democrats attending, and there is a willingness if not to confront him then at least to end the dependence and learn the lessons of thestandoff over Greenland.1:52Danish PM believes Trump still wants Greenland – videoTalk of a stronger independent European pillar of Nato was heard repeatedly, and even adopted byKeir Starmerin his speech pledging greater integration on defence with Europe. His Valentine’s Day speech to Europe was remarkable for two other reasons. He declared the Brexit era was over and, unlike Rubio, he praised societal diversity and a Britain where “people who look different to each other can live peacefully together”. So much for Rubio’s risk of civilisational erasure.But the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who is due to go to China in April, said theera of US hegemony was coming to an end, and more quickly than many thought if the US believed it could act alone. “We don’t believe in tariffs and protectionism but in free trade. And we stand by climate agreements and the World Health Organization because we are convinced that we can only solve global challenges together,” he said.Merz signalled Berlin was already preparing for a smaller American footprint in Europe, and that Germany may at times diverge from the US. “We Europeans are taking precautions. In doing so, we arrive at different conclusions than the administration in Washington,” he said.View image in fullscreenKeir Starmer, left, Friedrich Merz and Emmanuel Macron, right, are about to discuss how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe as a whole.Photograph: Kay Nietfeld/EPAThe dispute over Ukraine and Trump’s leniency towards Vladimir Putin still appals much of Europe and is at the centre of what is driving Trump and leaders on the continent apart. It was an American, Hillary Clinton, who expressed the anger best: “The effort that Putin and Trump are making to profit off the misery and death of the Ukrainian people is a historic error and corrupt to the nth degree … He’s betrayed the west. He’s betrayed human values.”The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, now a leading contributor to European defence technology, said “war reveals forms of evil we did not expect” and asked why it was, he felt, Ukraine and not Russia being asked by Trump to make the concessions. He admitted he felt keenly the mistake of Europe’s absence at the negotiating table.Radosław Sikorski, the Polish foreign minister, further made the point. He said it was natural for the US to take the lead in the negotiations when it was providing the bulk of the military assistance. “But we are now paying for this war. The US outlay for the war last year was close to zero. We are buying the weapons to be delivered to Ukraine. There is no prospect of a package in Congress. If we are paying, and it is affecting our security and not just Ukraine’s, we deserve a seat at the table.”Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, rebuked Mark Rutte, theNatosecretary general, for telling Europe to dream on if it thought it could defend itself without the US.At one level, the US and Europe vehemently agree that Europe should take greater responsibility for its own conventional defence. Elbridge Colby, the deputy secretary for war and the nearest thing the Trump administration has to a theoretician, said: “People get it, 2025 was the year to reframe and reorient, and now we have a lot of buy-in. Look at what Germany has been doing with a massive increase in spending.”But what the US and Europe have only started to debate is what this more independent Europe will be permitted to do by the US. For the moment an interregnum exists.Emmanuel Macron, the French president, in a speech that lost some impact owing to its late scheduling, was the one who spelled out the wider consequences of Europe becoming its own protector. With new responsibilities came new rights, some of which Trump may dislike.Not only did Europe deserve a place at the Ukraine negotiating table, since it was Europe’s existential challenge, it had a right to speak to Putin directly apart from the US, Macron said. Ideally, the US should be weaned off its belief that a just deal is acceptable in the short term.In any negotiations about what may replace the collapsed arms control agreements with Russia, Europe could not again be a bystander while the US unilaterally withdrew from agreements such as the INF treaty. He had learned of the US withdrawal from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in the newspapers, as did all allies, Macron complained.Starmer stresses ‘urgency’ of closer defence ties with Europe at Munich conferenceRead moreMacron argued that to be credible at such a negotiation, Europe needed better deep strike capacities to match those of Russia. European defence firms should not be browbeaten into buying US military hardware. “We will be credible only if we are able to procure and produce what we need, without foreign strings attached.”Europe could strengthen its own rules on tech and AI. It would be “crazy” if free speech meant giving “the mind, the brain, the heart of my teenagers to the algorithm of big guys with whom I’m not totally sure I share their values”, he said.Above all, Macron, Merz and Starmer referenced the deeply sensitive discussions on which they are to embark as to how France and the UK could make their nuclear deterrents available to Europe, thus reducing the need for the US nuclear umbrella. It is a hugely expensive and politically fraught undertaking.Merz made a brief but deliberate reference to the initial talks he had held with Macron, and in an article for Foreign Affairs he said he hoped to agree the first concrete steps this year. Macron was also an enthusiast, pointing to the cooperation with Britain.If European sovereignty ever extends this far it will make the US uncomfortable. But it is a sign of the times that it is on the agenda. Yesterday is truly over.Explore more on these topicsWorld newsEuropeNatoMarco RubioFriedrich MerzKeir StarmerEmmanuel MacronanalysisShareReuse this content"

It said one more person was killed after Israeli shelling in Gaza City, while one person was killed by Israeli gunfire in Beit Lahia.Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, accused Israel of committing a new massacre against displaced Palestinians, calling it a serious breach of the ceasefire days before the first meeting of Donald Trump’sBoard of Peace.Trump urged Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for postwar Gaza on Sunday and said members of the Board of Peace had pledged $5bn (£3.7bn) towards the Palestinian territory’s reconstruction.Despite a US-brokered truce thatentered its second phaselast month, violence has continued in Gaza, with Israel and Hamas accusing each other of violating the agreement.Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed they had received the bodies of at least seven people.“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabaliya attack, told Agence France-Presse. He said the people killed there were hit as they slept.“We’ve been living under a truce for months and they’ve still targeted us.

Men and women stood in prayer before the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.A military official said Israeli forces attacked in response to Hamas violations of the ceasefire agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, which took effect on 10 October, Israeli troops withdrew to positions behind a so-calledyellow line, although they remain in control of more than half the territory.“The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area,” the official said.Bitter dispute between Trump and EU over Gaza’s future breaks out into the openRead more“Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed is an explicit ceasefire violation and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops.”Israel has unilaterally moved the yellow line deeper into Gaza even though Israeli withdrawals are part of the ceasefire deal, and Hamas has so far rejected demands to lay down its weapons, also part of the plan. Israel has said it will have to force Hamas to disarm if it does not do so voluntarily.Gaza’s health ministry has said at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began. The Israeli military said at least four of its soldiers had been killed in the same period.Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsGazaPalestineIsraelHamasMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It said more than 53,845 people had been arrested.The Iranian opposition remains divided and Pahlavi has faced criticism for his support for Israel and making a highly publicised visit in 2023 that fractured an attempt to unify opposition camps.

Seven-month-old Briana slept on her lap, her breathing soft and uneven. On the other side of the screen was Mohan Karki, Basnet’s husband, who had yet to hold his daughter.For Karki, nearly 9,000 miles (14,500km) away, it was already morning. He was in hiding in south Asia, his exact location withheld for his safety, his face breaking into pixels as he watched his daughter sleep.“I feel like a ghost,” Karki said in Nepali. “Living in the shadows. No home, no name, not even an identity card that says I belong anywhere.”Karki, 30, was deported toBhutanon 13 January, after more than nine months in detention and a series of legal battles led by his wife and his attorneys in a final effort to stop his removal. Although Karki is stateless, his parents are Bhutanese, a distinction that has little bearing on his lived reality. He has never lived in Bhutan; he was born in a refugee camp in Nepal, and returning there exposes him to the risk of persecution and renewed statelessness.Human rights advocatessay this case reflects a broader and troubling pattern under the Trump administration, which has increasingly deported people – including refugees – to countries with which they have little or no connection, oftenplacing their lives in danger. For years, Bhutan had refused to repatriate Bhutanese refugees, and no public repatriation agreement between the two countries exists, according to Aisa Villarosa, an attorney with theAsian Law Caucus, also involved in ongoing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) litigation tied to the removal of Bhutanese refugees.“When you see a sudden shift in removal practices like this, it usually signals that some kind of government-to-government understanding exists,” Villarosa said. “What we’re trying to learn is what that understanding looks like.”John Sifton, Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch, said Bhutan was not a country where deported refugees can legally remain. Recent reports from the organization describe ongoinghuman rights violationsagainst Nepali-speaking political prisoners, documenting conditions it called dire and alleging that detainees continue toface torture and denial of fair trials.“It’s not safe to be a stateless person,” Sifton said. Refugees sent back to Bhutan are often pushed across the Indian border within days, leaving themstranded without nationality. “That is an inherently risky and dangerous status to have.”Sifton continued: “The idea that the US government would now say the place they were expelled from is safe contradicts two decades of US policy.”An advocacy group estimates that at least 70 Bhutanese refugees have effectively vanished into statelessness, some now in hiding, othersstranded in legal limboafter being sent to a country that does not recognize them as citizens.Four days after delivering her baby, Basnet traveled from their home in a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, to Detroit, where Karki was held in detention. She spoke with lawyers between feedings and appeared at Nepali community gatherings and on podcasts and Facebook livestreams to ask for help in broken English.“Motherhood and crisis,” she said, “arrived at the same moment, and neither waited.”For Basnet, the deportation of her husband feels both personal and historical. “He doesn’t have a home there,” she said of Bhutan. “He doesn’t have family. He doesn’t speak the language. It feels like the history of expulsion is repeating itself, and no one seems to realize it.”That history for Basnet and Karki traces back to the early 1990s, when more than100,000 ethnic Nepali-speaking Bhutanese were forcedout of the country during a state-led campaign that stripped them of citizenship and property.“What we are seeing now in the United States is not new for many Nepali-speaking Bhutanese,” said Robin Gurung, co-executive director of Asian Refugees United, an advocacy organization supporting deported Bhutanese refugees. “Back then, the government decided who was worthy of citizenship based solely on ethnicity.”Both Karki’s and Basnet’s families eventually resettled in refugee camps in eastern Nepal, where tens of thousands of displaced Bhutanese lived for decades. “Life in the camp was depressing,” Karki said. “We didn’t have enough food. We didn’t feel safe.” Even there, he said, he found small ways to hold onto childhood: “I loved playing soccer with my friends. That made me happy.”In early 2008, under the George W Bush administration, the US began a large-scaleresettlement program for Bhutanese refugees. By the end of Barack Obama’s second term, more than85,000 Bhutanese refugees had been resettledin the US, including both Karki’s and Basnet’s families. Karki’s family arrived in Georgia in 2011. That same year, Basnet’s family resettled in Ohio.“What I liked about Georgia, about America, was the abundance,” Karki said. “I convinced my father that once I finished high school, I wanted to join the US army, to give back to this country, and my father was OK with that decision.”That dream unraveled less than two years after his arrival. In February 2013, Karki, who was 17 then, and two friends were arrested in Georgia and charged withburglary, criminal trespassing and interference with government property.Karki has disputed the intent behind the incident.“We were just trying to get home quickly after school,” he said. “One of my friends said we could jump the fence as a shortcut. We didn’t know you could get in trouble for walking onto someone else’s property.”According to court transcripts reviewed by the Guardian, prosecutors alleged that jewelry was taken from the residence. The case did not go to trial, and no witness testified to seeing a burglary or theft. The only eyewitness account referenced involved someone who reported seeing individuals jump a fence.Karki said he accepted a plea deal. “My lawyer told me if I agreed to the plea, I could go home that day,” he said. “If I didn’t, I might stay in prison for 25 years.”Brian Hoffman, Karki’s immigration attorney, said the exchange reflected a common failure at the intersection of criminal and immigration law. “If your own lawyer is telling you, ‘This is a good deal, you should plead guilty,’ you’re not really listening to warnings about immigration consequences,” Hoffman said.Cases like Karki’s, Hoffman added, reveal the brutal mechanics of the system. Crimes that may be minor under state law can be reclassified as “aggravated felonies” for immigration purposes, triggering mandatory detention and deportation. “It doesn’t make any objective sense,” Hoffman said. “But that’s the system.”In August 2014, an immigration judge ordered Karki’s removal from the US. He was detained for about a month, then released under supervision after neither Bhutan nor Nepal accepted him. According to court documents reviewed by the Guardian andreporting from NPR, Karki was then released under anorder of supervision, a status that allowed him to remain in the US under regular monitoring by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Karki maintained regular ICE check-ins, earned his GED and worked at a meat-processing plant in Georgia. In 2021, while visiting family near Columbus, he met Basnet at a local gym.They exchanged smiles and left without speaking. Later that evening, Basnet received a Facebook message from him. Their community, she explained, was small and tightly connected. A mutual friend had told Karki who she was.Late-night phone calls followed. They traded voice notes, TikTok videos and long conversations that stretched past midnight. Within a year, Karki moved to Ohio to be closer to her and his family.Her parents initially opposed the relationship, worried about Karki’s immigration status, his education and his unstable employment. “They wanted me to marry someone with higher education, someone with a steady job,” Basnet said.Karki was required to report regularly to immigration authorities to renew his work authorization, a process that often left him in limbo. Delays in paperwork made steady employment difficult. “I couldn’t keep a stable job,” he said. “Sometimes they delayed my permit.” He was eventually able to get his license to drive a commercial truck.The couple eloped in December 2023.“I knew it wouldn’t be easy for us,” Basnet said. “I knew I might have to carry a lot on my own. But I couldn’t love anyone else. He loved me deeply, and I knew he would make me happy for the rest of my life.”Asked whether she ever feared his deportation, Basnet said she believed the risk had passed years earlier. “We knew they tried to deport him in 2014, and neither Bhutan nor Nepal accepted him,” she said. “He was born in a refugee camp. He had nowhere else to go. I felt confident they wouldn’t deport him.”“He followed every rule,” Basnet said. “I thought he was safe.”The sense of safety Karki and Basnet had built was short-lived. After Trump won the 2024 election on a promise ofmass deportation, reports began circulating thatBhutanese refugees were being picked up as ICEexpanded enforcement in immigrant communities across the country.Only months earlier, the couple had been planning a future. They had saved nearly $20,000 for a down payment on a home. “We wanted a small place of our own,” Basnet said. “A room for our future kids.” Within days, everything changed.On 2 April 2025, the couple drove to what they believed would be a routine ICE check-in. When they arrived, an agent told Karki to return on 8 April instead. “I knew something was off,” Basnet said.“We hired an attorney that morning,” Basnet said. “Our friends told us that sometimes bringing a lawyer can stop ICE from detaining you.”It didn’t.“When we walked in, they called my husband’s name,” Basnet said. “Before he could even step forward, agents grabbed him and handcuffed him.”Basnet and his attorney were ordered to wait outside. Minutes later, an agent returned and told them Karki would be transferred to the Butler county detention center and processed for deportation to Bhutan.“I told them immediately he’s not from Bhutan,” Basnet said. “If he’s deported there, he’s not safe.” The agent responded that the decision came from higher authorities and that travel documents had already been issued by Bhutan.Travel documents reviewed by the Guardian show that Bhutan has accepted deportees only as “non-Bhutanese”, a designation that does not guarantee residency rights or legal status inside the country. (The Guardian sought comment from Bhutan’s UN ambassador on the deportation agreement and travel documents, but received no response.)In a statement, the UN refugee agency said deported Bhutanese refugees remained legally stateless because Bhutan did not recognize them as citizens and no other country claimed them as nationals. Returning stateless people to a country that refuses to recognize them creates a precarious situation, the agency warned. When asked whether it had communicated those concerns directly to theTrump administration, the agency declined to comment. (The Department of Homeland Security and ICE have not responded to requests for comment.)Karki was transferred to St Clair county jail in Detroit on 9 June 2025, as his family, attorneys and advocates fought for his release. “They treated us worse than animals,” Karki said. He said he requested to see an eye doctor because he had a prescription for glasses: “I asked the ICE nurse. They told me they would arrange it, but it never happened.”He also described harassment from other people incarcerated there. “People in jail targeted those of us detained for immigration,” he said. “They called us ‘illegal’ and all kinds of things.”After more than six months of legal challenges, including ahabeas petition denied in December,he was deported to Bhutan on 13 January – placed on a commercial flight to Newark, then to New Delhi. Villarosa said many Bhutanese refugees were being deported on commercial flights in what she described as a covert process that makes it “next to impossible” to track how many people have been removed. The Guardian reached out to Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, involved in the flights, for comment regarding concerns raised by human rights groups. Neither airline responded by publication time.When Karki landed in India, he said, local authorities escorted him through the airport. The next day, he was placed on a flight to Bhutan.“I had no documents with me,” Karki said. “No ID to prove who I was.”When Karki’s plane landed in Paro, he said, the weight of that history finally caught up with him.“That’s when it felt real,” he said. “I grew up hearing stories of torture from my family and elders. When I stepped onto that ground, I thought I was going to die.” He said Bhutanese officials gave him two options on arrival: prison, or a taxi to the Indian border.He remains stateless, like many of the refugees deported before him.Each day, he calls Basnet. They talk. They cry. Sometimes they laugh. She continues to campaign for his return while raising their daughter alone. Basnet works full-time and often takes extra shifts while she organizes, calls lawyers and speaks at community events.“I work as much as I can,” she said. “Sometimes I leave my daughter with family and friends so I can keep fighting this.”Asked whether she is exhausted, Basnet shook her head.“I’m fighting for my family,” she said. “For my husband. For the future of my daughter that’s being stolen by the government.”Explore more on these topicsUS immigrationICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)BhutanNepalSouth and central AsiaTrump administrationfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It means that any changes to children’s use of social media, which may include other measures such as restricting infinite scrolling, could happen as soon as this summer.But the Conservatives dismissed the government’s claim to be acting quickly as “more smoke and mirrors” given the consultation has not yet started.“Claiming they are taking ‘immediate action’ is simply not credible when their so-called urgent consultation does not even exist,” said Laura Trott, the shadow education secretary. “Labour have repeatedly said they do not have a view on whether under-16s should be prevented from accessing social media. That is not good enough. I am clear that we should stop under-16s accessing these platforms.”The moves come after the online regulator Ofcom admitted it lacked powers to act against Grok because images and videos that are created by a chatbot without it searching the internet are not in the scope of the existing laws, unless it amounts to pornography. The change to bring AI chatbots under the Online Safety Act could happen within weeks, although the loophole has been known about for more than two years.“Technology is moving really fast, and the law has got to keep up,” said Starmer. “The action we took on Grok sent a clear message that no platform gets a free pass. Today we are closing loopholes that put children at risk, and laying the groundwork for further action.”Companies that breach the Online Safety Act can face punishments of up to 10% of global revenue and regulators can apply to courts to block their connection in the UK.If AI chatbots are used specifically as search engines, to produce pornography or operate in user-to-user contexts, they are already covered by the act. But they can be used to create material that encourages people to self-harm or take their own lives, or even generate child sexual abuse material, without facing sanction. That is the loophole the government says it wants to close.The chief executive of the NSPCC, Chris Sherwood, said young people were contacting its helpline reporting harms caused by AI chatbots and that he did not trust tech companies to design them safely.In one case, a 14-year-old girl who talked to an AI chatbot about her eating habits and body dysmorphia was given inaccurate information. In others, they have seen “young people who are self-harming even having content served up to them of more self-harming”.“Social media has produced huge benefits for young people, but lots of harm,” Sherwood said. “AI is going to be that on steroids if we’re not careful.”OpenAI, the $500bn San Francisco startup behind ChatGPT, one of the UK’s most popular chatbots, and xAI, which makes Grok, were approached for comment.Since the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine took his own life after, his family allege, “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”, OpenAI has launched parental controls and is rolling out age-prediction technology to restrict access to potentially harmful content.The government is also to consult on forcing social media platforms to make it impossible for users to send and receive nude images of children – a practice that is already illegal.Liz Kendall, the technology secretary, said: “We will not wait to take the action families need, so we will tighten the rules on AI chatbots and we are laying the ground so we can act at pace on the results of the consultation on young people and social media.”The Molly Rose Foundation, which was set up by the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who killed herself after viewing harmful content online, called the steps “a welcome downpayment”. But it called on the prime minister to commit to a new Online Safety Act “that strengthens regulation and makes clear that product safety and children’s wellbeing is the cost of doing business in the UK”.In the UK, theNSPCCoffers support to children on 0800 1111, and adults concerned about a child on 0808 800 5000.

The report contained allegations about Gabriel Pogrund and Harry Yorke, journalists at the paper, which then spread around Westminster.The paper reported that Tom Harper, Apco’s senior director and a former Sunday Times employee, wrote that he had examined the “sourcing, funding and origins of the Sunday Times story” using documents and “discreet human source enquiries”.Harper was said to have made “baseless claims” that the emails underpinning the published story were likely to have come from a suspected Kremlin hack of the Electoral Commission.“The likeliest culprit is the Russian state, or proxies of the Russian state,” he reportedly wrote. Apco’s report was also said to have referred to Pogrund’s Jewish background and made baseless allegations about his faith, upbringing and personal and professional relationships.Get in touchContact us about this storyThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.

No other British journalists were investigated in any document he or Labour Together ever received, Simons said.The Conservative party chair, Kevin Hollinrake, said that Labour Together’s behaviour showed “a contempt for the free press”.“With its close and widely known links to the heart of government, serious questions must be answered about who was aware of these actions, including whether senior figures around the prime minister knew,” he said.Alison Phillips, the former Daily Mirror editor who joined Labour Together as chief executive three months ago, emailed its staff on Sunday evening.She said: “As a former journalist and editor, it should come as no surprise that I was horrified that investigators hired by Labour Together would look into the background and sources of reporters even if I am assured that this was not the intention.”The focus had to be on the future, and the organisation was “under new leadership”, she added.John McDonnell, the veteran Labour backbencher and former shadow chancellor, said on Saturday he had written three times in recent weeks to the general secretary of the Labour party to call for an independent inquiry into the affair.“I copied Keir Starmer into each request,” McDonnell said. “Clear to me as secretary of the NUJ’s parliamentary group if true this is unacceptable.”Another Labour MP, Karl Turner, said the prime minister needed to look into the affair himself and should meet McDonnell to discuss it.The contract showed that Simons asked for information specifically on the sources for a book by Paul Holden about McSweeney’s role in Starmer’s rise, as well as related articles by the US journalist Matt Taibbi.Explore more on these topicsLabourKeir StarmerNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesThinktanksnewsShareReuse this content"

Russell was on bail after allegedly assaulting Madden – he was banned from contacting her – but the conversation took place nevertheless.There was a witness to the call who gave evidence to the inquest into Madden’s death. Mason Jones, a friend of Madden’s, said Russell was “vile” and “abusive”. Although Jones said he could not remember the exact words Russell used, he said: “I recall Jon saying at least once that he was in control of the town and would end her life if she didn’t do it herself.”In evidence, Russell denied saying this, but he did admit he had encouraged Madden to kill herself before this.In the days leading up to Madden’s death, her mother, Bernadette Sutton, had told police and social services that she was concerned about the threat Russell posed to her daughter. “By this point, I thought he would kill her or she would take her own life,” Sutton said, in a statement.Nigel Parsley, the coroner, concluded that Madden died by suicide while the balance of her mind was disturbed, but he also cited her relationship with Russell, with whom she had two children, as a contributory factor.“Kate’s toxic relationship, in conjunction with Kate’s known mental health conditions, affected her state of mind and therefore contributed to her death,” he said.The circumstances surrounding Madden’s death are no doubt tragic, but they are also an example of an increasingly controversial area of UK justice, one which has been described as a blind spot in the law’s ability to see the growing numbers of suicides among domestic abuse victims as something more: evidence of potential crimes.Analysis seen by the Guardian suggests that growing numbers of victims of domestic violence are taking their own lives. Campaigners are now calling for the circumstances that led to these deaths to be investigated.View image in fullscreenGeorgia Barter’s death was judged by a coroner to be an unlawful killing.The Guardian recently reported onthe case of Georgia Barter, whose suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be unlawful killing – only the second time in English legal history that such a conclusion has been reached. Despite this, no police investigation into Bignell’s role in Barter’s death has ever been launched and the Crown Prosecution Service says there is insufficient evidence to bring charges.Inquests have a different burden of proof to criminal courts, finding on the balance of probabilities, rather than the criminal threshold of beyond reasonable doubt. There is no criminal due process and nobody is convicted or acquitted.In Katie Madden’s case, although the coroner acknowledged that a toxic relationship contributed to her death, he did not make any finding of unlawful killing. Almost two years on, Madden’s family say Russell has not been investigated in relation to any of the inquest findings or any alleged abuse. This is despite admitting at the inquest that he gave Madden a black eye weeks before she died.Police closed the assault investigation just days after Madden was found hanged at her home in Lowestoft, Suffolk. “The idea that it would just be dropped because she died – it should never be the case,” her mother says.‘Her happy ever after’“You just couldn’t have wished for a better mum and person,” Sutton says of her daughter. “She was very generous. She would give anybody her last penny. She would give anybody a lift.”Growing up, Sutton remembers her daughter as a “bundle of fun and a very lively girl” who often had her head in a book. It was when Madden was about 12 that Sutton noticed a “massive change” in her daughter. “She wouldn’t get out of bed,” Sutton says. “She wouldn’t tell me anything.” Much later, Sutton discovered Madden had been sexually abused.As her teenage years passed, Madden began drinking heavily and going missing. Sutton felt powerless to protect her daughter and she spent a brief period in care. At 16, she dropped out of school after becoming pregnant with her first child, she began self-harming and using cannabis. She also tried to take an overdose – her first attempt at suicide.She was diagnosed with anxiety, depression, borderline personality disorder and emotionally unstable personality disorder. Sutton says Madden had spells of stability, was devoted to her children, and eventually got her own house in Lowestoft.However, she also recalls that many people “took advantage” of her daughter, using her home to drink alcohol and take drugs. “Most of Katie’s friends, I wouldn’t even call friends, I would call them acquaintances,” Sutton says. “She never really understood how vulnerable she was. I said to her: ‘Can you not see that these people are taking advantage of you and your roof over their heads?’”However, by late 2016, Sutton remembers Madden as being in a “good place”. It was then she met Russell. She told her mother she thought she had finally got her “happy ever after”.Throughout the course of our three-hour interview, Sutton refuses to say Russell’s name, describing him only as the “alleged perpetrator”. She recalls being uneasy in his company from the outset. When she first met her daughter’s new partner over a meal, she says she “wasn’t 100%” but tried to convince herself she was being overprotective. “Mothers sit on the fence to begin with,” she says.Madden soon fell pregnant with the couple’s first child, who was born in 2018. It was around this time she received a disclosure through Clare’s law, otherwise known as the domestic violence disclosure scheme, warning Madden of Russell’s past.At Madden’s inquest, Russell agreed that he had “significant previous involvement” with the police, including one conviction for “physically assaulting a woman”.A referral was made to a multi-agency safeguarding hub in light of the Clare’s law disclosure but the case was closed before any safety planning took place. In evidence, a senior social worker from Suffolk county council’s adult social services said this was because it looked like “a misdirected referral” as it did not indicate Madden “was subject to abuse or a crime”.In a statement, the local authority said “lessons were learned by all agencies” after Madden’s death and added that it had “strengthened” its referral process “ensuring that safeguarding concerns about parents and children are shared promptly and appropriately” between departments. The council also said it had introduced “domestic abuse workers with dedicated training to better support adults in a child’s life who may be experiencing domestic violence”.Madden had a second child with Russell in 2020. From this point, Sutton recalls, their relationship was “on and off”, something she remembers her daughter found hard to navigate. “Katie fell in love, this was her happy ever after,” Sutton says. “And suddenly it’s all [fallen] apart for a number of reasons.”The next few years were punctuated by mental health crises. In November 2021, Madden spent four weeks in intensive care after crashing her car into a brick wall, scared her children would be removed from her. In June 2022, she asked for the children to be taken into care. “Katie’s children were her everything, but she felt that she was fighting so many battles,” Sutton says. A clinical psychologist suggested Madden would benefit from specialist cognitive behavioural therapy but she never received funding for it from any of the public services she was in touch with.Sutton told the inquest that during this time, Madden was “fenced off” by Russell, and would sometimes spend days in bed without her phone as Russell “would smash it”. The inquest was also told that, in February 2023, Russell struck Madden on the face with her phone. Two months later, the court heard, Madden arrived at a contact meeting with her children with a cut to her eye and told Sutton she had been assaulted by Russell after a night out.At the inquest, Russell accepted he had given Madden a black eye. He had been arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and forbidden from contacting her.In the weeks that followed, Madden’s mental health problems spiralled. On 3 June, Sutton contacted her daughter to make arrangements for a picnic in the park with her children. Madden simply replied with a love heart.The following evening, Sutton’s doorbell rang. It was a police officer. She knew instinctively what had happened. “I told her that she didn’t need to tell me,” Sutton says. “I told her what she’d come for.”‘I said, go kill yourself’Mason Jones was one of the last people to see Madden alive. In a statement, he told the inquest that he had only been friendly with her for about a month before she died. On the morning of 3 June, he recalled waking up to a string of messages from Madden, who seemed upset by some social media posts suggesting that Russell was with another woman in a hotel. At 7am, Madden and Jones went on a drive. Jones said he wanted to buy drugs to manage pain related to a medical condition.Jones recalled that Russell “seemed to instigate” contact with Madden, despite his bail conditions. In his evidence, Russell claimed Madden called him. In response to Jones’s allegation that Russell said he was “in control of the town and would end [Madden’s] life if she didn’t do it herself”, Russell became agitated. “I didn’t say that,” he replied. “Get me the evidence … I wouldn’t say that. I’m a father. Why would I say that?”He was asked by the coroner what the “general contents” of the call were. He said: “It was very erratic at the start. She was crying … she was just very panicky … I tried to reassure her but then it escalated into an argument. I ended up saying bad stuff.”The coroner asked if Russell had told Madden she should hang herself. “I didn’t say hang herself,” he said. “There was a couple of references where I said, go kill yourself. Instantly, I went back on myself, and said, don’t be silly, don’t do that.”Jones said he and Madden went to another friend’s house, where Madden “continued to argue” with Russell by phone before returning home. At about 12.45pm, she sent a message to Jones which read: “Thanks for putting up with me.”Later that afternoon, Joe Hart, a friend of Russell’s, visited Madden’s home as she was looking after his dog. He told the inquest that Russell had told him Madden had “a noose around her neck”, but said: “At the time, I didn’t think it was a serious statement.”Hart did not get a reply at Madden’s house. He threw an empty milkshake bottle at her bedroom window to try to get her attention but there was no response.Neither man alerted the police, or Madden’s family. Hart said this was “because of what Katie was like … she’d quite regularly go off the map after she’d been wrecked”.Russell disputed knowing Madden had a noose around her neck. He told the inquest: “She said that she was going to kill herself, she didn’t say she had a noose around her neck.”When Russell was asked if he had failed to raise the alarm because he wanted Madden dead, he said:“You shouldn’t be speaking like that. I’ve got two children with her. Come on, man, that’s wrong. I didn’t want her dead. I dream about her every single day.”Hart returned to the property at about 5pm on 4 June, the inquest heard. He said he contacted Russell, who encouraged him to break in if there was no response. When he entered the house, Hart found Madden hanged and called the emergency services.‘There is no better detective than a mother’On the way to Madden’s home, PC Bradley Congleton was told there was a history of domestic violence between Madden and Russell, which had culminated in a live assault investigation. He recovered Madden’s phone from the property. When he charged it, he told the inquest, he found messages from Russell encouraging Madden to kill herself.“There is no doubt in my mind, that is what he said to her,” Congleton said.Congleton’s focus appears to have been on preparing a timeline of what had happened at the actual scene. In his evidence, Congleton said he considered it a priority to trace Russell to check his movements. At first, Russell would only speak to Congleton through an open window, the officer said. He recalled Russell saying that Madden had told him in her last hours that she “didn’t want to be alive any more” and was “intoxicated through drink and drugs”. Russell told Congleton he had been concerned but not been able to attend the address due to his bail conditions.“I just cannot even begin to think how Katie was feeling,” Sutton says. “I know she was feeling hopeless … she was made to believe that everything was her fault.”About a fortnight after Madden’s death, when Sutton was clearing out her daughter’s house, a letter arrived from the police, addressed to Madden. It said the assault case against Russell was being dropped.“They must have known that Katie passed away,” Sutton says. “And they sent her that letter for me to open. And I was so upset, angry and cross about it, I ripped it up and I was so gutted that I did.”Sutton says she contacted police as she had “a gut feeling there was more harm” in her daughter’s case. She was given Madden’s phone. “I read and listened to her messages,” she told the inquest. She described Russell’s messages as “awful”. “He told her to kill herself,” she told the court. “This is something he had said on many occasions.”“There is no better detective than a mother,” Sutton says. “What Katie was saying would haunt me for the rest of my life. I just remember Katie saying in one of those voice notes, ‘You are giving me more reason to do it. You are not welcome at my funeral.’”Sutton said she wanted police to review Madden and Russell’s communications in case they were able to build a case against Russell for coercive control; she claims officers told her they only had the capacity to examine a month’s worth of data.She recalls an officer who tried to “reassure us as a family” that the information about Russell would be held on file. “That’s no good to me,” she says.The Guardian sent Suffolk police a series of questions about Madden’s case. The force said it was unable to answer them as her death was the subject of a domestic homicide review that had yet to conclude. Domestic homicide reviews examine the deaths of adults suspected to have suffered violence, abuse or neglect at the hands of a partner or family member. They are intended to identify lessons for the multiple agencies involved, rather than decide on whether any criminal investigation is merited.The Guardian was not able to reach Russell for comment.Madden was cremated in an intimate family ceremony. “She was never the centre of attention,” Sutton says. “She would never have wanted to be on parade.”‘How many more women have got to die?’After Madden’s inquest Parsley, the coroner, issued a prevention of future deaths report addressed to the police, social services, the NHS, the home office and the Department forHealth. He said there was “no formal system in place” to support Madden, even though she was “known to be vulnerable” after the Clare’s law disclosure and that multi-agency safeguarding referrals made in respect of her children were “viewed in isolation, with no system in place to assess any additional risks posed to Kate herself”.He said that the public bodies Madden was in contact with each suggested another should pay for her cognitive behavioural therapy, which she ultimately never received.Sutton, who works in the NHS, says she hopes lessons will be learned after the tragedy and criticised “the lack of communication, the lack of empathy, the lack of professional curiosity, the lack of risk assessment, the lack of the standard stuff that should be happening” when it comes to dealing with alleged victims of domestic abuse.Despite the police finding messages on Madden’s phone from Russell in which he told her to kill herself, the Guardian understands no police investigation into their relationship or the circumstances surrounding her death has been launched since her inquest.“How many more women have got to die?” Sutton says. “Whether they take their own lives, or whether someone takes their life for them, how many more women, before something is done? How bad does it have to get before someone is prosecuted?”In the UK, call the nationaldomestic abuse helplineon 0808 2000 247, or visitWomen’s Aid.

When she did, police dropped domestic violence inquiryHannah Al-OthmanandGeraldine McKelvieSun 15 Feb 2026 16.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 21.30 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe number of women who are driven to suicide by domestic abusers is being under-reported, and their cases overlooked by police, in what has been described by experts as a “national scandal”.Domestic violence suicides are already growing at such a rate that a woman in an abusive relationship is now more likely to take her own life than be killed by a partner.But research into the number of women who take their own life in such circumstances has suggested official statistics could track as few as 6.5% of the true number of cases.According to the Domestic Homicide Project, a programme led by the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC), there were 98 suspected suicides following domestic abuse in 2024, compared with 80 intimate partner homicides.But research by a suicide prevention programme in Kent found that about a third of all suspected suicides in the region between 2018 and 2024 were affected by domestic abuse.If the numbers in Kent reflect the national picture, it could mean as many as 1,500 victims of domestic abuse are taking their own lives every year – up to 15 times as many as previously thought.Tim Woodhouse, the programme manager and a University of Kent academic, who led the research, said: “We need some sort of national taskforce to get a grip on this.” He added that it was “bonkers that we are basing national estimates on one researcher’s evidence”.He said his work was “just trying to open people’s eyes that this is happening way more often than people think – it is, in terms of numbers, a national scandal”.The data collected by the NPCC, he said, was a “good start”, but “they’re not counting very many of the right suicides, they’ve got very tight exclusion criteria so they’re massively underplaying the number”.Recording domestic suicides is just one part of campaigners’ struggle to have causes of death in these cases more thoroughly investigated. There has been only one criminal conviction for manslaughter in UK legal history where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse.Lawyers believe this number shows coroners may have been too quick to dismiss deaths as suicides without properly considering whether they could be unlawful killings.Campaigners have called for all suicides where domestic abuse is suspected to be investigated as potential homicides from the outset, in order to ensure the best evidence is collected and preserved, as well as more multi-agency work to protect victims from abusers in the first place.To illustrate the scale of the crisis, the Guardian is publishing a series of articles about the people, most of them women, who have died by suicide following domestic abuse.Inthe case of Georgia Barter, her suicide after a decade-long campaign at the hands of her former partner Thomas Bignell was judged by a coroner to be an unlawful killing.An inquest in Walthamstow, north-east London, heard evidence that Bignell had kicked, stamped on and sexually assaulted Barter, but he was never charged with any offences in relation to his alleged abuse. Despite the coroner’s findings, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said there was insufficient evidence to bring charges.Today we also revealthe case of Katie Madden. At an inquest, her former partner Jonathon Russell admitted he had given Madden a black eye and, hours before her death, told her to kill herself. No criminal investigation into Russell’s role in Madden’s death has been launched.CPS to train staff on ‘spectrum of abuse’ in violence against women and girlsRead moreIn many cases, prosecutors do not see a basis for investigating wrongdoing and fail to bring any criminal charges at all after a domestic abuse suicide. It means alleged abusers are rarely investigated for offences such as violence or coercive control – despite a wealth of evidence often being presented to a coroner in an inquest. Families have also found police have dropped domestic abuse investigations after the victim has died.Pragna Patel of Project Resist said: “Too many bereaved families who have lost loved ones to domestic abuse-related suicides are being failed by a criminal justice system that is not fit for purpose.” Her organisation has brought together bereaved families to launch a campaign to seek changes in the criminal justice system.“At the heart of the injustice is not the failure of training, the absence of ‘professional curiosity’ or the lack of laws, but a systemic culture of discrimination, arrogance, indifference and apathy,” she added.More recently, there have been concerted efforts from the NPCC and the Crown Prosecution Service to bring charges in such cases.There are now two men being prosecuted for manslaughter following a suicide after domestic abuse, and both organisations have stressed they are keen to bring more cases to court.However, lawyers, campaigners and families have said there are issues with individual police forces and officers failing to understand the impact of domestic abuse or to adequately investigate cases immediately after a death.“Sadly, police forces too often miss opportunities to disrupt escalating domestic abuse and protect victims,” said Kate Ellis, the joint head of litigation at the Centre for Women’s Justice.“Too often we see police forces failing to take any criminal action against perpetrators, or consider protective measures that could be put in place, even when domestic abuse cases are graded as high risk. These errors can have fatal consequences.“We believe that some domestic abuse-related suicides are preventable, particularly in cases where the police are on notice of the abuse,” Ellis added. “Coercive and controlling relationships tend to follow similar patterns, so it is vital that police identify these patterns and act quickly.“We are also concerned that many suicides in apparent domestic abuse contexts are not recognised or investigated by the police as potential homicides, even when there is significant evidence of prior domestic abuse.”Southall Black Sisters has been campaigning for abuse-related suicide to be recognised as homicide for more than 40 years, and introduced an amendment in the crime and policing bill that was supported by more than 50 MPs.The organisation has specifically raised concerns about the possible overrepresentation of suicide driven by domestic abuse and “honour”-based abuse within Black, minority and migrant communities.“Women in these communities have additional barriers to overcome in order to escape abuse caused by intersecting racism and misogyny,” said Hannana Siddiqui, the director of policy, campaigns and research.To date, there has only been one criminal conviction for manslaughter where a woman has died by suicide following domestic abuse. Nicholas Allen pleaded guilty to the charge in 2017 after his former partner Justene Reece took her own life. Allen had stalked her after she left him and moved to a women’s refuge.In March, Ryan Wellings was cleared of the manslaughter of Kiena Dawes by a jury at Preston crown court. Dawes took her own life, leaving a note on her phone saying: “Slowly … Ryan Wellings killed me.” Wellings was convicted of assault and coercive and controlling behaviour, and jailed for six and a half years.Georgia Barter’s mother, Kay, said: “It’s been almost six long heartbreaking years since I lost my beautiful daughter Georgia. Still the fight for justice goes on. I would like to ask this government ‘when did this country stop respecting or protecting women and girls?’ Now is the time to show them you care.”She added: “The only successful conviction for manslaughter where a person’s partner died by suicide was in 2017 almost ten years ago. That is shocking. I’m sure I speak for myself and the countless grieving families out there – we demand change now.”Frank Mullane of the campaign group Advocacy after Fatal Domestic Abuse said: “It might not be enough to rely on the police improving their investigations and the CPS optimising its prosecution, to ensure perpetrators face justice after domestic abuse related suicides.“The defence team will exploit the merest mention of mental health difficulties and the jury may struggle to convict for manslaughter. A new law, specific to suicide caused by domestic abuse, will make it easier for the jury to identify causation. It will give confidence to the CPS to bring cases and it will educate the public.”In the UK,Samaritanscan be contacted on 116 123 and thedomestic abuse helplineis 0808 2000 247.

While many people recover, the illness can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, brain inflammation and, in rare cases, long-term disability or death.Dr Vanessa Saliba, a consultant epidemiologist at the UKHSA, said: “Our latest data shows we are now seeing a big measles outbreak in north-east London, mostly affecting unvaccinated children under 10 in schools and nurseries, with some being hospitalised.“Measles is a nasty illness for any child but for some it can lead to long-term complications and, tragically, death, but [it] is so easily preventable with two doses of theMMRV vaccine.” The MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) was replaced by the MMRV with the addition of chickenpox (varicella) to the vaccination.Saliba urged families to ensure their children have not missed any doses. She said: “With Easter holidays fast approaching, it is a timely reminder to families travelling overseas to ensure all family members, especially children, are vaccinated, as measles is widespread in some countries with close links to the UK and there are ongoing outbreaks in parts of Europe.”Global health officials announced earlier this year that the UK wasno longer considered to have eliminated measlesafter reportingalmost 4,000 infectionssince 2024.The outbreak comes amid declining uptake of the MMRV vaccine across the UK, with only about84% of children receiving both dosesby the age of five, well below the 95% level needed to prevent outbreaks.Enfield has one of thelowest MMRV vaccine uptakerates in the country, according to UKHSA figures from last August, which showed just 64.3% of five-year-olds in the borough received both doses in 2024-25.The Sunday Times reported that more than 60 suspected cases of measles had been reported by seven schools and a nursery in Enfield.A message posted on the borough’s Ordnance Unity Centre forHealthGP surgery website described a “fast-spreading measles outbreak”. It said: “During this recent outbreak, one in five children have been hospitalised due to measles and all of them had not been fully immunised.”Alev Cazimoglu, Enfield council’s cabinet member for health and social care, said: “The current outbreak has mainly affected children and some have required additional care with a short stay in hospital. Measles is one of the most infectious known diseases. It is approximately six times more infectious than Covid-19.“Catching the measles is entirely preventable, but it spreads extremely quickly where vaccination levels are low. By checking your family’s vaccination status and taking up the free NHS vaccine, you are protecting not only yourselves but also vulnerable members of our community.”Dudu Sher-Arami, Enfield’s director of public health, is writing to every parent in the area to try to contain the spread of the disease. Temporary vaccination centres have been established in schools across the borough in an effort to boost immunisation levels.Sher-Arami told the Sunday Times the outbreak had the potential to cause a “much greater and bigger pan-London outbreak” as people travel across the city for work and school.She said average vaccination figures – which are low across the city – masked significant pockets of very low uptake, which created prime areas for measles to spread.Modelling of a large measles outbreak in London by the UKHSA suggests between40,000 and 160,000 people could become infected. Last July achild died from measles in Liverpoolafter a small outbreak there.Since the start of the year there have been96 confirmed casesof measles in England, three-quarters affecting children under 10. Enfield has had the highest numbers, followed by Birmingham.There is no specific treatment for measles, only the vaccination to prevent catching it.Although the vaccination has been proven to be safe and effective, now-debunked claims that the injection was linked to autism have persisted on social media and among some minority ethnic communities, contributing to vaccine hesitancy.Measles spreads through coughs and sneezes and by touching contaminated surfaces, making it extremely easy to pass on in schools. Earlysymptomsinclude a high fever, runny nose, sneezing, coughing and red, watery eyes. A blotchy red-brown rash usually appears a few days later, starting on the face before spreading across the body.Explore more on these topicsMMRChildren's healthVaccines and immunisationHealthLondonEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

Shipwreck World, a group that works to locate shipwrecks around the globe,announced on Fridaythat the team led by Ehorn found the wreck about 20 miles (32km) offshore between Racine and Kenosha,Wisconsin.Ehorn’s Lac La Belle discovery took place in October 2022. The announcement was delayed because his team wanted to include a three-dimensional video model of the ship, but poor weather and other commitments kept his dive team from going back down to the wreck until last summer, hetoldthe Associated Press in an interview.Ehorn, 80, has been searching for shipwrecks since he was 15 years old. He said that he’s been trying to pinpoint the Lac La Belle’s location since 1965. He used a clue from fellow wreck hunter and author Ross Richardson in 2022 to narrow down his search grid and found the ship using side-scan sonar after just two hours on the lake, he said.“It’s kind of a game, like solve the puzzle. Sometimes you don’t have many pieces to put the puzzle together but this one worked out and we found it right away,” he said. The finding left him “super elated”.Ehorn declined to discuss the clue that led to the discovery.Richardson said in a short telephone interview on Sunday that he learned that a commercial fisherman at a “certain location” had snagged what Richardson called an item specific to steamships from the 1800s. He declined to elaborate further on how competitive shipwreck hunting has become and how the information could alert searchers to another way to conduct research.The luxury passenger steamer, called the Lac La Belle, set off from Milwaukee to Grand Haven, Michigan, one October night in 1872, with 53 passengers and crew as well as a cargo of 19,000 bushels of barley, 1,200 barrels of flour, 50 barrels of pork and 25 barrels of whiskey, according to Shipwreck World.‘We must protect and we must understand’: using shipwrecks to rebuild fish populationsRead moreAbout two hours into the trip, the ship began to leak uncontrollably. The captain turned the ship back to Milwaukee, but huge waves came crashing over, extinguishing its boilers. The storm drove the ship south. At around 5am, the captain ordered lifeboats lowered and the ship went down stern first.One of the lifeboats capsized on the way to shore, killing eight people. The other lifeboats made landfall along theWisconsincoast.According to an account on Shipwreck World, the Lac La Belle was built in 1864 in Cleveland, Ohio. The massive 217ft (66-meter) steamer ran between Cleveland and Lake Superior but sank in the St Clair River in 1866 after a collision. The ship was raised in 1869, and reconditioned.According to Ehorn, the ship’s exterior is covered with mussels and the upper cabins are gone, but the hull looks intact and the oak interiors are still in good shape.The Great Lakes are home to anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 shipwrecks, most of which remain undiscovered, Discoverreported. Shipwreck hunters have been searching the lakes with more urgency in recent years out of concerns thatinvasive quagga musselsare slowlydestroyingwrecks.The Lac La Belle is the 15th shipwreck Ehorn has located, the Associated Press reports.“It was one more to put a checkmark by,” Ehron said. “Now it’s on to the next one. It’s getting harder and harder. The easier ones have been found.”Ehorn will be presenting the discovery in person at the 2026 Ghost Ships Festival in Wisconsin in March, along with video and more images of the wreck.Explore more on these topicsWisconsinnewsShareReuse this content"

She wasreported missingthe following day, after she failed to arrive at a friend’s house to watch a church service.Authorities have been investigating her disappearance as akidnapping, and as of Sunday morning, two weeks since she was reported missing, no arrests have been made and no one is in custody.A missing woman, bloodstains and a masked intruder: tantalising clues but few leads in hunt for Nancy GuthrieRead moreOn Sunday, the FBI said instatementreported by several news outlets,that the gloves found around two miles from Guthrie’s home – one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days – “appear to match the gloves of the subject in the surveillance video”.The agency said that they sent the gloves to a lab in Florida for DNA testing, and that they received preliminary results on Saturday and “are awaiting quality control and official confirmation today”.“This process typically takes 24 hours from when the bureau receives DNA,” the FBI added.Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the vicinity, the FBI said.But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is “different”, according to the FBI statement.Investigators have released doorbell camera footage recovered from Guthrie’s home, which showed a masked individual arriving in the early morning hours of 1 February, carrying a backpack and what appeared to be a holstered handgun.On Thursday, the FBI released newdetailsabout the person in the video, describing them as “a male, approximately 5’9” – 5’10” tall, with an average build”.As the search continues, authoritiesare requestingthat residents within a two-mile radius of Guthrie’s home submit any surveillance footage recorded between 1 January to 2 February. They haveaskedneighbors to provide “all video footage that includes vehicles, vehicle traffic, people/pedestrians, and anything neighbors deem out of the ordinary or important”.As the investigation enters its third week, and continues to draw huge national attention, some crime bloggers and true crime podcasters have traveled toArizonato cover the case.On Saturday night, Arizona state representative Alma Hernandez, released astatement, saying that she was “sick of watching” the “insane speculation, lies, and BS by random wannabe journalists and YouTubers who have now caused more harm than good to this entire situation and put this serious case in jeopardy.“Please GO HOME,” she said. “Let law enforcement do their jobs. Stop following them during swat operations and playing detectives.”Late on Friday night, law enforcement converged on an area around two milesfrom Guthrie’s home, where they searched a home, and also investigated a car at a nearby Culver’s parking lot.On Saturday, the Pima county sheriff’s department confirmed that a federal court-ordered search warrant had been carried out at a residence in connection with the case. But they said that no arrests were made during the operation.Police seal off road near Arizona home of Today show host Savannah Guthrie’s missing motherRead moreAuthorities hadbriefly detaineda man earlier in the week, but he was released after questioning.Investigators havesaidthat splashes of blood found on the front porch of Guthrie’s home tested positive for her DNA. They also said that additional DNAcollectedfrom her property, that does not match Guthrie or those in close contact with her, is undergoing testing, along with several gloves reportedly discovered several miles from her residence.“All collected evidence has been submitted for laboratory analysis,” officials said this week.The FBI hasincreased the rewardto $100,000 for information that helps find Guthrie, or leads to an arrest and conviction of those involved in her disappearance. The bureau has said it has received more than 13,000 tips from the public about the case since 1 February.There have also been unverified reports about ransom notes sent to several Arizona television stations, and celebrity news websiteTMZ.Since Nancy Guthrie’s disappearance, Savannah Guthrie and hersiblingshave posted several videos on social media,pleading for helpfrom the public in finding their mother.A spokesperson for the Pima county sheriff’s department toldCNNon Sunday that no news conferences are currently planned.Explore more on these topicsArizonaUS crimenewsShareReuse this content"

As she and her family struggled with the medical procedures, her father, Ruben Torres Maldonado, was detained by immigration authorities while at a Home Depot in October, leading to a contentious and public case that highlighted the human effects of theTrump administration’s aggressiveimmigration crackdown.The family challenged Torres Maldonado’s detention, saying he was instrumental to helping their family and caring for Ofelia’s four-year-old brother, Nathan. A judgelater ruledin late October that Torres Maldonado’s arrest and detention was illegal. He wasreleasedfrom custody on 30 October.Last year, the Trump administration launchedOperation Midway Blitz, a surge in immigration enforcement arrests in Chicago, with officials from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), border patrol and other federal agencies descending on the city to drive up arrests.Torres Maldonado was arrested by authorities and detained in an immigration jail amid the operation. Ofelia had been enjoying a temporary break from treatment for stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer that develops in skeletal muscles, when her father was detained.Delia Ramirez, a US representative opposing the Trump administration’s mass deportation agenda, said on social media that Ofelia, one of her constituents, was an inspiration.“Even as Ofelia fought cancer, she also fought to bring her father home and ensured that he would no longer have to live in fear in the shadows,” Ramirezsaid. “She taught us what love, hope, and resolve look like. My condolences to her family and loved ones.”Chicago’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, also expressed his condolences on social media, while criticizing the Trump administration’s operations inChicago.“Ofelia led a steadfast, dedicated and truly inspiring life,” Johnsonsaid, adding that the Trump administration’s “indiscriminate, bigoted” mass deportation campaign, “which has upended the lives of hard-working families who came to Chicago, and other cities across the country, in search for a better life, must come to end”.View image in fullscreenSandibell Hidalgo, left, and Ofelia Torres, right, speak about the detention of Ruben Torres Maldonado during a press conference on 22 October 2025.Photograph: APA public GoFundMepagehighlighting the Torres family’s story in October included a video by Ofelia talking about her dad and the effect of his arrest.“I find it so unfair that hardworking immigrant families are being targetedbecause they were not born here,” Ofelia said in the video. The Torres family were able to secure resources to help with their situation. “Sadly, that’s not the case for all families.”“That’s why I’m making this video: to spread awareness and remind the public that immigrants are humans with families and deserve to be treated with love and respect, just like anyone else,” Ofelia added.The Torres family’s story led to widespread condemnation and backlash against the Trump administration for their crackdown targeting families. Ofelia’s family received legal assistance, filing and pushing for his release.In response to the Chicago Tribune when the family’s story came to light, homeland security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlinaccusedOfelia’s father of “habitual driving offenses”. She called his legal case “nothing more than a desperate hail Mary attempt” to keep him in the US with his family.Days before Ofelia died, a judge ruled that Torres Maldonado’s deportation would be blocked, due to the hardship it would bring his family, opening the door to a potential pathway to permanent residence and eventual citizenship.“Ofelia was heroic and brave in the face of ICE’s detention and threateneddeportation of her father,” the family’s attorney said in a statement. “We mourn Ofelia’s passing, and we hope that she will serve as a model for us all for how to be courageous and to fight for what’s right to our last breaths.”According to theChicago Tribune, Ofelia completed a school project on the high cost of healthcare in the US. As a result, her teacher introduced her to an Illinois state representative.“She is smart, funny, inquisitive, engaging. We just talked about state healthcare policy,”Illinoisstate representative Laura Faver Dias said at the time. “We talked about her fears, our shared fears about what happens to Medicaid for her and her family as she is navigating cancer.”Explore more on these topicsChicagoICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement)IllinoisUS immigrationUS politicsTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

At the time, he lived in Granbury, 40 minutes west of Fort Worth. He’d noticed that a local member of the state legislature, Mike Lang, had become a vocal advocate forusing public money for private schools– despite the fact that Lang campaigned as a supporter of public education.With a little research, Tackett found that Lang had received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from the Wilks brothers and Tim Dunn, billionaire megadonors whose deep pockets and Christian nationalist views haveconsumed the Texas GOP. Tackett published his findings on social media, and soon enough, people started asking him to create pie charts of their representatives’ campaign funds. These charts evolved into the organisationSee It. Name It. Fight It.“There’s so many people out there that are so busy with their daily lives, they’re walking past and not even seeing some of these bad things going on,” he says. “So that’s the first step: you have to see this thing.”Tackett and his wife Mendi, the organisation’s sole members, now live in Fort Worth, where they’re part of a scrappy community of progressives and anti-extremist organizers who are building momentum amid their town’s deeply embedded Christian nationalism. Tarrant county, in which Fort Worth is the largest city, provideda chilling preview of Texas’s gerrymandering efforts, and the county is widely regarded as a hotbed for far-right actors. But most recently, the county was the site of a Democratic victory that sent the Texas Republican party reeling.Taylor Rehmet, a Democrat and local union leader,wona runoff for a state Senate seat that’s been held by Republicans since 1992. What’s more, he bested Republican Leigh Wambsganss despite having one-tenth as much money. Much of Wambsganss’s funding came from Dunn and the Wilks brothers.Republicans blamed low turnout for Rehmet’s victory, while pundits opined that the Trump administration’s unpopularity was to blame. But people in Fort Worth say local organizing was central to the upset – and it will be key to any future victories inTexas, too.Alexander Montalvo, a longtime grassroots organizer in Tarrant county, points to several examples where local advocates have successfully rallied for causes they believe. There was thepushbackagainst a proposal to split a local school district. Then there were the school board elections last May, where every candidate endorsed by the Christian nationalist cellphone carrier Patriot Mobile lost their election.Patriot Mobile– where Wambsganss works as an executive – had previously racked up several wins across Tarrant county, effectively taking over multiple boards.Now, after those May losses and Rehmet’s win, the company’s political influence is in doubt.“There is something very local here in Tarrant county that is happening and that has been happening,” he says. “There is a collective groundswell that’s been building.”Tackett says he’s in close contact with organizers like Montalvo and other Tarrant County residents who meet up for what’s called the “817 Gather”: a monthly meeting of people activated by the extremism that’s run rampant in their area.“It’s a bunch of folks that are Black, brown, white, mostly progressive, but we’ve got a few folks that play into that former Republican space, as well,” he says. “It’s not about Republican versus Democrat. It’s really all about what we stand for, because we can agree that public education is foundational to the success of our democracy. We can agree that a person should have rights over their own body, and it should be easier to vote, not harder to vote.”People have found their roles within this community, and in one way or another, their efforts always lead back to voting. Montalvo and fellow organizer EJ Carrion, one of the hosts of the local podcastthe 817 Pod, frequently inspire large crowds for local city council and county commissioner meetings. The Tacketts publish social media videosspotlightingtheir concerned neighbors – often as they speak at those local meetings – and putting local extremists on display.Before Rehmet’s victory, their organisation shared a video of Wambsganss appearing on the podcast of former Trump consigliereSteve Bannon. After the election, the Tacketts published a video breaking down how local Republicans reacted to the Rehmet victory at a meeting held the day after Rehmet’s win.Inthe video, a candidate for Texas agriculture commissioner claimed Texas was at risk of falling under Sharia law. Others framed politics as a spiritual battle that will determine whether the US remains a Christian nation. That meeting was hosted by For Liberty & Justice, a local political organisation affiliated with a Fort Worth church called Mercy Culture which isseeking activelyencourage conservative Christians to run for office and break down barriers between church and state in the US.When it comes toChristian nationalismin Tarrant County, multiple people interviewed for this story say no institution looms larger than Mercy Culture.“Mercy Culture is not just a church,” says Wesley Kirk, a lifelong Fort Worthian and one of the hosts of the 817 Pod. “It’s a political machine. They are organizing people. They are endorsing candidates.”Chanin Scanlon, a former Fort Worth resident who recently moved to San Antonio, puts it bluntly.“This is Christian nationalism,” she says. “It’s not subtle. They are very clear about what they want. They want to take over institutions.”The Tacketts have used their popular social media presence to chronicle Mercy Culture’s rising influence. But Chris Tackett is alsostill making pie charts. After the Rehmet victory, he dove deep into the data to see if the narrative about low turnout was true. Turnout was down across the board, he found, which undermined the local GOP’s narrative that Republicans who stayed home were the ones to blame.Using a voter score analysis, Tackett alsofoundthat 57% of runoff voters fell into one of two groups: true independents, or “Democratic-leaning voters who regularly vote in Republican primaries because, in ‘deep-red’ Texas, the GOP primary is the only election that matters in most cycles.” (Fifty-seven percent is the total percentage of the electorate that Rehmet won.)“What we saw wasn’t massive Republican crossover,” hewrote. “It was Democrats – many of whom have been forced to play in GOP primaries for years – finally getting a meaningful choice and showing up.”Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor, agrees with the idea that Democrats had a strong candidate to back in the runoff.“I think they figured out the secret sauce to candidate recruitment,” he says of the Democratic party. “Being an authentic person goes a long way for voters these days.”Montalvo, meanwhile, finds himself motivated by Tackett’s pie chart.“There’s actually a big enough and a diverse enough base amongst Democratic voters in Tarrant county that if we actually invest in those communities, we have the votes to be able to win,” he says.Explore more on these topicsTexasUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The early September headline accompanying our 2025NFLpredictions –Will it be Mahomes, Jackson or Allen in the Super Bowl?– was the ultimate hedge. After all, what were the odds that one of them wouldn’t emerge from the AFC?Then there was the reality. Mike Vrabel’s dramatic turnaround of New England. The Bears transforming from worst-to-first in the NFC North under Ben Johnson. The first-half magic of Daniel Jones. The successful pairing of Jaxon Smith-Njigba andSam Darnold.Aside from foreseeing the annual disaster that is theNew York Jets, our crystal balls largely failed us. The good news is that we weren’t alone in faceplanting on our predictions. Seriously, who saw MVP contender Drake Maye coming?Time to take a few deep breaths, grab a security blanket, and revisit our 2025 NFL predictions. (You canread them in full here.)Best team whowon’t make the playoffsWhat we said before the season:We thoughtthe Rams would miss outdue to Matthew Stafford’s herniated disc being a “case of when, not if, he is replaced by Jimmy Garoppolo”. We also believedWashington would thriveunder “phenom” Jayden Daniels and thatJoe Burrow and Ja’Marr Chase, the NFL’s “top quarterback-wide receiver duo”, wouldget the Bengals close. (Yes, we assumed Burrow would remain healthy for an entire season.) We thoughtMinnesotawould narrowly miss outbecause JJ McCarthy is no Darnold, We believedthe Bears offense would take a leapunder Johnsonbut still miss out.What actually happened:Burrow lasted two weeksbefore turf toe erased most of his season. Cincinnati finished 6-11.Daniels was riddled with a litany of injuresand completed only four full games. Washington was eliminated after Week 14. Meanwhile, 37-year-oldStafford was named MVPafter the best season of his career. The 12-5 Rams reached the NFC championship game, a thrilling battle many will consider the real Super Bowl.MVPWhat we said before the season:Three of us were firm believers inthe Lamar Jackson revenge tour. We believed that Jackson’s mightiest MVP challengers, aside from Josh Allen, would be “Mahomes, Hurts, Daniels, Stroud, Purdy and Jordan Love”. Earning one vote each were Patrick Mahomes, who “won’t turn the ball over and he will have the comeback narrative on his side”, and Daniels, who would confirm he is a “legit superstar”.What actually happened:Stafford. Maye. Stafford. Maye.Stafford prevailedin the closest MVP vote since 2003. Of the names we bandied about, including Jackson and his seven contenders, only one (Allen) finished in the top five in MVP voting.View image in fullscreenWho would’ve thought Drake Maye would be in the MVP conversation? Not us.Photograph: Garrett W Ellwood/APRookie to watchWhat we said before the season:Two of usloved Raiders running back Ashton Jeanty, believing he “has all the tools to transform a franchise”. Another two believed that the addition ofAbdul Carterwould help the New York Giants “quietly have one of the most fearsome pass-rushs in the league”, and that Carter could “flirt” with the 13 sacks Micah Parsons attained as a rookie. Also receiving a nod was No 1 overall pickCam Ward,who we said has “better targets than one might expect for a guy taking over a 3-14 team”.What actually happened:Carolina’sTetairoa McMillanwas the runaway winner for Offensive Rookie of the Year after collecting 1,014 receiving yards and seven touchdowns. Browns linebackerCarson Schwesinger, a constant nuisance, took defensive rookie honors. Carter started slow, finishing the season with four sacks, though the Giants still had one of the league’s better pass rushes. Ward’s season was forgetable. He was sacked a league-high 55 times and Tennessee again finished 3-14. Fellow rookie quarterbacks Tyler Shough and Jaxson Dart were far more impactful. Productive as Jeanty was (1,300-plus yards from scrimmage and 10 touchdowns), it turns out the Raiders need far more than a rookie rusher to transform their franchise.AFC EastWhat we said before the season:Five prognosticators.Five votes for Buffalo. We called the Bills “the biggest division lock across the NFL”, though we pointed out “serious concerns” about the Bills defense. A few of us all acknowledged that the Patriots were “up-and-coming”. Still, we thought Buffalo would “waltz through the division.”What actually happened:Buffalo’s five-year hold on the division wassnatched by New England, who miraculously finished 14-3 after a 4-13 campaign in 2024. Buffalo earned a wildcard berth despite many gaps in their defense, especially against the run. Allen had the highest completion percentage of his career, though was only the second-best quarterback in the division. Maye narrowly lost out on MVP after his breakout season. Meanwhile, the Jets became the first team in modern NFL history not to collect a single interception over the course of a season.The flawed Patriots face a harsh truth: only the very best teams get a Super Bowl sequelRead moreAFC NorthWhat we said before the season:It wasanother sweep, this timein favor of the Ravenswith their “top-tier defense” and “most stacked roster in the NFL”. We called Jackson “the best player in the NFL” and while we acknowledged the Steelers’ improvement, we considered Cincinnati the most legitimate contender.What actually happened: TheRavens missed the playoffs. Jackson was inconsistent and riddled with a litany of injuries. Baltimore’s defense was a disappointment. Jaire Alexander, thought to be a key addition, was traded to Philadelphia after two games. It wasPittsburgh whotook the divisionat 10-7 thanks to some gutsy wins. Their defense was brilliant at times, and Aaron Rodgers did enough to keep them in games. More importantly, Rodgers kept the drama away. Myles Garrett set the NFL’s season-sack record, and that’s all worth mentioning about Cleveland.AFC SouthWhat we said before the season:More group-think as weunanimously picked the Texansthanks to their “top-five defense”. Wedidn’t sleep on Jacksonville, noting that “no team has a higher floor or ceiling given the weapons on offense and the new coaching staff,” but thought them “too green”. One of us thought the Titans would be entertaining with Ward but couldn’t say the same about the Colts since they were “rolling out Daniel Jones as their win-now option”.What actually happened:A hot start from the quite entertaining Danny Dimes – with a wee assist from Jonathan Taylor – put the Colts in the driver’s seat until they petered out in the second half. Jacksonville and Houston ended the regular season as two of the hottest teams in football. Both earned a postseason berth, but it wasJacksonville under first-year coach Liam Coenwho took the title. Trevor Lawrence took the next step, defensive end Josh Hines-Allen was a standout, and the Jags appear to be a force to reckoned with for the near future.View image in fullscreenPatrick Mahomes’s season came to an early end when he tore his ACL in Week 15.Photograph: Reed Hoffmann/APAFC WestWhat we said before the season:Only three of us took the Chiefs, while two picked Denver. We wereenamored with the Broncos defenseand believed “Bo Nix doesn’t need to take a major leap forward for Denver to be a force”. No one who picked Kansas City was exactly confident, acknowledging the Broncos and Chargers’ potential but ultimately said“it’s the Chiefs until it ain’t”.What actually happened:Denver happened.Their defense was a force, collecting 68 sacks. Bo Nix worked perfectly in Sean Payton’s system. And the Broncos ended the Chiefs’ nine-year rule of the division. Kansas City missed the playoffs amid a disappointing campaign from Mahomes that ended with the star QB tearing his ACL in Week 15.NFC EastWhat we said before the season:It wasan Eagles sweep. “Is there a more foolproof roster in the NFL?”, we asked rhetorically. We did consider the Commanders a threat given how they “strengthened the offense around Daniels”.What actually happened:Philadelphia easily took the divisionthanks to the no one else topping .500. The 11-6 Eagles fell flat on offense, finishing just 21st in points per game. Dallas at 7-9 finished as division runner-up, while Washington went 5-12 and rolled out an offense that was anything but fortified.NFC NorthWhat we said before the season: Anotherunanimous vote, this timefor Green Bay. We said the acquisition of Parsons would be “division altering” and thought the Packers had entered the season with all the ingredients of a contender. We thought the Lions and Vikings would duke it out for a wildcard spot, though one of predicted Minnesota would miss Darnold. Only one of us even mentioned the Bears and it was just to say they are “improved but not quite there yet”.What actually happened:None of us saw the immediate impact of Ben Johnson coming.Chicago took the titleas Johnson turned Caleb Williams into a star who proved clutch as they come. The NFC North was the tightest of divisions with the Vikings and Lions, both at 9-8, narrowly missing out on the postseason. And yes, the Vikings did miss Darnold.NFC SouthWhat we said before the season:Three of usbelieved the Buccaneerswould take the title thanks to “the most well-rounded roster in the division” and “best offensive line in the league – when Tristan Wirfs is healthy”. One writerpicked the Falconsdue to their “high-powered offense” while the anotheropted for Panthersdeeming the division up for grabs.View image in fullscreenThe Panthers made the most of a weak NFC South.Photograph: Jacob Kupferman/APWhat actually happened:What the division lacked in quality, it made up in late season intrigue – namely who of these uninspired teams would spark the playoff-seeding debate. The Bucs and Panthers entered Week 18 with the division up for grabs. Despite finishing 8-9 and scoring fewer points than all but one NFC team,the Panthers took the title. The Bucs and Falcons also finished 8-9.NFC WestWhat we said before the season: Wemade a case for all four teams– yes, even the Cardinals. Two of us thought the 49ers would rebound from a nightmare 2024 season with “MVP caliber” Brock Purdy and the return of Robert Saleh. One of us thought Klint Kubiak“making the most of Sam Darnold”would lead Seattle to the division title. Another gave the nod to the Rams, believing Stafford’s back would stay in one piece. Our last writer picked Arizona somewhat by fault.What actually happened:Aside from the Cardinals, the division was insanely competitive withthe Seahawks taking the crown– and at 14-3 the No 1 seed. Los Angeles and San Francisco both finished 12-5 and were also in the running for the division and home-field heading in the final month of the regular season. For LA, Stafford’s back not only remained intact but he had the best season of his career and was named league MVP. And San Francisco, despite their usual slew of injuries to star players (headlined by Nick Bosa and Fred Warner), found ways to win as Purdy settled in.Welcome to the Dark Side: Seattle’s brutal, Super Bowl-winning defense is here to stayRead moreSuper BowlWhat we said before the season:Ravens over Packers. Broncos over Packers. Eagles over Bills. Ravens over Lions. Eagles over Ravens.What actually happened:Seattle over New England.The Super Bowl none of us came close to predicting. In fact, neither team was mentioned in our championship round picks. We didn’t seeSeattle’s smothering defensebeingthatsmothering. Or Darnold playing the best game of his career in the NFC championship battle for the ages against the Rams. Or Kenneth Walker III being such a force. We didn’t see New England’s defensive trajectory in the playoffs. No one saw Maye being that good in the regular season andthat bad in the Super Bowl.Seattle’s29-13 Super BowlLX dominationmay not have been everyone’s cup of tea, but at least we’re not afraid to roll back the clock and admit that we never saw it coming.

But the Ukrainian freeskier Kateryna Kotsar’s evening was just getting started.Having made the big air final, Kotsar then wrote “freedom of memory” on her glove to protest againstthe ban of her compatriot Vladyslav Heraskevychfor wearing images of slain athletes on his helmet. And a Valentine’s Day she will never forget took another surprise turn when her boyfriend, Bohdan Fashtryha, then dropped to one knee and proposed.Volodymyr Zelenskyy honours disqualified skeleton racer with order of freedomRead more“He said in Ukrainian, do I want to marry him, nothing else,” said Kotsar. “He was nervous. It was so cute. I’m still excited and can’t understand what happened tonight, because it’s two really huge things for me.”Kotsar, who finished 11th in qualifying, flashed her sparkling diamond ring as she admitted she didn’t expect the proposal. “Usually I have some feelings that something great will happen,” she said. “Today I had the feeling, but I thought it was about making the finals. I had a bad feeling yesterday, I felt sick. For today, my biggest goal was to complete and make clean runs, but they were clean enough to be in the final. Now I am full of energy.”The 25-year-old from Kyiv will compete against the defending Olympic champion, Eileen Gu, and 10 other athletes in Monday’s big air final. But she admitted that she would be thinking of her compatriots back home.“You live without electricity, without heating, without the opportunity to wash your clothes and do some pretty simple things,” she said. “Usually, most of our training on snow, we do abroad, in Austria, Italy, Switzerland, but I still have enough time in Ukraine to do some gym and trampoline training.”Last week Kotsar also made headlines when she revealed that the International Olympic Committee had barred her from using a custom helmet with the inscription “Be Brave like Ukrainians” in Milano Cortina. “About a week before the Olympic Games, I received an email saying that the International Olympic Committee considers this helmet to be propaganda, which means I cannot compete in it at the Games,” she said.“Due to a lack of certain experience, knowledge, and probably confidence, I simply changed the helmet, and now it just has a small Ukrainian flag on it,” she added.Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

It is here, deep in the countryside a few kilometres outside the baroque city, that the noise of the Bernabéu and the intensity of Stamford Bridge feel like a lifetime ago. The setting is rustic, quiet and slow-paced: a stark contrast to the frenetic energy that defined Eden Hazard’s career on the pitch.It has been almost three years since he stopped playing, and the silence sincehis retirement at 32has been notable. After an injury-hit spell at Real Madrid brought a premature end to a dazzling career, Hazard did not seek the spotlight. Surrounded by vineyards rather than defenders, slumped in an armchair, he seems entirely at peace, remarkably comfortable with his life after football.“Life goes really fast,” Hazard says, leaning back, “especially in football. Yesterday I was 19, today I’m 35. You have to enjoy it, not just in football but in everything.”View image in fullscreenEden Hazard celebrates after scoring for Chelsea: ‘The Premier League is more physical; you never stop running. La Liga is more technical.’Photograph: Chelsea Football Club/Chelsea FC/Getty ImagesWhile many players struggle with the void left by the game, Hazard has found solace in simplicity. “Your family is what helps you,” he says. “My life is simple: I stay home and enjoy the simple things with my wife, kids, and brothers. When you play, you travel constantly, but when you stop, you finally have time for them without the stress.”He still lives in Madrid, a choice made not for football, but for “the family, the kids, the weather, and the food”. He jokes about his new reality. “I never trained at 10am! I just played on Saturday and that was it,” he says with a smile. “Now my life is quite simple. I’m a dad of five. In this moment, I’m more of a taxi driver than a football player, but it’s OK.”Distance from the game has afforded him perspective on the two domestic leagues that defined him. The debate between the Premier League and La Liga is eternal, but Hazard has a clear position. “They have different styles of play,” he says. “The Premier League is more physical; you never stop running. La Liga is more technical. At Madrid, you can manage the game, but in the Premier League, there is no chance: you have to go full speed for 90 minutes.”Talk of England inevitably leads to José Mourinho, who coached him atChelsea. Everyone seems to have a Mourinho story, but Hazard’s is quintessentially Hazard: a mix of brilliance and a laid-back attitude that somehow worked.“I don’t have just one, I have many,” he says with a laugh. “I remember once, during the first year Mourinho arrived, I went to Lille to watch a game and lost my passport on the way back.” The consequences were immediate. “I wasn’t allowed back into England and missed training. I returned around 2pm. When the session was over, I had to apologise to him. It was a really bad moment for me.”For many, that would be the end. For Hazard, it was only a blip. “The next week, he pulled me out of the team and said it was my fault, but by the weekend I was back playing and it went well.”View image in fullscreenHazard runs with the ball during the Russia 2018 World Cup. ‘Being the captain of my country was something unbelievable.’Photograph: Manan Vatsyayana/AFP/Getty ImagesDespite the friction, the respect remains. “So many things,” he replies when asked what he learned from the Portuguese manager. “His passion for football, the way he trusts players … the way we trained with him was unbelievable.”If Chelsea were where he became an idol, Belgium was where he carried the hopes of a nation. He speaks of the 2018 World Cup with a glow. “It’s not necessarilyfunny, but the 2018 World Cup was incredible. I had the chance to play with my brother. Being the captain of my country was something unbelievable.”Belgium finished third in that tournament, a result that haunts some but satisfies Hazard. “It’s total happiness,” he says. “We felt that Belgium were incredible during those years. Even though we didn’t win, people today say we were a better team than France.” There is a pause, and a flash of pride. “That makes me proud: not because we won, but because of what we created together.”He still follows the national team – “the manager is a friend of mine” – and visits Belgium for holidays, though he prefers the Madrid weather. But if he were to trade his taxi-driver duties for political office in his homeland, prime minister Hazard has a clear manifesto.“Kids today love PlayStation and YouTube,” he says. “My No 1 rule would be: go play on the street, play football, and enjoy it with your friends. Maybe no school on Fridays: only Monday to Thursday, and then you play football all weekend.”View image in fullscreenReal Madrid’s Eden Hazard (left) is felled by Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne in the Champions League.Photograph: Peter Powell/EPALooking back, he cites the2018 World Cup quarter-final against Brazilas his best game. But what about his favourite goal? “Maybe the one against Tottenham,” he says of the curling equaliser in the dying minutes of theBattle of the Bridge in 2016. That goal didn’t just secure a 2-2 draw, it effectively ended Spurs’ title hopes and handed the trophy to Claudio Ranieri’s Leicester.He lifted the Champions League withReal Madridin 2022. “It’s a great feeling,” he says, “because you play for the crowd and the trophies. The Champions League is one of the best trophies to win. Even if I didn’t play much, just being there in a club that wins so much and playing with such great players was unbelievable.”Yet he places the Premier League, won twice with Chelsea, on the same pedestal: “Winning the Premier League is very hard, just like the Champions League or the World Cup. It’s special because so many teams can win it.”The most underrated player he played alongside? He doesn’t hesitate: “I always thought Mousa Dembélé was one of the best midfielders of that generation. People didn’t talk about him much because he didn’t score goals, but the fans in the Premier League know he was a top, top player.”So why are we in Lecce? The connection comes via an old friend. “It started with Willian, my ex-teammate at Chelsea,” Hazard says. “He spoke with me about it and said: ‘Please, can you join us?’” The “us” in question is our host, Fabio Cordella. A sporting director by trade, Cordella decided at one point to build his own fantasy team: not on the pitch, but in the vineyard. He has assembled a “squad” of legends, recruiting the likes of Ronaldinho, Andriy Shevchenko, Iván Zamorano, and Gianluigi Buffon to create their own signature bottles. Hazard is the latest star to join this vintage lineup.View image in fullscreenEden Hazard sees a parallel between the wine barrel and the ball. ‘It’s a bit like football: it’s not just about one game, it’s about a career of 10 or 15 years.’Photograph: Giulio Piscitelli/The GuardianHazard admits he was not a big drinker during his playing days, but he sees a parallel between the barrel and the ball: “It’s a bit like football: it’s not just about one game, it’s about a career of 10 or 15 years.” And does his wine resemble the player? “Yes, of course,” he says with a grin. “This wine is elegant, just like me.”Hazard has no desire to be remembered as a legend. “Just as a good player and a good, funny guy. I don’t need anything more than that.”He has found a new meaning now. “It’s a bottle of wine and family,” he says, painting a picture of his future. “I see my future as a happy grandfather with white hair, surrounded by my kids. That is the life I want.”Explore more on these topicsEden HazardReal MadridChelseainterviewsShareReuse this content"

But Wilson dropped the gloves late in Canada’s 10-2 rout of France on Sunday, tangling with Pierre Crinon, who had delivered a forearm to the head of teammate Nathan MacKinnon minutes earlier.“Obviously fighting isn’t a big thing in this tournament, but when a guy takes a run at one of our big guys, that’s what Willy does,” three-time Olympian Drew Doughty said. “I mean, he does a lot more than that, but it was great to see him step up.”Would bringing back NHL’s brawling enforcers make hockey safer?Read moreCrinon was given a two-minute minor penalty and apologized to MacKinnon after the hit in the third period. Scoring 25 seconds into the ensuing power play was not good enough punishment in the eyes of Canada’s players.“We didn’t like the hit: felt like it was late and high,” the tournament’s leading scorer, Connor McDavid, said. “Willy just finishes a check and the guy jumps him, and Willy’s just protecting himself. That’s all he can do. That’s the type of guy he is, type of teammate he is. Nothing but respect for him.”Unlike the NHL, which assesses a five-minute major penalty for a fight, the International Ice Hockey Federation classifies it as a game misconduct, so Wilson and Crinon were ejected. The outcome of the game had already been effectively settled by the dominant Canadians, and Wilson only missed the final seven minutes.“We’re used to a lot more than that happening, so it was pretty harmless in the grand scheme of things,” coach Jon Cooper said. “Sticking up for his teammates, that’s an easy one for him.”Wilson also had a goal and an assist, along with the fight giving him what is known in hockey as a “Gordie Howe hat-trick.”The 31-year-old winger is one of just a few new players for Canada who did not play at the 4 Nations Face-Off a year ago, when there werethree fights in the first nine secondsof the team’s first game against the US.MacKinnon, who was slow to get up and spent some time on the bench before returning, appreciated Wilson standing up for him.“That guy obviously didn’t want to fight Tom,” MacKinnon said. “He just wanted to wrestle. I wouldn’t want to fight Tom either.”Wilson, who is 6ft 4in and 220lbs, was a no-doubt pick for his physicality and ability to retrieve pucks, along with producing at a high level back in North America with theWashington Capitals. He is their leading scorer with 49 points in 50 games this season.“We know Willy’s got our backs,” Bennett said. “He’s going to protect all our guys and bring the energy. We love that from Willy. He’s going to do anything for our team.”Canada’s goaltender Jordan Binnington, who is known for his physical player, also approved. “I definitely wasn’t surprised,” Binnington said. “That’s hockey, right? That’s hockey.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Ice hockeyWashington CapitalsCanada ice hockey teamUS sportsWinter OlympicsFrance Olympic teamnewsShareReuse this content"

Vonn has had multiple surgeries in Italy to repair the complex tibia fracture in her left leg.Lindsey Vonn’s crash is violent but honest ending to an unprecedented Olympic bidRead more“We’re working through all of that at the moment,” Goldschmidt said. “We’ve got a great team around helping her and she’ll go back to the US for further surgeries.”Spectators hoping to see Vonnwin a medal at the age of 41with a torn ACL in her left knee and a partial titanium replacement in her right knee were shocked when she hooked a gate just 13 seconds into her run –resulting in a spinning crash.“The impact, the silence, everyone was just in shock. And you could tell it was a really nasty injury,” said Goldschmidt, who was at the course when Vonn crashed. “There’s a lot of danger in doing all sorts of Alpine sports but it gives more of an appreciation for how superhuman these athletes are.“I mean putting your body on the line, going at those speeds, the physicality. Sometimes actually on the broadcast it’s really hard to get that across. Danger sometimes brings fans in and is pretty captivating. We obviously hope we won’t have injuries like that but it is unfortunately part and parcel of our sports.”Vonn says she has no regrets. “When I think back on my crash, I didn’t stand in the starting gate unaware of the potential consequences,” Vonn said in an Instagram post late Saturday. “I knew what I was doing. I chose to take a risk. Every skier in that starting gate took the same risk.

That’s the gamble of chasing your dreams, you might fall but if you don’t try you’ll never know.Vonn added that people should not feel sorry for her. “Don’t feel sad,” she wrote. “The ride was worth the fall. When I close my eyes at night I don’t have regrets and the love I have for skiing remains. I am still looking forward to the moment when I can stand on the top of the mountain once more. And I will.”Goldschmidt visited Vonn at the hospital twice and said, “She’s not in pain. She’s in a stable condition.“She took an aggressive line and was all in and it was inches off what could have ended up a very different way,” Goldschmidt said. “But what she’s done for our sports and the sport in general, her being a role model, has gone to a whole new level. You learn often more about people during these tough moments than when they’re winning.”Some users on social media said Vonn should not have been racing only a week after tearing her ACL. However, those who know the risks of skiing best supported Vonn’s decision.“People that don’t know ski racing don’t really understand what happened yesterday,” Vonn’s US teammate Keely Cashman said on Monday. “She hooked her arm on the gate, which twisted her around. She was going probably 70mph, and so that twists your body around.”Cashman, who suffered a heavy crash of her own five years ago, said Vonn’s crash had “nothing to do with her ACL, nothing to do with her knee”, and people who think otherwise are “totally incorrect”.Explore more on these topicsLindsey VonnSkiingWinter OlympicsWinter Olympics 2026newsShareReuse this content"

After her victory in the women’s Super-G on Friday, she won the giant slalom by just over six-tenths of a second.As small as that gap sounds, it was an enormous margin in a race where there were only six-hundredths of a second between the three women who finished behind her; Sweden’s Sara Hector, Norway’s Thea Louise Stjernesund and Brignone’s Italian teammate Lara Della Mea. The gap between Brignone and second place was the same as that between second and 15th.Winter Olympics 2026: latest medal table for Milano CortinaRead moreIt was a rare and beautiful display of high-speed skiing on L’Olympia delle Tofane by a woman who has found once-in-a-lifetime form at her home Olympics. After it was over, Hector and Stjernesund, who had tied for second place, both dropped to their knees and bowed down before her.“I crossed the finish line and I said: ‘I don’t know if it’s enough,’” Brignone said. “Then I heard the crowd and I said: ‘Oh, maybe yes.’ Then I turned around and I saw number one.”She was not the only one who heard them. The grandstands at the finish line were bouncing with overjoyed Italian fans, and the noise must have carried all the way across the other side of the valley.View image in fullscreenSara Hector (right) and Thea Louise Stjernesund (centre), the dual silver medallists, bowed down before Federica Brignone after the race.Photograph: Aleksandra Szmigiel/Reuters“I have too many emotions. I can’t believe it, this is just crazy,” Brignone said. “My attitude was that I would be happy just to be here. That was already an achievement. Just to be back as an athlete.”Three hundred days ago, Brignone could not say whether she would ever again be able to walk normally, let alone race in this fashion. Her crash during the giant slalom at the Italian national championships last April broke her left knee in four places and tore her anterior cruciate ligament.The 35-year-old had three rounds of surgery, a series of metal screws and plates inserted into the joint, then started out on seven months of intensive rehabilitation.For most of the past year, all Italian sport has been sweating over the question of whether she would be fit to compete here in Cortina or not. The physical recovery was only one part of what Brignone had to go through to be able to do it. The mental recovery was another.The great Mikaela Shiffrin, who beat Brignone in this event in 2018, has spoken openly about how she has been struggling with PTSD since abad crash at Killingtonin November 2024, when she sustained a puncture wound that very nearly killed her by ripping open her colon.View image in fullscreenMikaela Shiffrin in the finish area after her second run in the giant slalom.Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty ImagesShiffrin is 30 and has won more World Cup races than any skier in history but readily admits that she is relearning how to race in the way she took for granted before that accident. She finished 11th here, almost a full second behind Brignone.It was Brignone’s fifth Olympic medal after the silver and two bronzes that she won in Beijing and Pyeongchang.

France took silver and the bronze went to Italy.Klæbo’s gold puts him ahead of the Norwegian cross-country skiers Marit Bjørgen, Bjørn Dæhlie and the biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen, with whom he shared a previous record.“It was good to share the top with them for a couple of days, but it feels even better to be on the top. It’s a big achievement and will take some time to sink in,” Klæbo said. His ninth gold puts him level with six Olympic greats including Finland’s Paavo Nurmi and the US sprinter Carl Lewis. One more would lift him to second on the all-time list for any Olympics, but he would have some way to go to surpass the American swimmer Michael Phelps, who towers above all with 23.View image in fullscreenNorway celebrate atop the cross-country relay podium.Photograph: Tobias Schwarz/AFP/Getty ImagesNorway kept a steady lead for much of the race, which was seen as Klæbo’s easiest path to a gold medal of these Games. France’s Mathis Desloges, who has taken two silvers so far, pulled his team into a medal position during the third leg of the race, while Italy’s Federico Pellegrino overcame Finland in the anchor leg to take bronze on home soil in his last Olympics.“[Klæbo] is the greatest of all time. We knew that, and now it is also in the numbers,” said the Italian skier Elia Barp, while Canada’s Remi Drolet added: “I think he’ll go down as the greatest of all time. To be racing the same era as him - it is crazy to witness that and to fight against that.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsNorwaynewsShareReuse this content"

On Sunday evening, she performed like an athlete insistent on leaving no room for doubt.Kok leveraged two years of total sprint dominance into the first Olympic gold medal of her career. She blew away the field in the women’s 500m in an Olympic-record time of 36.49sec with the kind of controlled, furious circuit that has made her a three-time world champion at the distance at 25 years old.‘The ride was worth the fall’: Lindsey Vonn returning to US for further surgeries after downhill crashRead moreLeerdam took the silver in 37.15sec, inverting the order from their 1000m finish six days earlier, while Japan’s Miko Tahagi repeated her bronze from the 500m with a time of 37.27sec, once again from the early pairs. Erin Jackson,the defending champion, came in fifth and only five hundredths out of the medals.“There was so much pressure and I really wanted to prove to everyone that I could do it,” Kok said. “I was at the starting line in the last pair, so when you finish you know [straight away] if it’s enough or not. I was like: ‘I need to go as fast as I can to that finish line.’ The race was so good. I dreamed of it, but I didn’t know it was that fast.”If the result looked inevitable on paper for Kok, it still required near-perfection on the day. The shortest race in Olympic speed skating offers no space to recover from hesitation: the start must be explosive, the corners exact and the straightaways relentless. Kok thrived in all three phases to cross first by nearly seven-tenths of a second, the widest margin of victory in an Olympic 500m in 54 years.Kok arrived in Milan having shattered Sang-Hwa Lee’s longstanding world record by 0.27sec last November and having not lost a 500m race since 2 February 2024. She hasn’t simply been winning lately so much as obliterating her rivals, taking all six of her World Cup races this season by margins of 0.39, 0.48, 0.49, 0.36, 0.60 and 0.35 seconds. On Sunday, Kok pushed that separation to 0.66 on the biggest stage of all, igniting delirium throughout another Dutch-heavy crowd.Takagi was the first to post a time that affected the medal picture, skating 37.27 from the fourth pair to seize an early lead with a controlled 10.40 opening split. The times tightened steadily from there, with Italy’s Serena Pergher briefly moving into contention at 37.30, while Canada’s Béatrice Lamarche and Poland’s Kaja Ziomek-Nogal both threatened the podium with sub-37.60 laps.The contest truly caught fire in the 12th pair when Leerdam took over the lead with a time of 37.15, built not on an explosive start but on her devastating closing speed, her 26.57 final lap the fastest of the session to that point. Her time survived the next two heats, ensuring her a medal by the time Kok and Jackson stepped to the line for the night’s marquee pairing.Jackson produced the kind of start that has defined her career, exploding from the line in 10.25 – the second-fastest opener of the field – and carrying that speed cleanly through the opening corner. But her overall time of 37.32 as Kok pulled away left her in fifth and off the podium by the narrowest of margins.“Femke has been the person to chase,” Jackson said. “She’s been amazing throughout the season. I was like, ‘OK, there’s still a chance. If I have the perfect race I can probably give her a run for her money.’ I was expecting to land somewhere on the podium today, so to be just off, that’s a little tough, but it is what it is.”Kok’s 10.18 opening split was the fastest of the night and immediately put the Olympic record within reach. Where others faded fractionally through the closing 400m, Kok accelerated, driving through the final corner and stopping the clock at 36.49 – marking the sixth Olympic speed skating record of these Games.Kok’s trip perfectly embodied the technical advantage she has built over her competition: fastest start, fastest overall time and the only skater able to sustain sub-26.5 pace over the final lap of the race. She adds Olympic gold to a trophy case that includes the past three 500m world titles.“The start was pretty good, I think,” Kok said. “I was a little bit shaky, because I had so much pressure and nerves. But when I skated I felt like, ‘OK, it’s going fast’. I just wanted to get to that finish line as fast as I could.”Jackson, who became thefirst Black woman to win individual Winter Olympic goldfour years ago in Beijing, entered the Milano Cortina Games fighting through a season dogged by back and hamstring issues, skating cautiously through parts of the World Cup campaign simply to preserve her body for this moment. Even so, she arrived ranked No 3 in the world and still carrying the aura of the sport’s most explosive starter.“Before the race I was feeling confident, ready to go,” Jackson said. “I got off the line probably the best I have ever. That was my fastest 100m opener, so I was really happy with that.“First corner felt great, in the backstretch, my feet got away from me a little bit. I had a little stumble going into the second corner. I finished as strong as I could. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the race. It sucks to miss out on the podium by so little, especially with a stumble midway through, but that’s racing.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Winter OlympicsSpeed skatingUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But after being substituted at half-time during the disappointingdraw with Brentfordon Thursday, perhaps this competition could help to breathe new life into Eberechi Eze’s Arsenal career.As well as providing assists for Noni Madueke’s and Gabriel Martinelli’s goals – albeit against a poor Wigan side languishing in the League One relegation zone – the England midfielder’s swagger was back for the first time since he scored a hat‑trick in thenorth London derbyin November.Wolves show guts to edge past battling Grimsby and into FA Cup fifth roundRead moreWith doubts over the participation of Martin Ødegaard against Wolves on Wednesday after the captain was not part of the matchday squad on Sunday, and with Kai Havertz expected to miss at least four matches with a muscle injury, it could be a timely return to form for Eze before the rematch with Tottenham next weekend.“That’s what I want from him,” said Mikel Arteta, who confirmed Ødegaard picked up a knock against Brentford and admitted Arsenal’s growing injury list in attacking midfield is a concern.“We are still coping with that, but we need some players back and fit to give us not only numbers but different options in relation to the opponents that we have. The quicker the better.”Glenn Whelan, who is sharing interim management duties at Wigan with Graham Barrow, revealed beforehand that he had been in touch with his former Republic of Ireland teammate Keith Andrews to get some tips about facing Arsenal, the record 14-timeFA Cupwinners, after watching Brentford cut their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points.However, after this thumping kept alive Arsenal’s hopes of an unprecedented quadruple, the former Stoke midfielder might be relieved that their spell is not expected to last much longer. Gary Caldwell is tipped to leave Exeter and return to the club he helped to win the FA Cup in 2013 as a player before managing them to promotion to the Championship three years later.Having picked up only one point from their previous seven league games including a 6-1 hammering by Peterborough that cost Ryan Lowe his job, Wigan’s priorities are clearly elsewhere. They set up in a back five but that was abandoned when Arsenal raced into a 4‑0 lead after only 27 minutes.View image in fullscreenNoni Madueke slots the ball past Sam Tickle to score Arsenal’s first goal.Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesArteta was forced into a change when Riccardo Calafiori picked up an injury in the warmup. That meant Myles Lewis-Skelly was denied a rare opportunity to start in midfield and reverted to left-back as Bukayo Saka was promoted from the bench to an unfamiliar No 10 position earmarked originally for Eze.It did not take for long for Wigan to be overwhelmed by Arsenal’s array of attacking ability. Eze, playing alongside Christian Nørgaard in a deeper midfield role than against Brentford, was given far too much space to pick out a perfect through ball for Madueke and his finish left the goalkeeper, Sam Tickle, flailing.Seven minutes later, Eze repeated the trick but this time the killer pass was executed with his left foot as Martinelli was the grateful beneficiary.Quick GuideFulham advance past StokeShowHarrison Reed's opportunistic finish carried Fulham into the fifth round of the FA Cup as they came from behind to defeat the Championship strugglers Stoke 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium.Stoke have not won a game since seeing off Coventry in the previous round, but started well against a Fulham side showing 10 changes from their midweek defeat by Manchester City.The South Korean midfielder Bae Jun-ho capped a fine move by putting Mark Robins's team ahead after 19 minutes but they were overpowered as their Premier League opponents settled after the interval.The Brazilian winger Kevin got his reward for a livewire performance in the 55th minute, sending a first-time effort into the bottom corner after cutting in from the left, and a self-inflicted error cost the hosts dear with six minutes remaining.Under siege for long periods, goalkeeper Tommy Simkin attempted a short pass to Tatsuki Seko, who was caught daydreaming by Reed, Fulham's captain for the day. He collected the ball as Seko tumbled to the turf, finished calmly and sealed the London club's place in the next stage.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Jack Hunt – the veteran who spent three seasons at Palace more than a decade ago but never made a first-team appearance – was the unfortunate culprit when Saka and Madueke combined to devastating effect down the right. Gabriel Jesus should have finished it but Hunt’s untimely header left the 35‑year‑old cursing his luck. He was caught out again by Nørgaard’s long pass to pick out Jesus and this time the Brazilian made no mistake. “Are you Tottenham in disguise?” the Arsenal fans mocked.Hunt’s miserable afternoon was completed soon after when he was withdrawn for Matt Smith – a product of Arsenal’s academy – as Whelan switched to a back four. At least they made it to half-time without conceding again, although Wigan’s mascot, Crusty the Pie, was on the end of a 3-1 penalty shootout defeat by a jubilant Gunnersaurus during the break.Saka, who returned from a hip injury against Brentford, made way for Viktor Gyökeres for the second half as Arsenal went back on the attack. The Sweden striker struck the post from Ben White’s pass before Eze fired into the side netting after a mazy run. Marli Salmon, a highly rated 16-year-old central defender who has already played in the Champions League, was brought on for William Saliba to make his home debut with half an hour to play and shifted across to right‑back when Ben White was taken off after receiving treatment.Martinelli now has 10 goals in the FA Cup and Champions League this season but he and Eze were both denied another by outstanding saves from Tickle as Wigan managed to limit the damage that had already been done. “A little tweak made a big difference,” Barrow said. “We’ve got to stick together and move on.”Explore more on these topicsFA CupArsenalWigan Athleticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The Italianjoined on 2 Septemberfrom Paris Saint-Germain for £26m and became Guardiola’s first choice.Guéhi scores first Manchester City goal but Guardiola labels Salford win ‘boring’Read moreWhile Trafford started all of City’s opening three Premier League games of the season in August, he has not done so since in the competition, with his other eight appearances being in the FA Cup, Carabao Cup and the Champions League.Trafford joined the club aged 12 in 2015 and, afterCity’s 2-0 win over Salfordin the FA Cup fourth round, he was asked about returning. “Yeah, it’s been good,” he said. “I didn’t expect the situation [with Donnarumma] to happen but it happened, so just get on with it. So it’s happened so I work very hard every day and see what happens, give it my best shot.”Before Donnarumma joined, Trafford was not informed he would be the No 1. “No, it wasn’t that,” he said. “So it is what it is. It’s football, you’ve got to keep grafting every day and the games that come, play as hard as you can. This is just another experience to add to my career and it has been a good learning experience.”While agreeing a five-year contract with an option of an extra year, Trafford is uncertain if he will remain at the club beyond the summer. “Who knows, it’s football. Let’s take it a day at a time and try and work as hard as I can and whatever happens, happens,” he said. “I’ve obviously got a contract, so don’t know what happens next season. I just know that I’ll just take it a day at a time and try and improve.”Trafford was called into Thomas Tuchel’s England squad in November after Nick Pope dropped out, but has had no conversation with the manager regarding his prospects of going to the World Cup in June.“No, obviously everyone knows what’s going on with me,” he said. “So I’ve just got to, whenever I play, play as well as I can. I haven’t spoken to them about if that’s enough, but I play as well as I can and train every day very hard and it’s just down to me.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CitynewsShareReuse this content"

The scale of celebration that met Rangers’ victory decreed they had not defeated also-rans. Danny Röhl, theRangersmanager, went cavorting down the touchline as his team scored a fourth.This proved the game of the season in Scotland. A genuine thriller. It was also one Rangers dare not lose; that they took three points properly fuels hopes of snatching the league from Celtic’s grasp. An inspired second half from Rangers was sufficient as their visitors wilted.As if to prove nothing in this city happens in isolation, it was also pertinent that Celtic had scored a 97th‑minute winner at Kilmarnock before Rangers andHeartskicked off. Hearts lead Rangers by two with Celtic, who have a game in hand, a further point back.Should Rangers prevail in May, some apologies will be due towards Kevin Thelwell. The former Rangers sporting director was ridiculed for bestowing £8m on Everton for the services of Youssef Chermiti last summer. As Chermiti toiled during his early months in blue, Thelwell lost his job. A double at Celtic Park in January, coupled with this hat-trick against Hearts, means Chermiti has discovered a useful knack of being the man for the big occasion. Thelwell might yet have the last laugh.“We fully deserved over the 90 minutes to win,” Röhl said. “We have developed a lot of resilience since I came here.” The German was keen to point out Rangers’ points haul since he was appointed in October is the best in the league. He seemed to take umbrage with criticism of his team selection for the draw at Motherwell on Wednesday night. Recovery in the Hearts fixture meant the 36-year-old was in the mood to jab back.How Hearts respond to this blow will be fascinating. Context must be applied. Chermiti’s transfer fee remains a multiple of what the Edinburgh club will spend on anyone. Hearts have rattled the Old Firm over a matter of months, merely at the start of a journey as assisted by Tony Bloom and world-renowned analytics. They may well have to learn to lose before they can win. Back-to-back home games – Falkirk and Aberdeen visit Tynecastle – provide scope for Hearts to prove they can rebound from the ropes.Rangers host Celtic on the second of those weekends. Writing off Hearts’ challenge at this point would be both folly and premature. They have delivered the story of this campaign.Derek McInnes, the Hearts manager, said his players reminded each other of their league position in the dressing room as the dust settled before he had to.“We don’t feel as if we are going to go anywhere,” McInnes said. “We are disappointed, clearly, but not too despondent. There is still a lot to win and we are still in it.”Hearts had an early blow with the loss of Oisin McEntee, who damaged his shoulder with an awkward landing. The Irishman’s replacement, Michael Steinwender, slashed the ball into his own net after a Mikey Moore close‑range effort had rebounded from the Hearts bar.View image in fullscreenHearts’ lead at the top the Scottish Premiership is down to two points after defeat against their closest chasers, Rangers.Photograph: Russell Cheyne/ReutersHearts were a goal up by that point, Marc Leonard the gleeful recipient of an Emmanuel Fernandez pass intended for Nico Raskin. Leonard played a one-two with the excellent Cláudio Braga before slamming home. Hearts snatched the lead again through Braga, who met Steinwender’s cross while beating John Souttar to a header. An expectant Ibrox was silenced.Parity was restored by the interval. Craig Halkett dived to block a Chermiti shot when the centre-back may as well have stayed on his feet. After the ball flew back to him via Halkett’s back, Chermiti was handed a second try; this time he made no mistake.The simplicity of Rangers’ third will infuriate McInnes just as it is bound to delight Rohl. Andreas Skov Olsen – whose afternoon was otherwise notable for two comedic dives – found the unmarked Chermiti at the near post. The striker still had to leap and connect; he did precisely that to leave Alexander Schwolow helpless.Hearts never really looked like summoning an equaliser. Rangers added gloss to their win through the man of the moment, who strode on to Djeidi Gassama’s pass after a rapid counterattack. Cue bedlam. “I always believe in him,” Röhl said of Chermiti. “My job is now to keep him hungry and he will be hungry because he’ll want to score more. Big games are for big players and today he showed how big he is.”Rangers believe they can win this title all right. Hearts’ motivation will derive from showing their race is far from run. Stand by for more, much more, twisting and turning.Explore more on these topicsScottish PremiershipRangersHeartsmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Television footage suggested there was no contact between the players. Juventus, down to 10 men after the sending off, lost 3-2, meaning Inter are now eight points clear at the top.“We are very sorry about the incident, about La Penna’s decision, which was clearly wrong, and about the fact that VAR could not be used to rectify it,” Rocchi told Italian news agency Ansa. “La Penna is mortified and we are close to him, but I have to tell you the truth that he is not the only one who made a mistake, because yesterday there was clear simulation.”Kalulu made the VAR gesture as he protested his marching orders, but the league’s protocol prevents the use of VAR in yellow card situations, including for second yellows that lead to sendings off.The Juventus coach, Luciano Spalletti, and the director Giorgio Chiellini later confronted La Penna in the tunnel. “Something completely unacceptable happened today, it doesn’t matter whether it happens to us or someone else, and from tomorrow presumably VAR will have to change, because this is not acceptable that so many errors keep happening even in big games like this,” Chiellini told Sky Italia.TheNapolidebutant Alisson Santos scored a late equaliser as theSerie Achampions snatched a 2-2 home draw againstRomaon Sunday to keep them third in the Serie A standings and maintain their unbeaten home record in the Italian league this season.View image in fullscreenAlisson Santos fires home Napoli’s late equaliser against Roma.Photograph: Fabio Rossi/AS Roma/Getty ImagesThe Brazilian, coming on as a substitute for his first league outing since moving from the Portuguese side Sporting, thrashed home a powerful shot eight minutes from the end to keepNapolithree points ahead of fourth-placed Roma.The visitors looked on course to dislodge their hosts as the striker Donyell Malen continued his scoring spree since arriving in Serie A with a double.

But after scoring a last‑gasp equaliser to take the tie to extra time and then a penalty shootout, Birmingham could draw some consolation from pushing their top-flight opponents.Sean Longstaff converted the clinching penalty, after Patrick Roberts, who had scored in the 89th minute to gain parity for Birmingham, blasted his kick over the crossbar; the Leeds goalkeeper Lucas Perri also saved from Tommy Doyle, Birmingham’s best player.Wolves show guts to edge past battling Grimsby and into FA Cup fifth roundRead moreThe home side’s status, two points outside the Championship playoff zone, means this result would not have counted as an embarrassment. Leeds are consolidating back in the Premier League and have now lost only once in seven games – and thatagainst Arsenal– and here they showed the character to recover from a shoddy first half to make it through to the next round.There was a sense that Birmingham needed to score while Leeds were so poor. Facundo Buonanotte, on his full debut for the visiting side after joining on loan from Brighton, typified their ineffectiveness and was withdrawn at half-time.“No question Birmingham were the better side in the first half,” the Leeds manager, Daniel Farke, said. “We had rotated more players than we would normally do and had a lot of offensive players on the field, so if you don’t dominate the ball, you can get outmuscled. We changed it for the second half and [Ethan] Ampadu gave us more physicality.”Jay Stansfield, Birmingham’s top scorer, had produced a superb left‑footed half‑volley that would have nestled in the top corner if Perri had not tipped the ball on to the post early on. Ibrahim Osman also shot against the inside of a post, Kanya Fujimoto unable to convert the rebound, with the last action of regulation time.Both teams had made six changes to their starting lineups from Tuesday night league action but, even after Leeds led through Lukas Nmecha, this felt like a special day for Birmingham. They wore a bespoke kit for the match, replicating the blue with a white central stripe first worn by the team of the former England striker Bob Latchford in 1971-72, and the crowd were impassioned throughout.View image in fullscreenBirmingham’s players, in their retro shirts, react to their shootout defeat.Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty ImagesLeeds had to weather a storm, on and off the pitch. Birmingham, bolstered by six signings in the January window, have strength in depth and, in St Andrew’s, the archetypal fortress. They have lost only once in 40 league games at home.The regular Leeds captain, Ethan Ampadu, came on for the second half and changed the complexion of the game; the Premier League side adapted their mentality as well as their shape. Within four minutes they were ahead.There was a question over offside when Noah Okafor played the ball in for Nmecha but, in the absence of a video assistant referee until the next round of this competition, the striker was able to capitalise on Christoph Klarer’s slip and strike his seventh goal of the season inside the near post.Quick GuideFulham advance past StokeShowHarrison Reed's opportunistic finish carried Fulham into the fifth round of the FA Cup as they came from behind to defeat the Championship strugglers Stoke 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium.Stoke have not won a game since seeing off Coventry in the previous round, but started well against a Fulham side showing 10 changes from their midweek defeat by Manchester City.The South Korean midfielder Bae Jun-ho capped a fine move by putting Mark Robins's team ahead after 19 minutes but they were overpowered as their Premier League opponents settled after the interval.The Brazilian winger Kevin got his reward for a livewire performance in the 55th minute, sending a first-time effort into the bottom corner after cutting in from the left, and a self-inflicted error cost the hosts dear with six minutes remaining.Under siege for long periods, goalkeeper Tommy Simkin attempted a short pass to Tatsuki Seko, who was caught daydreaming by Reed, Fulham's captain for the day. He collected the ball as Seko tumbled to the turf, finished calmly and sealed the London club's place in the next stage.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Birmingham did not lose belief, though Leeds had become a different proposition. With Dominic Calvert-Lewin and, especially, Brenden Aaronson coming on to add to their counterattacking threat, the chances of a Cup upset appeared to be receding – especially with Osman, on as a substitute, spurning a series of presentable chances from the left.With a minute of regulation time remaining, a corner was recycled to Roberts who let fly, left-footed, from 25 yards. The ball flicked off James Justin and past Perri to take the tie into extra time and penalties.Farke conceded that this was “far from champagne football” but he was proud that his Leeds side “showed again resilience”.Chris Davies, the Birmingham manager, expressed pride in his team but struck a note of disappointment at the result.“I’m proud of [my players],” Davies said. “Of course there’s a tinge of frustration because I thought we were deserved winners.

They went into thisFA Cupfourth‑round tie on the back of a 10-game unbeaten run in all competitions to encourage hopes of promotion in the coming weeks. But the Uruguayan defender Bueno was on hand to connect with João Gomes’ teasing right-wing cross with a decisive goal on the hour.On a quagmire of a pitch, Wolves showed guts to eke out the win. Edwards, holding court in the mud on the edge of the pitch afterwards, jokingly called it “quite an aggressive game of headers and volleys”.The Wolves head coach said: “It was an interesting game in really difficult conditions – for both teams – and a bit of a throwback. We showed really good spirit and fight, did the basics well, and came through it.“In a way for us, it was great that Grimsby were able to do what they did against Manchester United earlier in the season because we could lean on that and use it. It was about completely respecting the opposition and we had that fight today and showed a good mentality.“This is a competition that I absolutely love and sitting watching the FA Cup final with my dad when I was young, I loved it. I’ve never been lucky enough to go really far in it, so nothing would please me more than being able to progress further.“It’s been a really dark season, I suppose, so this is something for the fans to shout about and gives us some momentum going forward.”In front of a bumper 8,594 crowd, there was no hiding place for Wolves – not that there was any suggestion they were looking to do so. The game began in freezing temperatures and driving rain but the hosts almost led inside the opening 45 seconds when Charles Vernam cut inside from the left flank and fired a low shot just wide.It was a classic FA Cup tie and had all the makings of an upset, but Wolves showed glimpses of their class. Gomes fired against the crossbar before the break, but Grimsby continued to battle gamely.View image in fullscreenWolves’ Adam Armstrong is tackled in atrocious conditions at Blundell Park.Photograph: Scott Heppell/ReutersRoared on by their vociferous support, David Artell’s men could not make the breakthrough and the crucial opener went to Wolves in the 60th minute.

There was little in the way of the magic of the Cup, but to their credit 9,879 spectators created a decent atmosphere all the same.Perri makes key save as Leeds sink Birmingham in FA Cup shootoutRead more“We lost 2-0 last season when we played here so we expected a tough game,” said Le Bris, who argued his side had approached the contest with “real ambition”.Oxford’s physical strengths made defending long balls to the edge of the box “an important part of the game”, Le Bris said: “One we dealt with better in the second half, but we scored, which is always important and the game was well managed.”Matt Bloomfield, the Oxford manager, made nine changes from the team beaten by their Championship relegation rivals Norwich in midweek, and called the performance “remarkably improved”.There was a home debut for Jamie Donley, lining up alongside his fellow Tottenham loanee, Will Lankshear, 20.Despite their relative youth, both players shared the same physical quality as their teammates: a broad‑shouldered profile that allowed Oxford to effectively contest the physical duels and gave the team a foothold in the match. This was made easier still by the willingness of a scratch Sunderland side to play at a soporific tempo after Le Bris himself made six changes from the defeat at home against Liverpool.Donley had the game’s opening chance in the 18th minute, and the opportunity was served up by Lankshear. Making connection with one of the many long balls aimed over the top of Sunderland’s improvised defensive pairing of Luke O’Nien and Nordi Mukiele, Lankshear held possession and teed up Donley who found the space to hit a left‑foot effort that Robin Roefs could only punch clear.With no more threat forthcoming from the home side, however, Sunderland opened the scoring on the half-hour with one of their first forays upfield. A bundling challenge by Christ Makosso on Dennis Cirkin sent the Sunderland man to the floor in the box and with no video assistant referee there was no chance to pick over a foul that seemed rather soft when watching in the ground. The referee, Thomas Kirk, was immediate in his decision and Diarra rolled a bobbling penalty into the right hand corner of Matthew Ingram’s net. “One-nil to the referee”, sang the home fans almost straight away, the sense of any hope for this match already draining away.Oxford created another decent chance for themselves before half-time and it came from another direct approach, this time a Will Vaulks long throw. After winning the first contact in the box, the ball sprung out to Makosso who was in enough space to time his effort but could only steer a header wide of Roefs’s far post.Quick GuideFulham advance past StokeShowHarrison Reed's opportunistic finish carried Fulham into the fifth round of the FA Cup as they came from behind to defeat the Championship strugglers Stoke 2-1 at the bet365 Stadium.Stoke have not won a game since seeing off Coventry in the previous round, but started well against a Fulham side showing 10 changes from their midweek defeat by Manchester City.The South Korean midfielder Bae Jun-ho capped a fine move by putting Mark Robins's team ahead after 19 minutes but they were overpowered as their Premier League opponents settled after the interval.The Brazilian winger Kevin got his reward for a livewire performance in the 55th minute, sending a first-time effort into the bottom corner after cutting in from the left, and a self-inflicted error cost the hosts dear with six minutes remaining.Under siege for long periods, goalkeeper Tommy Simkin attempted a short pass to Tatsuki Seko, who was caught daydreaming by Reed, Fulham's captain for the day. He collected the ball as Seko tumbled to the turf, finished calmly and sealed the London club's place in the next stage.PA MediaWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Those hoping for an injection of energy after half-time were to be disappointed. The tempo remained gentle and the play slow, so it was perhaps no surprise to see Sunderland take a tight grip on the game. Around the hour mark the visitors should have at least doubled their lead, with Romaine Mundle, Chemsdine Talbi, Trai Hume and Mukiele forcing Ingram into instinctive saves in consecutive minutes.The goal did not come, however, and Jamie McDonnell, on as an Oxford substitute, could have upset the applecart but he shot over when well placed in the box following another long throw. There was one final Vaulks projectile as the clock ticked towards 90 minutes, but it came off the unfortunate Makosso’s toe.Bloomfield said his side had lacked the rub of the green, lamenting not only the penalty but a Lankshear break that was pulled up for a marginal offside. “We’re not getting these decisions at the minute, I’ve been told we’ve been getting a lot of decisions against us,” he said. “But when we come in on Tuesday we’re going to work hard because we want to repeat this level of performance.“For us it’s about finding consistency, we have to do that between now and the end of the season to get the results we know we’re capable of.”View image in fullscreenHabib Diarra scores the winner for Sunderland.Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images/ReutersExplore more on these topicsFA CupOxford UnitedSunderlandmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Lauren James inspired Sonia Bompastor’s side to victory at Kingsmeadow, setting up Sjoeke Nüsken’s opener before making sure of the result with a goal in the second half.It has been a turbulent month for the Blues on and off the pitch. Back-to-backdefeats against Arsenaland Manchester City all but ended their title defence and it was announced last week that the club hadparted ways with Paul Green, their long-term head of women’s football.Chelsea 2-0 Liverpool, Aston Villa 3-7 Tottenham and more: WSL clockwatch – as it happenedRead moreThe news sent shockwaves through the game. Green had been part of the fabric of Chelsea for the past 13 years, playing an instrumental role in the success that included 19 trophies.A hard-fought victory against a re-energised Liverpool was much needed respite as Chelsea battle to play Champions League football again next season.“It was a tough week,” Bompastor said. “We are all humans and it hurts when you lose a member of your staff. It was an emotional week for everyone … I think we did well considering everything that happened. Being able to come here, focus on the game, put in the performance and get the result proved a lot about our character. I am proud of my players and all the members of my staff.”Asked whether she was happy with the decision not to replace Green, she said: “We have had many conversations with the CEO and the sporting directors. I think we are on board with what we want to do for Chelsea’s future.“I felt a lot of support from them since I joined and I feel the support right now. The fact that they were able to extend my contract in the period where the results were a little more difficult shows a lot.“My main focus is trying to perform at our best level and try and give clarity to the players for them to perform at their best. Getting good results helps a lot.”Chelsea had to remain patient against a buoyant Liverpool side who travelled to Kingsmeadow on the back of a big win against Aston Villa. Gareth Taylor made only one change from that success, bringing in the more defensive-minded Alice Bergström for Mia Enderby.View image in fullscreenSjoeke Nüsken slots home Chelsea’s opener in the 40th minute.Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images/ReutersBompastor equally made one change to the Chelsea team who hadbeaten Tottenhamlast weekend. An injury to the captain, Millie Bright, forced the manager into switching her backline around, bringing Sandy Baltimore in at left-back.The hosts had to weather early pressure as Liverpool started the better. Positive in and out of possession, Taylor’s side had an early goal from Bergström disallowed for handball while the tireless Ceri Holland tested Hannah Hampton.Chelsea struggled to gain momentum. Despite having more of the ball, they were careless with it, disrupted by Liverpool’s high press, and lacked movement in the box. VeerleBuurman and Naomi Girma had efforts blocked while Erin Cuthbert was denied a goal thanks to superb defending by Alejandra Bernabé, but clearcut chances were hard to come by.That was, however, until James sparked into life. It has been a frustrating season for the 24-year-old, who has made only six starts because of injury, but when fit she remains one of the best in the league. She was instrumental in Chelsea taking the lead just before the break, losing her defender before floating in a pinpoint cross that picked out the run of Nüsken at the near post.Liverpool then produced a series of chances. Cornelia Kapocs sent a shot just wide while Martha Thomas had two big opportunities that came and went.Just as the visitors looked as if they were going to find a way back into the game, James struck with one of her trademark moves. With 25 minutes left to play, she cut inside before unleashing a curling right-footed shot that gave Jennifer Falk no chance. She wheeled away to celebrate with her fingers in her ears, a clear signal about shutting out the noise.It was a strike that took the sting out of Liverpool’s defences and they failed to mount a challenge in the closing stages. Chelsea, meanwhile, could breathe a sigh of relief having navigated a difficult situation to remain third in the table. Focus now turns to a difficult tie against Manchester United in the fifth round of the Women’s FA Cup next weekend.Explore more on these topicsWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballChelsea WomenLiverpool FC WomennewsShareReuse this content"

Outside is the narrow shelf that the co-owner Lucy Tallant, the DIY enthusiast of the pair, attached to the wall for those wanting to hang around outside. As she worked on that shelf, two girls walked past and one proclaimed: “Yeah, they’re opening a lesbian club.” “A lesbian club?” replied the other, “Yeah, there’s one outside now.”Lucy was in stitches, and so was social media when she posted about what she had overheard. The shelf has become a thing, with lesbians posing for photographs and then sharing online with versions of “there’s one outside now” as the caption.Leicester and Liverpool locked in tense race to avoid WSL relegation playoffRead moreCrossbar has taken on a life of its own in the few months since Lucy and her wife, Pippa Tallant, announced to their 12 followers on Instagram, all their close friends, that they were opening the first women’s sports bar in the UK. They don’t like the camera but they thought they had better announce and get it out of the way. “So, we just filmed it, one take, and were like: ‘Nobody will see this, I’ll just put it up there and then it will be buried and we’ll do a normal post once we open’,” says Pippa.The problem is, it was an idea whose time had come and far more eyes saw it than they expected. Since they announced the opening on social media at the start of December, they now have more than 17,000 followers on Instagram without really trying, people clicking to follow the renovation.Before the opening on 6 February, a tour revealed there were no tables and chairs yet, there were still plumbers and electricians in, boxes were placed strategically to keep their two dogs out of trouble and the Guardian’s interview was conducted in one of the two upstairs function rooms, the Clubhouse, which has white paint flecks all over the floor that are keeping Pippa up at night. The bar door is Lucy’s nemesis – stripping, sanding and painting it a battle they post about online.View image in fullscreenCrossbar, the UK’s first dedicated women’s sports bar, opened in early February.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThe bar was Lucy’s idea and she had spent so many many years talking about doing it that Pippa started to fear the repercussions if someone else got there first. “I’d been toying around with this idea for a long time within our friend group, over a few bottles of wine, and we’d all have a little moan about why there isn’t a female-centric space, but also somewhere that supported women’s sports,” says Lucy. “That theme sort of grew and grew until Pip got fed up hearing about it.”The2025 European Championshipwas the turning point, but not because that tournament demonstrated the growth of interest in women’s sports but because of how “the next day, it just drops off,” says Lucy. “There’s all these people that have come out, that care, that are excited and celebrating and then days later it’s like it hasn’t happened, and that felt quite weird.”It got serious from there. They started looking at possible premises and Pippa was still somewhat in denial, until they stepped into an unloved and empty bar on the corner of Upper North Street and Regent Hill. “We walked in here and I was like: ‘I can see it working here. Oh my God, this actually might happen’,” says Pippa.It was the deep green tiles behind the bar, the black and white ones on the floor in front of the bar, the hardwood floors, the function rooms, the space for the pool table, the floor-to-ceiling windows in the Clubhouse and the exposed brick in the smaller Boot Room function space that made “the bones of this place feel like the right kind of thing,” says Pippa.View image in fullscreenGetting the Crossbar up and running has been a labour of love.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianPippa wasn’t a big football watcher: she liked playing sport but if they were going to watch she would want to do it at home whereas Lucy preferred a pub. “There was a barrier there. Where could we go that would have an atmosphere you would enjoy with a few friends or just the two of us for a decent period of time?” she says.There is another issue facing fans of women’s sports, not just female fans, all fans, adds Lucy, who also coachesBrighton Seagals FC, the inclusive team that the comedian Maisie Adam plays for. “You often have to run around to multiple venues to see if someone’s showing it. Either it’s just ‘no’ or you get a yes but then you get there and it’s either on on the smallest screen in the corner with no sound or they’ve changed the channel because someone wanted something else,” she says. “That’s a recurring story and it’s problematic for the growth of women’s sports across the board.”They won’t show only women’s sports, though. The pub’s tagline is: “The best place to watch women’s sport, and the best place for women to watch sport”. They were granted a late licence, so they could screen the Super Bowl and will be showing the World Cup in the summer because the bar is a safe space for anyone wanting to watch sport, but women’s sport is the priority.One day later and the Guardian is back for Crossbar’s launch. The doors opened at 4pm and it’s already buzzing. Lucy and Pippa had shared their fears about ticket sales for opening night, but they sold out within four minutes.“I’ve been waiting for a place that really focuses and appreciates women’s sport because I’m a huge fan of women’s football,” says one of the early patrons, Popsy Greader-Palme. “I’m so glad that there is a dedicated space where people can feel safe and watch women’s football, women’s sport, without feeling judged.”Another visitor to Crossbar is Serena Ferguson. “I was never interested in football but my girlfriend got into it and I started watching a bit more and going to games with her,” she says. “I feel like this space is the perfect place for people like me, who want a nicer environment to enjoy the sport instead of going to a shitty bar where there’s a load of lads waiting for the game to be turned over so they can get what they want on.”View image in fullscreenVisitors to the Crossbar enjoying the sport and good company.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThe three spaces make it a place where lots of different groups can go. It’s called the Clubhouse because Pippa and Lucy hope that teams will want to adopt it as a place to go and hang out.For the co-owners there is joy in seeing it take off so quickly. “I love that already this feels like a space that someone could come by themselves to watch something at 11pm on a Sunday and have a great time and feel already comfortable,” says Lucy after Super Bowl night.View image in fullscreenThere are photographs of women’s sporting achievements around Crossbar.Photograph: Peter Flude/The GuardianThey have funded the bar themselves, Pippa investing her inheritance after the death of her mother. “It’s not been super scary in that sense, because it’s not money we had originally,” she says. “Later in life my mum’s attitude towards money was: ‘Don’t sit on it, do something’.“I don’t know how she would feel about a women’s sports bar, I don’t know if she’d get it, but us doing something for us and trying something new I think she’d be really excited about. ”The pressure instead comes from doing right by those women who are desperate for a space like this. “We want the community of people that are already excited about the bar to feel well looked after and like it’s how they wanted it to be,” says Lucy.Explore more on these topicsFootballWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It ended up being a great week here, a place where I always feel really, really good. I was just a step short the previous years, so it feels great to finally be able to lift the title.”The sport’s top-two powerhouses may not have been in the Netherlands this week, but Auger-Aliassime had been in the form of his life, having destroyed Alexander Bublik in the semis in what he felt was a near-perfect performance.But De Minaur, the first to make it to three-straight finals at the Ahoy Arena tournament, found a completely new level after some slightly chequered form during the week as he took just 77 minutes to become only the second Australian winner in the prestigious tournament’s 54-year history.Emulating 2004 winner Lleyton Hewitt, De Minaur never let indoor specialist Auger-Aliassime settle from the start as he attacked aggressively and dominated the baseline exchanges.He still needed two scintillating passes to finally crack Auger-Aliassime’s serve in the sixth game, but then never relented.In his semi-final slog against Ugo Humbert, De Minaur had only managed three winners; this time, he uncorked 10 beauties, while the Canadian, with all his superior firepower, managed only six.The Canadian was just not allowed to revisit the dazzling form he had shown all week thanks to De Minaur’s constant pressing – and near the end, it seemed his eight-win streak might have taken too much out of him as he needed treatment for an apparent hip problem.That, though, shouldn’t detract from De Minaur’s exceptional performance as he outplayed the man with whom he’s enjoyed a 10-match rivalry since they were kids. Auger-Aliassime had held a 6-3 win record, but admitted this time: “Alex was just a bit too good.”“For sure, it was my best tennis of the week, and that’s what it’s all about, just doing my best to rise up to the occasion,” said de Minaur, who ended up with three breaks but didn’t give up a single break point on his own delivery.It was his fifth triumph in an ATP 500 event – the tournaments directly below Masters and grand slam level in which he’s won more matches than anyone (53) since the start of 2023.Explore more on these topicsTennisAustralia sportAlex de MinaurnewsShareReuse this content"

But we were patient, we kept the vibe up. We kept very positive because we knew we were going to have opportunities to come.”It was not quite a perfect day for Team GB, however.

India coasted to victory in what became global cricket’s most lucrative mismatch after a superlative innings from the opener Ishan Kishanskewed it definitively in their favour.In its second half a game that was dramatically offand then on againbecame one where a parade of Pakistan batters were dramatically in and then out again. Chasing a target of 176 they were seven down before they even got halfway, and were eventually skittled for 114 to lose by 61 runs.India v Pakistan: Cricket T20 World Cup – as it happenedRead moreKishan’s innings was a glorious anomaly, the 27-year-old thriving on a surface with which few came to terms. Only one other player struck more than three fours; Kishan hit 10. No one else produced more than a single six; Kishan managed three. In all he hit 77 runs off 40 balls, the extent to which he stood out illustrated by the fact that when he was dismissed he had scored 88.5% of his team’s runs.“Ishan thought something out of the box. Someone needed to take responsibility and he did that amazingly,” Suryakumar Yadav, the India captain, said.Pakistan won the toss and very little else. Yadav said he had been planning to bat first anyway, but for Salman Agha a turning pitch was a gift that he could not wait to unwrap. The Pakistan captain insisted on getting his hands on it before anyone else, bowling himself at the start of the match – the first time in eight games this year that he has bowled at all – and for a few halcyon moments his team were on top.That opening over brought only one run and the wicket of Abhishek Sharma, who came into the tournament as the most feared batter in world cricket but in two World Cup appearances has now faced five balls and not scored. Perhaps things would have been different had Salman’s luck not flipped in his second over, when Kishan twice miscued the ball into the air: the first time it flew just too far for the fielder at backward point to reach, the second it flew not quite far enough for the man at long-on to catch.Pakistan’s array of spinners – they bowled only two overs of seam – rarely discomforted Kishan after that. “Our spinners had an off day,” Salman said. “The pitch played better in the second innings but we did not bowl according to the situation and we did not apply ourselves with the bat.”View image in fullscreenBabar Azam (right) is bowled by Axar Patel for five as Pakistan’s top order collapses against India.Photograph: Lahiru Harshana/ReutersBut while Kishan was motoring at nearly two runs a ball, Tilak Varma at the other end was barely managing one, as did Yadav after his dismissal. It was clear from those batters’ travails that India had posted a challenging target, and Pakistan’s chances of overhauling it existed only briefly. It would be tempting to note that their response started in the worst possible fashion were it not for the fact that if anything it got worse after that.Hardik Pandya started and finished it, opening proceedings with a wicket maiden, and ending them by ripping out Usman Tariq’s middle stump with the last ball of the 18th over. Jasprit Bumrah bowled the second over of the innings and after he dismissed Saim Ayub with his second ball, a brilliant inswinging yorker, for the second time in the game Salman was required to lead by example. He flubbed his fourth delivery, in a slow and miserable arc, to Pandya at mid-on. Realistically, for Pakistan to have stood any kind of chance, they needed their top four to produce at least one lasting partnership. Those key batters combined scored 15 off 17.Victory confirms the co-hosts’ qualification for the Super Eights with a game to spare, and if the extent of this defeat means that, with one game to play, Pakistan sit below USA in the Group A standings on net run rate, however, they will only surrender their place in the next round if they lose their final match to Namibia across town at the Sinhalese Sports Club on Wednesday.“We have a game in a couple of days and we have to look forward to it,” Salman said. “We need to win that and qualify. Then it is a new tournament.”Explore more on these topicsT20 World Cup 2026India cricket teamPakistan cricket teamT20 World CupTwenty20CricketnewsShareReuse this content"

He had been keeping it stashed in a spare sock in his top drawer since the moment he took it off that evening. As soon as it is out, he has a second one to put back in its place.The 28-year-old Weston became the first British athlete in history to win two medals at a singleWinter Olympics, after he and his 25‑year‑old teammate Tabitha Stoecker won the inaugural Olympic mixed team skeleton race in a combined time of 1min 59.36sec, 0.17sec ahead of the German pair of Axel Jungk and Susanne Kreher.GB chiefs hail greatest Winter Olympics day after super Sunday delivers two goldsRead moreThe mixed team event is new for the Olympics. The fastest men and women from each country are paired together, and then race the track back-to-back for a combined time. The key difference from the regular race is that the mixed team event uses a reaction start in which the racers have to set off as soon as a light randomly turns off. There were two false starts among the 15 teams, but it did not make too much difference to Weston, who has dominated this field all week.“I’m extremely proud of what I’ve been able to achieve in the past couple of days, especially to win the first-ever team event,” Weston said. “It’s absolutely amazing, I’m over the moon, buzzing, and I’ve got no idea what’s next, to be honest. Probably the pub I guess.”They have plenty to celebrate. Weston and Stoecker describe themselves as each other’s best friends, her boyfriend is going to be the best man at his wedding later this summer. Weston said: “It’s like a family, really, because we all spend so much time with each other.”It took another astonishing run by Weston to pull it off. He and Stoecker were the very last pair to race, and by the time they started the track record had already been broken five times in a row.View image in fullscreenMatt Weston celebrates at the end of his decisive run.Photograph: Annegret Hilse/ReutersStoecker had a lightning-fast start, but made a couple of mistakes in the second half of her run that meant Weston needed to make up three-tenths of a second if they were going to overtake Jungk and Kreher. It might sound like the blink of an eye to you and I, but it is a huge deficit in a sport that comes down to hundredths of a second.“I’ve got a lot of trust in him,” Stoecker said. “He’s the individual Olympic champ, and his standard of sliding is insane, so I had a lot of faith that he was going to lay down another exceptional run, but it’s always nerve-racking when you have to watch the clock.”Up at the top of the track, Weston had pulled his helmet down low to stop him from watching Stoecker’s splits. “All I was doing was listening to my coach telling me the timings, and all I could think of was: ‘Don’t false start.’”He shot off the line in 0.12sec, the fastest reaction time of any of the 30 athletes competing. “The flow that he has on the sled, it’s just unmatched, so from about halfway down I could feel that the gold was coming,” Stoecker said. So could everyone else watching.Weston is so smooth on the sled he moves down the run like a bullet along the barrel of a gun. “I was just staying very calm, trying to be as boring as possible. Just tick the boxes, get the job done, and hopefully that will be enough.” It was more than that.Even then, Weston being the man he is, he was still nitpicking at what he could have done differently. “I think on corner nine, I wasn’t exactly smooth coming out …” he began, when Stoecker cut in over the top of him. “Stop it, Matt! Stop it! You don’t need to do that any more! You’ve got six months off!”Not to mention two gold medals. Weston laughed. “Yeah, all right, I’ve been told off now.” The only bittersweet note to it was that they knocked their friends and teammates Freya Tarbit and Marcus Wyatt down into fourth sport.Only one other British athlete has won two gold medals in the Winter Olympics, and that was Lizzy Yarnold, who won the women’s skeleton in both 2014 and 2018.“I mean, there’s some great names in the British Winter Olympic history, I think to even consider putting my name next to those is a massive honour,” Weston said. “A lot of those guys have been a massive inspiration. Especially within the sliding sports as well. The success that they’ve had has only opened the door for us.”Explore more on these topicsWinter Olympics 2026Team GBWinter OlympicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In an era where world-class athletes tend to wrap themselves in cotton wool for fear of injury it was unusual to see one so accomplished run an additional three times in three hours when there was no particular need.That Azu triumphed – in a personal best of 20.77sec – came as little surprise given his accolades include world and European 60m gold medals. He will defend the first of those at the World Athletics Indoor Championships next month.With Keely Hodgkinson opting not to take her place in the 800m final, and the Olympic medallists Georgia Hunter Bell and Josh Kerr late injury withdrawals from their races, Azu’s presence added some sparkle to an afternoon that otherwise lacked some sheen.“It’s mainly for the training,” Azu said of his decision to contest a sprint double.“There’s a level of speed you get from competition that you don’t get from training. It’s three good rounds and it’s adding to the base. It was a good session.”Asked whether more athletes should take the chance to run at these events, he said: “We travel around the world so much, and we represent Great Britain, so if there’s an opportunity to do it, for [the crowd] to come and see us, I think people should grab that. But obviously people are based in different places.It’s not easy to just break up training and come here. I’m two hours away [in Cardiff]. Everyone’s got different things to juggle.View image in fullscreenIssy Boffey continued her breakthrough season with victory in the 800m.Photograph: Alex Livesey/British Athletics/Getty Images“For me, it really works. I think people should definitely make use of these championships. You get some great work from it, and you get to come out and run in front of the British crowd.”Those at the Utilita Arena certainly appreciated it. Hodgkinson had blitzed her way to a scintillating British record when winning her 800m heat on Saturday but, with designs on challenging the world record at a high-profile French meeting next week, chose to sit out the final. That left Issy Boffey to take the title, a fortnight after entering the all-time global top 10. The triumph on Sunday was not quite as quick, coming in 1min 59.64sec, but it continued a whirlwind season that has seen a necessary change of plans.“A couple of weeks ago, I really wasn’t sure about doing the world indoors,” Boffey said. “But now I’m feeling more confident. Ultimately, I want to be in that [world] final. You take one step at a time, but I definitely want to be there.”Hodgkinson will head there as the overwhelming favourite, especially if she claims a world record that has stood since the day she was born: 3 March 2002. Of Hodgkinson’s absence from the final, Boffey said: “I was super excited to race against her. She’s the Olympic champion and deserves so much respect.“It would have been so nice to run with her and really try to hold on for as long as I could. But I absolutely respect her choice to not do the final. A lot of people don’t really understand there’s a lot of things going on behind doors. If you’re racing again next week it’s a short season. You’ve got to do what’s best for you.”There was a surprise defeat for the reigning world indoor 400m champion, Amber Anning, who could only win bronze behind Yemi Mary John. The former world medallist Ben Pattison claimed 800m gold, and Jemma Reekie won the 1500m.Explore more on these topicsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Arundell’s first yellow was shown for not releasing after a covering tackle on Rory Darge, the second for taking out Kyle Steyn in the air.‘Something to smile about’: Townsend salutes Scotland after shocking EnglandRead moreBorthwick’s wing options are already depleted with Immanuel Feyi-Waboso nursing a hamstring injury, and Arundell’s expected unavailability would leave the head coach without any express pace for the visit of Andy Farrell’s side. Elliot Daly is in the wider squad but has been out of form this season while Cadan Murley, who endured a torrid debut against Ireland12 months ago, is another option.Alternatively, Borthwick could shelve his strategy of picking Tommy Freeman at outside-centre, restore the Northampton player to the wing and select Ollie Lawrence in midfield. Marcus Smith and George Furbank are also likely to come into contention given they both offer a creative spark that was sorely lacking against Scotland, who brought England’s 12-match winning run to a juddering halt.Borthwick did his best to avoid overreacting in the aftermath of the defeat on Saturday but a third successive loss at Murrayfield has burst his side’s bubble and ended England’s grand slam pursuit for another year. They will now have to beat Ireland – who got back to winning waysagainst Italy– to have any realistic hope of securing a first Six Nations title in six years.View image in fullscreenJames Lowe leads the charge for Ireland, palming off Italy’s Louis Lynagh in the home side’s Dublin victory.Photograph: Evan Treacy/Getty ImagesIreland were made to work by an impressive Italy side before completing a 20-13 victory in Dublin at the weekend. The manner in which they were beaten on the tournament’s opening night by France was further evidence that this Ireland side appear to be in decline but Borthwick was full of praise for Farrell’s men.“They’ve got such enormous amounts of talent,” the England head coach said. “How many starting British and Irish Lions do they have on their team? The whole Lions coaching team. They play together so often, given the Leinster influence and only coming from a limited number of teams. They’re a very good team. They’ve been at the top of the world rankings for a long period of time.”After tournament organisers opted to remove a fallow week from the competition this year, England have the opportunity to put things right immediately against Ireland.“You’d hate to go into a fallow week now and be licking your wounds after a result like that,” the scrum-half Alex Mitchell said. “So it’s perfect we’ve got another chance to go at Ireland on Saturday to right some wrongs. So, yes, it’s perfect timing.”The England squad reconvened at their Bagshot base on Sunday night with some uncomfortable reviews ahead before attentions turn to Ireland. Furbank is fit again after recovering from a head injury, as is Billy Sela, who replaces George Kloska.Quick GuideSix Nations standingsShow1 FranceP2 W2 L0 Pts 102 ScotlandP2 W1 L1 Pts 63 EnglandP2 W1 L1 Pts 54 ItalyP2 W1 L1 Pts 55 IrelandP2 W1 L1 Pts 46 WalesP2 W0 L2 Pts 0Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“I always will try to review a game from a neutral standpoint,” the centre Fraser Dingwall said. “I think that after a win or a loss, you’ve got to be incredibly honest so you kick on and grow and develop, irrespective of the result. As ever, there are parts that won’t be as bad as you think they are, but there are parts that will be tough to watch back as well. You’ve got to be honest and confront those in both senses.“The emotional side will be around the contact stuff, the physicality stuff, the moments which are based upon desire and effort.

Near the end, after shouting “God bless America” (his only words in English), Bad Bunny ran through a long list of countries in the western hemisphere.That inclusiveness enragedDonald Trump, who erupted on social media, and tried to take the word back, declaring the half-time show “an affront to the greatness of America”. By which, of course, he meant the United States.It was refreshing to encounter this greater America – or more accurately, to welcome it back. It has always been there, since the word “America” first appeared, hovering over Brazil in a 1507 map.View image in fullscreenDetail of Waldseemüller’s 1507 map, the first known map to use the name ‘America’.Photograph: Library of CongressEver since he was inaugurated, Trump has acted as if he owns the word “America”. Throughout his secondinaugural address, he used it as a synonym for the US. (“America will soon be greater, stronger, and far more exceptional than ever before.”) His “America first” foreign policy assumes the right to take possession of any part of the hemisphere he wants, whether it’s the oilfields of Venezuela or the frozen tundra of Greenland.This view is perhaps best understood through his repackaging of the Monroe doctrine, which Trump has increasingly invoked as a “big deal”to justify his desire to dominate the hemisphere. In his view, the doctrine appears to be a mantra for an amped-up foreign policy that may soon extend to other nations on Bad Bunny’s list, including Cuba, Colombia and Panama.So why is a 203-year-old footnote from American history,first articulated in James Monroe’s 1823 message to Congress, rattling around the president’s head?While Trump has not paused to define what he now calls the “Donroe doctrine”, it appears to be synonymous with a “Trump Corollary”, recently announced in the2025 National Security Strategy, that would update the Monroe doctrine by alerting all “non-Hemispheric competitors” – presumably China, Russia and Iran – that they will not be able to position forces or own “strategically vital assets” in our region. (That will come as news to the Chinese, who have spent years and billions of dollars building an enormous deep-water port in Chancay, Peru, announced in 2019. They will not be leaving anytime soon.)After introducing the Donroe doctrine during a rambling news conference after the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, Trump promised that “American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again”. A month earlier, the White House issued a celebratoryannouncementof the 203rd anniversary of the Monroe doctrine – not an anniversary noted by any previous administration, including Monroe’s. In his message, Trump announced: “I am proudly reasserting this time-honored policy.”These announcements were followed in short order by the Maduro raid, and the threat to annex Greenland, which revealed an administration suddenly anxious over the foreign domination of this hemisphere (despite no evidence, in the Greenland case, of Russian or Chinese naval activity).View image in fullscreenBad Bunny performs during the Super Bowl LX half-time show at Levi’s stadium on 8 February in Santa Clara, California.Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Roc NationExcept that Trump has read history incorrectly. Trump sees the Monroe doctrine as a military threat, a way to bully other superpowers out of the western hemisphere and plunder the Americas for any resources the US might want. But in its original formation, the Monroe doctrine was a statement of pan-American solidarity – much closer to Bad Bunny’s than Donald Trump’s.View image in fullscreenSelf-determination, not dominanceThe original doctrine, as written out by a visionary secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, is irreconcilable with the Trump administration’s interpretation of it. It was a plea to give the nations of South America a chance to develop democratic institutions of their own, away from the great powers of Europe. It was more about self-determination than dominance, and more about allies than Trump’s go-it-alone attitude. Specifically, it pulled together the United States and the United Kingdom, who only recently had been at war with each other. In its way, the Monroe doctrine showed just how much nations could accomplish when they stopped quarreling and worked toward the same ends.There is almost a fun-house mirror quality to the way that the current version of the doctrine has been stretched out of all resemblance to the original. Words like “democracy” and “self-determination” were noticeably absent in the White House version, the Donroe doctrine. The 2 December statement was all about strength, claiming that the “mighty words” from 1823 marked the beginning of a “superpower unlike anything the world had ever known”. That statement overlooks the inconvenient fact that in 1823, the United States had no power to enforce its doctrine, and relied entirely on the British navy at a time when the American navy was a fraction the size of France’s.The Monroe doctrine was indeed a big deal when it was introduced, but not for the reasons being touted at the moment. In 1823, the United States was struggling to find its place in the world. It had fought two wars against the United Kingdom, including a recent one, between 1812 and 1815, that resulted in humiliation when British troops invaded the capital city of Washington DC, and torched most of the government buildings, including the Capitol and White House. The new country was growing quickly, but it could hardly be called a military threat to its neighbors. The US army had a little more than 6,000 troops, after a reduction in 1821. The navy had about 4,000. That total – 10,000 – is smaller than the number (12,000) Cyprus can mobilize today.These charts show how Trump is isolating the US on the world stageRead moreMaking matters worse, the progress of democracy, begun with so much fanfare in 1776, seemed to be stalling. The French Revolution had thrown Europe into more than a decade of war and convulsion, and after Napoleon’s final defeat at Waterloo, the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) reasserted a conservative vision of Europe dominated by kings and all that went with them. Suddenly, the principles of republicanism were decidedly out of fashion. The new power structure was strengthened by the 1815 creation of a “Holy Alliance”, linking the extremely old-guard monarchies of Prussia, Austria-Hungary and Russia. Together, they were determined to make sure that there would never be another democratic revolution.That put the United States at a disadvantage, except for the fact that John Quincy Adams was the secretary of state. The son of the second president, Adams had grown up in several European countries (his father, too, was a diplomat), and could speak French, Greek and Latin. He was variously the US minister to the Netherlands, Prussia, Russia and the Court of St James. At times, he lived in London, where he met and married his wife, Louisa Catherine Johnson, an American who had grown up in England.In other words, Adams was well prepared, by training and temperament, to advance America’s interests. At the same time, he was willing to buck protocol. He was known to swim in the Potomac wearing nothing but a skullcap and goggles. Later, he would be a brave voice against slavery when most of the US government went the other way. This was not your ordinary diplomat.Adams became secretary of state in 1817 and would stay until 1825, when he became president. In 1819, he negotiated the Adams-Onis treaty, which transferred a huge amount of land, peacefully, to the United States from Spain, which was impoverished by the Napoleonic wars. Without this treaty, which secured Florida, Mar-a-Lago would be in a foreign country today.Adams also resolved a host of issues relating to the wars that had divided Great Britain and the United States. As a child, he had witnessed the Battle of Bunker Hill, the first major engagement of the American Revolution. But as secretary, he helped to reduce tensions, charting the western boundary with Canada (then a part of the UK), and reducing naval armaments on the Great Lakes.View image in fullscreenJohn Quincy Adams in the 1840s.Photograph: Heritage Images/Getty ImagesThese acts of mutual respect improved relations, and the two powers began to see each other in a new light. In 1821 (the same year that the Guardian was founded), Adams gave a Fourth of July speech that praised the British, as a people “distinguished for their intelligence and their spirit”, and announced that the United States would never go abroad “in search of monsters to destroy”. In other words, Adams was announcing a policy of nonintervention – the opposite of Donald Trump’s interpretation of the Monroe doctrine. Although Adams was an expansionist in his own way – he felt that adjoining territories would eventually join the United States voluntarily – he was against the use of military threats to accumulate real estate.The warming of Anglo-American relations continued, and two years later, in 1823, the British foreign minister, George Canning, approached the United States with a proposition. As Spain’s power continued to ebb, it was losing control of its colonies in theAmericas, and local independence movements had achieved full or partial success in Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina. This was troubling to the Holy Alliance, determined to fight the spread of democracy and maintain the rule of absolutism.But it was not so troubling to Britain. Though a king, George IV, certainly sat on the throne, the British government was more open to a world with diverse forms of government, including democracies. It had a growing middle class, and a strong parliament that represented merchants, mill-owners, and the people at large. In fact, Canning, the son of an actor, was such a person himself.Accordingly, Canning wondered if the United States and the United Kingdom might together indicate their joint support for the new republics, and warn the European powers not to send military expeditions into the Americas. Such a statement would bolster the new governments and deter any effort by Spain, France or the Holy Alliance to gain new colonies in the Americas.Adams saw merit in the idea, and drafted a statement, now known as the Monroe doctrine, that was included in James Monroe’s annual message to Congress in December 1823. It asserted that the Americas “are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers”. It added that if European nations tried to impose “their system” – monarchy – anywhere in the Americas, the United States would regard it as “the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition”.But it was hardly a sweeping statement of American power. It modestly promised that the US would not interfere in European affairs if Europe stayed out of the Americas. It did nothing to alter the status quo in the many places where European nations already possessed American colonies. And it needed the might of the British navy to be effective. In fact, no invasion from the Holy Alliance ever came, although Russia still had claims to the Pacific coast.View image in fullscreenDonald Trump speaks to the press before signing a proclamation renaming the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America aboard Air Force One on 9 February 2025.Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty ImagesThe new doctrine was welcomed by the leaders of Latin America’s independence movements, grateful for the help. It also brought the UK and the US together in a way that began to paint a way forward, for each, toward a world of greater freedom and rights, earned grudgingly, year by year.That mutual understanding would pay dividends for both. It helped the United States that Britain, after some slowness, refused to recognize the Confederacy during the civil war. It helped the United Kingdom that the United States, after some slowness, put all of its might into the fight during two existential world wars.The Monroe doctrine was not static during these years. It was a flexible instrument, serviceable for different messages. Expansionists could enlarge it into a call for aggressive action against the other countries of the Americas, as they did during the 1850s, when pro-slavery advocates argued that the US should acquire new territories around the hemisphere, and again in the 1890s, when the US plucked Cuba and Puerto Rico from Spain. The 20th century witnessed many interventions by presidents, well before Trump, in places ranging from the Dominican Republic to Haiti to Guatemala. That muscular approach feels closer to the Donroe doctrine.But its better angels were also available, as when FDR’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull,promiseda policy of nonintervention by the United States, and support for free trade and democracy, at a conference in Uruguay in 1933. That approach paid huge dividends when Latin America generally supported the allied cause in the second world war, and Venezuelan oil supplied allied convoys. Franklin D Roosevelt’s “good neighbor” policy was echoed by John F Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, a program of economic cooperation, education and support for democracy.View image in fullscreenA new orderIs Trump’s reformulation of the Monroe doctrine, in fact, a doctrine? His former national security adviser, John Bolton, recently told the Atlantic, “There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it’s whatever suits him at the moment.” It’s also true that presidents do not generally get to name doctrines and corollaries after themselves; that takes time – and consensus (Monroe’s doctrine was not named after him until 30 years later).Paradoxically, the closest thing to a recent doctrine was the speech delivered at the recent Davos meeting by Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney. It has already beencalledthe Carney doctrine.Trump’s not the first US president to fall in love with war. History shows where this is going | Peter BeinhartRead moreArguing for an alliance of the world’s “intermediate powers”, it proposed a “new order that encompasses our values, such as respect for human rights, sustainable development, solidarity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the various states”. It was coherent and pragmatic, seeking allies to resist a rising tide of reactionary thinking. That was very much in the spirit of John Quincy Adams and the original Monroe doctrine, a riposte to the great powers of its day, who were in their own way blind to the currents of history.It was also, in its way, aligned with Bad Bunny’s half-time show. On the surface, the Canadian prime minister’s sober speech and the Puerto Rican singer’s rollicking performance could not be more different. But they hit many of the same grace notes. By acknowledging that we are not alone in this hemisphere, by naming so many nations – he proposed a radical way to make America, in the largest sense of the word, great again.Ted Widmer is the author of Lincoln on the Verge: Thirteen Days to Washington (2020), and the editor of The Living Declaration: A Biography of America’s Founding Text, forthcoming from the Library of America (spring 2026).Spot illustrations by Lucy JonesThis article was amended on 15 February 2026 to correct the date of the John Quincy Adams image."

You might as well consider it: can AI help you find love?For a handful of tech entrepreneurs and a few brave Londoners, the answer is “maybe”.No, this is not a story about humans falling in love withsexy computer voices– and strictly speaking, AI dating of some variety has been around for a while. Most big platforms have integrated machine learning and someAI featuresinto their offerings over the past few years.But dreams of a robot-powered future – or perhaps just general dating malaise and a mounting loneliness crisis – have fuelled a new crop of startups that aim to use the possibilities of the technology differently.Jasmine, 28, was single for three years when she downloaded the AI-powered dating app Fate. With popular dating apps such as Hinge and Tinder, things were “repetitive”, she said: the same conversations over and over.“I thought, why not sign up, try something different? It sounded quite cool using, you know, agentic AI, which is where the world is going now, isn’t it?”Fate, a London startup that went live last May, bills itself as the first “agentic AI dating app”. Its core offering is an AI personality named Fate that “onboards” users during an interview, asking them about their hopes and struggles before putting forward five potential matches – no swiping involved.Fate will also coach users through their interactions, if they desire, a functionality Jasmine described as helpful and another user said was “scary” and “a bit like Black Mirror’.Rakesh Naidu, Fate’s founder, demonstrated its coaching ability in an interview with the Guardian. “I just feel a bit hopeless at the moment in regards to my chats. I feel like I’m not being engaging enough or meaningful enough,” he said into his phone. “I just need some kind of meaningful questions I can ask to really uncover the essence of people.”“I hear you, Rakesh,” said a synthetic female voice. “Here are a few ideas. One, what’s something you’re passionate about that not many people know?”Naidu, 28, said he started Fate in order to address shortcomings in the world’s biggest dating platforms – apps such as Tinder, Bumble and Hinge, whichmonetisethe time users spend on them and “are literally profiting off keeping people lonely”.Other startups, from Sitch to Keeper, have launched across the US, hoping AI features can provide the novelty to win them a share of a crowded market. Sitchleveragesthe power of AI to manage vasts amounts of information, inviting users to “give us detailed feedback down to the hair colour, where they want to raise a family, and their fav music”; Keepersaysit can find “a match with rare and real soulmate potential”.Part of the issue, Naidu says, are algorithmic approaches to matchmaking: Tinder at one point ranked users’ desirability through an Elo score, an algorithm originally used to rate chess players. On dating platforms, it’s a Hobbesian proposition – high-scoring users are shown to other high-scoring users, low-scoring users to other low-scoring users. “It’s very superficial,” said Naidu.AI, in theory, can offer a different way. Awkward as it may be to discuss your dating life with a chatbot, Fate does not rank you based on your responses, but instead uses an LLM to try to find other users who, based on their interview, might be similar to you. That approach, along with the AI dating coach, helps users to focus on authentic connection, said Naidu – “similarity and reciprocity of personality”.Amelia Miller, a consultant for Match Group (which owns Tinder and Hinge), worries about this approach.A recent study from the group surveyed 5,000 Europeans about their online dating preferences – and found that while many were interested in AI tools to weed out fake profiles and flag toxic users, most, 62%, were skeptical about using AI to guide their conversations. One obvious anxiety might be the dystopian idea of two agentic AIs steering a conversation, with the humans nominally in charge turning into little more than meatspace mouthpieces.Miller, however, who coaches people on their relationships with AI, says she sees many clients turn to an LLM for advice in the smaller, uncomfortable moments of building their relationships – asking AI how to craft a text, for example, or respond to an intimate question.“Often I’m trying to make sure that people aren’t turning to machines because turning to humans demands a level of vulnerability that has become uncomfortable now that there is an alternative,” she said.The appeal of an AI coach such as Fate is that revealing yourself to it – your judgments, hopes and idiosyncrasies – involves no risk; it does not remember or evaluate. Friends do, and, says Miller, asking advice from them helps hone the skills for successful relationships.“Advice is really one of the key ways that people practice vulnerability in a more low-stakes environment – they build up to more vulnerable moments in a romantic context.”Jeremias has been using Fate for several months. He said he doesn’t use the AI coach: “I could see it being helpful, but I mean there are obviously some concerns. Like the new generation are basically not going to have the real world experience of actually trying and failing.”The app recently helped him to meet someone after a long period of being single in London. He’s not sure if this is because of the AI matching, or because Fate simply serves up only five matches at a time – no infinite swiping – and, excruciatingly, forces its users to write an explanation when they reject a potential match.“It makes the swiping more thoughtful. If I’m actually saying no to this person, what are the reasons I’m saying no to them?”He and Jasmine both have second dates upcoming, both after being single for several years, they say.“It is exciting because you get like, you know, the butterflies in your stomach again, going on a date with someone, doing yourself up really nicely, wearing dresses, heels. It’s fun,” said Jasmine.Explore more on these topicsAI (artificial intelligence)DatingComputingAppsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Behemoths such as Google and Meta are getting involved in campaigns for November’s elections, as are venture capitalists, cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Palantir’s co-founders. The industry’s goals run the gamut – from fighting a billionaire tax to supporting a techie gubernatorial candidate to firing up new, influential super political action committees (Pacs).The phenomenon squarely fits the moment for the state’s politics – with 2026 being the year that Politico hasdubbed“the big tech flex”.Gavin Newsom, California’s tech-friendly governor who’s been quick to veto legislation that cramps the sector’s unfettered growth, is reaching his term limit. That meansSilicon Valleyneeds to find a new ally. The industry may have found its candidate in an upstart mayor from San Jose, Matt Mahan.View image in fullscreenMatt Mahan, the San Jose mayor who is running for governor.Photograph: Christopher Victorio/ShutterstockSilicon Valley’s businesses and billionaires – some of the richest and most powerful on earth, most of which are headquartered in California – are in the midst of a massive AI boom. Industry insiders say tech companies need to ensure they can continue to flourish without regulations getting in the way.“This is a golden opportunity and a golden moment for tech to reset its priorities and its perceptions,” said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University who studies state lobbying.Rather than going all-in on one candidate or issue, McCuan said the tech sector is using a multi-pronged attack in California. Tech billionaires are contributing to campaigns ranging from candidates for governor to local city council and school board races. They are also donating heavily to groups campaigning for relaxed taxation and minimal regulation around AI.“If you’re an uber-zillionaire, you give money early and often,” McCuan said. “They have more wealth and resources than they’ve ever had before, so that allows them to play on both sides of the aisle and up and down the ballot and across issues like never before.”Unlike other industries, such as oil and pharma, tech has been relatively tame when it comes to lobbying in the state. The industry has tended to focus on narrow state issues and insteadspent big and broad at the federal level(aside from Uber and Lyft’s massive$200m ballot measure campaignin 2020). That ethos has changed. California is now ground zero for tech titans working to become omnipresent in politics.Robert Singleton, the senior director of policy in California for the tech industry group Chamber of Progress, said this moment has been brewing for a long time and it just needed the right thing to set it off.“The introduction of that billionaire tax obviously galvanized a lot of wealthy individuals who don’t want to see that happen, and who will spend money to make sure it doesn’t happen,” Singleton said. “That tipped them into wanting to get more involved.”Billionaires fight a taxThe “California Billionaire Tax Act”, often referred to simply as the billionaire tax, is aproposalthat would require any California resident worth more than $1bn to pay a one-off, 5% tax on their assets to help cover education, food assistance and healthcare programs in the state. It’s sponsored by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West, and if it receives enough signatures from California voters, it will go to the ballot in November.When the proposal was put forward at the end of last year, many among tech’s billionaire elite threw a tantrum.Some opened offices or bought mansions in Florida or Texas,vowing to leave Californiafor good. The fleeing rich included Palantir co-founder Peter Thiel, whose current net worth is $25bn; Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth around $255bn and $240bn respectively; and Donald Trump’s AI and crypto czar, David Sacks, whose net worth is not publicly known. Earlier this week, theWall Street Journal reportedthat Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, worth $229bn, has also bought a property in south Florida valued between $150 and $200m.Thiel has additionally led the charge in donating to a lobbying group, the California Business Roundtable, which has pledged to fight the wealth tax. The Palantir co-founderhanded over $3mto the political action committee in late December. Other major donors include realtors, entrepreneurs and private equity firms. James Siminoff, who founded the camera-embedded Ring doorbell company, also donated $100,000, according to public records.View image in fullscreenPeter Thiel, the co-founder and chair of Palantir.Photograph: Kiyoshi Ota/Bloomberg via Getty Images“The most powerful money in politics is to be on the no-side of a ballot measure,” said McCuan. “You can even pre-empt something getting to the ballot, like a billionaire’s tax, by explaining to everyone out there that this is a bad idea for economic growth.”Tech investors and venture capitalists have been extremely vocal in their opposition to the tax, saying that the state will lose revenue as billionaires flee and it will hurt the state’s ability to be economically competitive.Just this week, Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive and current venture capital investor,wrote“the loss of this tax revenue was totally avoidable but is now forever”. Balaji Srinivasan, an investor and former chief technology officer of Coinbase,wrote, “the most successful tech founders of all time have now exited the failed state of California”.Adding on, Paul Graham, the co-founder of seed capital firm Y Combinator,wrote: “It’s important that people like Zuck and Larry Page are willing to move in response to the proposed wealth tax. It shows politicians what will happen if they try things like this.”Joining the billionaires, Newsom has pledged to fight the tax, saying it will “drive a race to the bottom” and stifle innovation as the ultra-wealthy leave. “This will be defeated – there’s no question in my mind,” Newsomtold the New York Timesin January. “I’ll do what I have to do to protect the state.”Super Pacs aplentyOutcry over taxes is just one of the ways the tech sector is ramping up its influence campaign. Several Super Pacs have popped up over the past few months and tech is injecting these committees with tens of millions.McCuan said this strategy is helpful for the ultra-wealthy because it allows them to stay behind the scenes, while donating limitless money.“You could create some amorphous sounding organization like ‘Californians for All That is Good and Right Under the Sun’,” McCuan said. “And who knows what the hell that is, but that entity becomes the vehicle to which others give money … and it becomes very difficult to unpeel and unfurl what is going on.”Meta launched two new Super Pacs last fall, which are focused on dialing back AI regulation and supporting AI-friendly candidates. The companycontributed $45mto one, the American Technology Excellence Project, which will operate in several states but hasn’t yet established a committee in California. The other, Mobilizing Economic Transformation Across (Meta) California, is state-specific and has received one $20m contribution from Meta.The social media giant has also matched Google in infusing a separate Super Pac called California Leads with a total of $10m. Ron Conway, a longtime Democratic tech donor, has also donated $100,000 to this committee, which says it aims to support favorable candidates in the state but will not just focus on issues affecting the tech industry,according to Politico.The crypto industry is getting into Super Pacs too, debuting a group calledGrow California. The committee opened with $10m from crypto executive Chris Larsen and evangelist Tim Draper. Larsentold the New York Timeshe plans to give $30m more. The focus of Grow California is to “rebuild a state capital” and shape the state’s legislature.“We have a group of people who are not acting in a pragmatic way. They’re not looking for balance. They’re completely fucking owned by one side,” Larsen, who’s the chair of crypto company Ripple,told Politico. “So we’re going to work on taking out those people who are not working for the people of California.”View image in fullscreenChris Larsen, co-founder and executive chairman of Ripple Labs.Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesWhile the tech industry is now pushing its influence at the state level, San Francisco has alreadyexperienced many of these same tacticsat the city level. Backed with Silicon Valley money, several different 501(c)(4) groups formed over the past couple election cycles to throw support behind preferred mayoral and board of supervisor candidates. They also bankrolled successful recall campaigns for a progressive district attorney and members of the school board.A new tech-friendly governor?The California governor’s race has been a crowded field without notable frontrunners. Newsom had been a long-time friend of the tech industry, hosting Google’s Page and Brin as guests at his wedding and referring to Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff as “family”. His departure appears to have Silicon Valley fretting.Singleton, from the Chamber of Progress, said Newsom had long recognized “how pivotal the technology industry is in California”.But then, late last month, Mahan, a moderate Democrat and the mayor of San Jose,announced his candidacy. Before Mahan got involved in politics in 2020, he had a career in the tech sector. He was an undergraduate at Harvard with Zuckerberg, and in 2014 co-founded a startup with funding from Conway, Benioff and Napster co-founder Sean Parker.Mahan appears to be the savior the tech industry had been searching for. Since his candidacy announcement just two weeks ago, millions have poured into his campaign. According to public records, he’s received donations from several venture capitalists, along with Roblox CEO David Baszucki, Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan, GitHub co-founder Chris Wanstrath, Cloudkitchen co-founder Diego Berdakin, and Ring founder Siminoff.Mahan has even courted donors who helped launch companies known for working with the Trump administration, including Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Anduril co-founder Matt Grimm and his wife Kimberly Grimm, according to public records.Google’s Brin has also backed Mahan, maxing out the limit for an individual campaign donation at $78,400. Several of Mahan’s other tech backers also maxed out their donations. At this point, Mahan has now raised more than double the two most prominent democrats in the race, Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter.As political races and ballot measure campaigns continue to heat up across California in 2026, tech’s influence is only expected to grow.“It’s going to be a fun session,” Singleton said.

You put it to one side and wait to see if anyone claims it or contacts you to ask if you got their gift, but no one does.While it is far from unusual for parcels to go astray, if one arrives with all your details on it, it is possible you have become an unsuspecting cog in a large-scale “brushing” fraud, a scam that is on the increase, according to online security experts.Fraudsters need your postage details, which they will often obtain through a data breach. They then set up a false online account in your name on the shopping site they are selling their goods on and post a fake verified and positive review, apparently from you, about the products you have received.These positive five-star reviews “brush up” their online ranking on the shopping site and also their credibility. In theory, this can then increase their sales. Oliver Devane of the security company McAfee says the goods need to be sent to the customer in order for a purchase and review to be verified. These fake verified reviewsare often paid for.While it may appear to be a victim-free scam, it could highlight that your personal details have been hacked. It also risks bringing potentially harmful toys or cosmetics into your home, says Devane.“If it is some little toy that you give to your child, you’ve got no idea of the quality … which is a risk in itself. You have no idea where it came from and what it contains,” he says.What it looks likeThe package will come out of the blue and could contain anything from a key chain gadget to random homeware or even plant seeds. The contents will be cheap and likely to be of poor quality. This could happen at any time of the year, although deliveries of the goods peak at busy shopping periods.In some cases, says Devane, the fraudsters may send QR codes or USB sticks with the product in the hope that people will scan them or put their into their computer. These will invariably lead to some malware being added to a phone or laptop that could result in data being stolen.What to doIf you get something unexpected in the post, do not use it or consume it as it may be dangerous. For example, a toy may not be produced to proper standards or perfume may have harmful ingredients.Check your online accounts to make sure there has been no unauthorised order and then report it to the marketplace that it was sent from.Amazon says third-party sellers are prohibited from sending unsolicited packages to customers and have a way toreport them here. If you can identify the fake reviews in your name, then you can inform the shopping site you are dealing with and they can take action.It is worth changing the password on your online shopping accounts and enabling two-factor authentication, says Devane.Do not try to return it to the retailer as this may prompt them to engage with you more and initiate more scams. Instead, simply throw it away after reporting it, he says.Explore more on these topicsScamsScam watchShoppingConsumer affairsInternetfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The last three years have shattered previous records for such events. Last Wednesday, scientists said that we arecloser than ever to the pointafter which global heating cannot be stopped.Just one day later, Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin, the head of the US Environmental Protection Agency,announced the eliminationof the Obama-era endangerment finding which underpins federal climate regulations.

Any fragment of hope may lie in the fact that a president who has called global heating a “hoax” framed this primarily as about deregulation – perhaps because the science is now so widely acceptedeven in the US.The administration claimed, without evidence, that Americans would save $1.3tn. Never mind insurance or healthcare costs; a recent reportfoundthat US earnings would be 12% higher without the climate crisis. The Democratic senator Sheldon Whitehousecalledthe decision “corruption, plain and simple”. In 2024, Mr Trump reportedly urged 20 fossil fuel tycoons tostump up $1bnfor his presidential campaign – while vowing to remove controls on the industry.In the same week as this reckless and destructive US decision, it emerged that China had recorded its 21st month of flat or slightly falling carbon emissions. As Washington tears up environmental regulations, Beijing isextendingcarbon reporting requirements. China remains the world’s biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, though its per capita and cumulativehistorical emissionsare still far behind those of the US. But clean energy drovemore than 90%of its investment growth last year.The Carbon Brief website, which publishedthe emissions analysis, says the numbers suggest that the decline in China’s carbon intensity – emissions per unit of GDP – was below the target set in the last five-year plan, making it hard to meet its commitments under the Paris agreement. The shift in emissions may not prove enduring. There is fear that China’s focus may change; the next five-year plan, due in March, will be key. Some subsidies for renewable power have already been withdrawn. The installation of huge quantities of renewable energy infrastructure has been accompanied by a surge in constructing coal-fired power plants, though the hope is that these are intended primarily as a fallback.There are other grave concerns, including evidence of the use of forced labour of Uyghur Muslims in solar-panel production in Xinjiang. China’s chokehold on critical minerals hampers the ability of others to develop their own technology. And while its cheap renewables technology has resulted inthe cheapest electricity in history, it has also hit manufacturers in other countries.No one can compensate for the grim reversal of belated US action on emissions. There is also a vacuum in climate diplomacy that Chinashows no signsof filling. But Beijing has a vested interest in encouraging others to cut emissions, even if some nations now want to challenge its “green mercantilism”. In contrast, US billionaires look forward to prospering at the cost of wallets and lives – not only at home, but around the world.Explore more on these topicsClimate crisisOpinionDonald TrumpChinaRenewable energyFossil fuelsPollutionEnergyeditorialsShareReuse this content"

Mass non-cooperationMark EnglerandPaul EnglerOur studies in civil resistance offer insight into the level of popular organizing needed to repel assaults on democracySun 15 Feb 2026 07.00 ESTShareIn the wake of two horrifying killings of legal observers in Minnesota, on top of the abduction of countless immigrant community members, the country has reached a turning point. Backlash against ICE’s lawlessness and aggression has reverberated so loudly that even Trump has heard it. But the effects on ordinary Americans contemplating what they would do if they lived in Minneapolis or St Paul is perhaps even more profound.The extraordinary level of grassroots solidarity and creative resistance in anti-ICE protests in Minnesota has given people a new appreciation for the power that mass non-cooperation can have in resisting the Trump administration’s drive toward authoritarianism. And it has created an awareness of why such action is clearly needed.Early in Trump’s second term, an array of mainstream critics expressed skepticism about the value of continued protests in the streets. They invested their faith in institutions such as Congress and the courts. But as these institutions – along with law firms, universities and the business community – have each caved in to the administration’s demands and proven themselves unwilling to catalyze an ardent defense of democracy, it has been left to the people themselves to do this essential work.The Twin Cities were not the first to stand up. We have seen robust resistance in Chicago, Los Angeles, Charlotte, Washington DC, and other metropolitan areas previously targeted by ICE or occupied by federal troops. In the past year, there have been hugeNo Kingsmarches and coordinated consumer actions such asTesla Takedown. But Minnesota has raised the stakes and expanded public awareness of what a community-wide refusal to submit can look like.This Black History Month, the leaders of the past can teach real resistance | Eric Morrison-SmithRead moreAs more people consider joining in such acts of refusal, it is important to recognize that they can build on a rich history of past action. While popular revolt is often treated as wholly spontaneous and emotional, there is a whole body of study exploring how mass protest can be deployed in a deliberate and strategic manner – a field with rich insights that new participants can draw from today.A decade ago, we wrote a book calledThis Is An Uprising, about the evolution of the theory and practice of nonviolent direct action over the past 100 years. More recently, in preparing a new and expanded10th anniversary edition, we reflected on how the field known as “civil resistance” has changed since the Barack Obama era. This meant examining how the craft of mass mobilization has become ever more important in the face of growing tyranny, in the US and beyond.Today, we need democratic uprisings that are bold enough to confront the scale of the crisis we now face and strategic enough to outmaneuver the systems that created it. For this reason, looking at lessons from the field of civil resistance is vital.We cannot wait for elitesThere has long been a debate about whether tactics of civil resistance are more relevant in democratic contexts or authoritarian ones and critics have cast doubt in both directions. When the study of strategic nonviolent action was still in its infancy, it was commonly believed that campaigns of disruptive protest could only prevail under governments that at least nominally tolerated freedom of expression and assembly – be it the British in Gandhi’s India or the John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson administrations for the US civil rights movement. Without such basic guarantees, many feared, demonstrations could simply be crushed. But in subsequent decades, the assumption was reversed. As campaigns of unarmed uprising showed often-surprising success under autocracies, cynics expressed new doubts: the strategies used to unseat dictators, they argued, had little salience in democracies, where people could already express their will at the polls.We have always rejected this false binary. Civil resistance can be vital in both contexts – though strategies and tactics must adapt to local conditions. In a country like the US, even under administrations that call themselves progressive, as Obama’s did, movement pressure plays a critical role. When leaders elected on platforms of hope fail to deliver, whether because of political cowardice or because entrenched corporate power blocks change, popular mobilization is often the only force capable of compelling action, extracting responses that no amount of insider lobbying can compel.Under a regime like Trump’s – particularly now, in his second term – the need for organized popular defiance is even more profound. Today, it appears as if the very foundations of American democracy are fracturing. Trump has launched a startling attack on public services, on the very concept of the social safety net, on free speech and the rule of law, on workers’ rights, on immigrants and on other vulnerable communities. If this is to be stopped – and if the wider system of oligarchic rule that is destroying our planet is to be replaced with true democracy – people must rediscover their own power.Mainstream political thinking in the US sees power as “monolithic,” resting in the hands of senators, generals, billionaires, presidents and CEOs. From that vantage point, the options for opposing a rogue administration seem desperately thin: wait for elections, file a lawsuit, hope for some unforeseen maneuver by elites. This worldview breeds despair. One prominent Democratic party consultant evenadvisedthat the best course for progressives is simply to “roll over and play dead”.The lack of imagination is staggering – and pervasive. In a 7 March 2025,op-edfor the New York Times, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California’s Berkeley School of Law, argued that if Trump chooses to wantonly defy court orders, there will be little further recourse to stop him from continuing to break laws, as the constitution does not give judges adequate enforcement power. His conclusion? “Perhaps public opinion will turn against the president” and convince him to retreat. “Or perhaps,” Chemerinsky bleakly suggested, “after 238 years, we will see the end of government under the rule of law.”On social media, Corey Robin, the political theorist, rightlyblastedthis defeatism, labeling it a stunning mix of “irresponsibility and learned helplessness”. He observed that, around the globe, people with far fewer rights and far fewer resources have found more forceful ways to confront authoritarianism, deploying mass strikes, boycotts, occupations, bureaucratic intransigence, artistic resistance and myriad other forms of social solidarity and collective noncompliance. Yet among establishment elites today, he wrote, “no one dares even to talk about picking up the customary political tools that democrats across the centuries and continents have traditionally wielded against runaway rulers”.The field of civil resistance provides an antidote to the fatal shortage of vision that pervades our political class, detailing a vast repertoire of steps that can be taken outside of lobbying and litigation. By studying these methods, we can learn key lessons: public sentiment rarely moves on its own; it responds to collective articulation and organized action. Democracies under assault cannot rely on existing checks and balances alone, they must be fortified by activated citizens. To simply declare a constitutional crisis and plead powerlessness is to accept pre-emptive ruin. The real question is how to respond when the safeguards we were told would protect us fail.Grassroots agitation nourishes democracyThose immersed in social movements look at the process of change in a different way than political insiders do. Instead of subscribing to the monolithic view of power, they hold a social view of power, which understands that those in positions of authority are dependent upon the cooperation and support of the governed.Frances Fox Piven, the great scholar of disruptive action, reminds us that the capacity of people to withdraw their cooperation from the system remains an essential mechanism for securing progress. In a 2022interviewwith Democracy Now, Piven argued that landmark movements of the past, from abolitionism to labor to civil rights, succeeded by impeding business as usual: “I think that movements, protest movements, defiant movements, movements that break the rules, are the main lever, the main weapon, that ordinary people have in realizing their aspirations and protecting their democratic rights,” she stated.In a separate interview we conducted with Piven, she identified the root of our present crisis in a lack of agitation from outside established political structures: “I think that a lot of the tragedy of American democracy is the result of quiescence,” she said. “Agitation and rising up from people at the bottom are good for democracy. They nourish democracy.”As the tremendously creative organizers in Minnesota have shown us of late, these campaigns from below can be far more varied than the organizing of big marches. In the 1970s, scholar Gene Sharp famouslycompiled a listof “198 methods of nonviolent action”, emphasizing the many different tactics available to social movements. Yet as comprehensive as Sharp aimed to be, his list could never exhaust the full range of options. New technologies and the inventiveness of on-the-ground organizers have since added many more examples of unarmed interventions. In 2021, Michael Beer, an activist and movement trainer, produced arevised databasethat almost doubles the contents of Sharp’s famous catalog, including a full 346 tactics.Now, as then, the list of methods is best seen as an invitation to creativity, reminding organizers they have many tools in their collective toolbox – each with distinctive properties and powers. The potential of civil resistance is not just in holding large demonstrations. It is in drawing from a vast array of strikes, boycotts, noncooperation tactics and artistic protest. And it is in coming up with innovative forms of creative resistance that may never have been seen before.The potentials of building momentum through these practices are exciting to envision. And our collective future may depend on their realization.What’s giving us hope nowA main error that mainstream detractors make when misjudging the impact of mass mobilizations is assuming that protest tactics are somehow exclusive with other methods for winning progress. Whirlwind moments of grassroots action should instead be seen as opportunities both to alter broader political conditions and draw in new recruits for the ongoing struggle in many arenas. What gives us hope is seeing the type of intensive organizing in Minnesota not only inspire a huge wave of participation beyond the state’s borders – with hundreds of people packing neighborhood trainings in communities across the country on monitoring and resisting ICE –but also go hand in hand with shifts in public opinion that are already becoming evident at the polls, where Trump-aligned candidates are rapidly losing ground. Most recently, we saw this when a far-right Republican wasdefeatedby a Democraticunion leaderin a Texas state senate district that Trump won by 17 points in 2024. In dark times, these mutually reinforcing gains are encouraging signs, and we will need many more of them.Mark and Paul Engler are co-directors of theWhirlwind Institute, a social change strategy center.

But Trump’s tailwind could save his skinAndrás Bíró-NagyOpposition challenger Péter Magyar is ahead in the polls on a promise of hope. Orbán is betting on fear of war to stay in powerSun 15 Feb 2026 00.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 20.34 ESTShareAfter 16 years of uninterrupted power,Viktor Orbánis facing his biggest electoral challenge. For years Hungary’s prime minister has spun weak policy performance as success. The rise of a rival, Péter Magyar, and the opposition Tisza party has exposed the limits of that strategy.The economy isstagnating, despite repeated promises of a long-awaited takeoff. Over the past decade and a half, Hungaryhas slippedfrom being one of central and eastern Europe’s strongest performers toone of its weakest. Public services, from healthcare to transport, are widely seen as neglected, andPolicy Solutionssurveys show that votershave noticed. Hungary is not alone in facing a cost of living crisis, but comparisons offer little consolation to voters who were assured that Orbán’s model would deliver exceptional results.Tisza has unified a previously fragmented opposition and turned the April 12 parliamentary election into a genuine contest. At this stage,nearly half of Hungarianssay they want a change of government.Yet preference is not the same as confidence. Many voters still doubt that change is within reach. This tension between dissatisfaction with the status quo and nervousness about the feasibility of political change has created an unpredictable electoral landscape. Frustration with Orbán may not be sufficient to overcome fear of the unknown.Orbán also has something his rival can’t match: he has a tailwind from Washington. While he may have little to shout about at home, Orbán has gained new momentum in Donald Trump’s volatile second term.Orbán’s campaign narrative now rests on the boast that he is simultaneously on good terms with the leaders of theUnited States,RussiaandChina. In a world of strongmen, Hungary needs a leader who can sit at their table.Expect Trump’s name to feature increasingly in the campaign as Orbán seeks to reinforce the claim that he – and only he – has the ear of the world’s most powerful leaders. His recentWhite House audiencewas proof of international relevance andthis weekend’s visit of Marco Rubio to Budapestwill only reinforce that narrative.What is striking about this campaign is that Fidesz, Orbán’s party, is no longer asking voters to reward it for a record of good governance. Rather, it is warning people that however dissatisfied they may be,Hungarycould be a lot worse off. The aim is not to mobilise hope, but to suppress it – to make sure voters see the ballot box not as an opportunity for change, but as a risk.View image in fullscreenAs Ukraine dominates Hungary’s election campaign a pro-Orbán billboard depicts President Zelenskyy demanding money for weapons.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/Reuters“The safe choice”, as the Fidesz party slogan goes, is designed to respond to an increasingly anxious mood in an uncertain and dangerous world. With war in Europe, migration, culture wars and geopolitical upheaval, the message runs, this is an age of danger, and change at the top is a gamble the country cannot afford.Everything Orbán presents as dangerous – European military support for Ukraine, migrants, expanding LGBTQ+ rights – is lumped together as the“Brussels path”. By contrast, peace, a migration-free country and the rejection of “gender ideology” are framed as the uniquely “Hungarian path”. The choice, voters are told, is civilisational, a message that echoes the Trump administration’swarningabout European liberal democracy.Trump’s scepticism towards Ukraine and his readiness to blame Kyiv for the war with Russia also closely align with Orbán’s position. This has emboldened Orbán, allowing him to be even softer on Russia and harsher on Ukraine, while presenting this stance as vindicated by global power shifts.Two strategies now stand in stark opposition. Orbán derives his political relevance from the international environment: from global instability, from war and from the claim that only he can navigate this dangerous world. Magyar, by contrast, grounds his message in domestic reality: the cost of living, failing public services and the sense that the state delivers far less than it should.Orbán’s worldview underpins this contrast. For him, international treaties and multilateral organisations matter less and less in a new global order defined by power and bilateral deals. What count now, he argues, are personal relationships and strength.DespiteTisza leadingin independent and opposition-leaning polls (while trailing in Fidesz-friendly polling), Orbán retains a credible path to victory. This is partly due to the structural advantages embedded in Hungary’s electoral system, which Fidesz designed in 2010. Biases built into theconstituency map– with Fidesz-leaning districts on average smaller than those favouring the opposition – mean that the governing party can still win a parliamentary majority even if it narrowly loses the popular vote. To overcome this, Tisza would probably need a lead of at least five percentage points nationally – a high bar in an uneven playing field.The greatest opportunity for Tisza lies in convincing those disappointed with the government that it can offer a credible alternative and tangible improvements in everyday life. Orbán wants voters to believe that change itself is the greatest danger. Magyar wants them to believe that stagnation is. For the first time in 16 years, the outcome is genuinely open. And that uncertainty alone marks a profound break with Hungary’s political past.András Bíró-Nagy is a senior research fellow at the ELTE Centre for Social Sciences in Budapest and director of Policy Solutions.

We found 24% of autistic children met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism.Why the debate about a ‘profound autism’ category?The category is intended to help governments and service providers plan and deliver supports, so autistic people with the highest needs aren’t overlooked. It also aims to re-balance theirunder-representationin mainstream autism research.Autism should not be seen as single condition with one cause, say scientistsRead moreThis new categorymay be helpful for advocatingfor a greater level of support, research and evidence for this group. Butsome have raised concernsthat autistic people who don’t fit into this category could be perceived as less in need and excluded from services and funding supports.Others argue the category doesn’tsufficiently emphasiseautistic people’s strengths and capabilities, and places too much emphasis on the challenges that are experienced.What did we do?We conducted thefirst Australian studyto examine how the “profound autism” category might apply to children attending publicly funded diagnostic services for developmental conditions.Drawing on the Australian Child Neurodevelopment Registry, we examined data from 513 autistic children assessed between 2019 and 2024. We asked:How many children met the criteria for profound autism?Were there behavioural features that set this group apart?Because we focused on children at the time of diagnosis, most (91%) were aged under eight years. We described these children as being “at risk of profound autism”.What did we find?About 24% of autistic children in our study met, or were at risk of meeting, the criteria for profound autism. This issimilar to the proportion of children internationally.Almost half (49.6%) showed behaviours that were a safety risk, such as trying to run away from carers, compared with one-third (31.2%) of other autistic children.These challenges weren’t limited to children who met criteria for profound autism. About one in five autistic children (22.5%) engaged in self-injury and more than one-third (38.2%) showed aggression toward others.So, while the category identified many children with very high needs, other children who didn’t meet these criteria also had significant needs.Importantly, we found the definition of “profound autism” doesn’t always line up with the official diagnostic levels which determine the level of support and national disability insurance scheme funding children receive.In our study, 8% of children at risk of profound autism were classified as level 2, rather than level 3 (the highest level of support). Meanwhile, 17% of children classified as level 3 did not meet criteria for profound autism.Our concernWe looked at children when they first received an autism diagnosis. Children were aged 18 months to 16 years, with more than 90% under the age of eight. This aligns withour earlier researchshowing that the average age of diagnosis in public settings is 6.6 years.From a practical perspective, our biggest concern about the profound autism category is the age threshold of eight years. Because most children are already assessed before age eight, introducing this category into assessment services would mean many families would need repeat assessments, placing additional strain on already stretched developmental services.Talk with clinicians about supports for yourself as well, including respite care or family support groupsSecond, modifications will be needed if this criteria is going to be used to inform funding decisions as it didn’t map perfectly on to level 3 support criteria.On balance, however, our results suggest the profound autism category may provide a clear, measurable way to describe the needs of autistic people with the highest support requirements.Every autistic child has individual strengths and needs. The term “profound autism” would need to be promoted with inclusive and supportive language, so as to not replace or diminish individual needs, but to help clinicians tailor supports and obtain additional resources when needed.Including the category in future clinical guidelines, such as thenational guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism, could help ensure governments, disability services and clinicians plan and deliver supports.What can you do in the meantime?If you’re concerned your child requires substantial support, here are some practical steps you can take to ensure their needs are recognised and addressed:Explain your concernsWhat is autism? How the term became too broad to have meaning any more | Tom ClementsRead moreNot all clinicians have experience working with children with high support needs. Be as clear as possible about behaviours that affect your child’s safety or daily life, including self-injury, aggression or attempts to run away. These details, while difficult to share, help give a clearer picture of your child’s support needs.It can also be a challenge to find and access clinicians with appropriate expertise. Another potential benefit of having a defined category is that it can better help families navigate care.Ask about support for the whole familyOur studies show that many caregiverswant more supportfor themselves but don’t always ask. Talk with clinicians about supports for yourself as well, including respite care or family support groups.Reach outComing together with other carers and families can reduce your own isolation and normalise many of the unique challenges you face. Connecting with like-minded people can provide a supportive, empathetic and empowering community.Plan for safetyFor children with high support needs, prioritise safety planning with your child’s care team. This can include strategies to reduce risks, as well as planning how best to support your child’s interactions with health, education and disability services.Kelsie Boulton is a senior research fellow in child neurodevelopment at the University of Sydney’s Brain and Mind Centre.

Through the early years of our careers, Europe was emerging from the shadow of the cold war. Governments of all political colours chose to take what was known as the “peace dividend” – investing in public services and reducing spending on defence. That was an understandable choice at the time. Now it’s clear that the threats we face demand a step change in our defence and security. European leaders, along with military and civilian officials, have just discussed necessary consequences at theannual Munich security conference.As military leaders, we see every day from intelligence and open sources how Russia’s military posture has shifted decisively westward. Its forces are rearming and learning from the war inUkraine, reorganising in ways that could heighten the risk of conflict with Nato countries. This is a reality we must prepare for; we cannot be complacent. Moscow’s military buildup, combined with its willingness to wage war on our continent, as painfully evidenced in Ukraine, represents an increased risk that demands our collective attention.At the Hague summit last year, Nato leaders committed to spend5% of GDPon defence and security by 2035. This reflects our new security reality and requires hard choices and prioritisation on public spending for all members.As the chiefs of defence of two of Europe’s biggest security providers, we have a duty to explain what is at stake, so that people can understand why our governments have committed to the biggest sustained increases in defence spending since the end of the cold war. That’s why it’s important that we communicate the threat. People must understand the difficult choices governments have to take in order to strengthen deterrence.History teaches us that deterrence fails when adversaries sense disunity and weakness. IfRussiaperceives Europe in this way, it may be emboldened to extend its aggression beyond Ukraine. Indeed, we know that Moscow’s intentions range wider than the current conflict. But the good news is that Europe is powerful. Nato is the most successful military alliance in history and today, together, its military might is unsurpassed. We have sophisticated capabilities across land, sea, air and cyber domains, and nuclear deterrence. And we have long been adapting to the new security reality: through building a new model for European security, underpinned by engagement, readiness and collaboration.This starts with Britain andGermanydeepening cooperation. Our landmark Trinity House agreement in 2024 is paving the way for unprecedented cooperation that benefits both our security and economies.Military readiness must mean a strong European defence industry. Ukraine shows us that industrial bases are key to sustaining and ultimately winning any major war. The increased defence spending under way across our countries proves that we are taking this seriously, as we cannot deter if we cannot produce.

These windows of potential energy are never wasted by women’s rights activists. Historically, they have used them to build the#MeToo movement, to fight for legislation change and to push for greater resources for victims.I’ve done it, many times – “never waste a crisis” is my mantra. In the past few weeks, while the nation’s attention has been on thepolitical fallout from the Epstein files, I have seen the opportunity to push for more, for better. To move beyond the throwaway line about the victims being the most important thing – and to actually make them just that. Deeds not words are what matter. If repentance and sorrow is all we achieve out of the courage of the Epstein victims, we will have failed; change is all that will suffice.That said, I am weary, tired and frankly downright furious that women and children must wait for a crisis to get progress. I wish that systems and institutions didn’t need us to bleed first and act second. Women ask for this at times of calm, we shouldn’t have to scream.When we were writing Labour’sviolence against women and girls strategy, this was always at the forefront of my mind. The fact that we couldn’t once again just have some nice prepackaged policy that we could pull off a shelf when the going got tough. It had to be long-term, systemic change in our police, in our courts, in our health services, our armed forces, our housing, our schools. We had to start really focusing on preventing the terrible harm from happening in the first place, not just trying to make nicer plasters to cover up the cuts and bruises. We had to get other government departments to realise that the safety, security and wellbeing of half the population wasn’t just a Home Office issue.I have worked on this issue under many governments – it always felt a bit one note, and investment in prevention has never been made. We had to change that, we had to write a strategy that would actually deliver on our commitment tohalve violence against women and children. Of course, I want to end all violence against women and girls, just like I want world peace, but committing to that would be nothing more than a throwaway line, an aspiration, a pipe dream. Our aim had to be actually achievable and practically measurable.No UK government has ever dared or cared to put a number on the problem before, because this issue has always been seen as too big to deal with or too likely to fail. Our target of halving violence against women and girls within a decade matters to me – it holds us to account, it focuses the minds of those with levers of power and demands that they pull them. Long-term, persistent, consistent, backaching and heartbreaking work is the only thing that is even going to remotely shift the dial on this issue.The NHS has to take responsibility for the consequences of this abuse just as it would with diabetes.Schoolsmust be given the tools to deal with how these incidents affect their pupils. If children grow up to be perpetrators of abuse or end up as victims, that will ruin their life chances and ability to function in the workplace more completely than not being good at maths. It’s no good having an engineering degree if you end up on the sex offender register – and the growing number of young people becoming perpetrators of these crimes should frighten us all.Want to tackle growth and productivity? Well, the annual socioeconomic cost for domestic abuse alone isestimated to be £89bn, without even including, rape, sexual harassment, stalking and other abuses. I could go on and cover every area of policy in every government department that would fail if it didn’t stop and think about how this issue will undermine its progress. This is what this government is seeking to do, to really change this thing once and for all – to change the system, not just react.Police set up national group to deal with UK-related Epstein allegationsRead moreEpstein’s victims don’t just need me to make sure no UK airport could ever be used to traffic them again. Thatloophole has been closed, and we will, of course, close any others we need to – but that isn’t enough. They need me to make sure that those who abused them are actually held accountable so they can’t do it again. They need me to make it so there is less likely to be a future Epstein in a UK classroom today; they need me to make sure legislation stops abusers whouse naked images and online hideawaysto groom them in the first place. They need me to make sure that when they say that they have suffered, not only do they have recourse in the law – but also that their mental health is cared for with therapeutic and social support so that they can recover and live prosperous lives.I will use the momentum of the current political attention on this subject to get more; I always do and always will. It’s how I have been trained to operate over decades, like the scrappy kid at the dinner table of a large family that I am. But I am damned if I will let these pinch-point moments be the only time those calls are heard. The long-term strategy of the government must be exactly that – long term.I am proud of the challenge we have tried to rise to, of the strategy with investment and system change at its heart; but even that we must stretch to meet our ambitions, and it must never only be cared about when it is politically expedient to do so. Epstein’s victims deserve better.Jess Phillips is MP for Birmingham Yardley and parliamentary under-secretary of state for safeguarding and violence against women and girlsDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

She’d woken screaming in severe pain, so we went to the emergency department after consulting a home visiting veterinarian. The vet recommended we admit Karla for X-rays to see if the pain was caused by osteosarcoma – a common and deadly cancer experienced by greyhounds.As we waited, I saw a weeping family, their golden retriever lying preternaturally still on a bed in a consulting room. Their sobs were guttural; I knew what had happened. I looked at social media to distract myself and saw a post from Nagi, talking about her beloved dogDozer’s illness, and felt a sense of connection, but also devastatingly alone in the bond between my dog and me, and the decisions I would need to make about her.São Paulo names new law after dog that stayed by owner’s grave for 10 yearsRead moreEventually, my dog limped into the back with the vet to be sedated and X-rayed. I bent to look into her wide eyes and to hold her close as I felt her tremble and pant against me.“Be brave, this is to help you, I’ll be back very soon,” I whispered, before walking out in a stupor.Since the day I adopted Karla more than eight years ago, I’ve felt the grief of looming loss daily, often needing to stop and remind myself that she’s here now. A simple line, “Karla is here now”, has been a balm for the anticipatory grief I have experienced.I’ve seen this grief in my therapy rooms, too.I’ve spent many a session talking to clients who have lost their beloved pets or are in the process of making end-of-life decisions for their pets, including the excruciating decision about when to let a pet go. The border between hope and futility is fine; made especially harder when loaded with guilt (“Did I do enough?”) or a desire to stave off grief (“Just a little while longer”).The connection between pet and human can be profound, and is often woven into every facet of our daily lives in a manner that few human-to-human relationships allow. Humans who have experienced trauma and loss or may have been rejected by others may have especially strong connections to their pets because of the unconditional love and presence they provide. The grief when this bond is lost can be profound.The pain of losing a pet is no different from the pain we might feel when we lose any other beloved family member. There are some terrible differences though: the disenfranchisement around the experience of pet bereavement, including an insistence that pets are just animals and should be grieved in a more contained manner, the lack of structures to support pet grief (eg bereavement leave), the paucity of socially sanctioned rituals of grief (such as funerals) and silence from many who can’t comprehend the depth of the bond.Working through pet grief is much like any other form of bereavement.There is no therapy that will ease the pain of grief, beyond the simple human connection of sitting with each other in kindness as we hold this hurt.The psychological tasks of grief include mourning the loss, talking about the relationship, staying connected to our pet such as by lighting candles or spending time looking at pictures and videos, seeking connection with those who understand our loss, hosting a memorial service or commemorating our pet in any way that feels right, engaging in basic acts of self-care such as eating well and sleeping, allowing yourself to be distracted from the grief for brief moments, and identifying ways in which we might be making the grief harder – such as through guilt-driven thoughts like, “Perhaps there was still a chance and I should not have let him go”.It’s also important to reduce expectations of ourselves as we grieve.As we farewelled Ronda our soft-hearted labrador, the grief was as painful as any I’ve felt | Paul DaleyRead moreIt is this last task that is often the hardest when we lose a pet. The systems of life and work are not designed to honour this bond, and it’s common to have to go to work the day after losing a pet, or while needing to provide end-of-life care.When Karla became unwell, my managers immediately let me work flexibly between the office and home, and my clients accepted that we would have telehealth appointments for a while. This didn’t make my anticipatory grief any easier to manage but it did mean that I could be present with her and tend to all her needs, alleviating some of the anguish.For the moment, Karla is better. She does not have osteosarcoma, though we are still exploring what caused her pain. I am blessed for now, though I am aware that there will come a day when I will need to process the biggest hurt, without my best friend at my side, just as many others have before me.Dr Ahona Guha is a clinical and forensic psychologist, trauma expert and author from Melbourne.

Keir Starmer looks even weaker than he dida week ago, uncoupled from the aides who wrote his scripts and picked his fights, and only still in his job because the cabinet and parliamentary Labour party stared into a chaotic immediate future and decided not to pounce – for now. The high-stakesGorton and Denton byelectionarrives in less than two weeks’ time. Policy-wise, meanwhile, we are about to finally be presented with a set of plans that have been fitfully gestating for over a year, and causing a quiet chorus of jangling Labour nerves.That sound is now getting louder. Any day now, the government will publish theeducation white papercontaining its plans for sweeping reform of England’s provision for children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities, or Send. Amid rising fears aboutcurrent and future costs, that document will shine light not just on the government’s thinking about the system it wants to change, but even bigger questions about Labour’s views on disability and human difference, and the relationship between families and the state. And if the proposals misfire, this most fragile of administrations will find itself back in the nightmarish place it ended up in when Labour MPsrefused to pass its cuts to disability benefits– only this time, the resulting chaos could consume it.Education secretary Bridget Phillipson and her colleagues want tomaximise the numbers of Send kidstaught at mainstream schools, driven by a staunch belief in the ideal of “inclusion”, and the slightly less idealistic imperative to cut spending on comparatively expensive special school places, and hack down thetransport billsresulting from getting thousands of kids to scarce placements miles away from where they live. Over 10 years, £3.7bnwill be spenton buildings and facilities in mainstream secondary schools that will seemingly contain “inclusion bases”, where kids with the relevant needs will be given extra help.But the government says it wants its new Send model to go much further. It is about to implementwhat it calls“the most ambitious and comprehensive Send training offer ever seen by the English schools system”, which will apparently ensure that “every teacher receives training to support pupils”, in both these new facilities and standard-issue classrooms. So how much has been found for this great leap forward? Here we encounter a gap between lofty ambition and the likely reality that is one of this government’s specialities. The answer? Just £200m – which must cover not just England’salmost 470,000 teachers, but support staff, people who work in further education colleges, early-years workers and more. Even on the most generous estimates, that works out at no more than a couple of hundred pounds per head.There has been no talk at all so far about improving the chronically miserly pay and lowly esteemof teaching assistants, despite the fact that existing Send support in mainstream schools – let alone the kind of hugely ramped-up provision the government wants to create – depends on them. I have also heard precious little about the dire shortage of the speech and occupational therapists who will be needed for the kind of great transformation the government seems to want; nor anything at all about what will happen topost-18 provision. Current Send support can go up to the age of 25, but observing the current conversation, you would think everything starts and ends with schools.And so to a huge anxiety among parents – and many MPs – that will not go away. Some 638,000 children and young people in Englandhave education, health and care plans(ECHPs), those documents that set out needs and support as a matter of legally enforceable rights, and whose numbers have hugely increased largely because of the decline of ad hoc, everyday Send help. For many parents, they form one precious pillar of accountability: the other is the official Send tribunal, to which they can appeal against a council’s refusal to assess their child for an EHCP, or suggested provision that they feel is either lacking or inappropriate. On this score, ministers and their advisers have spent the last year refusing to deny that EHCPs might be on their way out for most families, but also declining to say what they are planning: even now, when asked about any of this, they tend to emit the kind ofnervous wafflethat fills parents with dread.Worse still, the informational vacuum this leaves has been filled by another one of the government’s grimmest habits: near-constantanonymous briefings, often greeted with the maddening Department for Educationmantra: “We do not comment on speculation.” One high-up sourcehas saidthe government may “cut the tribunal off at the knees”: there have been whispers about taking refusals to assess children out of its reach, and further restricting appeals to whether other council decisions have followed the right processes, rather than their actual content. On this evidence, with the caveat that change is likely to be gradually phased in, the plan will not be to restore the Send system to stability by ensuring councils can meet their responsibilities, but by drastically reducing the number of parents they have to deal with: a classic bureaucrats’ fix, which has nothing to do with outcomes for children.In some Westminster circles, such ideas are justified by attacking and guilt-tripping a familiar folk devil: the pushy, sharp-elbowed parent, who supposedly enjoys unfair Send privileges (in truth, fighting for help is agrinding trial, whatever your alleged advantages). Almost certainly, that notion is one key reason why the government seems to be set on limiting legal rights, perhaps encouraged byrecent researchshowing that wealthy areas in England have recently seen bigger increases in Send spending than their poorer counterparts. In this reading, accountability and legal entitlements are mostly a bourgeois sham. It’s telling, though, that people fond of such arguments never make the case for making systems of accountability more open and accessible: the prevailing idea, which often thinly conceals a drive to cut provision, is that because pursuing your rights tends to be less impossible for one layer of society than another, the only egalitarian solution is to ensure no one has any rights at all.All told, the government’s underlying vision seems to be of a great rebalancing, away from personalised support towards the kind of top-down system in which families basically get what they’re given.A reportlast week from Sky News held out exactly this prospect: ministers, it said, “ultimately want to restrict the number of children with specific per-pupil funding packages, and to curb the number of parents who end up taking their case to tribunal”.What that might say about the Starmer government’s basic instincts is both fascinating and depressing. In the midst of all its chaos, this sometimes looks like an oldLabouradministration, in the worst possible way. It has no modern versions of that tradition’s good stuff: massed council-house building, or the creation of the NHS. But what remains is a familiar and very old-fashioned mistrust of redress, choice and accountability, a tendency to side with officials and penpushers, and an apparent belief we should all be grateful for whatever favours the state can give us. At a moment when Labour is being regularly warned of the dangers of retreating into an ideological comfort zone, that would be quite some safe space in which to take refuge. It would also test a lot of people’s faith in a party they hitherto believed was on their side: in all likelihood, to breaking point.John Harris is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsOpinionNeurodiversitySchool fundingChildrenSchoolsLabourcommentShareReuse this content"

But it’s unsuited to modern timesSun 15 Feb 2026 07.14 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 12.25 ESTShareLabour is a more complicated political party than most. For over a century, it has tried to contain warring traditions, philosophies and factions. Internal disagreements have been driven not just by personal rivalries, but by profound differences about how, and how much, to challenge Britain’s deeply embedded arrangements of power and wealth.The party’s current crisis, while most directly caused by Keir Starmer’s political shortcomings and the chillingly selective morality ofPeter Mandelson, is really the result of one Labour tradition demonstrably failing in government to meet the needs of today’s world. Often dominant in the party, especially over the past 40 years, you could call that tradition Labour minimalism.Labour minimalists believe that England is a fundamentally conservative, right-leaning country, in which the party can only succeed electorally and in government by appearing as moderate and unthreatening to powerful interests as possible. In 1985, in his first act as a senior party figure, Mandelson commissioned a report by a fellow Labour minimalist, thepolitical analyst Philip Gould. “Positive perceptions of the Labour party tend to be outweighed by negative concerns,” wrote Gould, “particularly [about] unacceptable ‘beyond the pale’ figures.” Provocative leftwing MPs, bold-sounding leftwing policies, fierce leftwing rhetoric: all should be pared back, marginalised or dropped altogether, the two men agreed, so that Labour could reposition itself advantageously on the centre ground.First under Neil Kinnock, then Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and finally Starmer, minimalism became the party’s operating principle. Labour politics became about discipline, self-denial and self-control; about saying no to spending commitments, selecting the least risky candidates and removing key areas of public life – such as the setting of interest rates – from politics altogether. Meanwhile less careful, more radical Labour leaders – Jeremy Corbyn, and to a lesser extent, Ed Miliband – were branded naive by the minimalists and viciously briefed against in the media.While the Tories veered around wildly in office, U-turning and switching between ideologies to barely a word of criticism from the rightwing press, the Labour hierarchy filled up with micromanagers, constantly trying to avoid negative coverage. Mandelsontold me in 1996: “The small things are very important in politics: you can trip up, fall flat on your face over the most unexpected things … My job as much as anything is to look for the small things, and make sure that others don’t trip over them.”Yet as Mandelson’srelationship with Jeffrey Epsteinand Labour’s often careless dealings with the rich showed, the party’s micromanagers did not always apply their cautious rules to themselves. This was plainly hypocritical, but also revealed a paradox: that this caution bred recklessness.One of Labour minimalism’s key characteristics was its acceptance of much of the social status quo, which increasingly meant accepting extreme wealth. “We are intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich,” as Mandelson famously said in 1998, “as long as they pay their taxes.” Since then, Labour governments have kept taxes on the rich low by European standards, while often praising them as wealth creators.The party has also deferred to other, more modestly privileged right-leaning voters, from prosperous home counties homeowners to socially conservative white men in the “red wall”. Minimalist Labour politicians rarely challenge the views or interests of such groups, or of the truly powerful, and are sometimes welcomed into elite circles in return – as Mandelson discovered to his initial delight and eventual ruin.In 1997, 2001 and 2024, this conciliatory approach helped Labour win huge Commons majorities, far bigger than those achieved by the Tories over the same period. In some ways, the last of these three victories was Labour minimalism’s peak: a list of candidates purged of almost all leftists, a new prime minister who had shed almost all his past radical commitments and a modest total vote concentrated for maximum effect. McSweeney, who had orchestrated Starmer’s rise to the leadership through a pressure group, Labour Together, which at times had barely any members, seemed the ultimate minimalist, narrowing the party to a sharp point.Yet since arriving in office, Labour has discovered to its bewilderment that, outside the party, politics has moved on. Populism is not minimalist but maximalist: huge promises, larger than life leaders, extravagant rhetoric. As well as the startling30% of the electoratewho now say they would vote for Reform UK, there are millions of others with great fears and yearnings, the products of economic, technological and environmental upheaval.The days when enough voters could be satisfied with gradual, understated reforms – as they often were under Blair – feel long gone. Many Britons may insist they hate politicians, or find politics incomprehensible or boring, but the anger they show in vox pops, at protests and online is an acknowledgment that politics, in its broadest sense, has become important again. In an inflamed atmosphere, Labour’s shrunken politics does not resonate.View image in fullscreenWes Streeting and Angela Rayner in 2024.Photograph: Jon Super/APStrikingly, the few popular Starmer policies are the more expansive, less minimalist ones, such asimproving workers’ rightsand rolling outclean energy. They naturally please green activists, trade unions and many progressive voters; but perhaps they also appeal more widely because they show some appreciation that, in a time of crisis, politics needs to be on a bigger scale.Whether or not Starmer’s premiership lasts much longer, and whoever wins the ever more obvious contest to succeed him, there suddenly seems agreement across Labour that the government should be bolder, more inclusive and truer to the party’s more egalitarian values. In other words, the minimalist politics practised so effectively and then so disastrously by Mandelson and McSweeney is out, for now at least.Since his political near-death experience,Starmer has sounded less constrained in public. Of his possible successors, Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham are probably too sweeping in their critiques of modern Britain to become wholly cautious prime ministers; and even Wes Streeting – long the preferred choice of Labour control freaks – has been speaking out on topics outside his brief, such asthe far rightand Gaza.Labour appears to have belatedly realised that the era of small politics is over. But to prevent what may be an epic political disaster – Britain’s first government of the populist hard right – it will almost certainly need to make alliances and compromises with other parties. In politics as in life, sometimes the more control you seek, the less you ultimately get.Andy Beckett is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionKeir StarmerPeter MandelsoncommentShareReuse this content"

The radical clerics benefited then, but who would prevail this time?Sun 15 Feb 2026 01.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 06.46 ESTShareAcritical moment looms for Iran, and so for the Middle East. The global consequences of any upheaval in Tehran have been made amply clear since therevolution in 1979that ushered in the rule of radical Islamist clerics. In Oman, the Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi and his teamhave begun indirect talkswith a high-powered US delegation. Many analysts believe the gap between the two sides is too wide to be bridged, and that a conflict is inevitable. Just this weekend, having already threatened military action,Donald Trump saidregime change is the “the best thing that could happen” in Iran. The tension, and risks grow higher.The hold on Iran of those who came to power in the aftermath of the 1979 revolution is now at stake. The ultimate objective of the US appears to be regime change. This may, in fact, already be under way. In December 2025 and January 2026, the most extensive wave of protest since the early 1980sswept Iran, with hundreds of thousands taking to the streets from Mashhad to Abadan.Such scenes prompted many to recall thelast days of the shahof Iran, when millions took to the streets. And as we live through contemporary events, there are striking similarities between then and now that should inform the debate about what may happen, about our hopes and our fears. One obvious parallel is the central role of economics. Soaring inflation was a key trigger for the most recent unrest. It was almost 50 years ago as well. In 1977, the price of basic consumer goods rose as much as 27%. Then, too, the key actors were shopkeepers and businessmen in Tehran’s bazaar whose livelihoods were threatened.A second parallel is emerging: a cycle of repression, grief and protest resembling that which unseated the shah. In 1978, this began when a conservative Iranian newspaper printed a scurrilous article aboutAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, prompting mass protests among his admirers. In the holy city of Qom, hundreds of religious students poured into the streets, attacking symbols of the shah’s rule and the modernisation he had sought to impose. Security forces used live ammunition to restore order and six students were killed. In Tehran there was further unrest.The protests might have died away but for the tradition among Shia Muslims, who still nominally constitute the vast majority of the Iranian population, to observe a 40-day period of mourning before a final collective commemoration.Ryszard Kapuściński, thecelebrated Polish reporter, described how family, friends, neighbours and acquaintances – “the whole street, the whole village, a crowd of people” – gathered in the home of the deceased. “If the death was natural … this gathering consists of some hours of ecstatic, pathetic discharge, followed by a mood of dulled and humble resignation,” he wrote. But “if the death was a violent one, inflicted by somebody” then “a thirst for revenge seizes the people [and] … they pronounce the name of the killer, the author of their sorrow, and it is believed that, even if he is far away, he will shudder at that moment [for] his days are numbered”.Exactly 40 days after the protests in Qom in January 1978, new demonstrations led to new killings, along with further mourning and commemorative processions that inevitably turned into new mass protests. These of course prompted further lethal repression. The cycle intensified until in January 1979 the shah, the “author of their sorrow”, left Iran – supposedly for a holiday – never to return.That cycle could well recur. Last Thursday, theWall Street Journal reportedthat merchants at Tehran’s grand bazaar had called on their counterparts across Iran to return to the streets at the end of the traditional 40-day mourning period for killings in the first week of January. The aim of the protest will be to “simultaneously, in their cities, keep the memory of the dead alive and continue the national uprising,” a trade association of bazaar workers quoted by the WSJ said on its Telegram channel. The goal is to “avenge the greatest street massacre in contemporary history”.This may be a much bigger challenge to the regime than even the threat of US strikes if, as expected, talks fail.Ali Ansari, a leading historian of Iran, hasput the total death tollin opposition to the shah in 1978 as approximately 2,800. Some believeup to 30,000 may have diedin January. That means a lot of mourners and a lot of 40-day commemorations in the coming weeks.Kapuściński, along with hundreds of international reporters and photographers, was on the ground in Iran in 1978, but there are no equivalents today, and the regime continues to restrict the internet. This makes it hard to work out exactly who was on the streets of Iran last December and in January. That the unrest was widespread, and an authentic expression of profound anger and alienation, seems clear. But the tragic biographies of casualties that have emerged offer only a fragmentary glimpse of the identities of those risking death and injury in the name of freedom.We know that the 1978 revolutionary movement was a broad coalition. It included the radical clerics who followed Khomeini and the many millions of often poor, less educated Iranians who saw the exiled ayatollah as, sometimes quite literally, the answer to their prayers. But there were also others, many of whom had worked as hard and made as many sacrifices in the struggle to overthrow the shah.On the streets in 1978 and 1979 were liberals and nationalists of every possible ideological flavour, socialists and feminists, moderate clerics and their students, even a few old-school communists. There were representatives of Iran’s ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities too. This variety had advantages and disadvantages. As Kapuściński wrote: “Everyone opposed the Shah and wanted to remove him. But everyone imagined the future differently.”Even if the current regime is toppled, any new direction may not even be immediately clear, for it’s worth noting that Khomeini did not immediately seize power on his return. It took several years for his rule to be fully secured, built on war with Iraq, new institutions, a new constitution, and new security forces such as theIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corpsand the Basij. These were deployed to methodically destroy every potential opponent in Iran between 1979 and 1988, and were also the bloody spearhead of the regime’s response to the most recent unrest.War, a Trump-imposed deal or internal regime collapse: for Tehran, none of the options are good | Sanam VakilRead moreThere is a lesson in this for the courageous men and women in Iran who seek the overthrow of their rulers today. Now, as then, their triumph can only come through the mass mobilisation of millions and the construction of a broad coalition. But though all will share many common goals, there will be as many different visions for the future of Iran today as there were among those who felled the shah in 1979. Back then, their sheer diversity became a weakness, allowing the one faction to impose an authoritarian rule and hardline vision at the expense of all others.So the regime may fall, but if it does, the future is as hard to predict as it was amid the tumult 47 years ago. The people may prevail and find that the real battle for freedom, prosperity and security has only just begun.Jason Burke is the international security correspondent of the Guardian and author ofThe Revolutionists: The Story of the Extremists Who Hijacked the 1970sExplore more on these topicsIranOpinionMiddle East and north AfricaRyszard KapuścińskicommentShareReuse this content"

Ahead of his prison drama Wasteman, David Jonsson discusses the pressures of being a leading Black British actorSun 15 Feb 2026 05.00 ESTLast modified on Sun 15 Feb 2026 07.56 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleDavid Jonsson is the kind of actor who disappears so completely into his roles that it’s easy to forget you’re watching the same person each time. In Rye Lane, he’s a lovestruck south Londoner; in Industry, an Etonian banker with ice in his veins; in Alien: Romulus, a paranoid android. He’s now starring as heroin addict Taylor in the ultraviolent British prison drama Wasteman and, for the first time, the 32-year-old actor claims he is playing something close to himself. “This is the most personal role I’ve done,” he says. “It’s so messed up because it’s a dark story about rehabilitation and addiction, but I know these men really well. Especially when you’re growing up somewhere like where I did.”We meet on a Friday afternoon at a photo studio in Islington, closer to where Jonsson lives now in north London than to Custom House in the East End, where he grew up. He arrives wearing a beanie pulled tight over his cornrows and a windbreaker. He looks stylish but carries a delicate shyness that mirrors his character’s air of desperation. Wasteman, which opens this month after a critically acclaimed festival run that netted five British Independent Film awards (Bifa) nominations including best lead performance for Jonsson, tells the story of Taylor, a young father who has spent 13 years in prison for a crime he committed as a teenager. In the film’s unflinching depiction of the British prison system, he’s referred to as a “nitty” – UK slang for a desperate, pathetic drug addict. Jonsson lost 1.8 stone to embody Taylor’s “wasted” physique. “I wasmawga, properly skinny,” he says, slipping into patois.Jonsson is the youngest of four children, born to working-class parents – his mother a police officer, his father an IT engineer at Heathrow. His background is Creole: Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the Caribbean, with a Swedish surname that hints at truly global origins. But when he was 11, his parents separated and the one stable thing in his life collapsed. “When you come from a broken home, it changes you,” he says. “That’s part of what happens with Taylor.” It’s the knock-on effect of incarceration that Wasteman portrays with devastating clarity: punishment doesn’t end with the prisoner.At school, that instability manifested as trouble and he was expelled for fighting. “I wasn’t a bad kid at all,” he insists. “I was just a bit … distracted at the time.” He remembers coming home to tell his mother, who had just finished a night shift. She was one of the first Black PCSO officers in London, walking a beat in Islington for decades – the same area we’re sitting in now. Exhausted and extremely disappointed, she asked what he wanted to do with his life. It was one of those existential questions parents ask when you least want to hear it, and Jonsson surprised himself with his answer: he wanted to act. “My parents are hard workers: if you want something then prove it. There’s no point talking about it.” It seems that ethos is still with him; he refers to acting as “a job” rather than “a craft” or “calling” like many young actors.The irony of having a police officer mother isn’t lost on Jonsson: she spent a decade arresting boys like him, while he now plays a man brutalised by the very system she served. Does that complicate his thoughts on the prison system? “Of course. I have sympathy for everyone working to keep us safe. But growing up as a young Black man in London, I’ve had some weird things happen.” He won’t elaborate, but the implication is clear: his mother’s profession and his own experiences exist in uncomfortable tension – a tension present throughout Wasteman.After being expelled, he moved to a school in Hammersmith – a 90-minute commute across the city – and discovered acting through school plays and the National Youth Theatre. At 16, he won a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, spending much of his two years there skating in Washington Square Park before returning to London. After his mother suggested he audition for Rada, he promptly won a place.View image in fullscreenStreets ahead … David Jonsson and Vivian Oparah in Rye Lane.Photograph: Chris Harris/20th Century StudiosWasteman was, improbably, Jonsson’s first ever film audition. He was fresh out of drama school and focused entirely on theatre, when his agent sent him the script – not for Taylor, but for Dee, the more traditionally violent convict character eventually portrayed by Tom Blyth (a far cry from Blyth’s role in Netflix’s frothy romcom People We Meet on Vacation). “I got my girlfriend at the time to draw a tattoo on my neck,” he recalls. “The director threw a punch at me. I threw a chair at him. I thought I nailed it.” Then he heard nothing. “I was like, ‘Oh: I guess I’m not as good as I thought.’”The film had been with A24 and the Safdie Brothers, who ended up dropping the project to make the Adam Sandler-starring crime drama Uncut Gems instead, meaning the project sat dormant for years. In the meantime, Jonsson left Rada early to joinRobert Icke’s stage revival of Mary Stuart, playing opposite Juliet Stevenson. His screen breakthrough came with Industry in 2020, the BBC and HBO series about cutthroat young investment bankers. Cast as Augustus “Gus” Sackey, Jonsson visited Eton and Oxford to research the role of a privileged Black man navigating the overwhelmingly white world of high finance. The performance was revelatory, but after two series, just as the show was becoming a hit, he left. “You only get one life,”he told GQ in August 2025. “Life is short, art is long.”His first gig post-Industry was Rye Lane, a joyful south London romcom that premiered at Sundance to whatDeadline called “sunny, irreverent” acclaim. Then came BBC Christmas detective drama Murder Is Easy, in which Jonsson became the first Black actor to lead an Agatha Christie adaptation. That milestone resurfaces in the news on the morning we meet – a BBC-commissioned review warning against “tick box” diversity casting has just been published, explicitly citing Murder Is Easy as an example of diversity being “superimposed” on a story. The review argues that “unless it’s very skilfully done, there is a danger it will feel overly didactic and preachy.”View image in fullscreenPlane sailing … Jonsson as Gus Sackey in Industry.Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC/Bad Wolf/HBOJonsson is diplomatic when I bring it up. “I’m always going to be British,” he says. “Britain will always be home for me. Even when I worked onAlien– this massive American studio film – they’d reference my British sensibility. And I’m like, ‘Yeah, that’s part of it. We do things differently on this tiny island.’” He’s undeniably benefited from a shifting landscape; in the wake of Black Lives Matter, British broadcasters began addressing the whiteness of their output. What’s striking is that he’s already experienced different phases of the conversation – first subverting expectations in Industry, then receiving backlash as a Black lead in period drama.His casting as a Black robot in 2024’s Alien: Romulus engendered a predictable wave of criticism, too. But his race brought an unexpected edge to the film’s exploration of the ubiquitous sci-fi question, “What does it mean to be human?”, and the film’s $351m box office haul showed the value of inspired casting. When director Fede Álvarez asked him to deliver the franchise’s most famous line – the Sigourney Weaver battle cry “Get away from her, you bitch” – Jonsson understood the stakes. “I was like: ‘I don’t know – you’re kidding right?’” Jonsson recalls, laughing. “Fede said: ‘Just give me one.’ I did and that was the take that made it into the film.”He’s grinning through the anecdote, but the significance isn’t lost on him. Alien brought visibility, and visibility brought a 2025 Bafta rising star award. When he accepted it, he quipped: “Star, I don’t know, but rising – I guess.” Then he turned serious: “Growing up, I had the Denzel Washingtons and Idris Elbas, but they’re not me. There’s not enough space for diverse talent in this industry. I realise I have an important role in defining what Black is.”View image in fullscreenBreak out star … David Jonsson. Photographed at Angel Space; grooming: Asata Allen; stylist: David Larson.Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The GuardianIt’s a responsibility he remains acutely aware of. “Every character I do, no matter what, I’m going to be a Black man first,” he says now, echoing the sentiment expressed in his acceptance speech. “Until we change what it is [to be a Black man], everyone’s going to have a certain view on it, you know what I mean? But I think that is evolving.”In Wasteman, Taylor’s Blackness is never explicitly discussed, yet it shapes everything – the way guards speak to him, the institutional contempt he faces, the lack of resources available to him. This feels deliberate: a crime drama with a Black lead where Blackness isn’t the story. Taylor faces no overtly racist guards or prison gangs. Instead, the racial dynamics are present but unstated, which makes them all the more insidious.The preparation for the role was intense. Jonsson worked with a charity that reintegrates former inmates and watched “folders and folders” of iPhone footage shot inside British prisons. Many of the supporting cast are former inmates themselves. He watched Steve McQueen’s Hunger – the film about IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands – multiple times in the lead-up. “This feeling of people doing something beyond themselves in a contained existence. That’s what’s happening with Taylor. He’s waking up, hitting the drugs, fighting for his life daily, going to sleep, rinsing and repeating. You’ve got to have something keeping you going,” he says.View image in fullscreenThe hard cell … David Jonsson and Tom Blyth in Wasteman.Photograph: Lionsgate UKThe idea of his character’s motivation clearly resonates: “Here comes the cringe,” says Jonsson, suddenly self-aware, “but I feel like I’m quite a complicated person. Sometimes I feel great and happy and sometimes I’m not. The darker stuff right now is interesting me.”Faith, he explains, helps him navigate that darkness. He grew up in the church and still attends, describing it as his “north star”, though he’s careful not to be preachy. “Faith is a personal thing for me. It’s what keeps me going. Life is tough enough without having something outside you … there’s a lot of darkness behind this wall, you know?”Perhaps the most devastating moment in Wasteman comes when Taylor speaks to his young son for the very first time – on FaceTime. Jonsson, too, met the actor playing his son for the first time during the scene. “The reaction I had is what made it into the movie. Imagine if that was your truth – for some people it is.” Taylor’s incarceration hasn’t just stolen his own life – it’s robbed his son of a father, perpetuating the exact cycle of absence that shaped Taylor himself.View image in fullscreenDavid Jonsson as Andy in Alien: Romulus.Photograph: 20th Century StudiosIf Wasteman represents one kind of intense male relationship under duress, The Long Walk represents another. The Stephen King adaptation follows a group of teenage boys forced to walk at a relentless pace until only one survives. Jonsson plays the buff Pete McVries opposite Cooper Hoffman’s Ray Garraty, a boy grieving his father’s death. The film’s premise is brutal – teenage boys walking themselves to death for public entertainment – but the real story is about what happens between Ray and Pete as exhaustion strips them bare.Shot in chronological order over six-and-a-half weeks in Winnipeg, the film required the ensemble to walk many miles each day. “We didn’t really know what we were getting ourselves into,” Jonsson recalls. “Baking sun, torrential rain, freezing cold. It was like a marathon.” By the end, he and Hoffman had covered about 350 miles together. The physical ordeal wasn’t method acting for its own sake – it was the point. “I don’t like acting tired. I’d rather just do it,” he says.But it’s the emotional landscape – and his relationship with Hoffman – that affected Jonsson most deeply. “I’ve never met anyone like him,” he says of his co-star, the 22-year-old son of the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. “He’s phenomenal. But there’s always more with Cooper. Always something deeper.” Filming a scene in which Hoffman’s character talks about losing his father, Jonsson found himself genuinely moved by what his co-star delivered. “They say our job as actors is to listen. And listening to him was transformative for me.” He pauses, choosing his words carefully. “You do stop and think, ‘where’s the line?’ And then you go, hang on, that’s incredibly brave, putting something of yourself out there for other people.”View image in fullscreenPartners in crime … Jonsson with Morfydd Clark in Murder Is Easy.Photograph: Album/AlamyNow Jonsson and Hoffman are reuniting for upcoming crime comedy The Chaperones. When Jonsson talks about their partnership, he invokes old Hollywood. “I think about Matt Damon and Ben Affleck teaming up, doing stuff again. I kind of dig that.” It’s a deliberate aspiration: two hungry young actors trying to recapture the magic of the late-90s indie boom that birthed, among other things, Hoffman’s father. “We’ve got a chance to go to places we haven’t been,” says Jonsson. “That’s a gift.”What’s next is characteristically ambitious. He’s currently filming Colman Domingo’s directorial debut Scandalous, playing Sammy Davis Jr opposite Sydney Sweeney’s Kim Novak. He’s also intriguingly set to star in Frank Ocean’s long-awaited directorial debut, though details remain scant. It’s a far cry from Custom House, yet Jonsson insists on treating it all as work rather than destiny. “That’s why I call it a job,” he says. “If I don’t, I’m in la-la land.”Sitting cross-legged, beanie pulled tight, he seems remarkably at peace with not having all the answers. “I wish I could say I know what I’m doing,” he admits when I ask about navigating this new level of visibility. It’s an unassuming approach and perhaps a helpful one when it comes to completely disappearing into a role. But with Wasteman, for the first time, Jonsson isn’t disappearing at all – he’s showing us exactly who he might have been.“It was scary, actually,” he says, hesitating slightly. The fear, he explains, wasn’t about the physical transformation or even the character’s darkness – it was about proximity. “I look at myself, someone who got kicked out of school, and I think: one wrong turn – one bad choice – that’s all it takes. Taylor made that choice. I didn’t – but I could have.”Wasteman is released in UK cinemas on20 February.Explore more on these topicsDavid JonssonAlienDrama filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsinterviewsShareReuse this content"

And we also know stories about relationship transgressions, of partnerships tested or broken by infidelity.As an evolutionary biologist who studies sex and relationships, I’m fascinated by these two truths. We humans make romantic commitments to each other – and some also break those commitments by cheating.This might sound like a modern problem, but for me, it raises questions stretching far back in evolutionary time. Why did we evolve botha tendency to stayanda tendency to stray? If some among us will inevitably cheat, does that mean humans are hardwired for infidelity?Answering those questions requires us to understand two key urges that propel our romantic and sexual behaviours as a species: the drive for a romantic bond and the drive for sexual novelty. Research shows that humans have evolved to seek secure partnership in the form of close pair-bond relationships, but it also shows, just as compellingly, that we’ve evolved a separate appetite for variety. Both drives are alive in us modern human beings, despite being at cross-purposes.Yet some of us seek novelty more than others. In 2010, my research colleagues and I made a shocking discovery when we found that some people’s genetic makeup does indeed create a predisposition to engage in infidelity. We conducted behavioural surveys and collected DNA from a sample of young adults. We then compared the subjects’ reported behaviours against their genetic variations. Specifically, we looked at genes that influence the function of dopamine receptor cells in the brain.In the brain, dopamine creates feelings of excitement and anticipation, and past research had shown that people who had the “long” version of specific dopamine genes, rather than the “short” version, tended toward thrill-seeking and risk-taking behaviour. This includes associations with alcohol abuse and gambling. In our study, we found that people who have the “long” version of the dopamine D4 receptor gene were 50% more likely to report having engaged in infidelity, and they were more likely to have done so multiple times.Of course not everyone with the “infidelity gene” will betray their partners – biology isn’t destiny, genetics being just one of a myriad of factors that influence us – but the study does suggest our ancestors evolved in such a way that some of the population would be more predisposed to sensation-seeking, and specifically sexual novelty, than others.View image in fullscreenMacaques are among the species that exhibit “mate guarding”.Photograph: Greg HillWhy did we develop such a range of personalities and tendencies, and what does it mean for us today? Evolutionarily speaking, in any given population, it can be adaptive for some individuals to be inclined to take a risk and for others to play it safe, and for yet others to fall somewhere in between. This has shown to be true in all kinds of species: fish, for example. Studies show that in a given pond, it can be adaptive for the population to evolve some shy fish who stay safely in the deep end, and some bold ones who spend time in the shallows where, though they may get eaten, they also have access to more resources.In other words, I think of infidelity as a phenomenon that can be understood at least in part as evolutionary adaptation – that is, a trait that can promote greater reproductive success. If some of our forebears were unfaithful, that might have led to more offspring, or more diverse offspring with different genetic mixes.I still wouldn’t say we’re “hardwired” for infidelity, though. From an evolutionary standpoint, yes, we did inherit the potential to have sex outside our primary relationships. And yet in the modern social context, I think the more helpful framework is this: we’re wired not for infidelity, but for sexual novelty.Because let’s not forget the other, equally powerful romantic drive our ancestors passed on to us: the adaptive motivation to form committed pair-bonds and protect them. This is a drive many species share: some animals attempt to enforce their mate’s sexual fidelity by screaming, biting and clawing any interloper who gets too close to their pair-bonded partner, a behaviour known as “mate guarding”.When we look at human pair-bonds specifically, we see that we’ve evolved to seek out a trustworthy co-pilot and to protect that connection. I would argue that this was a way that humans managed uncertainty in our ancestral conditions, and still do today. In order to weather a storm with someone, you want to know that you can count on that person when the going gets tough.Infidelity is by definition non-consensual, a betrayal of the expectations of the relationship. When the drive for novelty is expressed that way, it can erode and even destroy trust in one’s partner and in the relationship. In other words, it threatens the pair-bond and can be devastating for both individuals.I don’t believe we’ve evolved to have to endure betrayal and pain. The better question, then, is this: what do we do with these two drives that, in the course of a long relationship, may grow to be at odds with each other? Can the human drive to seek novelty be explored in healthy ways?I believe so. For some people, that may mean opening their relationship. For others it can mean finding ways to integrate novelty into their existing bond. This in itself can be a way to cultivate greater closeness.Doing new things with your partner is great fuel for passion over time. In our research on long-term passion in couples of all sexual orientations, we found those who maintained sexual satisfaction engaged in a range of behaviours associated with intimacy and closeness. These might include giving or receiving a massage, going on a romantic getaway or planning a date night. And when it comes to a desire for sexual novelty, it could include talking about or acting out fantasies, trying new positions, or using a sex toy together.On the surface, this might read as though the trick to sustaining interest is simply lots of sexual variety, but I believe the findings actually tell a deeper story about connection. Experimenting outside your comfort zone demonstrates interest in being intimate, and in so doing it communicates trust, vulnerability and attachment. That goes beyond any particular act of sex. Its power lies in the commitment to advancing passion, together.Dr Justin Garcia is executive director of the Kinsey Institute and author of The Intimate Animal: The Science of Love, Fidelity and Connection(Penguin Life).Further readingThe State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity by Esther Perel (Yellow Kite, £10.99)Secure Love: Create a Relationship That Lasts a Lifetime by Julie Mennano (Penguin, £12.99)Why We Love: The Definitive Guide to Our Most Fundamental Need by Anna Machin (W&N £10.99)Explore more on these topicsSexualityThe big ideaSexSociety booksGeneticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

You can be demanding, inconvenient, stubborn, complicated, troublesome, baffling, illegible. Black womanhood is one place where all these forms of difficulty overlap. I feel like I have always known this; I have been called difficult more times in my life than I can count. But I only began to understand – to discover the meanings and uses of – my own difficulty because ofToni Morrison.Morrison has shaped the way we think about everything from literature to politics, criticism to ethics, to the responsibilities of making art. In 1993 she became the only black woman ever to win the Nobel prize in literature. But the facts remain: she is difficult to read. She is difficult to teach. Notwithstanding the voluminous train of profiles, reviews and scholarly analysis that she drags behind her, she is difficult to write about. More to the point, she is our only truly canonical black female writer – and her work is highly complex.In a 1981 Vogue profile, Morrison spoke of a reader who had “told her how difficult it was to understand black culture in her books – it was so removed from his experience”. She had responded: “Boy, you must have had a hell of a time with Beowulf!” The Vogue interviewer, missing the wit in this retort, commented: “Morrison has no patience with people who plead ignorance; but then, she does not pride herself on being a patient woman. ‘I find myself being more and more difficult,’ she says. ‘It’s something I really relish.’” Morrison’s literary difficulty was often translated this way into a personal difficulty, a moral failing:How dare she be impatient!Well, wouldn’t you be?One reason for Morrison’s air of pique was surely the strain of trying to balance the demands of multiple careers simultaneously. She was an editor, a professor, a writer, a critic and a public intellectual. I have worked in these fields as well, so I know that extending many branches can be a way of distracting yourself from the core vocation. The commitment to writing over all else is often viewed as selfish; when gender is factored into the equation, the charge can carry the stigma of illegitimacy. “For a woman to say, ‘I am a writer’ is difficult,” Morrison noted succinctly.Morrison’s childhood stories read like photo negatives of the standard American race narrativesShe struggled to accommodate these forms of often underpaid literary labour with the unpaid domestic labour of raising two sons as a single mother: “It was very difficult writing and rearing children because they deserve all your time, and you don’t have it.” This occupational difficulty was exacerbated not only by the fact that she was unique in her fields but also by the fact that she often wilfully chose to go it alone. For example, she didn’t tell anyone at her first job in trade publishing that she was writing a novel untilThe Bluest Eyecame out at another house.As troublesome as difficulty may have been for her professionally, Morrison genuinely delighted in the difficulty of other black women artists, such as the novelist Gayl Jones, whose works she edited and published, and the jazz pianist and composer Mary Lou Williams. For Morrison, the fact that they were considered difficult was a sign that they had insisted on their art being taken seriously.To read Morrison herself with the seriousness that she deserves requires that we account for the knot – or bind – of gender and race she shared with them. It is not an easy one to untangle. AsMorrison wrotein a 1971 New York Times op-ed about feminism, “one must look very closely at the black woman herself – a difficult, inevitably doomed proposition, for if anything is true of black women, it is how consistently they have (deliberately, I suspect) defied classification”.Morrison’s childhood stories read like photo negatives of the standard American race narratives. She spoke of her father’s “defensive racism”, which prompted him to throw a predatory white landlord down the stairs. She spoke of her mother’s insistence on integrating every new movie theatre in town. She spoke of how when her “pitch-black” great-grandmother had first set eyes on Morrison and her sister, she said the girls had “been tampered with”, which was meant racially: “We were not pure and she was.”The dynamics of my mixed-race family didn’t match the norms, either. My black Zambian grandmother, for whom I’m named, initially disapproved of my mother’s decision to marry a white man; my mother’s older sister refused to attend the wedding. Our moves to the UK and then to the US when I was a kid – with a year back in Zambia when I was a teenager – were punctuated by moments of racial absurdity: “What are you? Black or white?” (As if I had a choice!) Yet even now, at my grown age, my first response to racism is surprise.Despite our respective births in disparate times and places (Lorain, Ohio, in 1931; Lusaka, Zambia, in 1980), I think Morrison and I both lucked into the strange privilege of zooming out from or boomeranging around race. This perhaps explains why neither of us tends to capitalise the word black when referring to people in writing. It concedes too much; it protests too much.How dare she demand to be taken seriously? How dare she be a black artist with real ideas?Morrison temperamentally disliked being pigeonholed. She was willing to accept “the labels” of race and gender only because, as she put it in a profile in the New Yorker, “being a black woman writer is not a shallow place but a rich place to write from. It doesn’t limit my imagination; it expands it.” She often complained that literary criticism was unequipped to read black writing, which gets read as merelyrepresentative, in both the tokenistic and identitarian senses: “Black literature is taught as sociology, as tolerance, not as a serious, rigorous art form,” she said.Indeed, the ultimate source of Morrison’s renowned difficulty was not, I would submit, her prickly personality, her intersectional identity, or even her sometimes contrarian politics. It was her commitment to reflecting the range and depth of black aesthetics – as epitomised by jazz, which she called “very complicated, very sophisticated, and very difficult” – in her own writing.Her close friend, the writer Fran Lebowitz, said upon Morrison’s passing in 2019: “I know it sounds like a crazy thing to say, but I always thought Toni’s writing was underappreciated. Because people always looked at it through the prism of her being black and being a woman. But Toni was a very experimental writer. There were a lot of things Toni did through her writing that just went unremarked upon.”Many still dismiss Morrison’s stature as either undeserved or obvious, as if surely so much praise either begs the question or settles it. They justify their disinclination to engage with the art itself by gesturing to what we might call her DEI-fication or her Oprah‑priation, as if Toni Morrison became Toni Morrison through some kind of literary affirmative action plan.Toni at Random by Dana A Williams review – Toni Morrison’s editing yearsRead moreIt’s rumoured that a black woman novelist on the board voted against Beloved receiving a National Book Award in 1987. A white colleague of mine at Harvard once told me he found Beloved sentimental – it never occurred to him that Morrison had intentionally leaned into sentimentality for effect. I’ve heard eminent black male scholars joke about whether she had stolen the book’s plot about a fugitive slave, and about whether her literary ambition had made her a bad mother.Morrison incensed all kinds of people. How dare she be a difficult writer and a black woman? How dare she refuse to placate or translate? How dare she demand to be taken seriously? How dare she be a black artist with real ideas? How dare she ask that we actually read her writing, and on its own terms?It could not have been easy to be Toni Morrison. Yet I aspire to it. I yearn for that freedom she so beautifully embodied: to feel at ease to be difficult.This is an edited extract from On Morrison by Namwali Serpell, published by Chatto & Windus.

I was rooting for you, we wereall rooting for you, how dare you!”‘Abject horror’: the troubling history of paedophile-hunting TV showsRead moreThe confrontation might have happened in 2005, before gifs and memes were as deeply embedded within our culture, but it’s managed to survive and mutate, a copy-paste punchline easily found on many a social media thread. Yet it doesn’t take much to figure out that something darker is happening in the scene and something even darker was taking place off-camera.“There was a lot more that was really said,” says Jay Manuel, one of Tyra’s ex on-screen right-hand men, in a new docuseries. “I will probably never repeat the lines that were actually said in the room that day … People have tried to make it something funny but it really wasn’t.”The re-assessment of America’s Next Top Model, from revolutionary reality show to hotbed of toxicity, had slowly been taking place in the years since it ended but it gathered steam during the pandemic when so many of us had much more TV watching time on our hands. It’s not as if the millennials who grew up with the show, which aired from 2003 until 2018, weren’t aware of how problematic so much of it was but it took a younger generation to look at it with fresh eyes, and what Banks now calls “a 2020 lens”, to bring about a social media reckoning. The cavalcade of aghast YouTube and TikTok breakdowns of crucially awful scenes (bodyshaming, racism, pretty much everything judge Janice Dickinson said) forced Banks, who created and hosted the show for 22 of its 24 cycles, to respond. Snippets, from panels or elsewhere online, showed her to be overly defensive, highlighting the good in an attempt to paper over the bad, but it wasn’t enough and finally, she’s agreed to be part of Netflix’s juicy three-part series Reality Check, the most substantive ANTM autopsy to date.“There was a lot of beauty in this show,” co-director Mor Loushy says to the Guardian in a video interview. “There was a lot of ugliness in this show. But let’s talk about all of it.”It’s understandable why Banks would have an initial impulse to play defence. She’d grown up in the fashion industry at a time when there were very few Black women allowed in and while she had opened doors (she was the first Black woman on the front of Sports Illustrated and GQ and was one of the very few women of colour to achieve supermodel status) she’d also had plenty closed in her face. “I would go home and just feel defeated,” Banks says of her early modelling days in Paris. “I was constantly being told no you can’t do this because you’re Black. There were not a lot of Black models back then. We were being paid so much less just because of the colour of our skin.”The idea of a reality show about models – pitched as The Real World meets American Idol – was her way to not only find “payback” as she calls it but also show that diversity within the industry was essential. The process of trying to sell it to a network led to yet more rejection for Banks (models were seen as “unsympathetic” characters) but after it was finally sold to Paramount offshoot UPN, it became a surprise ratings hit and provided an underserved young female majority audience with something unusually relatable.But while the show did offer up the idea of diversity – women of colour, queer and trans contestants, plus-sized models – it also upheld the same standards Banks was apparently railing against.“They started as misfits with very good intentions,” co-director Daniel Sivan says. “They were starting as disruptors but as power grew, they became bullies.”The series documents how Banks and her panel of judges, including two gay men of colour in Jay Manuel and J Alexander aka Miss J (another revolutionary addition at the time), found ways to make magnetic television (in its heyday, the show was watched in 170 countries) but often at the expense of the women, who were as young as 18, at its centre. “They did these girls so dirty,” says an influencer clipped in a montage.View image in fullscreenTyra BanksPhotograph: Barbara Nitke/Cw Network/Kobal/ShutterstockThe ways in which they were done dirty go from micro to macro and denigrating to downright dangerous. There was Dani Evans who was told she needed to close her tooth gap in order to stay on the show, something she eventually allowed them to do as part of a “makeover” (“It’s my life and it was toyed with consciously,” she says while Tyra says she was “between a rock and a hard place” when she gave the advice). There was Keenyah Hill who went from being bullied at school for being too thin to her exaggerated “overeating” being turned into a cruelly edited storyline (comments graduated from “shaped like a boy minus the breasts” to “Keenyahneedsto lose weight”). There was Dionne Walters who had to pose as a shooting victim in the “crime scene” week after she had told producers that her mother had been shot years earlier (“I think they wanted to see some type of mental breakdown,” she says).There was a weight test for contestants in earlier seasons, making young women like Shannon Stewart, who was struggling with an eating disorder, even more conscious of her body. There was also the infamous “race-swapping” week which saw contestants wearing make-up and styling to cosplay as other races, a genuinely shocking clip to rewatch (“This was my way of showing the world that brown and Black is beautiful,” Banks says of her initial intention before later admitting “It’s an issue and I understand 100% why”).Then there was Shandi Sullivan who says what was framed as a drunken indiscretion with a male model was in fact sexual assault and the cameras kept filming anyway (“No one did anything to stop it,” she says, tearfully).“It was definitely one of the most difficult interviews I’ve ever done in my life,” Loushy says. “It was a really a red line that was crossed in so many ways.”One of the most chilling moments in the series is a shameful defence for the decision to keep the camera rolling, not just during the assault but after as Shandi calls her boyfriend in tears. The makers were filming a “documentary” so they shouldn’t interrupt what’s taking place.“Being a documentary film-maker is not a get out of jail free card,” Sivan says. “Even in this interview, which Mo conducted, Shandi broke down crying and Mo said cut and we stopped because you don’t just keep filming because it’s good TV.”When Banks is asked about this particular incident, she says “it’s a little difficult for me to talk about production because that’s not my territory”.Banks was not alone in making Top Model of course, the show became a collaboration between her and producer Ken Mok as well as those involved with the network. It makes blame “complex”, says Loushy. The women they speak to clearly have a great deal of anger for Banks, who flipped between protective house-mother and betrayer-in-chief, but the show existed at a corrosive pop culture moment where women’s bodies were being scrutinised and ridiculed and reality TV was in its wild west era (“You guys were demanding it,” Banks says. “The viewers wanted more and more and more”). Banks was an easy fall guy, according to Loushy and Sivan.“Tyra was one of the only women who was a show-runner back then,” Sivan says. “The misogyny goes in both directions, not just to justify the harm that was done on the show.”He adds: “The whole concept of telling someone that she is too fat wasn’t even badmouthing back then. It was just part of the culture. And harassing people, having a man grab a woman’s ass is something that you would see on Home Alone 2, it was a joke.”There may now be a more formalised duty of care for some reality shows but is our culture, with social media now a prevalent force, really that much better now?View image in fullscreenAmerica’s Next Top ModelPhotograph: Evan Giordanella/Cw Network/Kobal/Shutterstock“The show did present and showcase so many different images of beauty,” Sivan says. “And now, even when you look at Instagram and it’s supposed to be all so democratised, everybody’s extremely skinny, fit, going to the gym, getting plastic surgery. Our own daughter is obsessed with make-up and she’s 10 years old.”Banks does show more self-awareness than we’ve seen from her before when talking about the problems that arose. She even addresses the uncomfortable clip of her screaming at Tiffany. “I went too far,” she admits. “I lost it. It was probably bigger than her. It was family, friends, society, Black girls, all the challenges we have. So many people saying that we’re not good enough. I think all that was in that moment. That’s some Black girl stuff that goes real deep inside of me, but I knew I went too far.”Perhaps her most surprising admission is that we might not have seen the end of America’s Next Top Model. “You have no idea what we have planned … for cycle 25,” she says.When I ask Loushy and Sivan if they think the show might actually return, they seem sure that those involved would want to do it again. “Cycle 25 is Tyra’s dream,” Sivan says. “I think it’s also the judges’ dream. I think they all want to do another cycle.”Loushy admits that even in her research, binge-watching all 24 cycles, she still understands why it was a success. “I couldn’t stop watching,” she says. “It still works even with the lenses of today and I enjoyed every second of it.”But is it possible to resurrect and avoid the same problems? What would that show even look like in 2026?Sivan says: “Our only tip that if anybody revives this show I hope it focuses more on the personality of the contenders and not on how they look.”Reality Check: Inside America’s Next Top Model is available on Netflix on 16 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsDocumentaryReality TVFactual TVTelevisionNetflixfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Today it makes a picture-perfect alternative to the Italian lakesAnnabel AbbsSun 15 Feb 2026 02.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleThe ancient settlement of Chiavenna, in Lombardy, near Italy’s border with Switzerland, was once well known among travellers. “Lovely Chiavenna … mountain peaks, huge boulders, with rippling miniature torrents and lovely young flowers … and grassy heights with rich Spanish chestnuts,”wrote George Eliotin 1860.Eliot wasn’t the only writer to rhapsodise about this charming town. Edith Wharton described it as “fantastically picturesque … an exuberance of rococo”. For Mary Shelley it was “paradise … glowing in rich and sunny vegetation”, while Goethe described it as “like a dream”.View image in fullscreenFor those pioneering travellers, gentle, sunlit Chiavenna marked their arrival in Italy, having crossed the Splügen Pass, one of the earliest transalpine routes connecting northern Europe to the south. Today, few tourists bother with Chiavenna, heading instead to the better-known Como that lies 60 miles (100km) to the south. They are missing a treat.Intrigued by the praise once heaped upon this mysterious town, with a picture-perfect location at the foot of the snow-flecked Alps, I decided to spend a week here with my husband. Surrounded by thick chestnut woods and bisected by the crystal-clear River Mera, Valchiavenna (the town’s valley) holds numerous surprises too, from the area’scrotti(natural caves), to a B&B in the ornate villa once inhabited by the great 18th-century painterAngelica Kauffman. It also has dozens of magnificent hiking and cycling trails through a spectacular landscape of waterfalls, glacially sculpted rocks, mossy woodlands, ancient mule tracks and abandoned villages. With barely a tourist in sight.The network of cobbled alleys containing ornate frescoed buildings and elaborate fountains is testament to its past as a wealthy trading townI travelled from Zurich, taking a train to St Moritz, then a bus over the spectacular Maloja Pass, down 20 vertiginous hairpin bends (known astornanti) carved from the rock face of the Alps, with sweeping views – lakes, peaks, forests – in all directions. This €20 one-hour bus ride also stops off at the Swiss village of Stampa (birthplace of the artist Alberto Giacometti and home of theMuseo Ciäsa Granda, which is dedicated to him), as well as Sils Maria village, home of theNietzsche-Haus, where Nietzsche spent seven formative summers in the late 19th century, and now a museum. Meanwhile, my husband travelled to Chiavenna by train from Milan, a journey that skirted the scenic shores of numerous lakes, including Lake Como.View image in fullscreenThe remote Rifugio Uschione.Photograph: Paolo ValentiniOur first day was spent hiking 6 miles upriver along the beautiful Via Bregaglia, a 24-mile hiking trail running from Soglio in Switzerland to Chiavenna, to reach one of the region’s best-known restaurants, the family-run, Michelin-starredLanterna Verde. After feasting on trout caught minutes before from their own lake, we took the bus back to explore Chiavenna’s old centre, which dates from the 15th century (the medieval town was destroyed by fire). Described by an Italian friend as “like Verona but without the amphitheatre, crowds and chain stores”, the network of cobbled alleys containing ornate frescoed buildings and elaborate fountains is testament to its past as a wealthy trading town.At Rifugio Uschione, a rustic yet stylish priest’s house, we spent an utterly silent night of perfect sleepChiavenna is home to dozens ofcrotti, natural cellars embedded in the rocky flanks of the surrounding mountains. Before the advent of refrigeration, thecrottiwere used for storing wine, cheese and cured meats, and often as places to socialise. Today several operate as restaurants and bars: atCrotto UbialiandCrotto Ombra, we tucked into two of the town’s signature dishes:sciatt– melt-in-the-mouth buckwheat fritters stuffed with cheese – andgnocchi alla chiavennasca– bread-based dumplings served with melted butter and crispy fried sage. AtCrotto Belvedere, we sipped local wine – try Opera, a delicious white from nearby vineyards, that arrives in a bottle labelled with the work of a local artist.On our second day we explored the Parco delle Marmitte dei Giganti (“giants’ cauldrons”), which slopes up from the town’s eastern edge–a mass of mineral-rich green stone (pietre verdi) natural craters, caused by glacial erosion over thousands of years. From here, hiking trails fan out, tantalisingly, in all directions. We took the 50-minute path to Uschione, an empty, roadless village of stone houses, a church and cemetery, perched high above the valley and wreathed in soft wisps of cloud. Four hundred people once lived here, but today the only inhabitants are long‑eared sheep and Mendi who runs theRifugio Uschione(doubles from €160), a rustic yet stylish priest’s house where we spent an utterly silent night of perfect sleep. The next morning we took a mossy path upwards to explore abandoned forestcrotti, before turning northwards to bask in panoramic views across the valley and up towards the soaring Rhaetian Alps.View image in fullscreenPalazzo Vertemate Franchi in Piuro is the only building that survived a landslide in 1618.Photograph: AGF/AlamyBack in Chiavenna, we headed to thePalazzo Salis B&B, once home to Angelica Kauffman. Here, a lavish frescoed room, complete with antique furniture, painted ceiling, chequered marble floor and breakfast on the terrace costs from €130. After stopping for cups of cappuccino andcioccolata calda(melted dark chocolate with a splash of thick cream) in Sierra Nevada, the town’s cutest roastery, we walked a mile north to Piuro for a tour of the most eye‑popping renaissance villa:Palazzo Vertemate Franchi. The sole surviving building from a 1618 landslide that destroyed the entire village and killed more than 1,000 inhabitants, the palazzo (advance booking and guided tours only) boasts exquisite marquetry, fantastical frescoes and elaborately carved panelling.Palazzo Vertemate Franchi is the most eye‑popping renaissance villa, boasting exquisite marquetry, fantastical frescoes and elaborately carved panellingGiddy from all these unexpected delights, we strolled a further mile to the dramatic Acquafraggia waterfalls. This double waterfall tumbles 1,300 metres in a series of cascades, and was described by Leonardo da Vinci as “making a beautiful sound and a marvellous spectacle”. With our cheeks gently misted, we climbed the ancient mule path (2,867 stone steps) up to the abandoned village of Savogno, where old stone houses cling precipitously to the mountainside.A day later, we drove up the 51 tightly twisting, hairpin bends to explore the Splügen Pass. This 40-minute journey climbs 1,780 metres and propelled us into an utterly different, much chillier landscape. We spent a contented night at the legendary coaching innAlbergo della Posta, (doubles from €130) in the tiny hamlet of Montespluga. Little has changed here in 75 years – the 10 bedrooms are cosily panelled in pine, and retain their original furnace stoves.View image in fullscreenLeonardo da Vinci was among admirers of the Acquafraggia waterfall.Photograph: Aerial Vision/AlamyWith Shelley’s words about the pass in our heads – “naked and sublime … dim mists, chilling blasts and driving snow” – we walked a three-hour circular path to the Lago di Andossi, revelling in the landscape’s bleak austerity, with its eerily turquoise lakes, luminously green lichen and treeless, craggy peaks. This route also forms the beginning of the 20-mileValchiavenna cycle path, which took third place in the Italian Green Way Cycle Road awards of 2022. Bike hire is available fromAdam’s Bike Tours, and we vowed to return one day to cycle the route.And then it was back to Chiavenna to investigate the Saturday market, sample its three gelaterias, explore the toweringParco Paradiso(a terraced botanical garden built on the site of the original castle), and to amble around the cloistered church of San Lorenzo, with its gloriously carved 12th-century font. We finished at Chiavenna’s high-security Museo del Tesoro or “treasure museum”, home to the extraordinaryLa Pace– a jaw-dropping, 11th-century bible cover with the finest goldsmithing and enamelling imaginable, encrusted with emeralds, rubies and pearls. It is yet another reminder of the important role Chiavenna once played in Europe’s history.We ended our trip by pigging out on the locally inspired tasting menu – it was our wedding anniversary – at the family-runVilla Giade(which also has sleekly modern, reasonably priced bedrooms with the best views in town). Over glasses of wine from the local Nebbiolo grape, we pondered Chiavenna’s many hidden charms, before agreeing that this could be the most quietly romantic town we had ever visited.For more information, visitvalchiavenna.comExplore more on these topicsItaly holidaysEurope holidaysMilan holidaysWalking holidaysWalkingfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Thankfully, our resident perfectionist is here to help you master your massamanFelicity CloakeSun 15 Feb 2026 08.00 ESTSharePrefer the Guardian on GoogleBickering pleasantly over the menu in a Thai restaurant with my family recently, I realised I was unable to explain exactly what a gaeng massaman was, beyond the fact it was probably a safe bet for those concerned about the three chillies next to the green curry (a dish I first tackled for this column back in 2010). The gap in my repertoire was explained later when I openedDavid Thompson’s pink bible ofThai Foodand learned that “a mussaman curry is the most complex, time-consuming Thai curry to make”. The fact the esteemed Australian chef also describes it as “the most delicious” is scant comfort given I’ve just promised my editor I’ll make at least six of the things … but then I remember how incredibly tasty it is, and knuckle down to my research.View image in fullscreen‘The most complex, time-consuming Thai curry’: David Thompson’s massaman. All inset photographs by Felicity Cloake.Though the first recipe dates from 1899, massaman, whose name suggests an association with the country’s Muslim minority, probably dates back to the 17th century, and reflects either Persian or Malaysian influence, or perhaps that of the Indian and Middle Eastern spice traders who travelled through southern Thailand on their way to China. It’s unusual in its use of dried spices like cumin and cinnamon, bay leaves and cloves alongside more classic Thai aromatics like lemongrass and galangal to create a richly savoury gravy that cloaks the protein and potatoes like a warm hug direct from Bangkok. Straightforward enough if you have a Thai specialist nearby, it’s still more of a weekend project than a weeknight dinner, but a very worthwhile one nonetheless.The curry pasteThe time-consuming part here is the paste, which, thanks to the additional dry spices, has alonger ingredient list than, say, a red or green curry version. The basic idea is the same, however, so once you’ve assembled everything you need, there’s not much more to it. That said, “as massaman curry paste is basically red curry paste PLUS some spices”, toquote Pailin Chongchitnant, the chef and author behind Hot Thai Kitchen, you can save yourself some time by using a ready-made red curry paste, asMeera Sodha suggests in her vegan weeknight version. (According to Chongchitnant, most commercial massaman curry pastes skimp on the pricier spices, which is why she doesn’t recommend them.)As long as you have a stick blender or a spice grinder, it’s easy enough to make your own (and, I’d argue, considerably more satisfying, unless, like me, you’re making several different versions at once). The basic ingredients will be familiar from other curry pastes: shallots, lemongrass, garlic, galangal, chillies, pepper, coriander root and shrimp paste. To briefly run through the less widely available ones, Thai shallots, or red onions, are smaller and more pungent than the varieties used in European cooking, but if you can’t find them, look for round, rather than banana shallots. Galangal is a pale, stubby rhizome with a peppery, slightly resinous flavour, which will probably be found in the fridge in south-east Asian specialists. Ginger is often mentioned as a substitute, but though there’s no harm in adding it instead, they don’t taste much alike to me – you’re better off rehydrating dried galangal if that’s all you can get.The chillies in question are the long red dried variety that you’ll find easily in any supermarket international aisle or Asian specialist (do not substitute chilli flakes; I can’t be held responsible for the consequences). Having done a tour of London in search of coriander root, I can tell UK readers that unless you get very lucky with a delivery (Khun Ya in Bermondsey tell me they tend to receive theirs, and sell out, on a Monday morning), you’ll need to buy it online or use the stems instead; as Kay Plunkett-Hogge explains in her book Baan, “it’s not quite the same, but it will do.” I do manage to locate the makrut lime called for in Leela Punyaratabandhu’s family recipe, which is quite the thrill – it doesn’t seem to be a common addition, but if you come across one, a few strips of rind lend a very pleasing zestiness to her dish.View image in fullscreenJohn Chantarasak’s massaman calls for a paste featuring the addition of cumin and coriander seeds, cloves, peppercorns and mace.To this basic mixture, the recipes I try, fromPlunkett-Hogge,Anglothai chef and author John Chantarasak,Punyaratabandhu’s book Bangkok, Sodha and Thompson, all add cumin. Like Hogge, Sodha also uses cinnamon (Thompson goes for cassia), and that’s it for her simple recipe. Everyone else includes coriander seeds and cloves; peppercorns (Plunkett-Hogge, Punyaratabandhu and Chantarasak); nutmeg (Plunkett-Hogge and Thompson ); mace (Thompson and Chantarasak); and cardamom (Plunkett-Hogge, Thompson and Punyaratabandhu).White cardamomis mentioned by some, which is a new one on me, and proves wellnigh impossible to track down – “very rare”, says my local Thai shopkeeper, presumably referring to their stocking policy, as I eventually manage to buy a large bag online. When they arrive, they look more like dried chickpeas than cardamom pods, and have a mildly peppery, slightly lemony flavour. As almost all of the recipes concerned suggest substituting green cardamom, this would be my advice, though if anyone would like an almost-full bag of the white sort, I’m not convinced I’m going to get through it in this lifetime.Massaman should be warmly spiced, rather than piquant, with a peppery heat that’s balanced by the mellow sweetness of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves (I haven’t included mace, because it’s slightly harder to get hold of and no one could pick it out in the finished dishes, but feel free to add a couple of blades). Everyone but Sodha toasts the spices before use, and everyone except Punyaratabandhu browns the fresh aromatics, too. Though clearly not mandatory, this step does seem to give the finished dishes a richer, deeper sweetness. To this end, I’m also, like Thompson, going to include ground peanuts, though you can leave this out if catering for allergies, or indeed use Sodha’s peanut butter to make life even easierA note: if grinding the paste by hand, then soak the chillies first, but unless you have both strength and patience, I’d strongly urge you to use a spice (/coffee) grinder for the spice mix if you have one, and an immersion blender to make the paste – if you only have a mini chopper, which requires liquid to work, then add a little of the coconut cream to grease the wheels. The paste can be made well ahead of time and refrigerated.The curry sauceOnce you have the paste under your belt, you’ve done the hard work. Most recipes then fry it* to use as a base for the curry’s gravy, but Chantarasak adds the fried paste to the pot much later in the process, an order that makes more sense when I read David Thompson’s warning that too much coconut milk “will dilute the intense flavours of the curry” … which is indeed what happens when I add his own paste to the litre of coconut milk called for by the recipe in his book. The results are still absolutely delicious, yet regrettably less pungent and aromatic than promised by the smell of the fried paste. When I watch himpreparing the same dish on YouTube, however, I discover he follows much the same method as Chantarasak, adding a little of the meat-poaching liquid to the paste, rather than watering down the paste with a whole pan of poaching liquid, which I think is the key to achieving a really full-flavoured result.View image in fullscreenLeela Punyaratabandhu’s massaman calls for the addition of Seville orange juice and peel.Once you’re happy with the consistency of the gravy, it’s time to adjust the flavour with that triumvirate of classic Thai seasonings: palm sugar, fish sauce and tamarind water, though pineapple juice is sometimes used instead of, or alongside the last, most notably by Thompson. My judges say this reminds them slightly of a pina colada, “but not in a bad way”. Nevertheless, I’ve left it out – but perhaps start with a dash, rather than a full cup if you’d like it. Alternatively, you might prefer the orange juice and peel (ideally a bitter Seville orange) in Punyaratabandhu’s version, which has noble precedent, as it pops up in the first recorded recipe by 19th-century chef and author Lady Plean Passakornrawong. Again add it at the end, so as not to spoil its freshness of flavour.*The paste is either fried in oil, or, as in Thompson’s recipe, in cracked coconut cream – cream that has been fried until the oil breaks free. Much room is taken up online by people bemoaning the stabilisers in much tinned coconut milk and cream, which prevent it separating – organic brands tend to be emulsifier free, but you could use coconut, or vegetable oil instead.The curried itemsView image in fullscreenKay Plunkett-Hogge suggests swapping chicken for goat.I would say meat, but Sodha’s recipe using extra-firm tofu is proof that you really don’t need it here – indeed, one of my testers complains that the slow-braised short ribs in Chantarasak’s recipe are distracting him from the deliciousness of the sauce. Tofu, a culinary blank canvas, is unlikely to have this problem. Massaman is generally made, however, with beef or chicken – as it’s a dish with Muslim origins, it’s never made with pork. Plunkett-Hogge suggests swapping in goat, for which I use diced mutton shoulder, which garners strong support from my testers; though I’ve stuck with chicken, the sweetness of the sheep meat works well with the spicing.Massaman is also unusual in that it tends to include large chunks of meat on the bone rather than bite-size pieces; Thompson hacks up chicken legs, but it’s probably easier, especially if buying pre-packed meat, to go with the bone-in thighs Punyaratabandhu recommends, piled high in a smallish pot, so they stay nice and juicy. Thompson deep fries the meat and vegetables – which “seals and firms the chicken and vegetables, as well as enriching the curry” – while Punyaratabandhu shallow fries hers, skin-side down. In a home context, I think just browning the meat before braising is sufficient. Like Chantarasak, I’m adding cinnamon and bay leaves to the coconut milk poaching liquid to perfume it – if you’re making a beef version, you might also like to include his star anise.Also unusual in a Thai context are the potatoes, though chef Bongkoch “Bee” Satongun of the Michelin-starred Paste Bangkoktold National Geographic Traveller magazinethat her mother favoured chunks of pineapple, and Chantarasak mentions daikon and sweet potato as potential alternatives. Don’t skip the whole shallots, though – as with Plunkett-Hogge’s raisins and Chantarasak’s golden sultanas, their sweetness echoes that of the curry, while roasted peanuts give the dish a finishing crunch.View image in fullscreenMeera Sodha finishes her massaman with sauteed chard and fresh red chilli.To finish, Sodha tops her curry with sauteed chard and fresh red chilli, which looks attractive, and Chantarasak a drizzle of coconut cream, which is a nice idea if you happen to have some leftove but isn’t worth cracking open a fresh tin for, plus a few caramelised shallots – again, if you have a pot open, by all means sprinkle them over the top, but I think it looks perfectly delicious without any garnish whatsoever.This can be made up until the addition of the potatoes, then reheated as required; indeed, Punyaratabandhu recommends making it a day ahead. Serve with steamed Thai rice and something fresh – Plunkett-Hogge’s snappy, zippypounded cucumber saladproves a popular pairing with my guests.Perfect massamanServes4-6Prep30 minCook50 minFor the paste (or use 6 tbsp red curry paste and the * ingredients)1½ tsp cumin seeds*2 tsp coriander seeds*2 cloves*4 cardamom pods*½ nutmeg, grated*1 cinnamon stick, roughly broken¼tsp white or black peppercorns6 long dried chillies, seeded and roughly crushed (soaked in water for 20 minutes if using a pestle and mortar)4 Thai shallots or 2 round shallots, peeled and chopped5 plump garlic cloves, peeled and chopped2 lemongrass stems, trimmed and purplish section only chopped (save the trimmings)2 tbsp finely chopped galangal2 tbsp finely chopped coriander root or stems1 tsp Thai shrimp paste(kapi)25g unsalted roasted peanuts*, roughly choppedFor the curry8 Thai shallots or 4 round ones, peeled and halved or quarteredNeutral oil, to fry6 chicken thighs, bone inSalt1 cinnamon stick3 cardamom pods, lightly crushed3 bay leaves800ml coconut milk4 smallish waxy potatoes, peeled and cut into halves or quartersSalt180ml coconut cream(brands without emulsifiers work best)Palm sugar, to tasteFish sauce, to tasteTamarind water or puree, to taste30g roasted peanutsView image in fullscreenTo make the paste, toast the dry spices in a hot wok or frying pan for a couple of minutes until aromatic, then allow to cool slightly before grinding to a powder.

Add the coriander root or stems and then use an immersion blender or wet spice grinder to puree (if you only have a food processor, add a little coconut cream or oil to help). Blend in the peanuts and whiz until smooth, then add the shrimp paste and ground spices and whiz again. Set aside, in the fridge if making in advance.View image in fullscreenCoat the bottom of a large frying pan generously with neutral oil and put on to a high heat. Fry the shallots until beginning to turn golden, then set aside. Season the chicken with salt, then fry in batches until golden brown but not cooked through.View image in fullscreenPut the chicken in a saucepan or casserole dish just large enough to hold it comfortably in several layers and tuck the shallots, cinnamon stick, cardamom and the ends and husks of the lemongrass in among it. Scooping out any cream at the top, pour over just enough coconut milk to almost but not quite cover it. Bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat, cover and simmer for 30-40 minutes until cooked through.Meanwhile, cook the potatoes in boiling, lightly salted water until just tender then set aside.View image in fullscreenOnce the chicken is almost cooked, put the coconut cream, plus any extra from the milk, in a frying pan over a fairly high heat. Fry until the fat begins to seep out of the sides, then add the curry paste. Cook until it sizzles and begins to darken.View image in fullscreenStir in just enough of the coconut milk from the chicken to make a medium thick gravy and then add sugar, fish sauce and tamarind to taste, starting with a tablespoon of each. Add the cooked potatoes, chicken and peanuts (you can make it ahead up to this point) before cooking for another 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving with rice.Massaman curry: is it indeed the most complex of the Thai curries, and what’s your verdict on my version? Do you prefer it thick and rich, or lighter and zestier, with meat or vegetables?

It was an utter delight, but then, Korean sweet bean paste, which is made with adzuki beans, is so very satisfying: pleasantly claggy, almost nutty, and a little decadent, while at the same time still convincing you that it might count as one of your five a day, were it not stuffed inside a hot fresh doughnut with a whopping great dollop of whipped cream. It was a cold winter’s day – the sort where, by lunchtime, my own umbrella had blown inside-out twice and everyone else’s seemed determined to poke my eye out. Against that backdrop, this doughnut was a moment of pure bliss.Koba, a Korean restaurant byLinda Lee, has been providing moments of such joy for 20 solid years, not least with its traditional tabletop barbecue hot plates on which guests could grill their own dinner. Or, in many cases, have their dinner grilled for them by a kindly server, because nothing says: “Lord God, what time does my shift finish?” more than the face of a tired Korean server watching a gang of tipsy non-Koreans trying to work a tabletop hot plate. After you’ve dropped that first plate of onions into your handbag, you’re often more than grateful for the help. To celebrate reaching 20 years, however, and after an elegant revamp, Lee has now ditched those hotplates altogether. Koba 2.0 has also slung out the black tables, the dangling extraction vents and much of the dark wood, and replaced it with awabi sabicolour palette that’s pale, dreamy and, in places, even twinkly.View image in fullscreen‘Insta-friendly’: Koba’smul hweistarter features mixed raw fish, prawn, trout’s roe and an icy gochujang vinaigrette.Small, elegant snacks and starters include the likes of deep-fried cuttlefish, neatjeonshrimp, vegetable and fermented sauce pancakes and a really very lovelyyook hweiraw beef with pear, seaweed and egg yolk. These starters come with a generous serving ofbanchan,featuring different types of kimchi, beansprouts and spicy cucumbers. Perhaps the old crowd will miss the grill-your-own element, but, especially with something like Koba’sdak galbibarbecue chicken, I feel it’s much better to let an expert take the strain, not least so you don’t mess up the chicken in its heady marinade of gochujang paste, chilli and garlic served with mixed leaves, pickles and sauces. It’s pretty great, too.Rest assured, also, that the beefbulgogiwith mushrooms is still on the menu and, should you really wish, you can even grill it yourself on one of the few remaining tabletop grills in the downstairs private dining room.View image in fullscreen‘Gorgeously staged’: Koba’sdubu sotbabof tofu, wilted greens, nori, mushrooms, green beans and rice.Other parts of Koba’s new menu, however, lean towards delicate, modern fine dining. Themul hwei, for instance, is a pretty bowl of prawn, raw salmon and white fish topped with a generous scoop of vivid orange trout roe and dressed in an iced gochujang vinaigrette. It’s a dish wherethe Koba reboot goes Insta-friendly, as does thedubu sotbabtofu and vegetable rice pot, which doesn’t sound like much on paper, but which turns up gorgeously staged with piles of wilted greens, sliced nori, green beans and mushrooms on top of rice, all waiting to be mixed in.That’s a nice touch, and one of many in this new incarnation of a handy little dining spot that has weathered so much change to this area over its two decades. It’s peculiar to think how many great, seemingly invincible restaurants have thrived but then vanished around Charlotte Street, Rathbone Street and down towards Goodge Street.Elena’s Etoileis long gone, and not even the OG Spaghetti Housecould survive the current climatein this little patch off theatreland, but Koba is somehow still kicking it. Will the decision to whip out those hot plates finally finish the place off? I don’t think so. Thego galbigrilled mackerel is just as great as ever, and in fact it’s all the better for not having to endure my amateur antics.View image in fullscreen‘An utter delight’: Koba’s Korean bean paste doughnut.But let’s go back to those desserts. Korean restaurants and the words “let’s linger over pudding” aren’t traditional friends, but at Koba I think it’s worth making time not just for that doughnut, but also for the vast scoop of fresh vanilla ice-cream that’s served with slices of sweet, fresh persimmon and a drenching of spiced, sticky syrup. Absolute joy.Ripping up your own rulebook after 20-odd years is something only the bravest souls would ever dare to do, but I admire Koba’s chutzpah. More power to its elbow.
