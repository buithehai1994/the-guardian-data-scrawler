Her mother knelt against the double bed and gave birth without assistance or complication. The baby spent the first days of her life in the small stone-terraced cottage and then began her travels, mostly carried by her mother in a sling, hidden under a burgundy puffer jacket. She travelled far for a newborn, passing through bus stations and port towns, hotels and cafes, cities and fields, from north to south, west to east. We know she lived for at least two weeks, but we don’t know, and can never know, precisely how she died. She was called Victoria.On 3 March 2025, the first day of the pre-trial hearing in the case of Marten and Gordon, neither defendant turned up to court. Among the huddle of journalists outside court six of the Old Bailey, the central criminal court in England and Wales, no one seemed surprised. Last year, the couple had been tried on five counts in relation to the death of Victoria while they were camping on the South Downs in January 2023. During the original trial, Gordon and Marten’s absences had been frequent. When they were both present, they’d embrace, still demonstrably a couple despite being held in different prisons – Marten in Bronzefield, Gordon in Belmarsh.Eventually, in late June 2024, after a trial that was supposed to last three months ended up taking six, they were found guilty of three charges: child cruelty, perverting the course of justice and concealing the birth of a child. The jury had been unable to reach a verdict on the two most serious charges of gross negligence manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child, and so a retrial of those charges had been ordered.Mark Lucraft KC, the most senior judge at the Old Bailey, would once again preside. Lucraft, whose official, 13th-century title is the recorder of London, is widely revered, not least because he is also the editor of Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice, the definitive criminal law reference book. As he entered the court this spring, stately in his wig and flowing black and red robe, we rose to our feet. “Constance Marten has refused to attend,” he said gravely. “She says she’s unwell, but has been declared fit.” Lucraft declared that he would continue with the trial whether the defendants were present or not. “Those who are genuinely ill, I have great sympathy for,” he said in a stern, cool voice we would grow to know well. “Those who do not feel like coming, I have very little sympathy for.”And so the retrial of Gordon, 51, and Marten, 38, began as it meant to go on. Over the next four and a half months, two stories would unfold simultaneously in court six. One was the story of Gordon and Marten, their complex history and their crimes, and the other was of a battle for control between a married couple and a judge.Marten and Gordon first came to public attention in January 2023. On the evening of 5 January, police found their burnt-out car on the side of the M61 motorway, near Bolton. Strewn nearby were bags of baby clothes, Marten’s passport and a bag of 38 mobile phones. When the police found a placenta wrapped in a towel on the back seat of the car, they launched a national search for the couple, concerned for the welfare of the baby.Quickly, the press began running stories: Marten is the daughter of Napier Marten, a former page to the queen. She had grown up at Crichel House, a vast stately home in Dorset, rebuilt after fire in the 18th century. Gordon, meanwhile, had spent 20 years in American prisons, having been charged with rape and battery at the age of 14. As the weeks passed and they weren’t found, the nation became obsessed with this couple on the run. The acceptable face of this obsession was concern for the baby. Less openly stated, but quite obvious, was the fascination with this marriage of seeming contrast: an aristocratic white woman and a Black man with a violent criminal record.View image in fullscreenCrichel House in Dorset.Photograph: Christopher Michael Kemp/AlamyOn the second day of the pre-trial hearing, Marten entered the dock for the first time. Tall and striking, with dark tumbling hair and a wide, pale face, she brought with her a frisson of criminal celebrity. A female defendant is rare enough at the Old Bailey, but a woman born into privilege, a boarding-school girl known to her friends as “Toots”, who also happens to be the beneficiary of a large trust fund left by her grandmother is exceptional. Everyone in the packed courtroom wanted to understand the same thing, which was how a woman apparently born with everything ends up in prison with nothing, charged with the manslaughter of her child.The court usher asked Marten if she’d like paper and a pen. Marten said thank you, a polite smile sweetening her expression, her eyes warm. “Ms Marten would wish to apologise to the court for her non-attendance yesterday,” said her barrister, Francis Fitzgibbon KC. “She said the prospect of having to go through this again became overwhelming. She couldn’t face it. She’s here now and she will be here for the trial.” In the dock, Marten looked tired and sullen. Her expression could transform quickly, moods rearranging her face in an instant.The barristers spent the day debating the agreed facts of the case. Leading up to the death of Victoria was a long, dark history, much of which Lucraft wanted to keep out of the trial. Gordon’s previous convictions from Florida were deemed so potentially prejudicial to his case that Lucraft had issued a reporting restriction preventing any mention of them. The couple’s prolonged dealings with the family courts were also problematic. Gordon and Marten had four previous children, born between 2017 and 2022. The first two children had initially lived with the couple, but were placed in care after intervention from social services. The subsequent two children were removed at birth, and a family court order in January 2022 permanently removed all four children from their parents. Fitzgibbon argued the inclusion of these facts reflected badly on his client. It was easy to see why. There is no way of learning that a couple has had four children taken away without imagining the worst possible reasons.Lucraft declared that the trial should not be a rehashing of the family court litigation but the family court order couldn’t be completely excluded, as it was relevant. (The reasons cited for the children’s removal in the 2022 order were the threat of them being exposed to violence after a reported domestic violence incident inflicted by Gordon on Marten in 2019, and the couple’s refusal to engage with health and social services for their children.) The family court history also explained why the couple had gone on the run. In police interviews and evidence, Marten said they had begun travelling around England while she was pregnant to avoid the oversight of any single local authority. If social services knew of her pregnancy, she said, the baby would be automatically taken from her at birth.In the dock, Marten had the charismatic presence of someone used to claiming an audience’s attention. Her volatility was addictive to watch, as if you had to keep checking to see what mood she might be in now. Looking at her, it was difficult to compute her experience. Marten had given birth to five children within the past eight years. Four of these had been put up for adoption. One had died in her arms. Whatever her culpability, I wasn’t sure how she was able to sit, or talk, or function at all.Tom Little KC, the most senior criminal prosecutor in the country, is a bear-like man, wide and tall, who wears a pair of thick black-framed glasses and heavy shoes. During the trial, he appeared so settled in his confidence that I never heard him sigh or redden with stress, the way other barristers did. At most, he paced with a kind of upbeat, competitive impatience, like a horse before a race.On 10 March, the first day of the trial, Little ran through his prosecution opening statement as if he were saying things so obvious that they hardly needed expressing. To tell the story of Gordon and Marten’s frantic travels after their car burst into flames on the M61, he played CCTV footage tracking them round the country from Bolton in Greater Manchester to Harwich in Essex to east London to the south coast, near Newhaven, where they pitched their tent. Look at this couple, said Little: damp, tired, constantly on the move, with nothing like what they needed for themselves let alone their newborn daughter. “Is that any way to look after a baby at that stage?”Little made sure the jury were aware of Marten’s background. She had access to plentiful funds through her family trust, and was regularly receiving these funds into her bank accounts and making substantial withdrawals. She had the means to rent a property and provide for her child. You might feel sympathy, but her version of events could not be trusted, he warned. The jury would need “cool logic and common sense”.View image in fullscreenMark Gordon leaving Crawley police station to attend magistrates court in March 2023.Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PALittle knew what he was up against. The defendants were being blamed for causing the death of a child they loved. Little needed to show that the two things were not mutually exclusive, that you can love and harm simultaneously. This was, he concluded, a “paradigm” case of gross negligence manslaughter, with two possible causes of death: either hypothermia or suffocation caused by dangerous co-sleeping in the tent.Little was followed by Gordon’s barrister, John Femi-Ola, who argued there was no evidence Victoria had died of hypothermia. The cause of death, according to two pathologists, was unascertained. Her body was so badly decomposed by the time it was discovered, in a Brighton allotment shed on 1 March 2023, that it was impossible to draw any certain conclusions. There was no evidence, either, of any harm or injury to her body, or that the defendants were consuming drink or drugs. The baby, Femi-Ola argued, was at all times kept warm, fed and close to her mother.Finally, it was Fitzgibbon’s turn. Gordon and Marten decided to camp with Victoria to escape the press attention after the police had launched their manhunt, he said. They had never intended to stay there long. Victoria’s death was a tragic accident. Marten, exhausted, had fallen asleep over her baby after breastfeeding and compromised her breathing – something that could happen to any sleep-deprived mother of a newborn.The jury now had two competing narratives to consider as they heard the evidence over the coming weeks. In the prosecution’s account, Marten and Gordon were deceitful, negligent individuals who knew the risks they were taking and had caused their child’s death. The defence painted the couple as parents in difficult circumstances whose daughter’s accidental death had rendered them grief-stricken. In reaching a verdict, the jury would not establish the truth, but simply declare victory for one story over another.The prosecution’s first witness was a social worker from Wales, who had been called to show that Marten had been warned five years before Victoria’s death about the dangers of camping with a newborn. The social worker explained that she’d met Marten in a hospital in Wales in 2017, when Marten was heavily pregnant with her first baby. Marten had put on an Irish accent, called herself Isabella and said she was from a Traveller community and needed help finding accommodation. The social worker had then accompanied Marten to a small tent where she and Gordon were living. Seeing it bowing with rainwater, she had told Marten how inappropriate the setting would be for a mother and a baby.Throughout the witness’s evidence, Marten fumed in the dock, either muttering in protest or staring at her with a cool half-smile, shaking her head in disbelief. Over the next three weeks, she responded in the same way to all the prosecution’s evidence. Between witnesses, Marten would slump back in her seat, drop her head to her chest, or yawn and sigh so loudly that heads would turn in the courtroom, a place of such codified manners that when Femi-Ola’s phone once went off mid-proceedings, the offence rippled through the room. To yawn was like a breach of the law itself.View image in fullscreenA court artist sketch of Constance Marten at the Old Bailey.Photograph: Elizabeth Cook/PAOn 12 March, the third day of the trial, Marten addressed the judge directly, another flouting of the code. She was exhausted, she said, and felt that this would damage her chance of having a fair hearing. “You’re a convicted prisoner,” Lucraft replied, as if to remind her that this might not be the strongest position from which to argue. Marten explained: her days were often 19 hours long because the Serco van arrived so early at HMP Bronzefield and took hours delivering female prisoners to the various London courts. (Marten had also made this point in an article in the View, a magazine about women in the criminal justice system. She would, she concluded, probably have to sue Serco.)The issue arose again a week later. “We’re leaving Bronzefield at peak rush hour,” said Marten, her voice loud and indignant. “And we’re sitting there waiting from 5am.” Marten sounded like a holidaymaker complaining to a concierge about the hotel’s service. Lucraft suggested that he could neither control the traffic or highlight her plight over the other 86,000 people in prison.The exchange was minor, but it hinted at Marten’s sense of exceptionalism. No part of her appeared cowed by being in prison, already convicted of three offences. Nor was she awed by the setting of the court or the authority of the judge. The moment revealed how she saw herself: not chastened by her situation, or likely to quietly surrender to the criminal justice system’s demands and inefficiencies, but as someone who believed she could bend it to her will.According to Marten and Gordon, they arrived in Newhaven on 8 January 2023 and walked until they found a wild area where they pitched their tent in the nook of a fallen tree. Victoria died the following day, they said. Afterwards, they spent weeks in hiding in a state of panic, not knowing what to do. To avoid detection, they stopped taking out cash or going to the shops. Grainy CCTV footage taken on 20 February shows them scavenging in bins outside Hollingbury golf course in Brighton and Hove. And then, on 27 February, Marten can be seen taking cash out of an ATM on the outskirts of the city. They must have known this would be the end.Marten and Gordon were arrested later that evening. Footage taken from police officers’ body-worn cameras shows the police taking hold of Gordon, who drops to the ground and repeatedly asks for food. Marten shouts at them to stop, that he isn’t well. The officers arrest them on suspicion of child neglect and concealing the birth of a child. Marten counters this isn’t an arrestable offence. Then the police start asking where their baby is, to which neither respond. As Marten is led away to a police car, she calls out to Gordon, “Daddy bear! Daddy bear!” “Love you, baby,” he shouts back.Neither Marten nor Gordon answered any questions about the whereabouts of their baby until two days later, when Victoria’s body was found by police in a Lidl bag in an allotment shed. Marten then gave three long interviews, one of which was shown to the jury. In a grey prison tracksuit, her legs crossed and face drawn and pale, Marten spoke with a quiet, unguarded frankness. For years, she said, she and Gordon had been trying to escape her family, who had employed private investigators to track them. She believed they had bugged their phones and meddled with their cars, including the one that burst into flames on the M61. (Later in the trial, it was confirmed that two private investigation firms had been employed by her parents to trace the couple. Both said they had not interfered with either their phones or vehicles.)View image in fullscreenConstance Marten being interviewed by police.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAIn the video, Marten explained that as her first four children had been taken away, she believed social services would have taken Victoria, too: “I wanted to keep her with me.” As she described discovering her baby’s lifeless body, Marten put her hands over her face. “I tried to resuscitate her but there was no response,” she said, her voice cracking. “I don’t know how long she’d been dead.” They’d discussed handing themselves in, she said, and Gordon had told her to say it was cot death rather than revealing that she had fallen asleep on top of the baby. “He may try to say that,” said Marten, “but that isn’t what happened.”Watching Marten in the video was disarming. In contrast to her brazen confidence in court, she seemed vulnerable, her grief palpable. As the weeks of the trial passed, she would often switch between these modes, inviting sympathy and provoking intense frustration almost simultaneously. There was, I began to realise, no reliable version of her personality.On 15 April, as the prosecution neared the end of their evidence, they hit their first major obstacle. In a printing error, an old version of a police interview with Gordon had been mistakenly placed before the jury in which reference had been made to his “history”. In the jury’s absence, Nina Crinian, the junior barrister representing Gordon, suggested that the reference was obviously to Gordon’s previous convictions. The jury, she argued, might have to be discharged – that is, dismissed and replaced by a new group of 12 people, therefore requiring the trial to start again. “Prejudice has crept into this trial.”Lucraft decided that the high bar for discharging a jury had not been met, but said he would keep the matter under review, and – as if blessed with a premonition of the chaos that was about to unfold in his court – emphasised that it was not in anyone’s interest for Gordon’s previous convictions to be revealed to the jury. “I suggest we say nothing about it for now,” he said. Two days later, on 17 April, the prosecution closed its case.The air in court seemed to simmer with anticipation when the trial resumed after the Easter weekend, on 22 April. It was now the turn of the defence: Gordon was not giving evidence, so we would go straight to Marten. In the first trial, Marten’s evidence had been emotionally fraught. Today, the press benches and gallery were full, the crowd curious about how she would perform this time.Entering the dock, Gordon and Marten greeted each other with a hug and a kiss. When one of the dock officers tried to intervene, Gordon started shouting: “Don’t touch me!” Marten, flaring with anger, suggested he make a complaint. The atmosphere in the room stiffened.Fitzgibbon rose. Marten was not feeling well, he said. She had a headache and toothache, and respectfully asked if she could start her evidence tomorrow and be seen by a doctor or nurse in prison. The judge agreed. “I’m sure you can understand,” Lucraft said to the jury, sounding surprisingly sympathetic. “There’s almost nothing worse than a toothache.” Marten would begin her evidence the following morning, at 10.30am.The following morning, Marten was not in the dock. The jury were sent home again. Lucraft looked tense. “It would be rather different if this were a one off, but it’s not,” he said. To refuse to turn up felt less like truancy and more an exertion of control. Absence was Marten’s singular power: without her, nothing could happen.The next day, Marten was present, but Fitzgibbon offered a pre-emptive excuse. She was in discomfort from her toothache and had still not been seen by a dentist. Lucraft resisted: they had already lost two days of court time and he was not going to delay again. She would begin her evidence today. Marten, temporarily vanquished, walked to the witness box, clutching files of papers in her arms.In a white shirt, her hair half-clipped back, Marten looked tired and subdued. Fitzgibbon rolled back to the beginning: to Marten’s childhood, growing up the eldest of four children of Napier Marten and Virginie de Selliers. (Napier left his family and moved to Australia when Marten was nine years old, and De Selliers remarried.) Marten’s upbringing had been financially privileged, she said, but emotionally starved. She’d been sent to boarding school at the age of eight, and felt her family had never been loving. Later, she went to Leeds University, and travelled in India, Nepal and Central America. (She did not, however, mention theevangelical Christian cult in Lagosinto which she was drawn after leaving school.) Marten then worked as a nanny in Switzerland and a journalist at Al Jazeera, before briefly attending drama school. She’d already fallen out with her family by the time she met Gordon by chance in a shop in east London in 2014. The shopkeeper had asked Marten to keep an eye on Gordon while she popped out, she said, and Gordon and Marten had bonded over this example of casual racism. Within three years the couple had married informally in Peru. (In the intervening time, Marten gradually stopped communicating with friends.) When they returned to England, Marten said her family had been unwilling to meet Gordon, an attitude she put down to bigotry.Under Fitzgibbon’s guidance, Marten’s evidence unspooled calmly, punctuated by regular yawns. Once Fitzgibbon began asking about her children, however, an anger began to well in her voice. One of the reasons Marten didn’t talk to her family any more was because they had been instrumental in having her four children taken away, she said. Fitzgibbon provided her with photographs of her first two children, copied from her Facebook page. Marten bent over the images, staring at her children’s faces. They had been “stolen by the state”, she said.Little, for the prosecution, stood in objection. Marten was treading a dangerous path. If she persisted in talking about the removal of her previous children, he would want to put more detailed evidence from the family courts before the jury. Lucraft tried to warn her that this would not help her case, but Marten seemed unperturbed. “I think it needs to be re-litigated at some point,” she said, defiantly.As Fitzgibbon led her through the journey across England after Victoria’s birth, Marten’s yawns became so frequent they took on a campaigning flavour, as if to demonstrate how unfit she was to be in the witness box. By the end of the day, Marten seemed low and snappy towards Fitzgibbon, as if forgetting that he was on her side.View image in fullscreenThe allotment shed in Brighton where baby Victoria was found.Photograph: Metropolitan Police/PAThe next day, Marten didn’t turn up. It felt like a direct challenge to the judge, testing his resolve the way a child tests a parent’s boundaries. The trial had become a tussle for control: Lucraft could demand Marten’s compliance all he liked, but he couldn’t force her to attend. The linear, rule-based system on which a trial depends had met its perfect enemy in Marten, who felt no deference to that system and who seemed to operate in a kind of swirl of impulsivity, knocking logic off its tracks at every turn.When Lucraft entered, Fitzgibbon rose and the two men stared at each other in loaded silence.“Mr Fitzgibbon,” said Lucraft, eventually.“Well it’s a conundrum isn’t it,” said Fitzgibbon. “There are two possibilities. One is that this is a sham and that she simply doesn’t want to come to court. The other is that she’s telling the truth and has a debilitating toothache.” Fitzgibbon suggested the judge should lean towards the second option.Lucraft allowed his frustration to flow. He had bent over backwards for Marten already, he said. She was on trial for very serious offences. “Constance Marten is not running this trial,Iam,” he declared, his voice resonating round the room in an uncharacteristically dramatic pronouncement, as if he had to remind himself of his authority.On Monday, Marten was present, but you could tell something was brewing. Shortly into her evidence, she asked if she could have a coffee as she was so tired. The yawns returned in earnest as she argued that the CPS and police should be held responsible for what had happened. If they hadn’t launched the manhunt, she and Gordon would never have had to hide in a tent in the first place.When Marten began describing how she’d discovered her daughter’s lifeless body, she seemed flat, even disengaged. Fitzgibbon asked her if they had made any attempt to call the police afterwards. “We were in a state of panic, shock and disbelief,” said Marten, calmly, before hurling a grenade into the proceedings. “As Mr Smith told the jury last week, Mark has a violent rape conviction,” she said, in a tone so matter of fact it masked the explosive nature of the content. “My fear was that they would immediately scapegoat him, which is what they usually do.”The court froze, as if not believing what Marten had just said. No one interrupted her, no one objected. Marten, as if disappointed by the lack of reaction, repeated herself: “He’s got a conviction of violent rape.”The judge intervened; the jury was sent out. Joel Smith, Little’s junior for the prosecution, leapt to his feet and called Marten’s statements a deliberate attempt to sabotage the trial. Femi-Ola argued that the jury would now unavoidably have to be discharged. Marten suggested that she’d done nothing wrong: Smith had already revealed all this to the jury, hadn’t he? Lucraft corrected her. No details of Gordon’s previous convictions had ever been revealed, only the vague mention of his “history”.Over the next two days, the trial seemed to waver on the verge of collapse as the barristers worked through the fallout of Marten’s revelation. Femi-Ola still wanted the jury discharged but Fitzgibbon, to Marten’s audible fury, said he felt the bar hadn’t been met in her case. Fitzgibbon and Marten’s relationship had often felt strained – his methodical approach at odds with Marten’s cavalier tendencies. Now, she stared at him with blatant animosity.Lucraft considered whether the defendants could be separated, with the trial of Marten continuing and Gordon being retried the following year. Gordon, who had been almost entirely silent for the last two months, called from the dock. He couldn’t wait another year for a trial, he said in his surprisingly high, soft voice, with its light American accent. “It’s too much for me. I may withdraw the application and not worry about the prejudice.”Sure enough, the following day, Femi-Ola announced that his client wanted to continue. Marten, still apparently incensed by Fitzgibbon, sacked him. Tom Godfrey, his junior, would take over as her lead barrister. In the midst of all this, there was news from the Bronzefield dentist who had seen Marten. She really did have toothache, Lucraft told the court, but had refused treatment. At this, Marten looked triumphant.There was an atmospheric shift as Marten resumed her evidence to Godfrey, her new barrister, on 2 May. Whether she preferred Godfrey’s gentler, more emollient approach, or felt a sense of victory over the judge with regards to her tooth, she was suddenly more convincing. Godfrey took her back to the death of Victoria. Marten described what happened in detail, her voice shaking. Victoria’s body had been limp, her lips purple. Gordon had tried to do CPR, but nothing worked. Marten was crying now, her hands over her face. She held her baby for hours afterwards, she said, unwilling to let her body go.After that, she said, they stayed in the tent for three days, unable to move from shock. Then followed the weeks of panic, as they tried to subsist on the little food they had, and carried Victoria’s body around with them in a Lidl bag. This bag had become totemic in the coverage of the trial last year, a symbol of the couple’s apparent neglect. Marten argued it was a vehicle for their grief: they hadn’t want to leave their daughter alone and were too weak to bury her. They’d talked about handing themselves in, but didn’t because Marten thought she would be branded “an evil mother who had done it on purpose”. At one point, Gordon suggested they throw themselves in a fire. Marten’s panic deepened as she realised how Victoria’s death would appear to the police and press.Finally, she reached the end of her evidence. She would now be cross-examined first by Femi-Ola, then the prosecution. “Thank you, my lord,” Marten said to Lucraft, in a perfect portrayal of deference. “You have been very, very patient.”In revealing her husband’s criminal past, Marten had planted a seed of disorder in the trial that now took root and spread. On 6 May, Femi-Ola rose and told the judge that there had been a breakdown in relations with Gordon: he was not able to continue to defend his client. “I don’t want another barrister,” Gordon declared. “I’d like to represent myself.”Gordon had been such a quiet presence in court until now, it was easy to forget he was there. He wore the same clothes every day: a blue shirt with a grey long-sleeved T-shirt beneath, and a pink wrap on his head, tied like a durag. To represent himself properly, he told Lucraft, he’d like time to go over the case and read the 600-page Criminal Justice Act. Gordon now had the right to cross-examine all the witnesses, to give evidence himself and to deliver a closing speech in his defence. A man who had spent two decades in American prisons, years in family court proceedings, then two more years in Belmarsh, was going to be heard unfiltered by lawyers who had routinely advised him to say nothing. You could almost see him grow with his sense of mission.A trial is a grave process, but at times it resembles a game. Suddenly, there was a player who didn’t know the rules. Lucraft explained to Gordon that he would need to submit all his questions for Marten in advance so that Lucraft could check they were relevant. Gordon wanted three days to prepare. “I don’t have three days, Mr Gordon,” said Lucraft. The trial was already set to overrun. Lucraft worked under pressure of the clock, but time seemed to have no meaning for the defendants, who felt none of the same obligations. Delaying had become one of their powers.Lucraft gave Gordon the afternoon. Gordon complained: he was being rushed, it wasn’t fair. “I think the jury is quite unaware of our case,” he said, with passion. Newly voiced, Gordon began to take issue with various aspects of the proceedings.“My lord, can I ask a question, please?”“You can.”“I was curious with regard to the evidence that has been submitted. The experts – it’s not real evidence.”He continued in this vein for some time, until Lucraft intervened. “If you take a breath for 30 seconds,” he said, then attempted to explain why expert testimony was valid. But Gordon wasn’t convinced. Their evidence didn’t prove anything. “You’re entitled to that view,” said Lucraft, with tight politeness, as if realising the new force that had been unleashed into his court, “but you’re wrong.”Chaos now seemed to engulf the trial with such regularity that it became the norm. The next day, Marten, having refused to come to court, appeared on a video link from Bronzefield, fizzing with self-righteous fury. “Your honour, I’m sorry, but there needs to be an independent review into this prison,” she said. “I’d like to subpoena seven officers.” Ignoring Lucraft’s barely concealed fury, she insisted on being told the duty governor’s name, as if plotting a campaign.Gordon, meanwhile, told the judge he wanted to ask his wife 150 questions in his cross-examination. After a private afternoon session with Gordon in court, Lucraft whittled these down to 71. Lucraft’s perseverance had a stubbornness to it now, as if to prove that the process of the law could not be easily dismantled.The next day, the press benches were full of long-serving crime reporters eager to see something they had never witnessed before in court: a husband cross-examining his wife about the death of their child. Perhaps their exchange would finally shed light on a relationship that had long seemed contradictory. The assumption that it was abusive, given the reported domestic violence incident and Marten’s isolation from family and friends, didn’t seem to chime with her outspoken fearlessness. (In the family court judgment from 2022, Judge Reardon said she lacked evidence to say that Gordon controlled her and could only conclude that the couple put their relationship before everything else, including their children.)As Gordon questioned Marten about their actions, the couple appeared to perform a kind of double act. Small in-jokes were shared, smiles exchanged. He was the positive one, she was more negative, she said. He was more practical, she was more emotional. Gordon asked Marten repeatedly to explain her state of mind in the weeks leading up to Victoria’s death. In response, Marten spoke about being constantly watched and the relief she felt when someone from the CPS confirmed that her parents had employed private investigators. She wasn’t paranoid, then: it was true. She hinted at something darker that had happened in her past, not specifying what. “There are people in my biological family that see me as an embarrassment. They’re scared that I’ll speak out against them and will stop at nothing to get what they want. Some people from privilege work on a different set of rules,” she said, not seeming to realise the self-implicating resonance of her words. “They think they’re above the law.”At one point, Gordon asked Marten whether the grief she’d felt after having her children taken away had affected her trust in the system.“I never had any issues with the system,” she replied. “I never had anything to do with social services until Wales, when I asked for a property.”Growing up as she had, Marten had never had to encounter the system. Privilege allows you to sidestep the state and its services almost completely. But if you have never needed the state, you have never learned its lesson: that once you are in its care, you must accept its oversight. In 2017, when she asked the social worker in Wales for help finding a house, Marten saw the system as something that could give her something she wanted: a purely transactional relationship. In reality, she encountered a set of professionals and services bound by a duty of care, concerned about her welfare and that of her child, and with a right to intervene.The family court judgment, which covered years of social services’ involvement with their previous children, described Gordon and Marten avoiding social workers, failing to get standard health checks for their babies, not turning up to family court hearings and not attending multiple contact sessions with their children, who were often left confused and upset by their absence. “The parents presented as if engaged in battle with a nonexistent enemy,” wrote the family judge, “and this struggle absorbs the entirety of their attention.” But for Marten, the enemy wasn’t nonexistent: it simply changed shape. It was her family first, then social services, police, prison, and now the judiciary. The enemy had become the state.The next day, Smith began his cross-examination for the prosecution in a style that suggested he was unleashing weeks of frustration. “It’s not the first time you’ve been on trial, is it?” he asked Marten.“No,” she replied, “because you decided to retry me because you didn’t get the result you wanted.”Smith retaliated fast, and asked her about Victoria’s body being kept after her death in the Lidl bag, covered with soil and a beer can, still wearing a dirty nappy.“If you’re going to go down that route,” said Marten, glowering, “it shows the sort of person you are.”Smith persisted: surely Victoria deserved dignity in death?Marten said that she had organised a funeral for Victoria from prison but hadn’t been allowed to go. She’d arranged the songs, the words.“She was sitting in her own faeces,” said Smith.“Mr Smith, you really are diabolical,” said Marten. “I find the way you cross examine me really so uncouth. You really are a heartless human being.”“Did you cover her up with a beer can?”“No …” Marten paused, as if knowing she couldn’t deny the pictures we had all seen. “It wasn’t because we didn’t care.”“Is that a caring act putting your dead baby in a plastic bag with sandwich wrappers and a beer can?”“Of course it’s not nice. Obviously we weren’t going to keep her in a bag like that. We were trying to figure out what to do.”Marten tried to explain that after Victoria died, they were in a state of shock. She no longer saw her body as her daughter, but more like her “space suit”. Her spirit had gone.Smith moved on, asking about the house in Greenwich which Marten had earlier described making lovely for their children. Smith suggested the court watched a video of the house’s interior taken by the landlord. Marten panicked: she’d never seen this video, she said. The jury were sent out and Lucraft said the defence should watch the video before he decided whether the jury should see it. Every screen in court flashed with footage of a house in a terrible state: the kitchen barely visible under dirty dishes, full black bin bags in the corridors, clothes all over the floor, a sense of lives that had unravelled. “The crown’s case is that Ms Marten is an unreliable narrator,” said Smith. Lucraft decided that the video would not be shown – another attempt, it seemed, to shield the defendants from their past.Smith resumed his attack. It didn’t last long. By the end of the day, Marten had collapsed in tears. She was at breaking point, she said, and couldn’t go on.When Marten arrived in court on 13 May, due to continue cross-examination, she stood in the dock. “I’m not going to give evidence any more,” she said. “I’ve made a decision.” Godfrey, Marten’s barrister, turned his head in surprise. After discussion with Marten, Godfrey confirmed her evidence was over.Marten wiped tears from her eyes. She had no fervour today, no imperious fury. It was as if she had realised that the relentless forward motion of the trial would continue whatever she did. The last power she had was a refusal to take part, and now that had been deployed, she sat curled over herself as if crushed.For the previous three weeks, I realised we had been in thrall to Marten, the centrifugal force around which the trial revolved. Now that she had relinquished her hold, it became Gordon’s domain. Every day, he dragged a large sack of legal papers into the dock – a sack that became so heavy as the weeks went on that it took him longer and longer to come up to court from the cells.At first, Lucraft appeared to develop an almost paternal working relationship with Gordon, as though he were coaching him in the law. The solicitor helped Gordon draft his questions and these were sent to Lucraft to check. But Gordon kept pressing for more time and resources: he wanted textbooks, a copy, even, of Archbold, Lucraft’s own tome. Lucraft made small allowances but Gordon was unhappy, and declared he was going to make an application “about issues affecting the fairness of this trial”. Three days later, Lucraft read Gordon’s complaints aloud to the court. He had not been given enough time or even a desk, he said: the process was unfair.“These are serious allegations about my conduct,” said Lucraft. “I will have to give this serious consideration.”Gordon appeared to panic a little. It was just his point of view, he said. This was a serious case and he was representing himself.“You have chosen to represent yourself,” Lucraft reminded him. Did he want a new barrister?“I don’t want a new barrister,” said Gordon. “What I would like is materials. If I had the Criminal Justice Act …”At this, Lucraft could not contain himself. “Do you want three years while you do a law degree?”Lucraft suggested that he would again have to consider discharging the jury in Gordon’s case so that he could represent himself in a different trial. Unlike Marten, who seemed to relish opportunities to challenge the judge’s authority, Gordon backtracked rapidly: the trial should go ahead, he did not want to proceed with the application and would now give evidence. “There will be no more disturbances and no more delays,” he promised. “You are doing everything to make sure this trial is fair. I have no complaints about that. I am content with how you run this trial.”Lucraft brought the jury back in and apologised. “You’ve probably had a very frustrating day,” he said. “You are not the only one.”On 21 May, Lucraft suggested that, in the absence of barristers, he could ask Gordon some simple questions to prompt his evidence. Gordon would then be cross-examined by the prosecution. “It would be nice to say my piece,” agreed Gordon.For the rest of the day, Gordon spoke freely, retelling their whole story. He began with his childhood, growing up in England before moving to Florida. “I come from a decent background,” he said. “My mother was a nurse. She worked very hard and did well for herself. She was a very passionate woman, very empathetic, and always helping other people.” He described challenges in his life, but said he was never underprivileged. His mother had “showed me empathy and taught me to feel what other people are experiencing. This is important for members of the jury and others observing my actions.”As he talked through the events after Victoria’s birth, he kept addressing the jury directly:What you need to know; What I want to tell you; You need to know the truth.Again, he emphasised his and Marten’s state of mind. They were deranged, he said, an effect of having their children taken from them. “We weren’t normal,” he said. “It’s like a vacuum, a hole, an emptiness – you can never fill it.”At the back of his mind, he said, he thought they would hand Victoria into social services. He had no problem with the system. “But it’s not a perfect system,” he said. “I don’t want to stand in the Old Bailey with my wife, and with my baby passed. I have to explain myself criminally for the loss of the baby I loved.” Gordon’s voice began to tremble with emotion. He swayed in the witness box, his arms gesturing into the air. “I will never forget the pain, the feeling of picking my baby up.” By now, Gordon was crying. “Weare the ones who have to live with what happened … You have to understand our perspective if you are judging us.”Both Gordon and Marten made this point. You cannot understand someone, Marten liked to say, until you have walked a mile in their shoes. But to truly understand Gordon and Marten would require the kind of long rewinding the judge was so desperate to avoid – not only back to the removal of their previous children, or even to the beginning of their relationship, but to their childhoods. On one side there was English privilege and family acrimony; on the other, violent crime and years in American prisons. Both had grown up fighting authorities – a wealthy family and a criminal justice system – that they believed were working against them. The pattern was set separately and early. When they met it was as if they found common cause in each other: it was them against the world. The mix of their personalities was like nuclear fusion, unleashing a relentless, destructive energy.At the end of Gordon’s evidence, Little rose on behalf of the prosecution. Gordon’s portrayal of himself as sympathetic had created a false impression of his character, he said. To counter this, the prosecution would like to bring his previous convictions before the jury: not just the American convictions of rape and battery, but his arrest for assaulting a police officer in a hospital in Wales in 2017 after Marten had given birth to their first child, and the reported domestic violence incident in 2019 in which Marten had fallen from a window. Marten had suffered a ruptured spleen and Gordon had not allowed paramedics to enter their property.When the issue arose again the next morning, Marten yelled from the dock. “It’s not true! My husband never laid a finger on me!” Gordon said he would need the day to consider his response, and suggested the prosecution were distorting his words: he’d never claimed to be perfect. It wasn’t fair, he said, the refrain sounding more childlike every time he repeated it. If he could take back what he’d said, he would. Lucraft reminded him that once something is said in court it cannot be unsaid. But Gordon persisted: he was without representation; he hadn’t realised what he was doing.“As I’ve pointed out,” said Lucraft, “you have chosen to represent yourself. It was not forced upon you, that was yourchoice.”“If I was aware that this was how self-representation was conducted,” said Gordon, “I probably wouldn’t have done it.”If Gordon had imagined that representing himself was an opportunity for legal heroics, he was quickly disabused of the idea. When Gordon returned to the witness box on 23 May to be cross-examined by Little, he looked morose.“That’s it,” he said.The court seemed to stop breathing.“I will answer no questions,” said Gordon.At times, a trial can move with devastating speed. Lucraft ruled that evidence from Gordon’s American convictions and the arrest in Wales could be put before the jury. In response, Gordon tried to suggest that he didn’t accept the convictions were real or valid, but he was rapidly outmanoeuvred. The prosecution dug up the relevant paperwork that proved his convictions, and Little announced that he was going to call one of the Welsh police officers who’d arrested Gordon in 2017 to give evidence. In the midst of all this, Gordon’s solicitor resigned.On 29 May, a police officer came into the witness box. Little led him through the details of Gordon’s previous convictions by asking a series of questions, each answered with a simple “yes”.Did he break into the house of a nextdoor neighbour?Before doing so had he placed a stocking over face to conceal his identity?Was he armed with a knife and hedge clippers?Did he attempt to vaginally rape her?Then did he orally rape her?Did he perform other sexual assault offences?Was that female held against her will for four and a half hours?Gordon was then allowed to cross-examine the officer.“Are you aware that the American police interviewed a 14-year-old child without parent or adult supervision?” he asked, referring to himself.The officer said he wasn’t aware of the circumstances of the case.“That’s why I’m making you aware,” said Gordon. “That was the case.”When Gordon suggested he had been mistreated and advised to plead guilty, Little tried to intervene. Gordon said he only had one more question.“Do you know that the American police in the south are racists and prejudiced against people?”“That is not a question this officer is going to answer,” said Lucraft.The defence closed its case at the end of May. Once, in a hearing for another case, I heard Lucraft joke that he might be running this trial for the rest of his life. But over three months of multiple near-collapses, he had somehow held its fragile structure together. In his directions to the jury, Lucraft told them to ignore the “numerous delays and disruptions to the smooth running of this trial”. Nor should Gordon’s previous convictions and the family court proceedings be seen as support for the prosecution case. If they wished, however, the jury could interpret Gordon and Marten’s refusal to be cross-examined as the defendants having no answer to the prosecution case. But the jury could not convict either defendant because of their refusal.In their closing speeches, Little, Gordon and Godfrey stuck to their well-established narratives. Little reminded the jury of the lies which fell from Marten’s mouth “like confetti”. Gordon, over a day and a half of circling oration, suggested that the prosecution’s case was like a movie script. “You will observe where the very keen and eager prosecution has just made things up and filled in the blanks in support of the plot.” Godfrey asked the jury to strip away the noise around the case and concentrate on what happened in the tent. “How did the baby die? If you faithfully apply the oath to try this case on the basis of the evidence, then the only verdicts are not guilty.”Just after 2.15pm on Monday 14 July, the jury delivered their verdict. Unanimously, they found Marten and Gordon guilty of manslaughter, the most serious charge. Neither Gordon nor Marten stood to hear the verdict, but quietly shook their heads. Marten was heard saying, “It’s a scam.” After the jury left court, Gordon began offering his views, until Lucraft cut him off. Sentencing, he announced, would take place in September.Chortle chortle, scribble scribble: inside the Old Bailey with Britain’s last court reportersRead moreIn the hours after the verdict, stories filled the press about the couple. The BBC had tracked down Gordon’s 1989 rape victim, who described him as a psychopath. The family court orders were also released in full, revealing how Marten and Gordon could be playful, caring parents when they did turn up to see their children, an observation the judge found difficult to reconcile with their inconsistency. “Perhaps most hurtful, from the children’s point of view, is their parents’ baffling lack of commitment to them over the course of these lengthy proceedings and their inability, or unwillingness, to do what needed to be done in order to reclaim them,” wrote the judge.Whatever time Gordon and Marten will now serve in their respective prisons seems tangential to the real pain and damage of this case. A child was born and lived too briefly. On their eventual release, Gordon and Marten will return to lives which are now shattered and yet, while entwined with each other, bound to create further chaos. The law, with all its weight and logic, can impose order temporarily, but it does not have the power to save people from themselves.Listen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readCrimefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than walk back down the several flights he’d already climbed, he drunkenly decided to jump all the way down to the reception level. When he regained consciousness, a bemused Courtney Love was staring down at his prone body. As was an irate hotel manager, who swiftly barred the band from staying there for years, before the crumpled musician was scooped up to go and spend a few days in hospital.It was not easy to get barred from the Columbia hotel, but Radio 4 were not the only ones who managed it. Once, at 6am, members ofOasisdecided to throw all the furniture in the bar out of the window, piece by piece. When items landed on the hotel manager’s Mercedes, the band had to scarper before the police arrived. It played such a significant part in Oasis’s story that Noel Gallagher wrote a song in tribute to it, Columbia, based on his escapades there back when he was a roadie for Inspiral Carpets.“It was rock’n’roll central,” says Inspiral Carpets’ Clint Boon. “The coming and going in the car park was amazing. All these minibuses of bands pulling up. I remember Noel heckling Paul Weller one time.” For working-class kids from Manchester, it was a big deal to be suddenly surrounded by idols. “To see Noddy Holder in the bar was like ... we’ve arrived,” says Boon. “We just stood around him in awe. Noel would have been with us in that gaggle of excited young northerners, and ultimately went on to cover one of Noddy’s songs,” Slade’s Cum on Feel the Noize.Oasis: Columbia – videoThe Columbia – located in leafy west London in Grade II listed Victorian townhouses across from Kensington Gardens – was known for its cheap rooms, flexible bar opening hours in a time well before 24-hour licenses, and its look-the-other-way attitude. It became a go-to spot for musicians in the 1980s when Liverpool outfit the Teardrop Explodes started staying there. “We had some wild parties and mad drug-taking,” says David Balfe, who played keyboards in the band. “The staff seemed quite philosophical about it – I presumed they weren’t getting a lot of business.”Word quickly spread. “Bands at the time had difficulty finding hotels that were relaxed as to the peculiarities of their behaviour,” says Balfe. “So suddenly everybody was staying there: Soft Cell, ABC, Depeche Mode.” Soft Cell’s Marc Almond practically lived there between 1982 and 1983, and in his autobiography he recalled it as a “bohemian gathering of musicians, bands and hangers-on” and a “who’s-who of the early 80s music scene”. He paints a stand-offish scene in the breakfast room populated by the Human League, Talk Talk and Kajagoogoo. “Every morning we all sat there, trying to be more aloof than one another,” he wrote. “Buttered toast and disdain.”Unusually, the Columbia outlasted its first flush of fame and continued to be a buzzy place for decades. It was such a magnet for groups that celebrated photographer Mick Rock would hang around looking to discover new bands to shoot. “In the 90s it becametheplace to descend on, after hours, irrespective of whether we knew anyone actually staying there,” says music publicist Andy Prevezer. “The historical importance of that place should not be overlooked. To this day I go past it and feel an almost irresistible urge to go into the building and misbehave.”View image in fullscreenColumbia denizens … from left: Marc Almond and Dave Ball of Soft Cell.Photograph: LJ Van Houten/ShutterstockNot everyone has such fond memories though. Miki Berenyi of Lush remembers it as being filled with “tame and boring conversations” and finding the place “a bit dismal”. The Auteurs’Luke Haineswent one further in expressing his dislike of it. On the 1996 song Tombstone he sings “taking out the garbage at the Columbia hotel / We’ll take the fucking building out, Baader Meinhof style.” The Columbia was, Haines says, a “signifier of everything I thought was crap at the time: boring cliched rock’n’roll behaviour, boring rock bands who thought they were the Faces, but who were about to be dropped after their first single on London Records.”Haines has one fond memory of hanging out with the late Grant McLennan of the Go-Betweens there, but for him it’s largely a place fogged with regret. He says heading there would seem like a good idea in a taxi over, but then you would end up “sitting with some sweating random bass player you had never met before and hoped to never meet again, drinking lager until you both passed out. It was the natural endgame of what went on backstage: getting drunk and taking drugs with people you don’t like and having awkward conversations.” For him, it holds no comparison to other mythologised hotels. “New York had the Chelsea Hotel, which was a dump, but a glamorous dump, where you might run into Jackie Curtis, Jobriath or Alan Vega,” he says. “London had the Columbia where you’d end up stuck in a conversation with a marketing manager from East West records or a session player for Babylon Zoo.”View image in fullscreenNot a fan … Miki Berenyi of Lush.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesNevertheless, the bands and industry people kept coming. Balfe even held his wedding reception there. “It was the only hotel that meant anything to me in London,” he says. Publicist Steve Phillips recalls having to climb a drainpipe to get back in one night after being booted out for something or other, so keen was he for the party to continue.Despite its reputation – with documented stories of open sex and drug use in public areas – the manager during these wild years refuted it. “If we’re known as the rock’n’roll hotel I don’t know why,” Michael Rose, known for smoking a pipe and wearing a suit at all times, said in a radio documentary. “It’s a family-run hotel. It is a Victorian building and we try as far as possible to leave that Victorian atmosphere in it. We are a conservative family and I don’t think any of us have any interest in pop music whatsoever.”Clint Boon creases up when I mention this. “I don’t remember any Victorian values,” he laughs.The party continued well into the new millennium. “It was like a rock’n’roll frat house,” says Karen Ruttner, a music industry veteran who spent the early 2000s staying and partying there, along with the likes of the Strokes, Interpol,Kings of Leonand the Killers. “I was young and wide-eyed and loved the movie Almost Famous and all those old stories of bands hanging out together causing chaos. That was how I dreamed things in the music business would be, so to see it actually unfolding in front of me was like: wow, this stuff actually happens.”View image in fullscreenBath time … from left: David Keuning, Brandon Flowers, Ronnie Vannucci, Mark Stoermer of the Killers.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsTwo of those bands almost came to blows at the Columbia. When Interpol’s black-clad bassist Carlos Dengler poked fun at Kings of Leon for looking like Lynyrd Skynyrd, as they shuffled around smoking weed in their bell bottoms with big moustaches, the band’s drummer Nathan Followill struck back. “We were like, ‘You vampire-looking motherfucker, we will break this bottle and cut you,’” he said in the scene oral historyMeet Me in the Bathroom.The Killers stayed there on their first UK tour, sharing rooms and a bathtub to puke in: they were not used to the levels of excessive drinking that took place at the bar that never closed. “Time seemed to start slowing down when you got through the entrance and eventually it stopped entirely if you stayed long enough,” recalls Conor McNicholas, NME editor at the time. “I remember everyone just slipping endlessly towards an alcohol coma.”‘Without a parka, I’ll look like an idiot’: Oasis fans’ fashion at the reunion tourRead moreTastes finally changed in the mid-to-late 2000s and bands began to go elsewhere. Today, the Columbia has had a refurb and while it now happily trades off its storied history, it’s no longer an anything-goes playground for the sleepless and inebriated. Similarly, cultural changes have taken hold: such excessive alcohol and drug consumption has lost its charm for many younger bands. And of course nobody is celebrating how tortured hotel staff had to clean up after entitled people trashing stuff for kicks. But, for some, the Columbia feels like a symbol of a pre-smartphone past. “As a participant in that madness, you were almost invisible,” says Boon.For Ruttner, it was a chance to peek into a world that she feels has since vanished. “The biggest thing that’s been lost in the age of social media, apart from privacy, is mystique,” she says. “There was a period when musicians had such a curated image that you only knew what they wanted you to know or the music press told you. That’s what made them so exciting, forbidden and sexy. The Columbia was an embodiment of that bygone rock’n’roll era: of icons hanging out together, being messy, and getting into trouble.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieLondonOasisLuke HainesInterpolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

In August 2021, the then foreign secretary,Dominic Raab, had moaned about the “sea being closed” while on holiday in Crete. The fate of thousands of Afghans who had helped the UK and whose lives were in danger as the Taliban homed in on Kabul came a distant second. For Psycho Dom, it was a simple matter of priorities.So no wonder a government official and/or a soldier had been less than diligent with the names of Afghans at risk. Following by example. Which one of us hasn’t accidentally emailed an entire spreadsheet of more than 18,000 endangered people to someone who might pass on their names to theTaliban? Such an easy mistake to make. Why bother to check a confidential file when you can just press send and go and grab yourself a coffee?Shortly after 12.30 and thelifting of the superinjunction, the defence secretary, John Healey, came to the Commons to give a statement on the data leak, the subsequent cover-up, and the news that a secret relocation scheme costing at least £800m, the Afghanistan Response Route (ARR), was being wound up. He might as well have been talking about the, by now familiar, Arse Covering Scheme (ACS).Time and again, Healey would commend MPs from both sides of the house for the tone they were taking. The sombre, measured sentences. No surprise there. The fuck ups all originated and were set in motion under the Tories. So they were hardly going to complain. But the self-congratulatory non-mea culpas all became nauseatingly cloying.This was not a time to not rock the boat. This was a time for righteous anger. How dare our government – not the government – be so cavalier with data? Put allies at risk. And then try to cover up the entire shambles. And get us to pay for it. Thanks for that. At the very moment Rishi Sunak was shouting “Stop the Boats”, he was running his own private relocation and immigration scheme to mop up after his government’s own failings. Someone should hang their head in shame at the hypocrisy.Time and again Healey would insist that it caused governments great pain to keep things secret from the public. That would have come as news to most of us. More frequently, it feels like getting blood from a stone. A desperate attempt either to conceal or, when that’s no longer an option, to spin the truth to their best advantage.Tuesday’s statement felt like no exception. There was no avoiding this one for Healey once the superinjunction was lifted. If he hadn’t given a statement he would soon have been playing catchup, as the journalists who had known about the story for years but had been prevented from writing about it would have got to work. Best to get the government version out first. Time for the ACS.Healey began by apologising for having kept parliament in the dark about the data leak and the ARR. This broke his heart, he said. He sounded almost sincere. But what could he have done? He too was bound by the superinjunction. What we had to remember was that it was all in a good cause. So top secret, that even those whose data had been breached were not allowed to be informed. That way, if the Taliban had wanted to send in a death squad then at least it would come as a surprise. So much better than spending months worrying about it. Or trying to flee the country.Anyway, Healey concluded, everything was fine now. The Taliban had promised to be a lot nicer. So it was OK for the superinjunction to be lifted and it was just fine to end the ARR. Everyone who needed to be in the UK was now accounted for. Or thereabouts. And anyone who wasn’t could just take their chances. The UK had done its bit. Paid all its debts. You couldn’t go around feeling sorry for Afghans you’d let down indefinitely. Part of the healing process was the moving on.In reply, the shadow defence secretary, James Cartlidge, was keen to absolve both the Tories and Labour. And especially himself. He had been a very – ever so humble – junior minister in August 2023 and his involvement had been minimal. So minimal that he might as well not have been there. So let’s just say he wasn’t there. Or anywhere. It was all down to Ben Wallace orGrant Shapps. One of the two. But they too had been doing their best. So it was probably right for all concerned to just reflect quietly and look to the future.This pretty much set the tone for the next hour and a quarter. Everyone was very sorry but none of them had done anything wrong. And it was important to remember that. They were the real victims in this, not the Afghans. The Lib Dems’ Helen Maguire went on to wonder just how many other superinjunctions the government might have in place. Er … That’s the whole point. We’ll never get to find out unless they are lifted.For all his rhetoric about the value of transparency in the cradle of democracy – yuk – Healey was relatively opaque with his answers. He ignored requests to identify the leaker as either a government official, a civil servant or a soldier and refused to say if the person had been sacked or forced to resign. Above all of our pay grades.He also threw his hands in the air. Much of the detail was in the papers of the former government. And luckily he didn’t have access to them. Long may it stay that way.Some of the dimmer MPs from both parties sought assurance thatthis could never happen again. A question that always gets asked at such moments. As if you could stop idiots from being idiots. You can’t foolproof the system. Especially when Psycho and the Shappster are setting the mood.The most interesting contributions came from Tories Edward Leigh and Mark Pritchard. Leigh suggested that one useful takeaway was we should think twice before committing to any more liberal imperialist urges to send British troops into unstable countries. Pritchard reckoned it was time to rock the boat. Shake the Commons out of its complacency and for people to feel a genuine sense of outrage. Healey shook his head. This was the wrong tone. That would never do.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanThe politics sketchMinistry of DefenceTalibanSuperinjunctionsSouth and central AsiaDominic RaabForeign policycommentShareReuse this content"

With that holy grail of British history, the Bayeux tapestry, about to belent by France to the British Museum, we could say the same. In 1885,Elizabeth Wardleof Leek, Staffordshire, led a team of 35 women in an extraordinary campaign to embroider a meticulous, full-scale replica of the entire early medieval artwork. With Victorian energy and industry they managed it in just a year and by 1886 it was being shown around Britain and abroad.View image in fullscreenNo mean feat … photograph of Elizabeth Wardle stitching.Today that Victorian Bayeux tapestry is preserved in Reading Museum, and like the original, can beviewedonline. Are there differences? Of course. The Bayeux tapestry is a time capsule of the 11th century and when you look at its stitching you get a raw sense of that remote past. TheLeek Embroidery Societyversion is no mean feat but it is an artefact of its own, Victorian age. The colours are simplified and intensified, using worsted thread, as Wardle explains in its end credits, “dyed in permanent colours” by her husband Thomas Wardle, a leading Midlands silk dyeing industrialist.The Wardles were friends with the radical craft evangelist William Morris – a clue that Elizabeth’s epic work of replication should be seen as part of the Victorian passion for medieval history that encompassed everything from neo-gothic architecture to Walter Scott’s novel Ivanhoe and Morris’s Kelmscott Chaucer – in which the poems are illustrated with woodcuts. In this Victorian dream of the past, sympathies were very much on the Saxon side. The Norman conquest was seen as a national tragedy in which traditional Anglo-Saxon freedoms were crushed by the “Norman Yoke”. It’s ironic that this underdog version of British history, with brave Saxons defying the wicked conquering Normans, prevailed at a time when they were themselves conquering or colonialising much of the planet. That immigrant Victorian Karl Marx wrote that when people are “revolutionising themselves and things … they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes”. This perfectly describes 19th-century Britain, which hid its creation of modern industrial capitalism in medieval styles. And when it came to reproducing theBayeux tapestry, it was a new technology that made it possible – photography.View image in fullscreenVictorian replica of the Bayeux tapestry housed in Reading Museum, Berkshire.Photograph: David Gee/AlamyWardle and her team based their embroideries on what was considered at the time a nationally essential photographic project. In the 1870s, the British government itself commissionedJoseph Cundallto photograph the entire Bayeux tapestry. You can picture his intrepid expedition setting out by the boat train with red-coated soldiers to guard the camera and a team of bearers. A Ripping Yarn.Cundall’s monochrome photographs were hand-coloured by art students back in Britain – and censored. Like other medieval art, including manuscripts illuminated by monks, the Bayeux tapestry has a plenitude of monsters and obscenities in its marginalia, including male nudes with graphically depicted penises. One naked man stands with a flamboyant erection, which may be part of the tapestry’s realism about the psychology of war. When the Leek Embroidery Society borrowed a set of Cundall’s photographs, they of course copied the false colours and underpants from these supposedly objective recordings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cundall created his own continuous photographic replica, mounted on two ornate wooden rollers so that you can scroll through it in your private library. Perhaps this is what its most recent private owner, the late Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, used to do. When his estate went on sale his “tapestry” got much less attention from the media than other treasures such as his first edition of The Great Gatsby. But it was sold for £16,000 – to the Bayeux Museum in Normandy. At least in Bayeux it’s in safe hands, just as the original has been for at least 600 years.Explore more on these topicsArt and designTextile artBayeux tapestryPhotographyArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He explains why he needed to join them in the trenchesCharlotte HigginsTue 15 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 13.18 EDTShareIt was in Sloviansk, in the rear of eastern Ukraine’s frontline, that I first met journalist and film-maker Mstyslav Chernov. It was the autumn of 2023 and he was telling me about the film that would later win him and his team an Oscar:20 Days in Mariupol, a horrifying documentary assembled from the news footage he and his team had gathered there, in the first month of the full-scale invasion. That September day of our interview, though – amid what would turn out to be Ukraine’s disappointing counteroffensive of 2023 – he was making his second film, one that took him to the heart of the combat zone, called 2,000 Meters to Andriivka. It is, if anything, even more powerful than its predecessor: a piece of frontline reporting that truly deserves the name, its footage gathered from soldiers’ own bodycams as well as from Chernov and his small crew on the ground among them. He puts the viewer into the trenches alongside the combatants. It is terrifying, bloody and heartbreakingly sad. You will not emerge from this film unchanged.The soldiers on whom Chernov focuses are members of Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade. They have a mission: to liberate the village of Andriivka, in the Donetsk region, and hoist the blue-and-yellow flag above it. Their sole route to this village is through a narrow strip of forest with flat, open fields either side. The wood, with its sketchy cover, is both their protection and, in many cases, their grave. The painful, dangerous advance through this 2km provides the structure of the film. And yet, for all that the film borrows the conventions of a thriller for its propulsive plotline, it is its tenderness, both in its gaze and in the relationships between the men that it depicts, that really destroyed me.View image in fullscreenTight-lipped determination … paramedics attend to a wounded comrade.Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/AP PhotoThis tenderness, this melancholia, is partly a result of what happened after the shoot, Chernov tells me: during the months of editing, most of the men he focused on were killed. In the film they do indeed raise the flag over Andriivka, or what was left of it, which was piles of abject rubble. But in 2024 it was lost again. And so 2,000 Meters to Andriivka may be a thriller of sorts. But on a deeper level, it is a lament and a memorial. “The film slowly became more about honouring memory, honouring names,” says Chernov. The news of the deaths trickled in while he was standing on red carpets for 20 Days in Mariupol. One reached him while he was in London picking up a Bafta. “There was always guilt,” he says, “there was always a feeling of the absurd to know what’s happening with those men and boys while I was experiencing the normality of the world outside Ukraine.”He talks about the Ukrainian premiere of 2,000 Meters to Andriivka, in Kyiv in May. The relatives of the dead men came. They had not seen the movie in advance. One of the characters, whose callsign, or military nickname, was Sheva, talks about his wife in the film. After the screening – which was followed by a 10-minute standing ovation – that woman came to Chernov, he says, and told him: “Thank you: now I will be able to show his grandson who his grandfather was.” He adds: “I could strip this film down to one basic meaning: which is of being able to salvage at least pieces of these people’s lives, for their families.”What is so touching about the moments in which we get to know Sheva is that he comes across as anything but conventionally heroic. He even asks Chernov to stop filming him: he hasn’t done anything worth recording yet, he says. But despite his evident fear, he is doing it anyway: which some might say is the definition of true bravery.View image in fullscreen‘These landscapes are part of our DNA’ … 2,000 Meters to Andriivka.Photograph: Mstyslav ChernovOne night in Kyiv, a Ukrainian friend asked me if I thought the film was anti-war. It is a good question. It is clear from Chernov’s work that he hates war – and he told me so, in so many words. But to call it anti-war would be a category error. It is true that there is absolutely no glory in 2,000 Meters. It is true that it dares to show us the pain of wounded men, their deaths, ordinary humans, who had ordinary jobs before the invasion, bleeding out for a few metres of Ukrainian soil. It is true that the men’s goal might seem futile – raising a Ukrainian flag over a pile of ruined houses is a strange kind of “liberation” for the village of Andriivka, which has become a mere name, rather than any kind of community. But Chernov shows deep respect and empathy for the fighters who, with tight-lipped determination, are trying to fend off Russia’s violent and pointless aggression. War came to them – to their homes, to their families, to their land – and they are having to fight it.I feel that I am in forests of Verdun 100 years ago, rather than next to my home townThe camera lingers on the breathtaking, big-skied landscapes of eastern Ukraine: expansive forests, glorious steppe, stretches of it burned and scarred by trenches and tanks beyond recognition. The film unfolds not far from Chernov’s native city of Kharkiv, 18 miles (30km) from the Russian border. “This is the landscape of my childhood,” he says. “This is what you see when you go to your grandmother’s village house, and then you run off to a field and steal some corn when you’re hungry, or play hide and seek in the forest with your friends. These landscapes are part of our DNA.” That connection was partly what made him and his crew take cameras and move among the fighters in the thick of the battle, at great risk to their lives. “This film could have existed purely in its bodycam form,” he says, “but it was incredibly important for me to actually walk on that ground, to experience those landscapes and to feel how they changed. To feel the pain and the anger and the surprise that I can’t recognise them any more, that I feel that I’m on another planet, that I feel that I am in forests of Verdun 100 years ago, rather than next to my home town.”Specific the landscape may be, but Chernov talks too about finding inspiration in the first world war paintings of Paul Nash – particularlyWe Are Making a New World, whose shell-pitted northern French landscape could be straight out of the Donetsk region. I am reminded, too, of another bleak painting in theImperial War Museum: Christopher Nevinson’sPaths of Glory. It shows two British soldiers face down, dead, in the forest. It was banned at the time by British censors: dead German soldiers were acceptable in a painting, but dead British soldiers were not. Chernov’s film, I am absolutely sure, would not have survived that kind of censorship. It is too raw, too tragic. It shows the death of Ukrainian men, though, after debates in the edits, the screen mercifully blacks out during the moments of oblivion – an effect akin to the way you can’t help closing your eyes in fear, Chernov says, when something explodes near you.The film has a deep moral purpose: it wants to show the reality of war, beyond the positive political speeches and the Ukrainian media’s “avoiding of difficult news”. “There is an acknowledged problem,” says Chernov, “and that’s probably the problem that’s troubling the Ukrainian soldiers the most right now. It’s not the lack of support by the US. It’s not the fact that Russia is clearly not prepared to finish this war. It’s not the fact that the soldiers [will] probably need to stay at the frontline for years and keep fighting and losing their friends. It’s the fact that part of Ukrainian society has distanced itself from the soldiers.”View image in fullscreen‘Ukrainian society has distanced itself from the soldiers’ … Mstyslav Chernov.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt is true: spending time in Ukraine, it is clear this is a subject of deep national anxiety. People worry, with justification, how the gaps in experience between them – between those on the frontline, those with family members fighting, those who are refugees, those who have avoided the draft – will ever be stitched together. Chernov tells me about a special screening he held for soldiers that happened to be in an ordinary Kyiv multiplex, where the other visitors were eating popcorn and watching blockbusters. “I could see the faces of the soldiers that came out from the cinema after watching 2,000 Meters,” he says. “And they said to me, ‘Mstyslav, we want these people to go and see 2,000 Meters. We want them to know what we are going through.’”The film is, he says, all about distance. Those perilous 2km to Andriivka, of course, but also implicitly about “the 3,000km to Paris. About what Russian TV tells its own people: that it would take a Russian tank only 24 hours to get to the Bundestag. Or 20 minutes for a Russian nuclear missile to fly to London.” And the distance between the combatants’ beating hearts and the viewers of the film – which is zero.2,000 Meters to Andriivka is out on 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Up to 100,000 Afghans could have been placed at risk after a British soldier,according to the Times, sent the names of 33,000 people who supported British forces to a contact he hoped would help verify their applications for sanctuary in this country. The story behind these numbers is one of real people who had already been living in fear for years, and who have been treated abhorrently by the British state.As soon as it became clear that the information could fall into the Taliban’s hands and lead to these people and those close to them being targeted, the highly secret Operation Rubific was launched. This debacle occurred under the previous Conservative government, which obtained a superinjunction preventing several media organisations that were aware of the leak from reporting on it.The current government commissioned an independent review ordered by the defence secretary, John Healey, into the level of risk to those whose details are contained in the leaked database. It was carried out by the retired civil servant Paul Rimmer. He concluded that if the Taliban has acquired or does acquire this database it is unlikely to substantially change an individual’s exposure, given the volume of data already available.Today at noon, the superinjunction was lifted. This conclusion raises questions about why it was allowed to continue for so long.Until now the Afghans affected, reportedly 24,000 of whom have already been brought to the UK or will come in the future, were not aware of the full facts. Many more on the database remain inAfghanistanor in a precarious situation in neighbouring countries. Many who fled to Pakistan and Iran have been rounded up and sent back to Afghanistan, where they live in daily fear of being targeted by the Taliban, whether or not their names are on the leaked database.Immigration lawyers with Afghan clients had not been informed about the leak and were puzzled about why some of their clients who were seeking asylum in the UK were granted leave to remain outside the rules.Today it has become apparent why this happened: the government knew more than it was letting on about the very real level of risk some of these Afghans were exposed to.But much still remains unknown about today’s revelations – exactly who is affected, what is the likely risk to them and their families, and whether or not this information is already known to the Taliban.It isn’t the first time personal data relating to Afghans who worked with overseas forces in Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover in August 2021has leaked. One interpreter airlifted to the UK with his family soon after the takeover started receiving threatening messages from the Taliban on his Afghan number – he had brought his Afghan sim card with him for ease of communication with family members who remained in hiding.“It was terrifying to wake up in the morning, put my Afghan sim into my phone to pick up family messages and hear these threatening messages from the Taliban saying they knew where I was living in London and that my family and I were in danger,” he said.Rimmer’s findings are likely to give little comfort to the tens of thousands of Afghans who put their trust in British and American forces and worked with them for many years. Many were already living in fear. Not knowing whether or not their names are being viewed by the Taliban can only compound that feeling.Today the focus is rightly on the disclosure of the gigantic leak, but this bigger issue has been affecting many Afghans since the fall of the Taliban and will continue to affect them for many years to come. While responsibility to protect Afghans who put their trust in overseas governments does not lie with the UK alone, and should be shared equally between the countries that pulled out in August 2021, the truth is that many lives are now at greater risk because of the countries that hastily and chaotically abandoned Afghanistan.It is no coincidence thatin 2023 and 2024, Afghanistan was the top country of origin for people who had crossed the Channel in small boats. For them, the dinghy is the last-chance saloon when they have no other option to reach safety. Many want to come to the UK for the same reason British officials in Afghanistan sought them out: because they speak excellent or perfect English. But we have shut them out of the legal routes to arrive here, which are all now closed.Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who has represented many Afghans, told me: “Not only did the government’s Afghan schemes not help who they were supposed to help, but administrative incompetence appears to have potentially put thousands at risk from the Taliban. This is a further betrayal of so many who were integral to western efforts in Afghanistan who have already been forced to wait years for a lawful relocation decision.”Today’s disclosures are an as-yet unquantifiable failure to Afghans who assisted us. But it is not the only failure. They will continue to try to reach the UK by irregular means because we have failed to protect them. While it is welcome that 24,000 people have been brought here, or are due to come here, many more are still living in danger. There is no sign of that changing any time soon.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In a statement to the Commons, he said he had felt “deeply concerned about the lack of transparency” around the data breach and “deeply uncomfortable to be constrained from reporting to this house”.1:14Data leak of Afghan scheme was 'serious departmental error', says UK defence secretary – videoHealey told MPs that he was first briefed about the topic when he was in opposition in December 2023 by the junior Conservative defence minister James Heappey, at which he was “issued with the superinjunction at the start of the meeting”. Its existence was also made known to the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle.However, the minister told MPs that neither Keir Starmer nor any other member of the current cabinet was briefed about the gagging order until “on taking office after the general election”.The minister said the leaked spreadsheet also included details of MPs, senior military officers and government officials linked to individual claims. The defence official who passed on the information in error had “mistakenly believed they were sending the names of 150 applicants”.In fact it contained 33,000 records among which was “personal information associated to 18,714 Afghans who had applied either to the ex gratia or the Arap [Afghan relocations and assistance policy] scheme on or before 7 January 2022”.The defence secretary said Labour would now halt the Afghan Response Route, which will cost a total of £850m and will help an estimated 6,900 people. Stopping the scheme will save a projected additional spend of £1.2bn, defence sources said – meaning the potential cost could have risen to more than £2bn.There were, Healey said, about 900 Afghans who were in Britain or in transit, with 3,600 family members at the cost of £400m and the UK would “honour the 600 invitations already made to any named person still inAfghanistanand their immediate family” – a number estimated at 1,800.Halting the scheme, however, would mean another 9,500 people would not come to the UK, he added.Three schemes, including the ARR, were created to help Afghans come to the UK after the Taliban takeover. So far, 36,000 people have arrived from the country, as of the end of March, and the government says the total cost of all relocation schemes will be between £5.5bn and £6bn.A Cabinet Office memo dated February 2025 that formed part of the evidence submitted to the court suggested that keeping open the ARR, the policy at the time, would mean relocating 25,000 Afghans at a time when “the UK’s asylum and immigration system is under strain”.Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreIt said the scheme would be extended by five years at a total cost of £7bn – but government officials said yesterday that sum was an error – and the figure in fact applied to the cost of all three Afghan resettlement schemes at the time. The other two were closed to new applicants at the beginning of July, with the costs now reduced, they said.One law firm, Barings, said it was pursuing potential legal action on behalf of 1,000 affected people, many of whom were linked to the Afghan armed forces during the period when the UK and other western militaries were based in the country.Adnan Malik, a lawyer with the firm, said: “This is essentially a database for anyone who wants to know who assisted the armed forces in Afghanistan.” He added: “If you’re someone whose family member or friend was killed by these individuals I’m sure you will want to take vengeance.”The initial decision to seek an injunction was taken by Ben Wallace, defence secretary until the end of August 2023. “We were determined that no harm came to those on the lists. The injunction was not about [a] cover-up. The judge, not us, decided on it being super,” he said.But it was maintained while Grant Shapps was defence secretary, with the ARR scheme devised to mitigate the risk following the leak. One ally of Shapps said: “We came in after the incident,” but added that it was “believed strongly” there was a duty to protect all those named on the list.Court judgments show that the size of the ARR kept increasing under the Conservatives. Ministers on the cabinet’s domestic and economic affairs committee decided in November to relocate 150 affected persons and their families, a figure that had risen to 2,300 people and 11,500 family members by March 2024.Labour said it had taken a year since coming to power to review the situation, and that decisions were taken after the commissioning of a review by Paul Rimmer, a retired civil servant whose conclusions were also shared with and published by the high court.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was unlikely, Rimmer said, that “merely being on the dataset would be grounds for targeting”.The official told ministers that “given this context, the ARR policy appears an extremely significant intervention, with not inconsiderable risk” to the government. He warned it raised questions about “value for money” given “the UK domestic housing system is under acute pressure; with record levels of homelessness and wider public service pressures”.In the high court, Chamberlain said the conclusions of Rimmer’s review “fundamentally undermine the evidential basis” on which he and the court of appeal in separate hearings had relied to decide that the MoD superinjunction should be upheld. The dramatically reduced threat assessment meant the extraordinary legal mechanism could no longer be justified.Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceMilitarySuperinjunctionsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaInjunctionsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was beyond comprehension,” he said.“This iconic tree can never be replaced. It belonged to the people. It was a totemic symbol.”Carruthers’ barrister, Andrew Gurney, said his client would have to “bear the burden of what he had done for the rest of his life”.“He is a man of previous good character,” Gurney said. “That is gone. He will forever be linked to this act. He will have to carry this as some form of personal penance.”Gurney acknowledged people wanted to know why the tree had been felled, but said: “Unfortunately it is no more than drunken stupidity. It is something he will regret for the rest of his life.”At the sentencing Wright urged the court to reject the idea that either man was intoxicated.“The court can be sure they were sober and prepared to do what they did,” he said, with the felling requiring a “high degree of planning and premeditation”.Wright added: “This was an expedition which required significant planning in terms of taking a vehicle, driving for about 40 minutes to a car park, taking with them appropriate specialist equipment, carrying the equipment for about 20 minutes’ walk in each direction.“The felling was carried out in a deliberate, professional way.”Christopher Knox, defence barrister for Graham, said his client had been remanded in custody before the trial for “his own sake” after attempting to take his own life.Knox described Graham, who owned a groundwork business, as a “troubled man” who had a much more positive side to him than what was being seen in court.“This is a man who was making a living with a decent business, a proper business,” he said.He said Graham’s home had been damaged since his arrest and he had received hate mail.The judge said the felling caused widespread distress.She told them: “You revelled in the coverage, taking pride in what you have done, knowing you were responsible for the crime so many people were talking about.“Whether that was the sole explanation for what you did, I do not know, however I know you are both equally culpable.”Kim McGuinness, the metro mayor for north-eastEngland, said she hoped the pair now realised the seriousness of their actions.“I’m glad to finally see justice being done, but the sentence could never reflect the devastation we all still feel for the loss of our beloved Sycamore Gap tree,” she said.The public gallery was packed for the sentencing and included 78-year-old Sheila Hillman, who had travelled up with her husband John, 84, from Wolverhampton.Originally from Newcastle, she said she was “incensed and heartbroken” by the felling and wanted to see justice being done.But she thought the sentences were too short and still did not understand why the pair had done it. “There’s plenty of trees in Cumbria for them to cut down.”Explore more on these topicsCrimeNorthumberlandEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

The legal team at Lewis Silkin that investigated the allegations relating to Gregg Wallace also substantiated an accusation of highly offensive racist language against John Torode which occurred in 2018.Recent ‘tough period’ is not the real existential threat facing the BBCRead more“This matter has been formally discussed with John Torode by Banijay UK, and whilst we note that John says he does not recall the incident, Lewis Silkin have upheld the very serious complaint. Banijay UK and theBBCare agreed that we will not renew his contract on MasterChef.”A BBC spokesperson said the allegation against Torode “involves an extremely offensive racist term being used in the workplace”, which was “investigated and substantiated” by the independent investigation led by Lewis Silkin.They added: “John Torode denies the allegation. He has stated he has no recollection of the alleged incident and does not believe that it happened. He also says that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment.“The BBC takes this upheld finding extremely seriously. We will not tolerate racist language of any kind and, as we have already said, we told Banijay UK, the makers of MasterChef, that action must be taken. John Torode’s contract on MasterChef will not be renewed.”In a statement on Instagram on Tuesday, Torode said: “Although I haven’t heard from anyone at the BBC or Banijay, I am seeing and reading that I’ve been ‘sacked’ from MasterChef and I repeat that I have no recollection of what I’m accused of. The enquiry could not even state the date or year of when I am meant to have said something wrong.“I’d hoped that I’d have some say in my exit from a show I’ve worked on since its relaunch in 2005, but events in last few seem to have prevented that.”He added: “Personally I have loved every minute working on MasterChef, but it’s time to pass the cutlery to someone else. For whoever takes over, love it as I have.”The report on Wallace, commissioned by Banijay UK, found that 45 out of 83 allegations against him were substantiated, alongside two standalone allegations made against other people.Wallace, 60, was sacked last week from MasterChef before the release of the report, which included one allegation of “unwelcome physical contact” that was upheld. He said he was “deeply sorry for any distress caused” and that he had “never set out to harm or humiliate”.MasterChef was relaunched in 2005 with Torode and Wallace as presenters. The latest development means Torode’s time at MasterChef is in effect over already as the 2025 series has already been shot and delivered to the BBC, though it has not been aired. Torode will not be contracted for any more episodes.His departure creates an even greater problem for the BBC director general, Tim Davie, over the current, unaired series of the show. He was already facing a tough decision over whether or not to air it, as Wallace features prominently throughout.The GuardianrevealedWallace appears as a judge right up until the series finale. It was only then that he stood back from the role amid allegations over his behaviour. Torode features throughout the whole series.Speaking at thelaunch of the BBC’s annual report, Davie said he had not made a decision over the series but he was mindful of the contestants who had worked hard throughout it.“One of my overwhelming concerns is that we’ve got all the amateur chefs that gave their heart and soul to this programme,” he said. “We have to reflect on that, talk to them – and I’m sure Banijay are doing that – consult them, think about the audience, and then make a call. That’s what we’re going through now.”He said there was a future for the show despite the allegations against Wallace and Torode. Production has only recently moved to new studios. “A great programme that’s well loved by audiences is much bigger than individuals,” Davie said.In an interview with BBC News on Tuesday evening, Davie said he saw the situation as an opportunity for the corporation to “reset”.He said he was not directly involved with the matter but had been told about the recommendation not to renew Torode’s contract and was “happy that the team were taking action”.Davie added: “It’s really important that we are taking this seriously. It’s a reset where we make sure that people are living up to the values we expect across the board.”Asked exactly what Torode was alleged to have said, the BBC’s director general replied: “I’m not going to give you the exact term because I think, frankly, it was serious racist term, a serious racist term, which does not get to be acceptable in any way, shape or form.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefBBCTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

The rationale for doing this is unclear, and was probably one of pragmatism and practicality, relying on medical staff to provide the additional expertise when required.“This lack of planning may have been responsible for driving the resentment felt by some resident [doctors] and potentially exposed patients to unnecessary risk.”One of her main recommendations is that PAs should not see “undifferentiated or untriaged patients”, meaning those who have not yet been diagnosed by a doctor. Leng recommended further work to establish which patients they should be able to see and to set clinical protocols that would enable PAs to diagnose patients with mild ailments.“Let’s be clear, [the role of PAs] is working well in some places, but there indeed has been some substitution and any substitution is clearly risky and confusing for patients,” she said.Leng recommended PAs should be renamed “physician assistants” and AAs “physician assistants in anaesthesia” to ensure that patients and their families are clear on whether they have been seen by a doctor. She observed that this confusion was the core concern voiced by the bereaved families she had spoken to, who believed it was a contributing factor in their loved ones’ death.She noted in her report that despite the role’s rapid expansion since it was introduced in the early 2000s, there was limited data and evidence on whether PAs were safe or unsafe. Most concerns related to PAs being the first clinician to see patients unsupervised. “Making the wrong initial diagnosis and putting patients on an inappropriate pathway can be catastrophic,” she said.The report found that “relatively few doctors felt it was appropriate for PAs to diagnose illness” and it identified disparities between the tasks PAs considered right for them to carry out and what doctors thought.Leng recommended that newly qualified PAs work in hospitals for two years before they are allowed to work in GP surgeries or mental health trusts, enabling them to start their careers where there are more training opportunities and supervision.Resident doctors’ strikes would be gift to Nigel Farage, warns Wes StreetingRead moreShe also recommended more leadership training for doctors, who shared concerns about the lack of preparation for supervision duties, and better career development for PAs and AAs. She suggested a named doctor supervise each PA, while uniforms, lanyards, badges and staff information should be standardised to “distinguish physician assistants from doctors”.Dr Tom Dolphin, the chair of the British Medical Association, said the report “laid bare the catastrophic failures in NHS leadership that have put patients at serious risk of harm”, but he argued the recommendations did not go far enough on national patient safety standards.“Prof Leng has succeeded in exposing how NHS England introduced these roles and encouraged their expansion without any robust evidence of their safety,” he said. “The report reveals inadequate national leadership, no accountability and no attempt to listen to the concerns raised by doctors, patients and coroners.“The blurring of lines between doctors and non-doctors, aided and abetted by the GMC [General Medical Council], has been an unfolding disaster for all to see, and many doctors today will be relieved to see that they were right to raise the alarm,” Dolphin said.Dr Naru Narayanan, the president of the hospital doctors’ union, the HSCA, said: “Safety concerns will continue until a properly defined national scope is established. The review acknowledges this by calling for standardised job descriptions and clinical protocols. This work needs to be fast-tracked.“Given how poorly these roles have been defined, and the fact physician assistants earn more after a couple of years of clinical training than resident doctors do after nearly a decade in medicine, it’s not surprising there’s been tension. We’ve got a shortage of medical training places and a limited supply of trainers. Additional support and time for senior doctors, as recommended by Prof Leng, are essential.”Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsHospitalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

Falconio went behind the car with Murdoch to investigate, and Lees heard a gunshot before Murdoch cable-tied her and covered her head.Leesmanaged to escapeand hide in bushland for five hours while pursued by Murdoch and his dog before flagging down a truck driver, while Falconio died from a gunshot wound to the head.Murdoch was also convicted of the attempted kidnap and assault of Lees.Falconio’s body has never been found, and Murdoch always maintained his innocence.Last month police announced a new reward of up to $500,000 for information leading to the discovery of the remains of the murdered British backpacker.View image in fullscreenMurdered backpacker Peter Falconio (right) with his girlfriend Joanne Lees during their travels around Australia in 2001.Photograph: PAMurdochwas convicted of murder and attempted kidnapping in 2005 and sentenced to life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 28 years.The murder partly inspired the 2005 Australian horror film Wolf Creek.While the high-profile trial was under way, an injunction on the release of Wolf Creek was placed by the Northern Territory court, in the belief it could influence the outcome of proceedings.The film, which centred on the kidnapping of three young backpackers in their 20s on a return from a hike in Wolf Creek national park in the Western Australian outback, said in the tagline it was “based on true events”,including Ivan Milat’s hitchhiker murders from the early 1990s and the abduction and murder of Falconio.Map showing where Peter Falconio was murdered in Australia’s outback.The NT police acting commander, Mark Grieve, told reporters in June the murder had “captured the heart of the country” when it occurred and “never gone away”.“We’ve never gone away as far as investigating it,” he said. “And it’s just something that’s captured worldwide attention.”He said despite “continued efforts” by police to pursue any viable information or leads, Falconio’s body had never been located, leading to a renewed reward approaching the 24th anniversary of his death.“The NT police still hold out hope that someone may be able to provide some vital information to assist in this search,” he said. “We think there’s still people out there that may hold some information.”Grieve said police had interviewed Murdoch in recent weeks and made “numerous approaches” over the years to no avail. Police had also been in regular contact with Falconio’s family.“He’s [Murdoch’s] not being too forthcoming in regards to engaging with police, but we will continue doing what we have to,” he said.“There may be someone out there that he’s confided in, whether or not that’s family or friends, we just don’t know.“Like any ongoing police investigation, you want to solve it, you want to try to at least bring some sliver of resolution to Peter’s family by bringing home his remains.”Murdoch’s family issued a statement on Wednesday, acknowledging his death.“To many, Bradley Murdoch is known only for the events that led to his conviction in 2005 for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio, a crime for which he has always denied responsibility from his arrest until his death,” his family said.“But to those who truly knew him, he was much more than the headlines.When given the opportunity, Brad was a devoted father, father-in-law, and proud Poppy who never missed a chance to brag about his grandchildren. He was a beloved brother, uncle, and friends.”The family said Murdoch maintained his innocence until his death.“We understand that the public perception of Bradley will always be shaped by his conviction, but our intention is simply to share the man we knew, the version of him that was rarely, if ever, seen beyond our family and close friends,” his family said.“He was deeply loved.

The move could help another 36,000 first-time buyers per year, according to the Bank of England• A permanent government-backed mortgage guarantee scheme, in which taxpayers will pick up the bill when a borrower defaults, in an effort to encourage participating banks to offer more 91-95% mortgages• A government-backed but industry-funded advertising campaign to encourage consumers to invest their cash savings in shares• Plans to allow banks to send information about “investment opportunities” to savers that have cash sitting in low interest rate accounts, encouraging them to shift money to stocks and shares• A fresh review of ringfencing rules which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis in order to protect consumer cash from a bank’s riskier activities• A review of warnings attached to investment products to ensure that people are “accurately” judging risk levels• Plans to “radically streamline” accountability rules for senior bankers and finance bosses• Reining in the powers of the Financial Ombudsman Service, which settles complaints between consumers and businesses• Cutting the rate of interest – and therefore total compensation – paid out to consumers wronged by City firms and imposing a 10-year limit for claims• A new “concierge service” to court international investors and create a one-stop-shop to promote the UK and provide tailored support to help businesses plan where to invest.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Meanwhile, lenders will be allowed to offer riskier mortgages that are worth more than 4.5 times a borrowers’ annual income, in an effort to get more first time buyers with lower salaries on the housing ladder. That is alongside a permanent government-backed mortgage guarantee scheme, in which taxpayers will pick up the bill when a borrower defaults, in an effort to encourage select banks to offer more 91-95% mortgages.There will also be a review of risk warnings attached to investment products to ensure that people are “accurately” judging risk levels. That is alongside plans to let banks send information about “investment opportunities” to savers who have cash sitting in low interest rate accounts, encouraging them to shift money to stocks and shares.The chancellor gave the greenlight on Tuesday to a new industry-funded advertising campaign to encourage consumers to invest their cash savings in stocks. The campaign is likely to be modelled on the “Tell Sid” advertising blitz which prompted the public to buy up shares in the newly privatised British Gas in 1986.However, efforts to encourage more risk taking came as the Treasury reigned in the powers of the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS), which settles complaints between consumers and businesses. Consumers will now have a 10-year limit on making claims, and from will see the rate of interest applied to compensation slashed from 8% from January.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She appeared intears in the Commonsa day later, which she later said were due to personal matters, but in the meantimespooked the financial markets.Reeves alluded to the pressures during her Mansion House speech on Tuesday. “Recently, on a visit to a school, a girl asked me – ‘what job would you do if you could do any job in the world?’ Given the events of the last few weeks, I suspect many of you would sympathise if I had said – ‘anything but chancellor.’ But I didn’t. I am proud to stand here tonight and address you for a second time at Mansion House as the chancellor of exchequer,” she said.Explore more on these topicsRachel ReevesEconomic growth (GDP)Economic policyFinancial sectorEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner described last October how he had to“crawl to the toilet”on a flight and said he had been left stuck on landed planes at least four times. In 2022 an elderly man requiring assistancefell down an escalatorat Gatwick and later died.Lady Grey-Thompson’s report warns of “a clear gap in the training and awareness of security staff in the treatment of disabled passengers and their equipment”, and it says ground staff need training to “understand the importance of equipment and the impact of damage on passengers”.It highlights widespread confusion for passengers in booking and airline policies on seats, companions and assistance dogs, or travelling with health conditions that require medical equipment such as oxygen or medication. The group also found there was limited awareness of non-visible impairments, contributing to “unintentional exclusion and undignified treatment”.They said more work was needed to address mobility aids, with many stowed in the hold and damaged, and passengers sometimes denied boarding due to battery safety requirements, causing “significant stress, inconvenience and in some cases physical harm”.Grey-Thompson said there were “tough challenges” but the scope for action was limited by the international nature of aviation, meaning following the 19 key recommendations in the report would owe more to goodwill than enforcement.The former wheelchair athlete, who has herself been left stranded on planesand trains, added: “Some of the cases of poor experiences hit the media headlines but the reality is most do not.”According to data from the Civil Aviation Authority, 5.5 million passengers requested assistance at a UK airport in 2024, approximately 1.9% of all passengers – a proportion 40% greater than just before the pandemic, and double that in 2010.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “Everyone should be able to travel with dignity and be respected at every stage of their journeys, including disabled passengers. That’s why we established this group in November last year, and I welcome this report’s findings which will clear the runway for greater accessibility in aviation. I know industry is working hard to make services more inclusive for all and I look forward to seeing these proposals becoming a reality.”Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “As demand for assistance services continues to increase, airlines remain committed to removing barriers so that flying is accessible to all.”Karen Dee, the chief executive of AirportsUK, said: “The recommendations in this report will help build on the work already being done by airports and the wider sector to ensure air travel is accessible to all.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportDisabilityAirline industryTanni Grey-ThompsonnewsShareReuse this content"

The appeal by the ITIA is therefore upheld and the decision rendered by the independent tribunal is set aside.”Moore had previously said she felt her reputation, ranking and livelihood was “slowly trickling away” for 19 months during her initial suspension.The 32-year-old had also filed a cross-appeal at Cas “seeking to dismiss the ITIA appeal, dismiss the nandrolone result in the ADRV or alternatively confirm that she bears no fault or negligence”.However, Cas said the cross-appeal was declared inadmissible and her four-year period of ineligibility would start from Tuesday, with credit for any provisional suspension that has already been served.“Our bar for appealing a first-instance decision is high, and the decision is not taken lightly,” the ITIA’s chief executive, Karen Moorhouse, said in a statement.“In this case, our independent scientific advice was that the player did not adequately explain the high level of nandrolone present in their sample. Today’s ruling is consistent with this position.”Moore is ranked 187th in the world in doubles and No 864 in singles – 11th in Britain in doubles and No 27 in singles. In recent times, she has been taking part on the ITF World Tennis and WTA 125 tours, the rungs below elite level. She is also a former Billie Jean King Cup team member, and in February 2022 – five months before her provisional suspension – Moore became Britain’s No 1-ranked women’s doubles player for the first time. She competed in doubles at this year’s Australian Open, losing alongside Austria’s Julia Grabher in the first round.In a 2019 tournament in Sunderland, Moore made headlines afterstaging an astonishing comebackfrom 0-6, 0-5 and 30-40 down to beat France’s Jessika Ponchet.Explore more on these topicsTennisDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

Conservative allies of the president have since criticized him and the attorney general, Pam Bondi, for what they see as opaque handling of a case that Trump campaigned on getting to the bottom of.“It’s a very delicate subject, but we should put everything out there and let the people decide it,” Johnson told Benny Johnson, a rightwing podcaster, in an interview released on Tuesday.“I agree with the sentiment that we need to put it out there.”Referring to a comment Bondi made to Fox News this year that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review”, Johnson said: “She needs to come forward and explain that to everybody.“We need the DoJ focusing on the major priorities. So let’s get this thing resolved,” the speaker added.Earlier in the day, Republicansvoted downan attempt by Democrats to insert language into legislation that would require files related to the Epstein case to be made public. But the minority party is determined to keep the issue alive, and Democrats on the House judiciary committeehave demandedthat its Republican chair, Trump ally Jim Jordan, hold a hearing with Bondi and her deputy as well as the leaders of the FBI to answer questions about Epstein.Trump has sought to quell the furorthat has eruptedwithin his Maga base over the justice department’s conclusion. Over the weekend, he wrote on Truth Social: “One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it’s the ‘HOTTEST’ Country anywhere in the World. Let’s keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.”As he departed the White House for Pittsburgh earlier on Tuesday, Trump defended Bondi, but hinted that more documents could be forthcoming. “She’s handled it very well, and it’s going to be up to her. Whatever she thinks is credible, she should release,” he said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We’ll get back to you on anything else. I haven’t seen all of his statements today.”At a press conference earlier on drug enforcement, Bondi had refused to answer questions about Epstein.“Today is about fentanyl overdoses throughout our country and people who have lost loved ones to fentanyl,” she said. “That’s the message that we’re here to send today.

Here’s what happened when I tried to make new friends in my 30sRead moreThis venue is one of Seoul’s “mind convenience stores”, places where residents struggling with loneliness can sit in comfort, enjoy a simple meal, watch a film, or simply spend time in company. People don’t have to talk. The idea is that even passive interactions can help combat the city’s loneliness epidemic. Counsellors are available for those ready for deeper support.View image in fullscreenEom Mi-hui says the centre makes heading out of the house seem easier.Photograph: Raphael RashidIn Seoul, home to nearly 10 million people, single-person households have surged from 16% to nearly 40% of all homes in just over two decades. A 2022 Seoul Institute survey found that 62% of single-person households report experiencing loneliness, while city estimates suggest 130,000 young people suffer from social isolation.Nationwide, more than 3,600 “lonely deaths” – people who die alone and remain undiscovered for extended periods – were recorded in 2023.Late last year, Mayor Oh Se-hoon launched his “Seoul without loneliness” initiative, a five-year programme investing451.3bn won(£242m) to tackle the issue,stating that“low happiness levels, high suicide rates and depression are all related to loneliness”.‘We needed to address loneliness itself’Eom, who lives alone and has struggled with mental health difficulties, discovered the centre through a district newsletter. “When you’re feeling low, staying at home just makes things worse,” she says.“There’s really nowhere to go, and just putting on shoes can be hard. But when there’s a place like this, I think, ‘I’ll go there’, and coming out seems easier.”The Dongdaemun branch is one of four pilot sites that opened in March.The “convenience store” concept deliberately sidesteps stigma while drawing on a touchstone of Korean culture.Pyeonuijeomare neighbourhood fixtures where people casually drop in throughout the day to buy snacks or a drink.View image in fullscreenThe Dongdaemun ‘mind convenience store’ has a place to prepare instant noodles.Photograph: Raphael RashidThis familiarity makes the space in Dongdaemun feel approachable. As Eom puts it: “It’s like a mix of a cafe and convenience store.”“The loneliness policies we previously had in our country were for people in isolated states who were at a crisis point,” says Kim Se-heon from Seoul’s new anti-loneliness department. “But we realised we needed to address loneliness itself – that is, the subjective emotional state that exists before isolation and withdrawal.”View image in fullscreenThose who visit the centres can watch a film or just spend time in quiet company.Photograph: Raphael RashidAlongside the convenience stores, the city has launched other programmes, including a 24-hour loneliness hotline in April. By early July, the service had received more than 10,000 calls, surpassing its annual target of 3,000. Nearly 6,000 were people calling simply because they felt lonely and needed to talk, with 63% being middle-aged, 31% young adults, and just 5% seniors.A place to belongAt the Dongdaemun site, visitors complete a short five-question loneliness assessment before using the facilities. They can prepare instant noodles, with meal frequency depending on their assessed isolation level.Lee Won-tae, 51, says the centre has quickly become part of his daily routine. New to the area and still building connections, he visits almost every day as part of a walking routine due to trouble with his legs.“I don’t have many close friends yet,” he says. “I walk a lot, but when I go too far, it gets difficult. I come here, take a break, then keep going.”Like Eom, he doesn’t seek intense socialisation. “Just being able to rest in a place like this feels more right for me.”View image in fullscreenYoo Dong-heon, who oversees operations at the Dongdaemun Mind Convenience Store, walks through the brief loneliness assessment.Photograph: Raphael RashidYoo Dong-heon, the social worker who manages the Dongdaemun centre and provides counselling to visitors, says demand has exceeded all expectations with a steady increase in daily users.“People come not just from other districts in Seoul but from cities outside the capital, including Gimpo, Uijeongbu and even Ansan,” he says.“This morning, someone came who had attempted suicide multiple times, with wounds still visible on their hands,” he says. “For people like that, we immediately connect them to welfare services.”Peer supportAs a volunteer “healing activity counsellor” at the centre, Lee In-sook doesn’t offer quick fixes but perhaps something more valuable: the knowledge that someone else has walked this path.Ten years ago, her marriage ended after more than two decades. With two children to raise and no financial support, she spiralled into despair.“I became powerless and didn’t want to do anything,” she recalls. “But I had children to raise, so I had to pull myself together.”View image in fullscreenVolunteer counsellor Lee In-sook uses her own experience of overcoming isolation to guide others at the Dongdaemun centre.Photograph: Raphael RashidHer recovery was long and hard-won, but now, she uses that experience to guide others.“Young people worry about jobs and the future. Middle-aged people face economic difficulties andforced retirement. Older people struggle with poverty and health issues.”Now working at the centre once a week, her approach is built on patience. “Some people come here and won’t talk to strangers at first. That’s normal. But gradually, as they get familiar with the space, they start to feel comfortable sharing.”For her, the centre represents something that formal services often miss: genuine human connection.“That’s something money can’t buy.”Explore more on these topicsLonelinessSouth KoreaAsia PacificMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is worried sick by the growing campaign to evict van-dwellers like him from historic parkland in the wealthy north-west ofBristol.“I’m not in the greatest headspace today … I wouldn’t have anywhere to go [if I was evicted] … this is my home,” he said in the gloomy interior. “I just wish there was more kindness.”Last week, residents from the neighbourhoods surrounding the Bristol Downs, where house prices and average incomes are among the highest in the city, lobbied the Green-led council to remove the 60 to 100 vans and caravans in the park.There are about 650 live-in vehicles across Bristol, which has been dubbed the van-dwelling capital of the UK. The number of vehicles used as homes has quadrupled over the past five years, with the council estimating that there were only 150 such vehicles in 2019.Other van-dwelling hotspots include Brighton, Falmouth and Glastonbury. National numbers are hard to gauge as few councils count vehicle-dwellers. But people are thought to be living in vans and caravans in every city in the UK. Torbay last year used private enforcement officers tocrack downon van-dwelling encampments.View image in fullscreenLee James, a self-employed handyman, fears that he and other van-dwellers will be moved on from the Downs.Photograph: Tom Wall/The GuardianThe issue is becoming increasingly divisive in Bristol. Residents have formed a “Protect the Downs” action group and marched through the park. The group addressed a Bristol city council meeting on Tuesday 8 July after more than 8,000 people signed a petition calling on councillors to “remove van-dwelling encampments”.Tony Nelson, the group’s chair, told a packed public gallery that antisocial behaviour, including defecation in bushes, fighting, assaults, drug dealing and flashing had become a daily occurrence. He even claimed a child was nearly blinded after coming into contact with human excrement. “This is no longer a park. It is a pit of antisocial behaviour,” he said.Nelson, who is a former RAF officer, urged the council to concentrate van-dwellers on unused sites elsewhere in the city. “We are asking for basic, reasonable measures, enforce the rules that already exist, identify those eligible for support, remove the illegal encampments and restore safety and dignity for our public spaces,” he said.The council is drafting a new van-dwelling policy, which will be subject to consultation in September. Barry Parsons, the Green chair of the housing committee, told the residents the new approach would support the wellbeing of settled communities and van-dwellers.View image in fullscreenTony Nelson, the chair of the “Protect the Downs” group, with other members, who say that the caravans and vans have become a hub of antisocial behaviour.Photograph: The GuardianJames, 45, however, fears that they will be moved on. He has been parked up on the downs since becoming homeless five months ago. He sought help from the council and local charities because he could not afford to rent a room in a shared house, which costs on average more than £850 a month in Bristol. But James, who is a self-employed handyman, said he was told he did not stand a chance of being rehoused.“None of what [the campaigners] say about us is true. They lump us all together,” said James, who struggles with a range of mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. “I try not to think about [their campaign] too much because it is upsetting.”The residents’ group accepts that there are some vulnerable, homeless people living in vehicles, but claims it is a lifestyle choice for the “vast majority” of van-dwellers. “The few vulnerable people are outweighed massively by the people who are choosing to live [on the downs],” said Nelson. He added that those priced out of the city should move to towns with lower rents, such as Newport in Wales: “You cannot remove people’s rights to access a family park because you can’t afford a mansion in Clifton.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dog, fox and cat faeces carry worm eggs thatcan cause blindness. Police figures show there has been a 5.7% decrease in recorded crime in the ward covering most of the Downs over the past 12 months.People live in vehicles for a range of often overlapping reasons. Some van-dwellers cannot afford high rents, while others resent giving most of their meagre income to landlords. Some are escaping street homelessness. Physical and mental health problems are common. Some prefer life on the road.Research published by the council last year showed the single largest reason to live in a vehicle is the inability to find or afford anywhere else to stay. There are more than 21,000 people waiting for social housing in Bristol and more than 1,600 households in temporary accommodation.View image in fullscreenAmy Dickson, who works three jobs, including cleaning and teaching yoga, says the hate those living in their van receive is awful.Photograph: Tom Wall/The GuardianAmy Dickson, 35, has been living on the downs since last year. She moved into a van after she was evicted from a string of rentals in the city: “I’ve always been in minimum wage jobs. My family don’t have any money. I can’t get a guarantor. I just can’t afford to rent any more.”Dickson works three jobs, including cleaning and teaching yoga. She is unsettled by the campaign to remove the close-knit communities that have sprung up in the park. “We’ve all parked together and it is really nice,” she said. “It is awful to receive so much hate.” She scoffs at the suggestion she could move to another city. “We have jobs here … that is talking out of total privilege. It is so ignorant.”The council has pledged to set up 250 temporary pitches on land set aside for development by the end of the year. Parsons said enforcement remained an option, but it was pointless to chase people from one part of the city to another. He accepted that the planned extra spaces could only accommodate a minority of van-dwellers. “Cracking down on one location … in the absence of better alternatives, just means people will move somewhere else.” he said. “People living in vehicles are fellow residents of Bristol and we have just as much responsibility to support them as anybody else.”Explore more on these topicsHousingBristolEnglandCommunitiesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I am talking, of course, about Thanos fromSquid Game.For some, Thanos – a purple-haired Konglish-spewing drug-addicted rapper played by the Korean performer T.O.P – was the standout actor of the entire year, in any genre or format. But not only was this a bad result for Thanos, it was a bad result forSquid Gamealtogether. A show that comprehensively did the numbers for Netflix found itself being locked out of all categories. Still, at least it finds itself in decent company; Black Doves, Netflix’s other wildly entertaining genre series, also found itself snubbed. As was The Handmaid’s Tale, which is admittedly a little less surprising, given the amount of heat it has lost in the years since it debuted.While we’re on snubs, you have to feel sorry for Patrick Schwarzenegger. Pretty much everyone who showed their face onThe White Lotusthis year found themselves nominated as a supporting performer. And yet Schwarzenegger, who arguably went on the most dramatic emotional arc of the entire season, was left off the list. This is genuinely very sad, since he was perhaps the biggest find of the show this year.Emmy nominations 2025: Severance leads while Adolescence makes impressive showingRead moreWhile we’re here,Renée Zellwegerdidn’t get nominated for Bridget Jones (which was released as a TV movie in the States), and I would have liked to see something for Imogen Faith Reid. If you haven’t seen Good American Family, it’s worth it for her performance alone. Her role required some incredible modulation – she’s 28, yet for reasons too convoluted to explain, had to play a character who was simultaneously seven and 21 – and for sheer complication deserved a nomination at the very least.We should also probably pour one out for The Four Seasons and Poker Face. The former had a stacked cast, and yet Colman Domingo was the only nominated performer. And the latter, despite being a tremendous amount of fun, didn’t get anything major at all. True, Cynthia Erivo was deservedly nominated for her incredibly showy guest spot as seven different credited characters, but Natasha Lyonne – whose central performance holds the entire show together – was snubbed. Similarly, the show wasn’t nominated for best comedy. That said, since Poker Face is ostensibly a comedy but actually a murder mystery, this could be down to genre confusion.View image in fullscreenNatasha Lyonne in Poker Face.Photograph: Sarah Shatz/APSpeaking of which, The Bear was nominated an awful lot in the comedy categories again. However, let’s not hold out too much hope for it. After all,backlashover whether it deserved to qualify as a comedy meant that it lost to Hacks last year. And this year it faces stiff competition from The Studio which, like Hacks, will curry favour with voters because it’s about show business. However, unlike Hacks, it is consistently funny and legitimately ambitious. In total, The Studio received 23 nominations across the board. If you’re involved in any other comedy show this year, it might be a good idea to stay at home come Emmy night.In all honesty, the same probably goes for the limited series categories and Adolescence. Netflix’s virtuoso one-shot wonder is nominated for basically everything it qualified for, and surely Owen Cooper is destined to become the youngest ever winner in his category.We haven’t mentioned Severance, which with 27 nominations has the most of any show this year, purely because everyone who was nominated was expected to be nominated. This is with one possible exception. A lot of the online prediction articles failed to mention Patricia Arquette. The fact that she was nominated for best supporting actress shouldn’t be a surprise – the woman’s ability to turn from eccentric to volcanic on a dime remains unparalleled – but within the context of snubs she absolutely deserves her place.Finally there are the anti-snubs; the nominees who probably didn’t deserve to be there but were anyway. In truth, this year is essentially limited to Pedro Pascal, who found himself being nominated for best actor in a drama series. If you haven’t seen The Last of Us look away now, but it’s hard to fathom why Pascal was nominated in this particular category. Was he good? Yes, he was great. But he was also killed before the end of the second episode, which in terms of screen time puts him somewhere between a supporting actor and a guest star. Is it too late to swap him with Thanos?Explore more on these topicsEmmysAwards and prizesTelevisionSquid GameThe White LotusfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The flashbacks are perfectLucy ManganTue 15 Jul 2025 17.00 EDTShareAfew questions before we begin. Did you come of age in or around 1989? Do you look back on your teenage years with fondness or horror? Did you have a great, formative love during the above? Did you let him/her go and never even do a cursory online search as to their whereabouts in the intervening decades?Did I just startle you by referring to the intervening decades between 1989 and now? Because that’s what there are. I know. I had to check, too.How great is your tolerance for the depiction of young love on screen now that you are past youth yourself? Will you sit on the sofa wreathed in smiles and yearning or will you put a boot through the telly?How well-disposed do you feel to the idea of a Sally Rooney-esque endeavour aged up to cover those who came of age in or around 1989 and how their lives have played out since? This is important. I’m talking contemplative scenes, wry smiles at memories, melancholic suffusion, mood above action.Have you read and enjoyed the acclaimed novel Mix Tape by Jane Sanderson?Your answers to the above will help determine how much you enjoy Mix Tape, an adaptation by Jo Spain of Sanderson’s novel. The four-part, double-timelined drama tells the story of freelance music journalist Dan O’Toole (Jim Sturgess) and author Alison Connor (Teresa Palmer), who grew up as teenagers in Sheffield and were each other’s first loves. Their younger selves are played (excellently) by newcomer Rory Walton-Smith and Florence Hunt respectively. Their scenes capture all the excitement and novelty, the heart-stopping importance of every minute spent together that teenagers in love conjure for themselves. Dan’s mother (Helen Behan) has some misgivings – she would rather he were playing the field a bit – but his father (Mark O’Halloran) is a romantic and is happy just to give his boy a little life advice along the way, especially as Alison is almost as fond of his racing pigeons as he is.View image in fullscreenExcellent … young Alison (Florence Hunt) and young Daniel (Rory Walton-Smith) in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/Subotica/Leanne SullivanDan only wishes that Alison would let him meet her parents. Or even tell him where she lives and let him walk her home. Unfortunately, Alison’s dad is long gone, her mother is an alcoholic and her boyfriend is a deeply unlovely piece of work called Martin (Jonathan Harden), whose malevolent presence suggests nothing but bad things are coming for the family. So it turns out, though the languorous pacing of Mix Tape, which is slightly too pleased with itself, means that it takes too long to get there.Things are even slower in the present as we wait for Dan and Alison’s paths to cross again. When Alison’s new book is released, Dan sends her – hesitantly – a friend request online. She – hesitantly – accepts it. For a long time – a long time – they communicate by sending Spotify links to each other, of songs that accompanied pivotal moments in their lives and relationship. Dan is now married to Katja (Sara Soulié), one of those screen wives who exist merely to irritate. She insists that now (their only child has just departed for university) is the time for them to start travelling together, regardless of the fact that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Dan to collaborate with a music legend on his memoir is on the horizon. Women, eh!Alison is married to a successful surgeon (one day I want the story of an unsuccessful surgeon – one who’s scraping by, his mortality rates just good enough to keep him in gainful employment but nothing to write home about) and trying to keep him from bouncing their daughter, Stella (Julia Savage), into a termination that she may not want. So neither adult life is perfect. Does this mean they should meet up and see what spark remains from 1989? Is the grass always greener on the path not taken? Why did they break up? Did he find out where she lived, and about her mum and Martin? Should they just hurry up and shag? Is your own life worthless because you do not have an intense, formative teenage romance to look back on that has shaped and haunted you in ways known and unknown ever since?

But are there hidden risks?Giving up alcohol changed my life, but I wanted to know whether cannabis cocktails were too good to be trueArwa MahdawiTue 15 Jul 2025 12.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 17.21 EDTShareMark Zuckerberg, a billionaire,has saidhe avoids substances like caffeine because he likes “rawdogging” reality. I, on the other hand, do not. I mean, have you seen reality lately?For most of my adult life, alcohol has been my preferred way to take the edge off. But, like a lot of other people, I got older and realized regular drinking was not doing me any favours. Last year, I experimented with “intermittent sobriety”, taking months off here and there. It helped, but it was also easy to slip back into bad habits.This year, I’ve jumped on theCalifornia-soberbandwagon, trading booze for the hemp-derived THC drinks that are rapidly growing in popularity. (THC stands for tetrahydrocannabinol, which is the psychoactive component of cannabis.) I’ve never had any interest in smokable or edible THC in the past – as a green card holder, I reckon I should make that very clear to any immigration officers reading. But these new drinks have been a game-changer. The dosage is clearly marked and the effects are felt almost as quickly as alcohol thanks to a technology callednanoemulsification, which turns the THC into tiny water-soluble droplets that are more rapidly absorbed by the body than traditional edibles.Having a 5mg THC seltzer or infused cocktail in the evening scratches the “I need to unwind” itch for me with seemingly no short-term negative effects, like a hangover. While I find THC doesn’t deliver quite the dopamine rush alcohol does, low doses give me a relaxing warm fuzz, and have been great for my anxiety. Most importantly, it’s helped me kick the alcohol habit; I’ve never felt healthier.Apart from the hefty price tag (one can costs $5-$7), these drinks feel a little too good to be true. So are they?The short answer is: sort of. First, their legality is a little … hazy. Marijuana is still a controlled substance under federal law in the US, although some states have legalized it for recreational and/or medicinal purposes. But under the 2018 Farm Bill, any cannabis plant with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight is considered hemp and is no longer a controlled substance. (No such loophole exists in the UK, where cannabis is illegal for recreational use.)This loophole has birthed a booming market: THC beverages are expected to be a $4bn industry by 2028, according toEuromonitor International. (Even comedian Seth Rogen has jumped in with his own line of drinks,called Houseplant.) Depending on the state, you might find these drinks in grocery or liquor stores. Some brands sell online, but whilehemp-derived THC is federally legal, this is a grey area, and some states have imposed restrictions on products containing it.Whether birthing a THC product industry was an intention of the Farm Bill is unclear. “Some independent attorneys argue it was,” says Hilary Bricken, a lawyer who specializes in cannabis. “Others say absolutely not: the bill was meant to promote things like textiles, not consumer-facing drugs. But ultimately, it’s enforcement, or the lack of it, that’s allowed this market to develop the way it has.”California sober: what does it mean and is it good for you?Read more“There’s no federal regulation unless a particular state steps in,” says Bricken. “Some states, like Minnesota, regulate these products. Others, like California, have banned them entirely.” (In California, these unregulated hemp-derived THC products are banned, but THC products that comply with the state’s cannabis regulations canlegally be sold at cannabis dispensaries.)But there are other risks to be aware of. “Practices vary wildly between operators,” says Bricken. “For the consumer, it’s hard to tell what’s actually in the drink. There’s no federal standard, so it’s essentially dealer’s choice on the operator side. While the original hemp might have tested under the 0.3% THC threshold, post-harvest it can be transformed in ways that technically still comply with federal law. But many believe that most of what’s being sold is synthetically derived, and potentially contains toxic compounds.”Even in a best-case scenario where you’re buying from a responsible operator, THC isn’t as harmless as many believe. Arecent studyled by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found people who regularly used marijuana in either smokable or edible form had reduced blood vessel function comparable to tobacco smokers. This is associated with a greater risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular issues.“We saw a 42% reduction in vascular function in marijuana smokers and 56% in THC edible users,” said lead study authorLeila Mohammadi. “The effect was dose-dependent: the more someone used per week, the worse their vascular function.” Worryingly, even relatively small doses of 2.5mg multiple times a week seemed to have a harmful effect. The study didn’t look at drinkable THC; a single can typically contains 2.5-10mg, though some products have considerably more. But Mohammadi notesthere’s no reason to think drinkable products would be significantlydifferent.THC can also affect cognitive function, especially in adolescents, whoseendocannabinoid systems– which interact with cannabinoids like THC and regulate critical bodily functions – are still developing. The long-term effects are complex, and research is ongoing, but one clearly documented risk of THC use in adolescence is in how the body handles fat, says Daniele Piomelli, a neuroscientist and leading cannabis researcher at the University of California at Irvine.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’“In adolescents who use cannabis heavily, the fat in their bodies becomes dysfunctional. Normally, during times of stress or intense cognitive effort, the brain uses glucose for energy but can also tap into energy derived from fat. But frequent cannabis users often lose that ability,” notes Piomelli. That means they might find concentrating more difficult.“There’s a large body of evidence suggesting a link – not necessarily causation, but a strong association – between cannabis use in adolescence and increased risk of psychosis,” says Piomelli. And while these drinks are only supposed to be consumed by people over 21, adolescence for men is longer than women and “really continues until 25 or 26”.Even if you’re an old crone like me, there are risks. A low-dosage THC drink now and again probably won’t do much harm, but it’s easy to accidentally go overboard. “The real problem is that, like many things in the US, we don’t do moderation well,” says Piomelli. “Some of these seltzers now contain up to 100mg of THC. That’s enough to send even an experienced user to the hospital if they’re not expecting it. Not because THC is deadly – you can’t overdose fatally on THC, even if you tried. But the experience can be incredibly unpleasant and disorienting, and recovery might take a couple of days.”It doesn’t help that the category is bringing in lots of inexperienced THC users, and dosage guidelines and risks often aren’t made particularly clear.In states like New Jersey, you can find THC-infused beverages containing 25mg of THC (not a negligible amount!) in the grocery store, stocked next to seltzers and energy drinks. You can very easily imagine a scenario where someone downs one of these without knowing exactly what they’re getting themselves into.If you are intrigued by these beverages, experts say education and a slow start are critical. Start with 2.5mg or less and work your way up incrementally. While it’s hard to generalize about effects, Piomelli notes that “for a person in their 20s to 40s, weighing anywhere from 50-80kg (110-175lbs), 10-20mg of THC per serving would be enough to produce a noticeable buzz – definitely not enough to cause a full-blown high for someone who isn’t a regular user.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Are you looking for mild relaxation or trying to manage chronic pain? Your intention should guide your choice of product.”Many of these THC drinks also include CBD, which is one of the main non-intoxicating components of cannabis, and alters the experience. “Some research suggests CBD can mitigate some of THC’s negative effects, like anxiety or paranoia,” Gruber explains.No matter the ratio, the dose of THC is what’s really important. “THC at low doses is often anxiolytic: it can reduce anxiety and make people feel more relaxed,” says Gruber. “But at higher doses, it becomes anxiogenic – it can actually cause anxiety. The problem is, what counts as a ‘low dose’ varies widely from person to person.”The wellness drink for sober people that some say they can’t stop drinkingRead moreTHC may have its risks but, just asking for a friend: is going California-sober still healthier than drinking alcohol? After all, alcohol heightens the risks of at leastseven types of cancerand the World Health Organization has said no level of consumption is safe.Unfortunately, scientists don’t give black-and-white statements that affirm your life choices; they qualify things. And the answer to whether going California-sober is a harm-reduction strategy is: it depends.“It really depends on the person,” says Ziva Cooper, director of the University of California at Los Angeles Center forCannabisand Cannabinoids. Factors like someone’s age, individual vulnerability and what they’re doing while intoxicated can influence the effects, as can frequency and dose of ingestion. “Some people may have a family history of psychosis or mood disorders,” says Cooper. “Others may be using very high doses regularly.” But there are risks either way: “Some are associated with frequent use, and others with being a novice user. One unexpected risk we’re now seeing is cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome – basically, heavy users presenting to the ER with severe nausea and vomiting. That was completely off the radar a few years ago.”Cooper notes that scientific research is still lagging behind the market. “We need better data, more funding and more research, especially because half the adult population is using cannabis products in some form now,” she says.Many THC startups, and their new users, are on a high, but they might be headed for a comedown. “A lot of these hemp companies are acting like they’re too big to fail, like they can’t be touched,” says Bricken. “Maybe that’ll end up being true. But right now, nobody really knows how it will play out.” Hemp-derived THC is receiving a lot more scrutiny, and increased regulation – even possible prohibition – is on the horizon.Last month, a key US House committee approveda spending bill, championed by the representative Andy Harris, a long-term prohibitionist, that walks back the legal definition of hemp. The bill still has to pass the House and Senate. But if it does get signed into law, the loophole these hemp-derived THC drink companies rely on will close, and they will have to stop operating in their current form.Separately, Congress generally renews the Farm Bill, a mammoth piece of legislation that funds major agriculture and food programs in the US, every five years. The current bill, which contains the hemp loophole, expired in October 2023 and Congress has since passed two one-year extensions. While they could potentially extend for another year, there’s a strong possibility that a new version will be debated later this year. When this happens, Bricken thinks, we’ll see the hemp-derived THC loophole either get closed or distilled into some kind of regulatory framework.“Hemp companies are scrambling to gain ground before anything changes,” notes Bricken. “They’re surprisingly well-organized from a lobbying perspective, and some factions in the alcohol industry support them. But prohibitionist groups are also lobbying hard.”Xander Shepherd, co-founder of THC aperitif brand Artet (his 86-year-old grandmother’s art adorns the bottles), says that flux in this sector is nothing new: “I’ve almost become numb to the constant changes, whether it’s the Farm Bill or state-level regulations. I try to remind myself it’s kind of like two steps forward, one step back. But overall, I really believe the industry is moving in the right direction.”While all of this is playing out, I’m going to continue sipping legal THC drinks – albeit with a little more caution than before. Going California-sober is clearly not the healthiest choice in the world but, speaking from a purely personal level, the highs currently outweigh the lows.Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyCannabisFood & drink industryAlcoholFoodHealthDrugsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was 2008, pre-Hardy and Hiddleston, post-Bale and Grant;Jim Sturgesswas a rising star and the latest handsome young Brit to break Hollywood. Having landed the lead role in casino thriller 21, Sturgess needed a love interest: cue a slew of chemistry tests with a roll call of beautiful young women, a process Sturgess remembers now as “the most exposed blind date you could ever possibly put yourself through, with five producers watching you from afar”.Kate Bosworth got the role, but one actor lingered in Sturgess’s mind: an effervescent Australian calledTeresa Palmer. “When you do those chemistry tests, they put you through it, so we spent the whole day together,” Sturgess says. “I was really hoping she was going to get the part, because we got on really well. She’s Australian, I’m English, and we were both in Hollywood going, ‘Where the hell are we?’”Palmer didn’t get the part, but Sturgess never forgot her. And, almost 20 years later, Sturgess and Palmer have been reunited – for Mix Tape, a wistful romantic drama about two people who reunite after 20 years apart.Told in four one-hour episodes (you’ll wish it was much, much longer), Mix Tape follows two teenagers, Dan and Alison, as they woo each other with letters and mix tapes in 1980s Sheffield (which means we get some amazing needle drops: the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Cure, Joy Division). Guileless young Dan (Rory Walton-Smith) is completely smitten, but Alison (Florence Hunt) is guarded, desperately trying to hide her difficult family life at home. When she suddenly disappears – for reasons revealed much later – Dan is completely heartbroken.View image in fullscreen‘I never forgot her’ … Sturgess with Teresa Palmer in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/SuboticaSturgess, now 47, plays adult Dan: a music journalist who never left his home town and, despite being married, never really moved on from his first love. When he discovers Alison (Palmer) is now a bestselling author living in Sydney, he sends her a friend request online. Letters and cassettes are swapped for Facebook messages and Spotify playlists, but the feelings remain the same.Palmer tells me Sturgess is “the kindest, warmest, coolest, most effortless actor I’ve ever worked with. And that dudereallyhas great taste in music,” she adds. “He is that character – he is the real deal.” Before filming even began, Sturgess and Palmer were sending each other playlists, with Sturgess putting her on to UK rappers like Kano, Dizzee Rascal, Ocean Wisdom, Little Simz. “It was just like the show,” he says. “Twenty-odd years later, we were reconnecting.”In his 20s, Sturgess made his name as the romantic lead in the Beatles musical film Across the Universe and opposite Anne Hathaway in One Day, but he has spent the past few years in roles that require guns and running – thinkHard SunandGeostorm. But Sturgess is made for this work, with his crinkly eyed smile and soft eyes. Last year was all about “rodent boyfriends” – well, you can take yourMike Faist, because Sturgess is the OG rodent boyfriend, with a face particularly suited for yearning.“I’ve been working on my yearning,” he laughs. “I’m actually very attracted to romance stories, more so as I get older. They’re just so human – it’s literally two people navigating their feelings and their emotions, which is really beautiful and interesting.”Mix tapes were a “big, big part” of how Sturgess wooed girls. “It works!” he laughs. “A mix tape was a really big deal back then! That was why I was so attracted to young Daniel – I was that guy!” As a teenager, he was obsessed with US hip-hop and guitar bands from Northern England; he vividly recalls listening to the Stone Roses on his Walkman while delivering newspapers. “That’s what’s so beautiful about Mix Tape – it is about that period when you first fall in love, when you first hear music,” he says. “Your receptors are just so wide open and everything is so important to you. And that’s why, when people ask you what your favourite band is, you’ll probably say what your favourite band was when you were 16.”View image in fullscreenEstates of desire … Sturgess with Cara Delevingne in the spectacular box office flop London Fields.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Head Gear Films/AllstarSturgess had a hand in choosing the music used in Mix Tape and even taught Walton-Smith and Hunt how to make mix tapes on cassette: “It blew their minds. They were like, ‘This is an art form. And this is a lot of work!’” he laughs. “I was explaining to them how you couldn’t just get the music off the internet – you had to own it, all your mix tapes came from what was in your collection. They couldn’t believe it.”Director Lucy Gaffy let Sturgess in on the audition process for young Dan; they picked Walton-Smith, a complete newcomer who will be in everything soon. “There was a real gentleness to Rory that some of the other actors didn’t bring,” says Sturgess. “He’s got that natural Northern swagger and charm to him. And it was his first job! He was so wide open and desperate to learn. Beautifully inquisitive. He was brilliant. I’m really proud of what he’s done.”When Sturgess was his age, he was too afraid to ask for help: “I was dropped in at the deep end.” He never formally trained as an actor, but he got the bug as a six-year-old when he was cast in a production of Wind in the Willows. “I was not very good at school. I struggled to concentrate … I was slightly tarnished with the naughty brush. But I just took to [acting]. I still remember the sense of community, of making something together – which I still crave now.”View image in fullscreenSturgess with Anne Hathaway in One Day.Photograph: Focus Features/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhen he was cast oppositeEvan Rachel WoodinAcross the Universe, Sturgess was propelled to international stardom. “I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was just a kid from England, playing in bands – and suddenly this movie thing happened. Everything changed quite quickly. I didn’t really understand how to navigate myself through all that. I didn’t have anybody guiding me. I’d be invited to these big parties, but I would always not go. It was a bit scary, it feels a bit mad.”Over the years, he’s been in the very good (Cloud Atlas), the worthy of reappraisal (Across the Universe – “I feel like if it came out now, it might have done all right,” Sturgess muses), and the very bad (London Fields, a spectacular box office flop overshadowed by the subsequent tawdry trial between his co-stars, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard). He’s passed on some big opportunities (playing Spider-Man on Broadway) and said yes to much smaller parts that made him happy. If anything, he’s learned to focus on the experience of making something, rather than the reception: “It’s such a rollercoaster ride … If your end goal is just to have it be well received and get all the admiration that might come with that, you’re going to fall over a lot. You’re going to trip yourself up. If it is well received, that’s the icing on the cake. I don’t really read reviews. I just don’t. I’m not trying to hide from them or anything.

What is his relationship with fame now? “It is easier,” he says. “I was definitely more famous when I was younger and, sometimes, I wish I’d enjoyed it a bit more. But I shied away from fame a lot. I had it at an arm’s length. And, looking back, I think I would have got more out of it if I opened myself up to it and embraced it, if I wasn’t quite so wary of it all.” Now, he is recognised “just enough that I’m quite flattered when it happens”.These days, Sturgess is performing music under the monikerKing Curiousand his next film will be4 Kids Walk Into a Bank, alongside Liam Neeson and – you guessed it– Teresa Palmer, who plays his girlfriend again. Is this what they’re doing now, a la Fred and Ginger, Kate and Leo, Hanks and Ryan?

Seven years after our last encounter, I joined him as he prepared for battleByEmmanuel CarrèreTue 15 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 04.33 EDTShare1. At the feet of Hans EgedeNuuk, the capital of Greenland, is a small jumble of orange prefab buildings and low grey apartment blocks nestled on a stony outcrop on the edge of the ocean. There are no trees, but there’s a hill topped by the statue of Hans Egede, the Danish-Norwegian missionary who evangelised the world’s biggest island in the 18th century and which, as such, is threatened with removal by Inuit anti-colonialists. It was at his feet that I awaited the helicopters bringing back the Greenlandic prime minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, the Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, and the French president,Emmanuel Macron– referred to throughout this trip as “PR”, short forprésident de larépublique– from their excursion on the ice.I was hoping I could also get on one of those helicopters, and I thought I had it in the bag when, as the delegation was being split between the chosen ones who would accompany PR in the air and the rest, Macron shot me one of those telling winks he often gives, so unexpectedly, to those who come into his field of view. I quickly returned to my senses: there are many seats on a plane, very few in a helicopter, and this was a PR+3 event, meaning PR plus three other people, which was out of my reach. As an embedded writer travelling with the French delegation to theG7– the summit of the richest and, in theory, most democratic countries, which is being held this year in Canada – I started having a chance at about PR+6 or 7, which wasn’t too bad.While waiting for the head of state to return, the mid-level members of the French delegation found a hangar equipped with wifi to work in. They work all the time and, as a diplomatic adviser told me, don’t get jet lag because they hardly ever sleep. As for parasites like me, and the photographers who’ve got nothing to do while PR’s away, we kicked around Nuuk, perspiring in our down jackets and moon boots because we’d been told it would be below freezing while it was actually a balmy 10C (50F) out.Only a few months ago, Macron would never have got it into his head to visit Greenland. In fact, no one really cared much about Greenland untilDonald Trumplet it be known that, like Canada, it was destined to become American. There’s a “good possibility”, he said, that Greenland could be annexed “without military force”, adding: “I don’t take anything off the table.” In this context, it was what political communicators call a “strong gesture” on Macron’s part to stop in Nuuk for a few hours on his way to the G7 and address the 200-300 people who’d turned out to listen to him, his voice alternately stirring and cajoling, his words peppered with skilfully placed pauses the Greenlanders have not yet had time to grow tired of.Hating Macron is a national sport inFrance– one that I personally do not participate in. Here, on the other hand, people were crazy about him. Ten days earlier they didn’t necessarily know who he was, but on the day of his visit, Nuuk looked every bit like a hotbed of fervent Macronists. His presence brought solace, and the crowd’s enthusiasm reached its peak when, after a resounding “Qujanaq!”(“thank you” in Greenlandic), he declared first that Greenland is neither up for sale, nor up for grabs (prolonged cheers, as if he’d said“Ich bin ein Grönländer”), then that as a sign of unwavering solidarity France will open a consulate in Nuuk (somewhat less enthusiastic cheers), and finally that his helicopter trip with the two prime ministers had allowed him to observe up close the effects of global heating – to which Greenland, whose entire population lives on the narrow coastal strip of a gigantic glacier that is melting at an alarming rate, is particularly exposed.In the succession of brief speeches, the three leaders outdid one another in their use of the word “climate” – five times for Macron – but I didn’t yet have a feel for just how provocative such seemingly banal statements could be. When the speeches were done, a journalist asked PR how far his solidarity would extend if Trump invaded Greenland, and he answered with a hint of impatience that he didn’t want to waste his time speculating on questions that were not currently on the table.2. On the planeAlmost seven years earlier, in September 2017, I’d travelled on the presidential plane with Macron, whomI was profilingfor the Guardian. It was at the start of his first term in office, and everything seemed to be going well for him. We were heading to Saint Martin, an overseas territory in the Caribbean that had recently been ravaged by a hurricane, and then to Athens, where Macron gave a pivotal speech on European civilisation. In hindsight, those times seem almost carefree, when you consider that our journey to the G7 was taking place against the backdrop of war in Ukraine, the systematic destruction of Gaza, a now irreversible ecological disaster and, for the previous two days, Israeli strikes on Iran which some considered a prelude to World War III. All this made me wonder if, in another seven years, we’ll look back with nostalgia on our current calamities, so wanton and unstoppable does the chaos seem to have become.In my notes from 2017 I found these words by Macron: “If we weren’t at a tragic moment in our history, I would never have been elected. I’m not made to lead in calm weather. My predecessor [the jovial socialist François Hollande] was, but I’m made for storms.” On the plane, I showed it to him. “Well, here we are,” he said with a smile.On the domestic front it must be said that Macron did nothing to calm the storm when he decided a year ago to dissolve the National Assembly – a political electroshock that he no doubt saw as a kill or cure approach to his unpopularity, unprecedented in the history of the Fifth Republic, but which left the country if not totally ungovernable, then at least even more difficult to govern than usual, and in any case more difficult forhimto govern. But PR being PR – meaning little inclined to self-criticism – he remains convinced that history will prove him right. At most, as he admitted in his last New Year’s address, his decision had not been understood and he boresomeof theresponsibility for this misunderstanding, without saying who bore the rest.Whatever his difficulties on the home front, however, foreign policy traditionally remains the preserve of the French president, and one could reasonably argue that although he’s toast at home, Macron thrives on the international stage. “Good career move,” Gore Vidal is said to have remarked on hearing that Truman Capote had died. In the same way, the global mayhem is proving to be an exceptional career boost for Macron – given that there’s a position to be filled at the head ofEurope. In any case that’s how he sees it, and in fact, during the time I spent with him, he did seem to be in fine form. I had imagined that my second portrait of him would be very different from the first, the fall of the Roman empire after its heyday, especially as some had told me that he was now gloomy, tormented, abandoned by all, his nails bitten to the quick, wandering through the corridors of a presidential palace where decisions are no longer taken.For my part, I saw nothing so Shakespearean. He seemed relatively unchanged, apart from the fact that he’s clearly taken to pumping iron and that, in a tight-fitting black T-shirt – his outfit on the plane – he displayed some quite impressive biceps, which he wasn’t content just to display but kneaded with visible satisfaction. Otherwise he’s still cool, quick on the uptake, available, his blue eyes fixed on yours, his hand clasping yours and only letting go reluctantly, and while I’m ready to believe thatdeep down(I’m always surprised to hear him use this teenage expression, “deep down”) he’s arrogant, self-centred and not interested in anyone, on the surface at least (which, in my opinion, does not mean that it’sfake), he’s still as attentive as ever, still as much there for the person he’s talking to, still singling them out from the crowd.That’s a politician’s trait, I know: making you feel that you’re the only one who counts, that if he got on the plane it was to enjoy your company to the full, and that he knows you better than you know yourself. But he takes it to extremes, and everyone who’s had any dealings with him can tell one anecdote or another that illustrates it in an almost supernatural way. Here’s mine. The presidential plane is divided into four sections. At the front is PR’s suite, to which he alone has access. Next is a lounge where, at his bidding, a dozen people can sit at a large oval table for a work session, a drink or even a light meal. (Macron himself seems to eat nothing but pecans.) Next comes a business cabin for the inner circle, PR+18, and finally the rear of the plane, for security, logistics and journalists. I was in the PR+18 cabin and on the three-day trip I was invited to the oval table three times, where I found PR in the mood to talk about French films from yesteryear. Not the Nouvelle Vague, not Godard or Truffaut, no, but comedies and crime films by popular, heritage film-makers such as Henri Verneuil, Georges Lautner and Claude Lelouch that are rebroadcast time and again on TV. (English readers are unlikely to know them, but their unexportable British equivalents might be Nuts in May orCarry On Up the Jungle.) Macron, in any case, reeled off the dialogue, peppered with outdated slang, as ably as he cites the verses of the noblest figures of 20th-century French poetry, such as Yves Bonnefoy, Patrice de la Tour du Pin and Louis Aragon.There came a moment in this flow of cinematic and literary erudition when talk came around to the upcoming adaptation of The Wizard of the Kremlin, Giuliano da Empoli’snovelabout Putin’s eminence griseVladislav Surkov, for which I wrote the screenplay with film-maker Olivier Assayas. Jude Law plays Putin, and I took out my phone to show PR a photo of him in the role. “Not bad,” Macron said, handing me back my phone, and for a moment I got the feeling he was annoyed that Jude Law is portraying Putin and not him. But why, he asked, did I write the screenplay? Why not Giuliano? (He said “Giuliano”.) I replied that the author of a book isn’t necessarily the best person to adapt it for the cinema, he lacks distance, I myself don’t collaborate on adaptations of my books. Macron raised an eyebrow: “But you adapted Class Trip with Claude Miller, didn’t you?”Now what you have to know is that Class Trip, based on my novel of the same name, came out almost 30 years ago. I think it’s a beautiful film but it wasn’t a success, critically or commercially. If you did a survey of 10 of my friends maybe one or two would have seen it, and aside from my agent who drew up the contract, none would be able to say whether or not I collaborated on the screenplay. “No surprise there,” people say when I tell them this anecdote about PR, “he’s given notes on everyone he talks to, that’s all.” No. Or if that’s the explanation, it’s even more remarkable than the fact itself. Assuming Macron took the time to review a file on me, it would have to be 15 pages long to include a detail like that.Amazed, I asked: “How on earth do you know that?”He replied: “I sleep little but well. That leaves me time to watch films.”3. The sherpaA loan word from Himalayan mountaineering where it refers to the guides, the term has become established in international summit meetings: the sherpa prepares the terrain and accompanies the head of state. Since 2019, Emmanuel Bonne has been Macron’s sherpa and head of the Elysée’s diplomatic unit, making him a less public but far more important figure than the various foreign ministers who’ve succeeded one another from one government to the next (that’s my opinion, he’d never say so himself, of course). A career diplomat and Middle East expert, Bonne is an elegant man in his 50s with a clear, deep voice who, maintaining the direct and friendly style used around PR, says he applies the Jesuit watchwordperinde ac cadaver(“corpse-like obedience”) in his dealings with him. (At least that’s what he said to me, perhaps because he assumes that as a writer I’m familiar with Latin and Ignatius of Loyola. With others he’s more blunt and says he’s a diehard public servant.)During the second part of the trip, between Nuuk and Calgary at the foot of the Canadian Rockies, I asked Bonne to explain what was at stake at the summit, and this is what I jotted down. When President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing initiated the G7 – then the “Group of Six”, or G6 – in 1975, the countries that took part (the US, France, UK, Germany, Italy and Japan) accounted for about 75% of global GDP. Today that figure has dropped to roughly 35%. “We were the chairman of the board,” Bonne sums up. “Now, we’re not even majority shareholders.” That makes it all the more crucial for these countries, if they’re not to disappear completely from the scene, to find a solution or at least agree on a position concerning one or other of the major issues facing the planet: Ukraine, the Middle East, the environment, tariffs – it doesn’t matter which, there’s no shortage of elephants in the room. The aim of the summit, then, was to produce a joint declaration that simply expresses a political will, a direction, shared objectives.Normally this shouldn’t be too difficult, but it’s become so since Trump 2, particularly when it comes to the climate. Until now, saying that global heating is a major threat and that halting it is an absolute priority was as uncontroversial as saying that you’re against war, for peace, for reducing inequality, etc. Once that was said, you did or didn’t act on your words, but it cost nothing to proclaim them. Those days are over. As the master of the world thinks that the climate isn’t a problem, there’s no putting it on the agenda, even as a pious wish. Even the word “climate” has become taboo.View image in fullscreenMacron (second left) at G7 with – from left to right – Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni, Canadian prime minister Mark Carney, US president Donald Trump and UK prime minister Keir Starmer.Photograph: Simon Dawson/No 10 Downing StreetAware that there was little room for manoeuvre, the Canadians, who were hosting this year’s G7, decided from the outset that there would be no joint declaration and only a kind of neutral summary, with every word weighed on a scale and, as far as possible, emptied of meaning. Already faced with the cruel obligation of hosting as a guest of honour someone who has made no bones about wanting to make their country the 51st state, the Canadians were further traumatised by memories of the previous G7 summit held on their soil seven years earlier, which could not have gone worse. Trump 1 got angry and stormed out before the end, refusing to sign the joint declaration and accusing his host, Justin Trudeau, of being “weak” and “dishonest”. Terrified at the thought of something like that happening again, the Canadians were ready to kowtow. What’s more, in general it’s become an aim in itself for the six members of the club of former masters of the world to keep the damage to a minimum with the seventh. At the same time they must remind everyone they’re still here and, all the while kowtowing, they puff out their chests as best they can. Now I understand better why Macron hammered home the word “climate” with such insistence back in Nuuk.The exercise, Bonne recapped over a snack at the oval table (radishes, little salmon and cucumber sandwiches, all the pecans you can eat), is “to make ourselves heard without giving the impression that we’re mocking Trump”. Macron nonchalantly responded to this cautious plea for boldness with a scoop: “I called him yesterday morning and told him we were going to Greenland.”“And?”“And he said: ‘Great! Very good idea. Tell them I only want what’s good for them.’”Although English makes no distinction between the informaltuand the formalvous, Macron, in his dealings with Trump – or rather in his accounts of his dealings with Trump – has opted for informal language. He puts all his social skills into setting himself up as the leader of Europe in the age of Trump 2, and as someone who knows Trump well and can make shrewd and unexpected observations about his character (“He’s not touchy in the least,” he said, “and as long as you’re open to give-and-take, he’s anything but egotistical”) – in short, as someone who knows how to handle the beast. This is not untrue, and what’s more, even though Macron is still young (47), in terms of presidential longevity he’s the most senior of the leaders set to attend the G7. He belongs to the very exclusive club of those now in their second term. Bonne recalled that in one of his more expansive moments, Trump himself tapped Macron on the shoulder and said: “You’ll see, you and me, we’ll do a third.”The French constitution, like the Russian one, prohibits threeconsecutivepresidential mandates, but you can seek a third provided you’ve taken a pass for one term: that’s what Putin did when he handed over the reins to a closely watched Dmitry Medvedev for four years, and Macron is increasingly open about his intention to do the same and run for office again in 2032. This is not provided for in the US constitution, on the other hand, but Trump has already warned that that’s no reason to deprive the world of his brilliance, that a constitution is not set in stone and that patriotic lawyers are already looking for a solution.4. The RatWhen I woke up in my room at the Lodges at Canmore near Kananaskis, a tiny Alberta village popular with hikers, it was 4am. Macron was already out jogging, but I, not having done my training at the Elysée’s diplomatic unit, was wiped from jet lag. It was in this state of disorientation that I remembered the following.When his stepdaughters were little, science fiction author Philip K Dick invented a variation of Monopoly for them, aimed at making the endless buying of buildings in the game they loved a little less boring. In this variation the banker is called the Rat, and instead of merely acting as sort of referee, he has the discretionary power to change the rules of the game whenever he wants, however he pleases, without anyone being able to question his dictates. It’s a perpetual clean slate, pure dictatorship, the negation of law and order. For a game to be successful, it’s in the players’ best interests to choose the most vicious and inventive participant as the Rat. A Rat worthy of the name must know how to mete out the torment he inflicts on the players, let them believe that his arbitrary decisions follow a plan, balance cruel disappointments and fickle encouragements, tear them away from everything they’re used to in Monopoly and – without losing their interest – plunge them into chaos.When, at 8am, after passing through several checkpoints on a mountain road set against a magnificent landscape, we, PR+6 and more members of the delegation, arrived at the huge, isolated hotel – which brought to mind the Overlook Hotel in The Shining – where the summit itself was taking place, I realised that I had come all this way to witness a spectacular game of the Rat.Dressed in dark suits and ties for the men (an overwhelming majority), and sober trouser suits for the women, 1,500 of us paced back and forth from one lounge to another, through corridors lined with carpets also straight out of the Overlook Hotel. A photographer I’d palled up with made a joke: “Imagine the doors of the elevator open and you seetwoTrumps come out –twins.” We did a lot of milling around and a lot of waiting, the game for the small fry like me being to bypass the various security guards and go through doors that were, in theory, closed to the likes of us. This is how, by literally clinging to Emmanuel Bonne, I gained access to the large salon (PR+4) where the six normal leaders were waiting for the seventh to descend from his Olympus.In fact, only five of the six were there: Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, was also missing. They couldn’t start without him, let alone without Trump, so they chatted, the usual pleasantries turning into increasingly disjointed small talk. Mark Carney, the Canadian prime minister, had the anxious look on his face of a host who repeats a little too insistently that everything is fine, perfectly fine. Shigeru Ishiba, the Japanese prime minister, listened idly as Italian PMGiorgia Melonitold him about her daughter’s passion for manga. I wondered if, one-on-one with the Australian or Spanish prime ministers, she’d have gone on about her daughter’s passion for surfing or bullfighting. Who’s to say. I know that Meloni is considered to be on the far right and that one shouldn’t say nice things about her, but let’s just say that this petite blond woman stood out at the G7 for her vivacious brusqueness and her dress code that made no concessions to the ubiquitous grey. Amid the austere suits, her lightweight sky-blue attire looked almost like beach wear.As the minutes passed, more and more slowly it seemed, people started wondering where Merz could be. Had he panicked? Fled? The delay had already lasted a good half-hour – a long time for an event scheduled to last no more than 36 hours in all. Finally, the two appeared, Merz tall, slim and grey, with body language that did little to clarify whether he was in the role of hostage or chosen one, Trump true to his image – midnight blue suit, red tie, orange face, thick-set body, only the wisp of a smile. Two leaders talking one-on-one before the official opening of the summit is totally against protocol, Bonne whispered in my ear, an open and deliberate affront, certainly not in the style of poor Merz, an old-school Christian Democrat, the frail and wobbly bulwark against a German far-right already endorsed by the US vice-president,JD Vance. Trump had used Merz to send the usual message: I do what I want.As to what happened next, I’ll spare you the pleasantries, the welcome speeches and the photocall. Soon the first plenary discussion began, which only the sherpas (PR+1) were allowed to attend, but I had access to the press room where you can see and hear everything as if you were sitting at the table. Kicking things off, Trump said that all this talk was meaningless in the absence of Putin – excluded from the club by that incompetent Obama after the annexation of Crimea in 2014 – a message he repeated in an increasingly grim tone every time anyone dared to send a comment his way.Taking his cue from Carney, Macron acted as if things were off to a great start and valiantly argued for a trade and tariff agreement that would be beneficial for all parties. Coming to his aid, Meloni suddenly pulled two world maps from her bag and showed them to Trump, saying: “Look, Donald: all of this, in blue, is us 20 years ago, when we were still in charge. And this in red is trade today, ie mainly China. So it would be better if we, the blues, could reach an agreement between us against the reds, because the question now is no longer so much who we let in, but how not to get kicked out.”Her tirade over, she nodded vigorously in approval of herself. And as I was starting to find her increasingly likable, I asked myself an embarrassing question: if I weren’t French, if I observed her from a distance, would I find Marine Le Pen likable, too? In any case, one thing you can say about Meloni is that she’s the least poker-faced person imaginable: when something amuses her she bursts out laughing, if something bores her she rolls her eyes and lets out a huge sigh.After an hour and a half, as expected, we’d got nowhere. Trump condescended to quip to Keir Starmer: “You say you’re a democracy but that’s not true: you’ve got a king.” Starmer laughed a little obsequiously, relieved like someone who’s been struck by lightning once and is unlikely to be struck again. He was wrong: a few hours later, standing with Trump outside the hotel, the latter let a sheaf of papers slip from a folder, scattering them on the ground, and as he made no move to pick them up, it was Starmer who, after a moment’s hesitation, bent down and literally knelt at the master’s feet – a devastating image that of course went around the world.Afterwards in smaller rooms there were a few bilats – as bilateral discussions between two leaders are called. I attended the ones between Macron and Starmer and then Macron and Carney: they made little impression on me. At the end of the afternoon, Macron held an impromptu press conference outside the hotel. Asked if he approved of the Israeli strikes on Iran and the prospect of a regime change in Tehran, he replied that however detestable the regime may be, revolutions imposed from outside rarely end well. Just look at Iraq and Libya.“How do you intepret [Trump’s] apparent sudden departure from the G7?” the journalist went on. Most of us present at this exchange weren’t aware that Trump had left, and the announcement left us stunned. For a moment Macron himself seemed taken aback. “I think,” he said, “he’s gone to negotiate a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.”Macron’s intention, in my opinion, was to politely clear Trump of accusations that he’d been boorish and had a temper tantrum, but the lightning strike was not long in coming. Arriving in Washington a few hours later, Trump said he hadn’t been going to negotiate a ceasefire but something “much bigger” (which was true: after three days of hesitation, the US joined the war alongside Israel). Trump added that while Macron is a “nice guy”, he’s “publicity seeking” and, later, that he “doesn’t get it right too often”, to which Macron responded with a shrug and no hard feelings: this wasn’t the first or last comment of its kind, a jibe between friends who get on well despite the odd squabble. (As Reagan put it when he was told in 1981 that Israel had just bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor: “Boys will be boys.”)5. The owl on the T-shirtWith the Rat gone, the tension subsided. We could breathe again but there was no denying that the game had lost some of its appeal. Even though the second day was no more than a half day it dragged on, which was all the crueller given that its star was Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Invited by the G7, he had travelled more than 3,000 miles just to see Trump and beg him once again not to completely abandon Ukraine, and Trump once again humiliated him, this time by leaving just before he arrived.At least, I assume that’s what Trump must have believed, that he was humiliating Zelenskyy. Personally, I belong to those who think that a scene as appalling as the one that took place in February in the Oval Office only served to demean Trump and uplift Zelenskyy. I also think that, despite their difference in size, Zelenskyy outdoes Trump in courage and strength – including physical strength – and that in a normal world his normal reaction would have been quite simply to grab Trump by the lapels of his midnight blue suit and give his face a good head-butt. But we live under the unchallenged reign of the most vicious of Rats, Zelenskyy is fighting for a country at war, and for him heroism consists of enduring one insult after another and saying thank you.Gathered around him for the final plenary session, the other members of the G7 took advantage of Trump’s absence to show Zelenskyy nothing but concern and understanding. When Merz said that the military approach is at an impasse and that what’s needed now is to refine the sanctions, Zelenskyy replied that yes, of course, he’s in favour of sanctions, but that while waiting for them to take effect Ukraine has to keep hold of its territory, so he needs weapons (“I need ammo”, as always).Everyone nodded: we get you, Volodymyr, we’re with you, Volodymyr, and of course Russia is the aggressor – a statement that is nowadays in the same “provocative” category as saying that the climate crisis is real. Meloni summed up the general feeling by exclaiming: “Don’t kid yourselves, my friends. He [Putin] doesn’t just want 20% of Volodymyr’s country, he wants 100%, and he won’t stop there. He wants to restore his empire. As if you [putting her hand on Macron’s arm] wanted half the world because it used to be French colonies, or you [jerking her chin at Starmer, still reeling from the previous day] wanted the Commonwealth. And while we’re at it, why don’t I rebuild the Roman empire?”Macron smiled indulgently. My photographer friend said this morning: “He’s in seventh heaven now that Trump has split. Now he’s the alpha male.” And in fact, with his arms crossed and his chest thrown back as if to take stock of the bigger picture, our PR had assumed with visible pleasure the role of the adult in the room.On the plane home a few hours later he had once again swapped his suit for a black T-shirt, which I noticed was emblazoned with a small owl, and this suddenly reminded me of the speech he’d given seven years before, an eternity ago, in Athens, on European civilisation. He quoted Hegel’s observation that “the owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the coming of dusk” – in other words, that any stage in history can only be properly understood when that moment has almost passed. He was pleased that I noticed this: of course the little owl wasn’t on his T-shirt by chance. Of course – to repeat his much-mocked mantra – he wants to write history and understand it “at the same time”.Orbiting Jupiter: my week with Emmanuel MacronRead moreI scribbled down a few things he said to me during the last dinner at the oval table, so quickly in fact that I’m having a hard time reading them now. It was too noisy to record, everyone (PR+20, I’d say) was talking loudly, laughing loudly, everyone was a little euphoric from the adrenaline, the fatigue and because things hadn’t gone too badly – even if, “deep down”, we had nothing to show: no joint declaration, not even the hint of a roadmap for anything at all. He talked about cognitive bubbles (“Of course Trump lives in a cognitive bubble, but so do I, so do you, that’s something one has to be at least a little aware of”); the advantages and drawbacks of thinking in a “contrarian” way – that is, in opposition to popular opinion (“Like an idiot I followed Javier Milei’s X account, and when I read his posts I realise that I’m capable of agreeing with him”); and double standards, an obsession of his (“If things go on like this, between Ukraine and Gaza we’ll end up losing what little credibility we have left. Europe will have missed its chance”).But what struck me most was what he said with sudden forcefulness about teens and teenagers – I don’t remember how we got there: “I was never a teenager. I don’t like teenagers. I don’t understand them [it’s rare for Macron to say he doesn’t understand something]. My wife understands them.” I thought to myself: he was a teenager when they met, and maybe if she hadn’t understood teenagers he wouldn’t be in his PR plane today, with his little owl of Minerva emblazoned on his black bodybuilder’s T-shirt. And then, the final word before going to sleep – even him – for two or three hours. Apparently it was something his grandmother used to say, and those around him know it by heart and await it with a blend of complicit mirth and mild concern, because beneath its kindness lies a threat: “OK, everyone to bed. Have the night you deserve.”Translated by John LambertListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere.Explore more on these topicsThe long readEmmanuel MacronBrigitte MacronDonald TrumpKeir StarmerMark CarneyFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Stamp duty on shares remains the background dragTue 15 Jul 2025 16.00 EDTShareRachel Reeves called it “the biggest set of reforms to financial regulation in a decade”, and, in one narrow sense, her Leeds Reforms would qualify for the description. If the ringfencing regime for banks were to be scrapped, we really would be entering a new era – or going back to an old one, since the separation of banks’ retail and investment banking activities wasthe single biggest regulatory change introduced after the 2008-09 crashto try to prevent another blow-up.Reeves on Tuesday, however, merely announced a review to look at how reforms to ringfencing could “strike the right balance between growth and stability, including protecting consumer deposits”. One hopes that does not mean outright abolition, which is what banks such as HSBC, Lloyds and NatWest have been urging on the grounds that the rules trap capital and impede growth.The stout defence of ringfencing from Andrew Bailey, governor of theBank of England, has always felt more compelling: the regime has made banks safer and removal would increase the cost of loans and mortgages. It would surely be hard for a chancellor to override the Bank on this core question, especially when Barclays – which, in theory, might have most to gain from abolition as it has the largest investment bank – is also in the defence camp.A fudged outcome would see more activities allowed within the ringfenced entity. It is technical stuff, but also deeply important. Get it wrong and the cautious voices sounding the alarm over a government in search of a sugar-rush of growth via financial deregulation would have a point. Tread carefully, chancellor: ditching ringfencing in its entirety risks unlearning the lessons of the last crisis.In other respects, however, Reeves’s red tape-slashing, investment-boosting, obstacle-removing reforms can be criticised in the other direction: yes, some changes are sensible tidying-up exercises but others are underwhelming.Take the showbiz headliner: the advertising campaign to encourage over-cautious savers to push a few quid into the stock market. The goal is admirable in itself for the reasons the Treasury gives: savers are doing themselves long-term financial harm if they do not understand that shares beat cash over most long-term periods.Quick GuideRachel Reeves's financial reforms: the key pointsShow• Looser mortgage rules, which allow lenders to provide bigger mortgages worth more than 4.5 times borrowers' annual income. The move could help another 36,000 first-time buyers per year, according to the Bank of England• A permanent government-backed mortgage guarantee scheme, in which taxpayers will pick up the bill when a borrower defaults, in an effort to encourage participating banks to offer more 91-95% mortgages• A government-backed but industry-funded advertising campaign to encourage consumers to invest their cash savings in shares• Plans to allow banks to send information about “investment opportunities” to savers that have cash sitting in low interest rate accounts, encouraging them to shift money to stocks and shares• A fresh review of ringfencing rules which were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis in order to protect consumer cash from a bank’s riskier activities• A review of warnings attached to investment products to ensure that people are “accurately” judging risk levels• Plans to “radically streamline” accountability rules for senior bankers and finance bosses• Reining in the powers of the Financial Ombudsman Service, which settles complaints between consumers and businesses• Cutting the rate of interest – and therefore total compensation – paid out to consumers wronged by City firms and imposing a 10-year limit for claims• A new “concierge service” to court international investors and create a one-stop-shop to promote the UK and provide tailored support to help businesses plan where to invest.Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PAWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.But it’s not as if the Treasury itself is doing much more than cheering from the wings. The ad campaign will be funded by the industry, which presumably could have launched the thing itself without government endorsement. At the very least, Reeves could have given the volunteers a hand by abolishing stamp duty on shares for purchases within ISAs. Even that gentle step was conspicuous by its absence.Tweaking risk-warning messaging may help at the margins. So will better access for retail investors to corporate debt and corporate fund-raising, as announced by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). But if Reeves is truly alarmed (as she should be) by the statistic that the UK has the lowest level of retail investment in the G7 group of rich economies, bolder measures are needed. It could take a generation to change saving habits to encourage “informed risk-taking” but the crisis in the London stock market is happening now. Stamp duty remains the drag in the background, and isthe real test of the Treasury’s seriousness.Elsewhere, several reforms look justified: help for “challenger” banks on capital rules; some loosening of rules to help first-time buyers; a trimming of the size of the authorisation regime for bank senior managers in the interest of efficiency; changes to allow the London Stock Exchange to quote dollar- and euro-denominated shares.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

That lot includes the neutering of the financial ombudsman service, but the banks may have had a point about the body acting as a “quasi regulator” within the FCA. The timing of the reform looks terrible while the unresolvedcar finance affairrumbles on, but the regulatory setup did look basically confused. The onus now falls on the FCA to act sooner to spot looming scandals, which is not a wholly reassuring thought.But let’s not overstate the significance of the Mansion House speech. Yes, the financial services industry deserves its place as one of the eight growth-driving sectors within the government’s overall industry strategy; it’s too big to ignore. But, despite some of the rhetoric, it’s not as if the City is currently being strangled by regulation in the way that purer industrial sectors are being hampered by high energy costs. So don’t go overboard on ringfencing reform: it is the bit that matters the most.Explore more on these topicsBanking reformNils Pratley on financeBankingFinancial sectorRachel ReevesBank of EnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

Instead, we’re forced to scrap over our right to food and a washFrances RyanBritain’s political and media class advocate policies that leave disabled people hungry and dirty. Why are we expected to settle for this?Tue 15 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 07.38 EDTShareThere is a longstanding practice in UK politics and media to force disabled people to fight for their basic rights – a kind of gladiatorial scrap in which the Colosseum is replaced by the set of Good Morning Britain.With the government’s welfare reform billjust passed by MPs, this has felt all the more stark. In the last week alone, the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, hasused a speechto declare she does not “believe” that one in four people are disabled, as if the Equality Act were based on vibes. “Twenty-eight million people in Britain are working to pay the wages and benefits of 28 million others,” she went on. “The rider is as big as the horse.”Days earlier, GB Newsaired a discussionin which a comedian “joked” that the best way to reduce the disability benefits bill was to starve or shoot disabled people.Faced with this level of discourse, campaigners have little choice but to argue the most obvious of truths: if the political and media class advocates policies that leave disabled people hungry and dirty, the disabled community must explain why we should be allowed to eat and be clean.As the number of people with long-term health conditions has increased, the living standards that disabled people are expected to accept have only declined. That many of these cases are related to mental health –often incorrectly seenas mild, less real, or unaccompanied by physical conditions – has only encouraged this backlash.In the last fortnight, I have watched disabled activists go on breakfast news and argue that wheelchair users deserve help to leave the house. I’ve seen chronically ill people make reels on social media listing for strangers the intimate items they need disability benefits to pay for.I realise I’ve done similar in my work over the last 15 years: whether it is arguing for disabled people’s rightto sleep on unsoiled sheetsor – as of last month – to receive enough care tochange their bloodied sanitary towels.Disabled people have to prove our humanity on repeat, sharing ever more intimate details of our lives and bodies to prove ourselves worthy, not least of taxpayer money. Each time it happens, I can feel myself shrink and shift a little more. It is ironic – or telling – that the degradation reminds me of a disability benefits assessment.Such a political culture not only psychologically damages disabled people, it damages our ability to gain our full rights. Toni Morrison saidthe function of racism was distraction, and I think it is similar for ableism. The political cycle of the past decade – a government introduces a cut to disability support, much of the media argues it’s valid, a minority outlines why it isn’t – not only legitimises dismantling the safety net, it wastes disabled people’s time that we could be using elsewhere. If you are busy arguing that social care cuts shouldn’t force disabled people togo to bed at 6pm, there is little energy left to lobby for better access to pubs and restaurants, or simply to enjoy going to one.Whenever a politician or pundit suggests benefit claimants are splurging taxpayer cash on booze and fags, I tweet that I’m off to spend my personal independence payments on Moët. I do that partly because I like to give people a chance to call a Guardian columnist a champagne socialist, but mainly because I am increasingly exhausted by the confines of the conversation. Years of austerity measures coupled with media scapegoating – on top of existing structural inequality and attitudes – has in many ways reduced disability in the public consciousness to the lowest common denominator. Forget ambitions to hire more disabled talent in senior roles or to improve access to social and sporting venues – Britain prefers to discuss whether disabled people should be allowed to eat and go to the toilet.I recently published a book, Who Wants Normal?, in an attempt to carve out a nuanced look at disabled life: the joy, humour and talent alongside the pills and the prejudice. In promoting it, I chose to turn down any interview with a broadcaster who has a track record of ableism or go on a “pundit v pundit” format in which bigotry and equality are pitched as equal points of view. I have no interest at this point in debating whether disabled people deserve human rights, or in shying away from advocating for a rich and fulfilling life lest we appear ungrateful or angry.It is time this country focused not just on disabled people’s right to survive, but on their right to live. Rather than talking about cutting benefit rates, let’s explore raising them to a level where they actually cover thegrowing extra costs of disability. Instead of calling disabled jobseekers lazy, let’s discuss the real causes of disability unemployment:biased employersand alack of practical support and fundingin the workplace. Rather than further isolating disabled people, we could makepublic spacesand infrastructuremore accessible – because no one can be an equal member of society if they can’t get in their local shop or on the bus.There is a popular adage that says non-disabled people should care about such things because they could one day become disabled or ill themselves. That’s true. The pundits and politicians belittling disability today could, with just the hand of bad luck, wake up tomorrow with Parkinson’s or ME. But real progress won’t come from non-disabled people caring about disability rights because it might one day affect them – it will come from caring that it already affects someone else.Half the battle in all of this is challenging the unspoken belief that some of us – typically those with limited health, money or status – do not actually deserve the same quality of life as others who have more. Few people without disabilities in Britain would settle for an existence of food, heat and a wash. The question is: why should disabled people?Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.

But the influence of nationalist leaders sympathetic to Trump has caused a splitTue 15 Jul 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 11.09 EDTShareDonald Trump’s trade policy has been labelled “Taco” – “Trump always chickens out” – by his critics. But when it comes to his latest trade war with the EU, it’s Brussels that risks chickening out. The US and the EU have been negotiating for months on an agreement. This week Trump made the shock announcement that the US would hit the EU with punitive tariffs on goods at a crippling30% ratefrom 1 August. This was in addition to separate steel and aluminium tariffs, and cars at even more punitive rates.BlindsidedBrussels negotiatorscalculated the economic damage, and ministers talked aboutretaliation. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, warned that “all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests” would be taken. But so far, despite the tough words, the EU isholding back.The hope of finding a reasonable compromise, which is the German chancellor Friedrich Merz’s preoccupation, makes economic sense. But the political fallout of the EU’s reticence and perceived weakness could be immense.The original Brussels strategy in talks with the US was to aim for a “0% for 0%” tariff agreement. It argued that the overall transatlantic trade balance should be considered, including services as well as manufactured goods. Because, although (as Trump complains bitterly) the EU enjoys a significant trade surplus in goods with the US – to the order of €200bn a year – it consistently features a deficit in services, in particular tech services, standing atabout €150bna year.When the UK reached an early “framework deal” with the US, accepting a 10% US tariff on its exports, but leaving negotiations open for exemptions on a number of specific sectors, it was considered dismissively, in EU circles, a bad deal.A 10% tariff is, after all, pretty high. Keir Starmer shaking hands on that appeared to be sealing the end of the free-trade era. The assumption was that given the EU’s economic size and the dependence on the European markets for certain US exports, Harley-Davidson bikes for example, Brussels had the clout to do a lot better: to induce Washington into a more trade-friendly deal.Indeed, China, whose economic weight is comparable to the EU’s and much higher than that of the UK, used its leverage to secure a trade truce, which is as much, if not more, inBeijing’s interestthan Washington’s. Washington and Beijing are now working towards a summit in the autumn.With Europe, negotiations have not turned out so well. As the Trump administration resumed sabre-rattling again recently, threatening Mexico, Canada and Brazil, the volatility made the EU jittery, eager to seal a deal no matter what. Back in the spring, on Trump’s so-called “liberation day”, the EU had been firm in threatening substantial retaliation, including venting the possibility of its “nuclear” option, a trade anti-coercion instrument that would severely restrict US access to the EU internal market. All of that was put on hold after the White House blinked first, dialling down from its original 20% tariff threat to a baseline of 10%, alongside higher sectoral tariffs.The prevailing view among EU member states then was that rather than follow Trump down the rat hole of a tit-for-tat trade war, they should negotiate an overarching free-trade deal. In the background, European governments also feared that Trump would leverage their military defence dependency on the US by lashing out, especially against Ukraine, at the Nato summit in The Hague.The Hague summit came and went in June. No agreement on trade materialised, but talks were ongoing. Then Trump launched his latest bombshell, throwingagriculture and pharmaceuticalsinto the mix as well.But once again, the EU has taco-ed out. A package of potential counter-tariffs drawn up to hit US exports worth €21bn annuallyhas been delayed. The European Commission is working on an additional retaliatory list, including US goods such as aircraft, alcohol and food, originally amounting to a value of €95bn. But this has beencut to €72bn, and may never come into effect. Talk about implementing the anti-coercion instrument is shelved for now. In the meantime, the US is applying tariffs on about€380bn of annual importsfrom the EU.As with all sanctions, retaliatory tariffs would be self-harming. It makes economic sense to focus instead on doubling down on removing trade barriers with other countries. In this respect, the European Commission has been active. Alongsidefree-trade agreementswith four of the Mercosur group (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and Mexico, which were reached before Trump took office, the EU has stepped up the pace in talks with Australia, New Zealand and India, and has launched negotiations with the UAE. After many years, it has just reached adeal with Indonesia. It has also proposed to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, featuring 11 Asia-Pacific countries plus the UK, to deepen relations and explore the possibility of developing a new World Trade Organization, given the original has been blocked by the US for many years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To cite the most obvious sore point, ratification of the free trade deal with the Mercosur bloc remains stuck. Nonetheless, there is real momentum behind the EU’s trade policy both with countries in the “rest of the west” and with the “rest” in the global south.But none of this alters the reality that succumbing to Trump’s bullying on trade may be a political boomerang for Europe. Although trade is managed by the EU collectively, not by individual governments, policy decisions still require approval by a qualified majority of member states. And it is no secret that European countries are divided between doves and hawks.The doves are prevailing so far. These include rightwing, nationalist, Trump-friendly countries such as Giorgia Meloni’s Italy, countries such as Germany that are heavily exposed to trade with the US, and northern and eastern member states that fear Trump’s wrath on defence. Put together, they constitute a solid majority. So solid that if the US were to carry on bullying, the EU may continue bending to breaking point, perhaps going as far asloosening its digital regulations, which is arguably the real prize Trump is after. This genuflection to Washington would amount to a significant unravelling of European integration. And although rightwing EU governments share responsibility for the appeasement adopted so far, they would also capitalise politically on a bad deal, blaming “Brussels bureaucrats” for the damage.If, for instance, the EU ends up agreeing to a 15% or 20% US tariff base, plus higher sectoral tariffs – in other words a worse deal than the UK’s – it will be hard to argue that European unity has been a source of strength. Europe’s tilt towards nationalism and the far right is weakening the continent. As it does, it’s strengthening those far-right forces undermining Europe’s interest.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

There have been endless examples of this gruesome phenomenon in the past 21 months;Monday’s reporton the BBC’s scrapped documentary about the plight of children in Gaza is just the latest instance.Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone was a rare example of the unbearable experiences of Palestinians being properly investigated by Britain’s public broadcaster. But within the media, this documentary has become a bigger scandal than the suffering of Palestinian children.When a researcher named David Collier, who has written widely in defence ofIsrael, discovered that the 13-year-old narrator of the film, Abdullah, was the son of the deputy agriculture minister in Hamas’s government, all hell broke loose. After a deafening chorus of condemnation from pro-Israel lobby groups, British newspapers and the government, the documentary was taken off iPlayer.Monday’s review states that the failure to disclose this connection violated the BBC’s editorial guidelines, which stipulate that the corporation must “provide full transparency to its audience”. But it concludes that Hoyo Films, the independent production company that made the film, did not intentionally mislead theBBC. It says Hoyo’s view had been – rightly – that Abdullah’s father had a “civilian or technocratic” position within Hamas as opposed to a political or military role, and that it had simply “made a mistake” in not informing the BBC.Here is the crucial point. All of Abdullah’s words were scripted by the production company, since he was the narrator. The report “[does] not consider that anything in the narrator’s scripted contribution to the programme breached the BBC’s standards on due impartiality”, and found no evidence that Abdullah’s father or family influenced the script in any way. In other words, it was completely irrelevant who his father was.There was no substantial justification for taking this documentary off air. The immediate repercussions were that the young narrator and his family were inundated with abuse and harassment, with Abdullah declaring thatthe BBC was to blameif anything happened to him. Such fear is hardly baseless: thousands of children have been slaughtered by Israeli troops, including the 12-year-old Mohammed Saeed al-Bardawil,one of the few witnessesto Israel’s killing of paramedics and first responders in March.Caution has turned to cowardice – the BBC is failing viewers with its Gaza coverage | Karishma PatelRead moreIn the past few days, Israeli forces have killed Palestinian childrenwaiting to collect nutritional supplementsandothers waiting for water. The latter incident, they claimed, was a “technical error”. Is this the explanation for how one of the world’s most sophisticated militaries, with technologyallowing it to knowexactly who it is about to kill in its strikes, has plausibly killed tens of thousands of children sinceOctober 2023?Still, in Britain there is infinitely more scrutiny of this documentary than of these historic crimes. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has even demanded to knowwhy no one has been sackedat the BBC after its decision to air the documentary. In Nandy’s upside-down world, a single detail in a documentary that exposes the killing of children should destroy careers. What about her colleagues who have supported the continued supply of military equipment for Israeli forces as they commit a livestreamed genocide?The media backlash against this documentary prompted the BBC to pauseanotherdocumentary, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, which investigated Israeli attempts todestroy Gaza’s healthcare system(so far, this haskilled at least 1,580healthcare workers). The BBC pulled the film despite it having been approved at every level, with no factual objections to anything in it (the documentary was ultimatelybroadcast on Channel 4). According toBen de Pear, the documentary’s executive producer and a former Channel 4 news editor who wrote about the decision in the Observer, BBC script meetings were dominated by discussions about potential objections from Collier and the lobby group Camera. Collier’s pro-Israel social media output is instructive: he has written that “Jewish people have every reason to seethe Palestinian flagas a flag of genocidal hate”, and that “the Palestinian identity, and especially the ‘refugees’ were developed ONLY as a weapon against Israel”.The furore has been used to justify the idea that the BBC is biased against Israel, yet the exact opposite is true. In adamning report, the Muslim Council of Britain’s Centre for Media Monitoring found that the BBC gave Israeli deaths far more coverage in its articles when measured on a per-fatality basis – and using the overly conservative official Gaza death toll. The vast majority of emotive words, such as “massacre”, “atrocities”, “slaughter”, “barbaric” and “brutal”, were reserved for Israeli victims. Israeli voices were heard far more often than those of Palestinians. This has angered many within the BBC, too, who want to report fairly on the conflict: more than 100 have signed a lettercriticisingthe choice not to air Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.Meanwhile, the historic context for Israel’s crimes against Palestinians has been ignored and erased. The numerous statements of genocidal and criminal intent by Israeli leaders have barely been acknowledged. Like other western media outlets, the BBC has stripped Palestinian lives of their worth, ignored and whitewashed Israeli crimes and repeatedly treated Israeli denials of atrocities as credible, even when those denials are repeatedly exposed as lies.Morality has been turned on its head. The BBC must be perceived as pro-Israel, despite the overwhelming evidence of its crimes. The scandals must be reserved for documentaries about Palestinians, rather than the horrors those Palestinians endure. But here lies the problem. Thanks not least to the work of Palestinian journalists, much of the world has already witnessed the atrocities that are being committed by the Israeli state. They can see the mismatch between what they know to be true and what media outlets such as the BBC report.The BBC has alienated its natural supporters and is detested by the right because it’s a public broadcaster. Its journalistic failures in the Conservative years increasingly undermined faith in its editorial standards. Now, its failure to accurately report on the great crime of our age has only deepened that outrage.

What should be some of the very best places for nature are the absolute worst. Across vast tracts of some of our most beautiful landscapes, life is rapidly ebbing away. Where once there was purple heather, bilberry and buzzing insect life, there are now over-grazed, sheep-infested ecological disaster zones. For a nation of nature lovers, it’s a disgrace.One of the very worst areas is the Dartmoor commons. These exemplify everything that is wrong about England’s upland management. Ina recent Natural England surveyof Dartmoor’s protected sites, only 26 out of 22,494 hectares (55,583 acres) were found to be in an ecologically favourable condition – that’s 0.1%. All theblanket bogsand all the heathland surveyed are in an appalling state, and in many places these once wonderful habitats are in decline.On Dartmoor’s high moor, where there should be a diverse blanket bog, we see huge areas dominated by a single species –purple moor-grass. This hardy plant flourishes in degraded conditions, and is a wretched symptom of the historical extraction, erosion and drainage of the underlying peat, which was compounded by excessive burning and year-round grazing in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This moor grass flourishes at the expense of peat-forming sphagnum mosses – the botanical engineers of healthy bogs. That legacy of intensive farming haunts us with the ghastly spread of impenetrable tussocks of moor grass as far as the rambler can ramble. Meanwhile, livestock –particularly sheep– continue to destroy what little heather moorland is left.This modern-day tragedy of the commons is the result of a land that has been pushed far beyond its ecological limits by the farmers and commoners who have rights over it. But this is also a national scandal – because it is the taxpayer, you and I, who pay for this destruction.Here is a hard, unpopular but simple fact: farming in this place does not make any money. According toa Duchy College Rural Business School reportin 2023, each ewe put on the Dartmoor commons loses its owner £16.90. And there are a lot of sheep. The only way these losses are maintained is through public subsidies. From the 1970s to the 1990s, farmers and commoners werepaid per headof animal – so the more you grazed, the more cash you got. Some sense prevailed in the late 1990s when the first nature schemes came in and public payments were made to actuallyreduce the numbers.The problem is that numbers were never reduced enough; the grazing rates ended up being an unscientific compromise. For instance, on the huge Forest of Dartmoor common, the higher-level stewardship scheme allows an average of 0.52 ewes per hectare. Ina Natural England 2020 studyof 25 years of schemes in the Lake District, the habitat response was universally good only where the stocking rates were below 0.4 ewes per hectare.View image in fullscreenSheep on the slopes of Cat Bells, a peak in the Lake District.Photograph: halbergman/Getty ImagesBut here is the greatest scandal. Over the past decade, more than £32m has been paid toDartmoorcommoners through higher-level stewardship schemes – schemes that exist specifically to improve nature on sites that should be protected by law. And guess what? Not one common has improved, and many have got worse.The government’s supposed regulator, Natural England, has tried to improve things. Back in 2023 it made a stand, being clear that if it was to agree to schemes being extended, it would need to see changesto those stocking rates. The backlash from the farming fraternity was wild, and a politically drivenindependent reviewsaw NE make anembarrassing climb-down. Public fundscontinue to be wasted, and the law isnot being enforced. That’s why an organisation calledWild Justicehas stepped up and secured a judicial review, which is being heard on 15 and 16 July. Our wish is that the Dartmoor Commoners’ Council adheres to its legal obligations and acts to reduce stocking rates to ensure the habitat recovers.It’s not even as if this land is contributing to food security. Grazing on Dartmoor falls withinthe least productive 20% of land, which produces less than 3% of the food produced in England. In short, the public is propping up an environmentally destructive, loss-making industry that makes a minimal contribution to the nation’s food supply, all while damaging Dartmoor’s greatest asset: its nature. It’s madness!We are in a planet-threatening climate and nature crisis; we cannot afford not to make positive changes now. We need the government’s newland use frameworkto lend weight to taking this minimally productive land out of any pretence of significant food production, and concentrating instead on its real potential for essential nature restoration. Dartmoor’s blanket bogs, for instance, are internationally scarce habitats that, if restored, can store carbon and help regulate the flow of water, thus reducing flood-risk downstream. We need to remove the sheep, restore and rewet the bogs, and then leave them alone. At the very least, the public should not be subsidising sheep grazing on the uplands.There are also some good farmers out there who want to do more to restore nature. If they put nature first, they deserve the public’s support to restore our uplands with more suitable animals and more sustainable practices that the local community and our national parks can be proud of. Those farmers who don’t want to change should be penalised for causing damage, not rewarded. Their destructive actions should be as illegal as dumping rubbish on protected areas or deliberately setting fires.The time for unjust compromises is over. We have to stop pouring millions into ecological collapse. Dartmoor and our other uplands are failing ecological systems propped up by wasting taxpayers’ hard-earned cash. If we truly care about nature, the climate, or even fiscal responsibility, we must stop funding failure and invest in healing: in carbon-binding peat, in wild and wonderful nature, in healthy landscapes that breathe life. Our uplands need a healthy future, and that future starts with change – radical, urgent and unapologetic.Chris Packham is a naturalist, broadcaster and campaignerExplore more on these topicsBiodiversityOpinionDartmoorFarmingGreen politicsConservationWildlifeEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

I was chatting to two nearly-graduates last week, who both had something to go on to, and fair play, they were chemists, and I’ve never met one of those before. It’s possible they always saunter into work.The story you hear far more often from graduates is that it’s a wasteland – that every new post has 2,000 applications, all identical because they’re AI-generated anyway, and it’s an AI bot that reads the damn things, so it wouldn’t be able to tell a personal touch even if there was one. Applying for work is like throwing your hat into a ring that’s on fire: your chances of success are mythically small and your hat – or, if you prefer, your self-esteem – will be destroyed in the process.This isn’t just entry-level jobs, though it’s maybe felt most keenly by recent graduates who were sold a hundred grand’s worth of debt as a passport to success, only to find they’ve taken out what was, effectively, a mortgage for a house that doesn’t exist. And it’s not new – more than 10 years ago, Steve Dalton wrote The 2-Hour Job Search, identifying exactly this: posting jobs online would result in so many applications that normal humans would start to rely on word of mouth.What’s the appeal of AI?

And maybe that does the trick for individuals, particularly ones with superficially nice personalities. But it’s a terrible development for the world of work as a whole, privileging as it does people who already know other people, with a rapport that is likely not based on anything more profound than sub-verbal class allegiance.People bashing their heads against this wall will not be in the mood for irony, but itisironic that technology, far from advancing human connectedness, has actually landed us back in the middle ages, where you can’t get anywhere unless you know someone’s uncle.

But a staggering toll continues to mountTue 15 Jul 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 14.11 EDTShareOn Sunday, an Israeli strike killed six Palestinian children – and four adults – as they queued for water in a refugee camp. The deaths of children may be the most terrible part of any war. It is not only the suffering of the innocent and powerless, and the unimaginable pain of surviving parents – as dreadful as those are – but the knowledge of lives ended when they had barely begun, of futures that should have stretched long into the distance severed in an instant.As shocking as Sunday’s deaths were, they are commonplace in Gaza: a classroom-worth of children have been killed each day since the war began. What marked them out was that so many deaths happened at once and publicly; and that Israel’s military felt obliged to acknowledge its responsibility – though without any great contrition. It claimed that a “technical error with the munition” caused it to miss its intended target and added that it “regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians”.What does this bloodless, bureaucratic language have to do with the bloody deaths of six already traumatised children? These deaths were not a mistake. They were a tragedy – like those of the 10 children killed days before, as theyqueued outside a clinic. The Israeli military said, again, that it regretted any harm to civilians. And yet the bodies of children pile up. Children killed as theysheltered in former schools; children killedas they fled Israeli forces; children killed as they slept at home.Gaza’s ministry of health says thatmore than 17,000of the 58,000 Palestinians killed are children. Israel says that it seeks to minimise harm to civilians. The death toll belies that and Israeli intelligence sourcestold reporters last yearthat at times they were permitted to kill up to 20 civilians to take out even junior militants – with the preference being to attack targets when they were at home, because it was easier.Those six thirsty children should not have needed to queue for water due to what the UN calls a human-made drought. Human Rights Watch believes that thousands of Palestinians have died due toIsrael’s deliberate pattern of actions to deprive them of water, which it alleges amounts to thecrime against humanity of extermination as well as acts of genocide. Those 10 hungry children should not have required nutritional supplements, but Israelcontinues to choke off aidand civilians are starving. Unrwa says that a tenth of the children screened in their clinics are malnourished.Tens of thousands of children have been seriously injured; many are amputees. As of February last year, around 17,000 had been identified asunaccompanied or separatedfrom their families. The very young are among those least able to cope with hunger and disease. How many will survive this conflict? How many will be able to remain in Gaza? How many will be able to live anything like a normal life one day? How many will see only vengeance or despair ahead of them?Meanwhile,Israeli parentscall for the hostage release and ceasefire deal that must end this conflict, and which Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted. Allies, including the EU and Britain, remain complicit in this war. They should ask themselves what they would do if their children faced for even one day what those in Gaza have endured for month after month.The children of Gaza have the same rights as children anywhere – to water, to food, to shelter, to education, to play, to hope, to joy. To life. Yet on Sunday, Israel killed Abdullah Yasser Ahmed, Badr al-Din Qarman, Siraj Khaled Ibrahim, Ibrahim Ashraf Abu Urayban, Karam Ashraf al-Ghussein and Lana Ashraf al-Ghussein.They were children. They were loved.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

In sport, Americans value brevity, drama, a guaranteed resolution. Draws are anathema and ways must be found to avoid them. Two enterprising journalists once took Groucho Marx to an MCC game at Lord’s and hepronouncedit “a wonderful cure for insomnia”.What Groucho would have made of the “timeless”Testin Durban in March 1939 – it had been going on for 10 days before England, close to victory, decided that they had to catch the boat home – doesn’t bear thinking about. George Bernard Shaw summed it up perfectly: “The English are not a very spiritual people, so they invented cricket to give them some idea of eternity.”Yet, as theLord’s Testbetween England and India that concluded on Monday in dramatic fashion with a victory for the home team by 22 runs showed, Test cricket can also provide the most gripping sport of all – in large part because it unfolds over five days, slowly gathering in intensity. Twenty20, where each side bats for 20 overs and the game is done and dusted in less than three hours (the baseball model), may be taking over cricket globally, but there is nothing that matches the complexity and sustained excitement of a hard‑fought Test. Twenty20, though immensely skilful in its own way, is bubblegum pop. A Test such as the one we have just witnessed is Wagner’s Ring Cycle.This match will be ranked withHeadingley1981 andEdgbaston2005 in the pantheon of unforgettable Tests of the modern era. Lord’s had everything: heroic performances – especially Ben Stokes, England’s bearded Siegfried, looking as intense as Bob Willis at Headingley in ’81; ill-feeling over the time-wasting tactics employed by both teams earlier in the match; a raucous crowd, with plenty of noisy but good-humoured support for both teams; and the bizarredenouementwhen the injured England novice spinner Shoaib Bashir bowled the feisty Mohammed Siraj to win the match. Siraj had middled the ball, but it spun back to hit the stumps, with Siraj, who could legally have kicked it away, seemingly transfixed. Bashir raced around the ground in ecstasy; Siraj was in tears; the earlier ill‑feeling was forgotten as England’s fieldersconsoledthe Indian No 11. Drama, pathos, humanity: Hollywood (or indeed Bollywood) could not have written a better script.Test cricket, as the Wisden editor Lawrence Booth told the Today programme on the morning after the match, is always in the middle of an existential crisis. As England were celebrating their mighty victory, the West Indies – in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s the best Test team in the world – were beingbowled outignominiously for 27 (the second-lowest Test total of all time) by Australia in front of empty stands in Jamaica.Test cricket may be buoyant in the UK, but it is in desperate trouble in other countries where money is short and Twenty20 is seen as a more viable option. If the greatest form of the game is to survive and flourish, the cricketing authorities need to address the inequalities at the heart of global cricket. Let Lord’s 2025 be an inspiration, not an epitaph for a format that is sometimes seen as anachronistic in an age that demands instant gratification.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

France have emerged as leading contenders to face the Lions in a warm-up match before the tour of New Zealand in 2029 and, according to Benazzi, could also fulfil the same role before the inaugural women’s tour in 2027, also to New Zealand.The Breakdown | Five areas where the Australia v Lions Test series will be won and lostRead moreMore recently, however, there has been a groundswell of support for a tour of France, with leading Top 14 sides such as Toulouse and Bordeaux offering the prospect of competitive warm-up matches before a mouthwatering series againstLes Bleusin contrast to the currently one-sided tour of Australia. The former Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips last week became the most recent former Lion to throw his weight behind the prospect, suggesting a tour of France would be a “gamechanger”.Benazzi, who is also the president of the Six Nations and narrowly lost out to Brett Robinson in last year’s election to be World Rugby chair, is seeking to make France regular opponents on the Lions’ fixture list. Asked about the prospect of a future tour of his country, Benazzi said: “If you look at the legacy and the reputation of the Lions, of course they have the tradition with the south, our position as a neighbour is that we can do something together in the future.“We had contact, not formally, just a friendly chat with the guys from the Lions and they started thinking maybe it would be a good idea. We don’t have a formal decision now but maybe we will talk about having two meetings with the [women] and the Lions and the men and the Lions in the future. Maybe in 2027 and 2029. We don’t think of just one shot, we think of a programme for the future. It’s good for everyone because it’s powerful and we want to share it with this institution.“I want to spend a bit of time with the staff and just think about how we can build a new business model with this institution between France and the Lions. For me and for France, we want to build something interesting for both. How we can build something bigger for rugby, for everyone around the world with this meeting and secondly, how we can build some business between the two institutions, the Lions and France, and everyone will be happy with that.”It is understood the Lions are open to exploring possibilities with France, which would provide an attractive option for supporters unable to afford expensive trips to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Benazzi was eager to stress that France are not looking to replace any of the three southern hemisphere nations but the FFR’s interest increases the pressure on the Wallabies to be competitive against the Lions in the coming series. An agreement for the 2029 tour with New Zealand is considered a given but the Lions are not formally committed to tour South Africa in 2033 or Australia in 2037.Benazzi also believes the French public and players would fully buy in to the concept and expressed confidence an arrangement could be reached with the Top 14 to avoid clashing with the end-of-season run-in. “We don’t want to steal something from the south,” he added. “We just want to do something extra. It’s a legacy and that’s very important but we have a lot of things to share together. Being neighbours is important for supporters. I spoke with an agency that brings a lot of people to Australia this year and they said to me it would be very good business for people coming from the UK to France.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He haswon three majors, been ranked world No 1 since 2023, and is the favourite for the Open this week. But during an extraordinary press conference at Portrush on Tuesday, the American peered into an existential void as he asked himself: what is the point of it all?Scheffler was clearly happy, and his determination to win this week was clear. He also spoke eloquently on the challenges of links golf. But a hitherto unremarkable press conference suddenly veered into a deeper philosophical search for meaning when the 29-year-old was asked how long he had ever celebrated a victory.McIlroy vows ‘the story isn’t over’ as he revels in Royal Portrush support at the OpenRead moreIt turned out the answer was a few minutes. And Scheffler was only getting started, as he then promised to quit golf if it ever affected his family life.“There’s a lot of people that make it to what they thought was going to fulfil them in life, and you get there, you get to No 1 in the world, and they’re like what’s the point?” he said. “I really do believe that, because what is the point? Why do I want to win this tournament so bad?“That’s something that I wrestle with on a daily basis. Showing up at the Masters every year, it’s like, why do I want to win this golf tournament so badly? Why do I want to win the Open Championship so badly? I don’t know. Because, if I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes. Then we’re going to get to the next week and it’s: ‘Hey, you won two majors this year; how important is it for you to win the FedExCup playoffs?’ And we’re back here again.”Scheffler was clearly in a good mood. But he conceded that any joy he felt from his achievements was only fleeting and didn’t give him much fulfilment. “To get to live out your dreams is very special, but at the end of the day I’m not out here to inspire the next generation of golfers,” he said.“I’m not out here to inspire someone to be the best player in the world, because what’s the point? This is not a fulfilling life. It’s fulfilling from the sense of accomplishment, but it’s not fulfilling from a sense of the deepest places of your heart.”Perhaps such an approach, along with his deepest held religious beliefs, helps to explain why Scheffler has looked so ice‑cool even when the pressure is ratcheted up to the max.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler’s Open press conference veered into a deeper philosophical search for meaning.Photograph: Francisco Seco/AP“We really work so hard for such little moments. I’m kind of sicko; I love putting in the work. I love getting to practise. I love getting to live out my dreams. But at the end of the day, sometimes I just don’t understand the point.“I don’t know if I’m making any sense or not. It’s just one of those deals. I love the challenge. I love being able to play this game for a living. It’s one of the greatest joys of my life, but does it fill the deepest wants and desires of my heart? Absolutely not.”Instead Scheffler said that his family mattered far more – and he would stop playing professional golf if it ever affected his relationship with his wife, Meredith, and his son, Bennett.“Every day when I wake up early to go put in the work, my wife thanks me for going out and working so hard,” he said. “When I get home, I try to thank her every day for taking care of our son. That’s why I talk about family being my priority because it really is.“I’m blessed to be able to come out here and play golf, but if my golf ever started affecting my home life or it ever affected the relationship I have with my wife or my son, that’s going to be the last day that I play out here for a living.Quick GuideFive groups to follow at the Open with rounds 1 and 2Show6:35am (rd 1) /11.26am (rd 2):Padraig Harrington, Nicolai Hojgaard, Tom McKibbinTwo-time Open champion Padraig Harrington leads an eye-catching first group with two rising European stars. Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard, 24, already has a Ryder Cup appearance under his belt, while Tom McKibbin, 22, who finished tied-fourth in LIV Golf Andalucía, will be hoping to make an impression in his native Northern Ireland.9:58am (rd 1)/2.59pm (rd 2):Xander Schauffele, JJ Spaun, Jon RahmXander Schauffele will be bidding to become the first golfer since Harrington in 2008 to defend his Open title. JJ Spaun, making his Open debut, said his closest links experience was playing Bandon Dunes in Oregon, but as the only golfer to finish under-par at the US Open, he will fancy his chances. Former world No 1 Jon Rahm rounds out a group of major champions.10:09am (rd 1)/3:10pm (rd 2):Shane Lowry, Collin Morikawa, Scottie SchefflerMuch has been said about Scottie Scheffler's effortless dominance, which will finally be put to the test on Portrush's treacherous links course. \"I think it fits my strengths because I like to do things very creatively,\" he said pre-tournament. Former champions Collin Morikawa and Shane Lowry, who won at Portrush in 2019, complete the trio.10:42am (rd 1)/3:43pm (rd 2):Matti Schmid, Ryggs Johnston, Richard Teder (a)Richard Teder will be one of nine amateurs among the 156-strong field to watch. The 20-year-old Estonian, who picked up golf by accident, dramatically qualified for the Open by holing out from 90 yards in a sudden-death play-off. He is no stranger to links golf, having played in kids' tournaments in Scotland and shot competitive rounds at courses like Royal St George's and Ballyliffin.2:48pm (rd 1)/9:47am (rd 2):Robert MacIntyre, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin RoseMajor success has come fleetingly close for Justin Rose in recent attempts, and the Englishman will again be a crowd favourite as he aims to add to his 2013 US Open win. Meanwhile, the contrast in styles between Bryson DeChambeau, who has traditionally struggled with links golf, and Scotland's Robert MacIntyre is one to keep an eye on.3:10pm (rd 1)/10.09am (rd 2):Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Tommy FleetwoodAll eyes are on home favourite Rory McIlroy as he returns to Portrush after missing the cut in 2019. McIlroy left that tournament with regrets, but comes here after his Masters victory. Tommy Fleetwood finished second at Portrush in 2019 and may be best placed to end his Major drought, while Justin Thomas is also looking to rediscover his mojo.Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This is not the be all, end all. This is not the most important thing in my life. That’s why I wrestle with, why is this so important to me? Because I’d much rather be a great father than I would be a great golfer. At the end of the day, that’s what’s more important to me.”That doesn’t mean, of course, that Scheffler isn’t deeply determined to win his first Open title at Portrush, having achieved his best finish of seventh at Troon last year.“It’s great to win tournaments. But sometimes the feeling of winning only lasts a few seconds. It’s pretty exciting and fun, but it just doesn’t last that long.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is often said that a player’s stock can rise when they are sat on the sidelines – yet sometimes, in some quarters, the reverse can also be true.Chief among them was a reminder that England possessa special fast bowling talenthere, Archer displaying the attributes that set him apart from others. As the man himself confidently put it regarding the 89.6mph beauty to Rishabh Pant that angled in, nipped away and gave the snappers the stumplosion they craved: “I guess it was just a matter of when, if I kept bowling like that. I can’t imagine many left-handers getting away with it.”England call up veteran spinner Liam Dawson to replace Bashir for fourth Test with IndiaRead moreIt is the moments of intensity that Archer can whip up in the middle and the questions he asks beyond simply pace and that shock‑ball of a bouncer. He is not a robot, of course, and small miscalculations can still lead to the odd rush of runs. Take the fourth evening, when he went too full in pursuit of the magical inswinger. But as a fast bowler feeling his way back into the rhythms of red-ball cricket, this was to be expected. Overall, Archer’s impact went beyond fine match figures of five for 107 from 39.3 overs.England have never wavered from their belief that days such as these could return, hence repeated contract renewals since his debut in 2019 and despite those repeated stress fractures to his lower back and elbow. The support has been plentiful and the planning meticulous. Strength and conditioning coaches have even flown to Barbados to work with him at the club near his family home in Saint Philip. No expense has been spared.Rob Key, the England team director, deserves credit for insisting on an ultra-cautious schedule; more cautious than just those 18 overs for Sussex suggested and more than the man himself felt necessary. Archer fancied himself to be ready for Test cricket a good while back, having trained to get in the best physical shape of his career. The slow 18-month buildup in the white-ball formats, he said, was like being in “training wheels”.View image in fullscreenJofra Archer celebrates taking a catch to dismiss India's Washington Sundar off his own bowling.Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesBut at times England’s seven‑figure investment has been queried by sections of the support base; eyebrows raised at Archer playing in the Indian Premier League and questions about either his ability or desire (or both) to make it back to Test level. As Archer put it, he has had to battle the negativity of “keyboard warriors” on social media. Even the BBC made some jokey content this week aboutJonathan Agnew betting against the comeback, not realising how this might have sounded to the man himself. “I never thought about not coming back, that was just you,” Archer deadpanned in response to this.The roar that met Archer’s name being read out when he first came on to bowl at Lord’s – decibel levels that rose further when he jagged his third ball across Yashasvi Jaiswal and took the wunderkind’s outside edge – felt far more instructive, however. As tends to be the case more broadly in life, the mood of the wider public differs to the world online. Archer, World Cup winner and Ashes star six years ago, has far more support out there.And not that Archer should have needed to prove his desire given the work to reach this point but, like pretty much every player on show in this hardcore India series, he put in a serious shift this past week. At the end he was still producing speeds of which most other seamers only dream.Just ask Mohammed Siraj, who suffered a brutish stinger to the upper arm just moments before he was the last man to fall.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

One tick is already there. I will do everything in my power to be on the plane in November.”With respect to India, who are serving up a mighty challenge and not least when it comes to taking 20 wickets, this is where English mouths naturally start to water even more: the prospect of seeing Archer in full flight on Australian surfaces that, in recent times, have been spicier than those witnessed during this home summer.Another cause for optimism is that, in Ben Stokes, Archer has a captain who seems to understand him, not simply as a fellow fast bowler but as another cricketer about whom expectations were raised after that golden summer of 2019. “I think the mentality under Baz [the head coach Brendon McCullum] suits the way I like to play my cricket,” he said.As has often been trotted out by McCullum these past three years, that mentality is one of staying present; to “plan as if you’ll live forever, but live as if you’ll die tomorrow”. When it comes to Archer and thoughts of what is to come, this feels the way to go.Explore more on these topicsJofra ArcherEngland v India 2025England cricket teamIndia cricket teamCricketfeaturesShareReuse this content"

High in the air he held three fingers on his right hand to signify his intention to become a three-time undisputed world champion. It was a typical sporting gesture and underlined his determination to defeat Dubois at Wembley Stadium on Saturday night and follow his earlier achievements in winning all the belts as a cruiserweight and then, last year,becoming the first boxer to unify the world heavyweight divisionthis century.Usyk remains the WBA, WBC and WBO champion but boxing politics forced him tovacate his IBF titlesoon after he beat Tyson Fury in their magnificent first world title unification fight 14 months ago in Riyadh. He looks ready now forthe dangerous challenge of Dubois, the new IBF champion, but Usyk’s arrival in London was a timely reminder of the far more significant role he plays in Ukraine.Daniel Dubois: ‘That first fight against Usyk is behind me – I’m a man of the future’Read moreRather than just being a cherished world champion boxer, Usyk carries the gravitas of a Ukrainian statesman. And so, before the brutal yet simple fisticuffs which will break out in front of 90,000 people at Wembley, Usyk began fight week with two highly symbolic political gestures. In Trafalgar Square he unveiled a replica of a mosaic which had been created by the Ukrainian artist Alla Horska in Mariupol in 1967. The original mosaic had been bombed during Russia’s relentless onslaught soon after the outbreak of war in February 2022.“Russia destroyed so much in my country,” Usyk told the small crowd that gathered around him. “Russia destroyed hospitals. Russia destroyed schools. Russia destroyed Ukrainian lives. But we will survive. We will rebuild our country, like a mosaic, piece by piece.”Richard Branson stood next to him as the boxer confirmed that the British businessman had become the first donor to help the Usyk Foundation to raise £2.5m to build new apartments for 64 displaced families inUkraine. They then made the short walk to Pall Mall and the statue of Florence Nightingale, which is also a memorial to the 19th-century Crimean War. The British nurse had been revered as “the Lady with the Lamp” as she tended to wounded Crimean soldiers.On Monday the Nightingale statue added a prosthetic limb, painted in the blue and yellow of Ukraine. There was no talk of war in the ring, or the fractured boxing landscape, as Usyk and Branson pledged to help the 80,000 Ukrainians who now need a prosthetic limb to replace an arm or leg lost to Russian bombs.Usyk comes from Simferopol, the Crimean city annexed by Russia in 2014, and it was easy to remember his direct response inan interview with the BBC last month. “Hey, listen, Putin wants four of my territories,” Usyk said as he looked directly into the camera. “You crazy? It’s Ukrainian territory. It’s not your territory. Listen, guys, please, open eyes, it’s our people. Ukrainian soldiers are in captivity now in Russia. Listen, it’s bad conditions in Ukraine for three-and-a-half years.”View image in fullscreenOleksandr Usyk was joined by Sir Richard Branson and deputy mayor for culture and the creative industries Justine Simons at the unveiling.Photograph: Yui Mok/PAIn that same interview Usyk had been asked what message he would give those trying to negotiate a ceasefire. “I advise the American President, Donald Trump, to go to Ukraine and live in my house. Only one week. I will give him my house. Live please in Ukraine and watch what is going on every night. Every night there are bombs and flights above my house. Bombs, rockets. Every night. It’s enough.”Usyk also said: “Ukrainian people are dying. It’s not [just] military guys, but children, women, grandmothers, grandfathers. For me it’s hard. It’s my country. I worry about what happens in my country.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionHis focus for the rest of this week will return to Dubois. Usyk defeated his 27-year-old British opponentwhen they fought for the first timealmost two years ago in Wroclaw, the Polish city close to the Ukrainian border. Dubois hurt him with a body punch which was declared, amid great controversy, as a low blow in the fifth round. Usyk was on the canvas for four minutes before he rose to his feet and prevailed in the ninth when he pummelled Dubois into submission.But he is 38 now and Usyk endured two gruelling 12-round battles against Fury last year. They were the kind of fights which take chunks out of men – even Usyk who won both by narrow margins. He also knows that Dubois has improved considerably since their first bout and gained in confidence as a world champion – whocrushed Anthony Joshua last Septemberin a way that Usyk had not been able to match in his two hard fights with the older British heavyweight. “Daniel is a good athlete and has good skills,” Usyk said. “In his [past] three fights, he had great wins [against] Filip Hrgovic, Jarrell Miller and Anthony Joshua. I think he’s a great fighter.”He also suggested: “Daniel is a little bit afraid. I am too, but my afraid is different.”Usyk’s real fear is of further carnage and death in Ukraine which is why, even during his final preparations for Saturday night’s latest test in the Wembley ring, he has had Putin, Trump and Florence Nightingale on his mind. His most important task, as a symbol of defiance and hope in Ukraine, seems as endless as it is vast.Explore more on these topicsBoxingOleksandr UsykUkrainefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Has Jonas Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike team at times been towing the bunch deliberately in order to ensure that Tadej Pogacar retains the yellow jersey? It’s a gloriously arcane question, the kind that only comes up in the Tour’s opening phase, but it distracts from a point that could be key in the next 10 days: how the two teams manage the race will probably be decisive.Firstly, a brief explainer. The received wisdom in cycling lore is that holding the yellow jersey early in a Grand Tour can be as much a curse as a blessing, because the daily media and podium duties cut into recovery time. Hence the thinking goes that Visma might have been chasing down the odd move purposely to keep Pogacar in themaillot jaune, so that he will be answering media questions and hanging about waiting to go on the podium, while Vingegaard has his feet up. Only Visma’s management know if this was the case, but what is certain is that the febrile atmosphere between the two teams will intensify from here on in.Onley and Blackmore lead the charge of young Britons at Tour de FranceRead moreIn that context, Monday’s slog through the Massif Central was a score draw between the two armadas. Pogacar could afford to lose yellow to Ben Healy of Ireland as it buys his UAE team some down time at least on Wednesday and Thursday, when Healy’s EF squad will have to control the race. On the other hand, Simon Yates’s opportunistic stage win on Monday redressed the balance a little in favour of Visma; at this stage of the Tour, any amount of positive momentum is welcome.The tone had been set for the opening 10 days – and possibly the whole Tour – about 15km from the finish of the first stage into Lille on 5 July when Vingegaard and his lieutenants Matteo Jorgenson and Edoardo Affini surged to the front of the peloton in a cross wind and split the race. Pogacar was not to be caught out, but only one of his men made the split of about 40; Vingegaard, on the other hand, had three with him.Visma have no option but to try to find openings, to probe UAE’s defences constantly to seek the single chink in the armour that may enable their leader to pull back some of his 1min 17sec deficit to Pogacar. Hence an abortive attempt to split the field on Sunday into Châteauroux led by Wout van Aert, and Monday’s classic display of tactical mountain racing, with Yates and the Belgian Victor Campenaerts sent ahead in a breakaway just in case either Vingegaard or Jorgenson managed to elude Pogacar and his men.This kind of racing has paid massive dividends for the Dutch squad in the past, most recently at the Giro d’Italia, where Yates managed an unlikely overall victory with the support of Van Aert, at the expense of UAE’s starlet Isaac del Toro. The scenario that is the stuff of nightmares for the UAE management is the one that Visma (in their previous incarnation as Jumbo-Visma) engineered in 2022, when UAE were first reduced in numbers by illness, and were then put to the sword by Vingegaard, Van Aert and Primoz Roglic in the Alps.Roglic has moved on, but Jorgenson is an adequate replacement; he has twice won the Paris-Nice stage race and finished eighth in the Tour last year while supporting Vingegaard. The obvious tactic for Visma in the next 10 days will be to burn off Pogacar’s support riders to engineer a situation in which the Slovenian ends up on his own on a mountain with Jorgenson and Vingegaard, who can attack him one by one. Pogacar may well prove equal to the task, but there is only one way to find out. Any one of the four high mountain stages in the Alps and Pyrenees would be adequate, and they only need Pogacar to flinch once.Nerves will have been sharpened by João Almeida’s heavy crash on Friday en route to Mûr-de-Bretagne, which forced him to quit the race on Sunday. With Rafal Majka sitting out this Tour, that has deprived the double Tour winner of his principal mountain wingman. Almeida – “the best teammate in the world,” as Pogacar put it – would have provided substantial support: he has notched up nine wins this year, including the Tour of Switzerland.“Someone will have to step in,” said the UAE director of sport, Simone Pedrazzini, but the uncomfortable fact is that Almeida offered a back-up option, a man who could mark a breakaway and potentially work towards finishing on the podium. Neither Adam Yates or Jhonatan Narváez is a like-for-like replacement, while another UAE climber, Pavel Sivakov, looked distinctly out of sorts on Sunday and Monday. UAE will need him to recover during Tuesday’s rest day.There are questions around Visma as well. Yates’s stage win on Monday suggests he is back to top form after his struggles on the opening stage, but thus far Van Aert has blown hot and cold, completely absent at times, shy of his best at others, but capable of finishing second to Jonathan Milan on Saturday into Laval. It remains to be seen if he is merely riding himself in having taken a break after the Giro.In past Tours, he has proven capable of smashing the entire race into smithereens on any mountain stage, and if Visma are hoping to take the fight to UAE in the next 10 days, they need him to quickly rediscover that same blistering form.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarJonas VingegaardTour de FranceCyclingcommentShareReuse this content"

We were celebrating her success at Arsenal, but not so much now. We’ll see. Stina is an incredibly powerful footballer and very intelligent with her runs. She’s a hard player to play against in that respect.”Euro 2025 is shaping up to be a roaring success. Now for more jeopardyRead moreThe two players were on the same Arsenal side in May when Blackstenius scored the winner against Barcelona in the Champions League final. And trying to separate the friendship they have when they step on to the pitch in Zurich on Thursday can be challenging. “It’s different because playing each other in training comes with restrictions, it’s rare that I get to play against Stina in this setting. I enjoy it, I like Stina,” Williamson said with a grin. “It’s tough to remove all of that to just go at it, you don’t want to focus on it too much, there’s lots of things that come into play when you play against a teammate, but I think I’ve known Stina long enough now that I know who she is and it’s time to focus on us.”As a centre-back, Williamson will be directly up against her club colleague, but she is wary of pinpointing Blackstenius’s threat alone. “When you have a team who work for each other like Sweden, then you don’t need to necessarily have a crazy standout threat because everyone plays their roles,” she said. “They are hard to prepare for in that sense. The discipline for them all to complete their jobs on the pitch makes them a dangerous side.”View image in fullscreenStina Blackstenius scores Sweden's first goal against Germany in the 4-1 win.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APWilliamson’s focus in this tournament is staying present, replicating her mantra of the 2022 Euros. “I want to enjoy it and spend time with my teammates,” she said. “It’s a great environment and I love being around them all. Beth Mead was laughing at me the other day because I did the day in the life of her, which meant I didn’t go back to my room and I was very sociable. By the end of the day I sleptgood.“I said to her: ‘I don’t know how you do this every day,’ and she said: ‘This is my every day’. I said: ‘Yes, it’s crazy to me, I’m not that type of person’. But it’s little things like that, just trying to be around more. In 2022 I slept most of the time that I wasn’t on a pitch so yes, a bit different this time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She’s a funny character, but she can be serious and she has so many experiences of her own and an incredible perspective, she does actually help us out. When she retired we were begging for somebody to employ her within the FA just to bring her along. I’m glad that she is here and she’s found a way to be here.

How can a side packed with some of the world’s finest players continually make early exits at tournaments, fail to look cohesive and even endure a chastening8-0 defeat against Englandat Euro 2022? How can great talents such as Barcelona’s Caroline Graham Hansen, Chelsea’s Guro Reiten and the Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg not thrive together in their national-team kit?Stop there. Hold that thought. Something is stirring. Norway topped Group A at Euro 2025 with three wins from three and face Italy on Wednesday in the quarter-finals. Is this the summer when Norway will deliver on their potential, offered not just by Graham Hansen, Reiten and Hegerberg but Arsenal’s Frida Maanum and players from Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Lyon? And with an English head coach in the former Wales manager Gemma Grainger.Euro 2025 is shaping up to be a roaring success. Now for more jeopardyRead moreNorway are the second-most successful team in Women’s European Championship history, with two titles, but have not lifted this trophy since 1993. So far, though, 2025 has been a year of long waits ending in football; whether it was the Real Madrid women’s team winning their first clásico, an English women’s team lifting a European title for the first time since 2007, or Inter qualifying for the Women’s Champions League for the first time.In the men’s game, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Tottenham ended trophy droughts, Paris Saint-Germain got theirfirst men’s European Cupand Harry Kane won a trophy. Rory McIlroy finally got his Masters. Last month, South Africa’s men’s cricket side won theirfirst global trophy in 27 years.Maybe there is something in the air this year. Maybe, 20 years after the slogan “good things happen to those who wait” began to be phased out in a well-known Irish stout’s advertising, 2025 is the year when that comes true.Norway have been waiting 25 years for international women’s football success, since their Olympic gold in Sydney in 2000, and have waited 30 years to hoist a major trophy, since winning the 1995 Women’s World Cup, at a time when the star of their team was Hege Riise, who temporarily preceded Sarina Wiegman in the Lionesses dugout. But in contrast, they had crashed out in the group stages of the past two European Championships. In the past two Euros they crashed out at the group stage.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Frida Maanum scored twice in Norway’s 4-3 win against Iceland in their final group game at Euro 2025.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThe former Tottenham and Norway men’s goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, who got 97 caps and is in Switzerland as a pundit for the Norwegian broadcaster TV 2, says the past few tournaments were “a bit disastrous” but he says: “I think we have become a bit of a victim of the general rise in level of women’s football. Because we were quite early to it, we had lots of girls playing football quite early, so we had an advantage, but now when the big nations really go for it, and they become professional and you have academies in Spain and stuff like that, it’s becoming more difficult to beat those teams. And now you have all the other late developers that are maybe in population a bit bigger than Norway, so it becomes difficult to beat them too.”Norway defeated Switzerland, Finland and Iceland by a one‑goal margin. Thorstvedt was unimpressed by the performances in their first two wins but says: “I’m so much more optimistic and so much happier now after the third match because, against Iceland, we played really well.“It was like: ‘Take these shackles off my feet so I can dance.’ Suddenly it was enjoyable, suddenly it was like we have got a good team. There was no pressure because we had already won the group, so that mentality might have played into it, so I just hope we get to see a Norway team that plays with freedom.”Italy are higher in Fifa’s world rankings than any of those three group opponents and are on a good run. Thorstvedt says: “I’ve seen all of Italy’s good matches and they’re a good team. If Norway can beat Italy and reach a semi-final you can’t argue with that – it’s a humongous success. If we lose to Italy, I think the final verdict will be determined by the way we lose, maybe, whereas if we win that would be totally incredible. Gemma Grainger seems to have created a good atmosphere in the group and things are looking good.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Norway women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now for more jeopardyLocal and travelling fans have been captivated and most problems could have been avoided with more spending or careSuzanne Wrackin ZurichTue 15 Jul 2025 10.37 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 15.31 EDTShareThe headline in SonntagsBlick Sport reads: “Lia hier, Lia da, Lia überall.” It is not metaphorical; Switzerland’s Lia Wälti is literally here, there and everywhere. From billboards and tram stops to produce packets and tourism adverts, the Arsenal midfielder is the poster girl of Euro 2025, the captain, the Champions League winner, the fulcrum of a team who captured the heart of the country as they set up a blockbuster quarter-final with the world champions, Spain.There were raised eyebrows when Switzerland was announced as the host country. The largest stadium is the 38,512-capacity home of Basel, St Jakob-Park, where the opening game and final are being played. It felt like a step back from the 74,310-capacity Old Trafford, which hosted the opening game in 2022, and Wembley, which hosted 87,192 fans for the final between England and Germany.Was Switzerland the easy option, conveniently on Uefa’s doorstep? Probably. However, if the group stage has set the tone, this tournament will be looked on as a roaring success. The group stage attendance record has been broken, with 461,582 fans piling in, and more records are set to tumble.Switzerland may lack a Wembley or Old Trafford but its small‑ to middling-sized stadiums have been overwhelmingly full, locals and travelling fans captivated by a tournament they want to be a part of regardless of the fixture. Take Portugal’s 1-1 draw with Italy in Geneva, for example, which had an attendance of 22,713 for a mid-group game between teams outside the top 10 of the Fifa world rankings.View image in fullscreenThere was an excellent crowd in the Stade de Geneve for Portugal v Italy.Photograph: Bernadett Szabó/ReutersIt is still valid to ask, given the pace of the game’s growth year on year, whether the scale of the tournament could have been much, much bigger, but it is impossible to quantify whether another nation would have so easily and readily embraced a tournament in its entirety. What we can say is that the Swiss, and the large contingents of travelling fans, have created a feel similar to the Olympics, where those who miss out on the 100m finals book in for the beach volleyball just to say they were there and to soak up the vibe.These are engaged Swiss fans too, not passively along for the ride, which is impressive given many of them have probably not watched a huge amount of women’s football live. At the host nation’s opening game, against Norway in Basel, the attendance was 34,063, but what was more noteworthy was the nature of the crowd. There was vocal support throughout, spearheaded by the supporters’ group, with very few lulls in chanting, clapping and energy.The attendance record for a women’s domestic match in Switzerland was set in March, when 10,647 fans watched Young Boys’ women’s team play Grasshopper at the Stadion Wankdorf. The fan marches have set the tone for the support, with a peak of 14,000 (12,000 Swiss and 2,000 Icelandic) taking part in one such walk to the Wankdorf for the hosts’ 2-0 defeat of Iceland.View image in fullscreenNetherlands fans on the march to their game against England.Photograph: Hollandse Hoogte/ShutterstockThere have been problems. Post-match transport in some of the smaller cities, such as St Gallen, hasn’t been ideal after 9pm kick‑offs; supporters have had trouble bringing water into stadiums despite high temperatures; there aren’t enough women’s toilets in some grounds; and sky-high prices have made it difficult for travelling fans to stay out. All but the last are solvable and it shows where costs have been kept low or where there has been a lack of care in the detail.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There are no surprises among the qualifiers for the quarter-finals, although perhaps only Spain and Sweden, despite showing they can be vulnerable defensively, have avoided an unconvincing performance.A sense of jeopardy, the feeling that no team are infallible, aids the drive to increase interest. The identity of the quarter-finalists has been predictable but from here all bets are off and that makes for an exciting tournament.Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Switzerland women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

There was such a rush to the website the server broke down.That would have been unthinkable only a few months ago but the Polish team that played in their first Euros, scored their first goal and secured their first win at the tournament have changed the perception of women’s football in the country for ever. “One of the key goals was to leave the best possible impression and to get little girls interested in the sport,” said the coach, Nina Patalon, after the 3-2 win against Denmark. “That was our biggest responsibility at our first Euros.”They did just that. Before the tournament the record viewing figure for a women’s football game on national TV was 600,000, for the decisive playoff against Austria. With momentum building, a whopping two million people tuned into the opening match against Germany, where Poland produced a feisty display and were somewhat unluckyto lose 2-0.By comparison, the men’s national team’s match against the Netherlands at Euro 2024 was watched by nine million people. But the men’s team have lost some of their allure. Their performances at major tournaments have been a source of frustration for Poles. Recently Robert Lewandowski quit in a fit of pique after losing the captaincy,a row that ended with the coach, Michal Probierz, resigning. It wasn’t pretty.The women, meanwhile, have captured the hearts of a nation. One of the biggest sports portals,sport.pl, wrote: “The Polish women were debutants. They are still at the beginning of their journey. It is still a stage where the saying ‘we are learning, we are gaining experience’ is not a bad excuse, but the honest truth. The fact that they didn’t finish last in such a difficult group, were able to score three goals and win a game, is a surprise that needs to be appreciated. The Euros, but also everything that has happened over the last year, builds hope that the best is coming.”Poland followed up defeat against Germany with another loss,this time 3-0 against Sweden, before the cathartic victory over Denmark. “I hope we will experience these moments more often,” said Ewa Pajor, the team’s star striker, who plays her club football for Barcelona. “I am proud that we could feel the taste of victory at the European Championships. I know that this is a step on the road to further development.”View image in fullscreenEwa Pajor applauds the Poland fans after the victory over Denmark.Photograph: Florencia Tan Jun/Uefa/Getty ImagesThe West Ham goalkeeper Kinga Szemik told the Guardian: “I hope that our participation at the Euros is another milestone in propagating the sport and changing the mentality of Polish people. Like we said from the beginning, one of the main goals for us was to help younger generations of girls so if they choose playing football, it’ll be much more accessible and easier for them.”It has been quite an achievement by the team. A year ago no one believed they would even get to the Euros. And that was not only the experts but also the Polish FA and Nike, who did not plan a special kit for the team. When qualification was secured Nike said that there was not enough time to produce a new jersey. SoPolandwere the only country at the 16-side tournament who were playing in an old design.View image in fullscreenThe Poland goalkeeper Kinga Szemik celebrates a goal.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersNow, though, the country is looking forward. Poland submitted an application to host this year’s Euros but lost out to Switzerland. They will soon apply to organise the 2029 tournament and should they succeed it will be the first time the women’s Euros are held in easternEurope.It brings back memories of 2012, when Poland co-hosted the men’s Euros together with Ukraine. The “Euro effect” is still talked about in Poland, the success of the event having exceeded all expectations. The impact of the Euros on the economy, the development of tourism and the country’s image was invaluable.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

After the final game against Denmark she said: “It is worth falling in love with our team. My team has presented something that can be a fertiliser for little girls to fall in love with football. They are role models.”This is just the beginning and one of the best things is that Poland is now a country where girls and boys have new idols.

However, with Uefa deeming that move came too late to save them, having ruled that Textor’s Eagle Football Holdings Ltd had controlling stakes over both the French club Lyon and Palace, a protest organised by the supporters’ group the Holmesdale Fanatics was attended by hundreds of fans who marched from Norwood High Street to Palace’s stadium.“Uefa: morally bankrupt. Revoke the ruling now,” read a large banner at the front of the march, with another reading: “Football: created by the poor, stolen by the rich.” Palace fan Josh Harness said: “It’s not fair that we’ve won the oldest Cup competition in the world and then been demoted from theEuropa League.“We earned the right to be there and all we can do is show our support for the club. The delay over the decision also means we can’t start planning for next season yet because we didn’t know what competition we were going to be in.”The group behind the tifos that were on display at the Wembley FA Cup semi-final and final against Aston Villa and Manchester City respectively, the Fanatics had said it was “time to act” and called on supporters “of all teams to join us”. “Those who are disillusioned with the state of modern football, those who are tired of the authorities favouring a small cartel of larger clubs all in the name of profit, and those who want to bring football back to the fans, where it belongs,” said a statement announcing the protest.“We must come together for our voice to be heard around Europe. This will not be an isolated action, but the beginning of the campaign against those responsible for the moral and financial corruption that has plagued the modern game. Let us remind Uefa and the Cas that this ruling can, and should, change.”A petition that calls on Uefa to restore Palace to the Europa League has also been signed by almost 3,000 people since being posted on Friday. Uefa rejected an attempt by Textor and fellow American co‑owner David Blitzer – the majority shareholder of the Danish club Brondby, who have also qualified for the Conference League – to place theirshares in a blind trustbecause they had missed the March deadline.Use of a blind trust has enabled other clubs with the same owners to play together in a Uefa competition. Sources at the European governing body confirmed that it had cleared both clubs to play in the same competition having deemed that Blitzer does not have a decisive influence at Palace.However, writing on X over the weekend, Parish questioned the logic behind the current system. “Let’s put this ‘THEY missed the deadline’ nonsense to bed. Let’s say Me, Josh, David and everyone other than Eagle football had placed our shares in a ‘blind trust’ before March 1st. Three random people would have had control of the club since then but by Uefa’s interpretation of the rules we would still be out of the Europa League.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceEuropa LeagueUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Liverpool’s valuation is based on their accounting position rather than an asking price.Díaz has two years remaining on his deal and there have been no talks so far over an extension.

But it would take a significant improvement on Bayern’s offer to test Liverpool’s resolve to keep him.Liverpool have spent almost £200m this summer and remain in the market for a centre-forward, with Newcastle’s Alexander Isak high on their list. A striker was a priority before the tragicdeath of Diogo Jota.The potential sale of Díaz and Darwin Núñez, who has interest from Napoli and clubs in Saudi Arabia, would help the champions fund what would need to be a club record deal for Isak but Liverpool’s understanding is that the Sweden international is not for sale.Newcastle have made a club record £70m move forHugo Ekitikeand, although that has been rejected by Eintracht Frankfurt, a breakthrough in that pursuit could have implications for Liverpool’s chances of landing Isak. As things stand, however, Liverpool expect Isak to remain on Tyneside.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak, pictured at Newcastle’s training camp in Austria, remains a Liverpool target.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesEkitike has also been linked with a move to Anfield, and Liverpool continue to monitorMarc Guéhi’s situationat Crystal Palace.

Rangers finished seven points above the relegation places and the 43-year-old Cifuentes left by mutual consent last month.‘It’s not fair’: Crystal Palace fans march in protest at demotion from Europa LeagueRead moreThe Foxes, who also spoke to the former Bournemouth and Wolves head coach Gary O’Neil and the former Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder, said in a statement that they opted for Cifuentes because of his “modern, progressive footballing philosophy”.The club’s hierarchy are understood to see in Cifuentes shades of their former manager Enzo Maresca, who oversaw promotion to the Premier League before leaving for Chelsea.Leicester finished third-bottom in England’s top tier last season with 25 points from 38 matches, and a goal different of -47, the second worst in the Premier League.Cifuentes, who has a three-year contract, told the club’s website: “It’s a great honour to be appointedLeicester Citymanager.

If it’s launchers, that’s possible,” he added.Each Patriot system comes with six launchers. Germany has agreed to provide two Patriot systems, with the Netherlands donating a third, Skibitskyi said. “That would be 18 launchers for three batteries, which is close to 17. The US administration and the Pentagon will give us further details,” he added.The possibility of the US providing long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, as discussed by Trump and Zelenskyy this month, is likely to enrage Vladimir Putin. The precision cruise missiles are capable of striking Moscow and have a range of 1,600km. Previous Ukrainian requests were rejected by the Biden administration.During a call on 4 July, Trump asked Zelenskyy if he could hit the Russian capital and St Petersburg. According to Skibitskyi, Zelenskyy replied: “Yes, absolutely. We can if you give us the weapons”. Trump on Tuesday said Ukraine should not target Moscow.Aid donations to UkraineThe Trump administration has so far not agreed to send Tomahawks. If it did provide the weapons, Ukraine would struggle to deploy them, Skibitskyi said. “They are not easy to use. The main launchers are combat ships or strategic bombers. We don’t have any strategic bomber aircraft,” he recognised.But he said it was crucial Ukraine had the ability to conduct “kinetic” strikes deep inside Russia against high-value military targets. Discussions were ongoing with Washington over lifting restrictions imposed by the last administration on the use of Atacams, US provided missiles with a 300km range – about 190 miles.The Washington Postreported on Tuesdaythat the Trump administration was likely to allow Atacams to be used inside Russia at their full range, and was considering sending additional missiles. Currently, they can only be fired into Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, and not used on Russian territory.Skibitskyi said the Kremlin had already moved its strategic military bases more than 500km from its border with Ukraine. Kyiv was only able to hit them using unmanned kamikaze drones which can carry 5okg of explosives. Atacams, by contrast, have a 500kg payload and can cause greater destruction.“It’s very important for us to get approval from the US to use long-range missiles,” he said. “We want to destroy and to disrupt, in accordance withNatoprocedure.”Zelenskyy said he had a “really good conversation” with Trump following Monday’s announcement of a big weapons package. He said he discussed with the US president how to achieve “a lasting and just peace” and to stop Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities, which have beenhit in recent weeks by hundreds of drones and missiles.Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands on Tuesday said they wanted to participate in Trump’s plan forEuropeto buy US weapons for Ukraine.Pledged European aidPoliticians in Kyiv have broadly welcomed the improvement in relations with the US, following Zelenskyy’s disastrous White House meeting with Trump in February. But there was also frustration that US tariffs and secondary sanctions on Russia have been postponed again, with Trump setting a deadline of 50 days.In an interview with the BBC, Trump said he was “disappointed, but not done” with Putin.Russian officials have dismissed Trump’s threat as “hot air”, pointing out he has changed his mind several times on sanctions and other issues. “Trump issued a theatrical ultimatum to the Kremlin. The world shuddered, expecting the consequences … Russia didn’t care,” the former president Dmitry Medvedev wrote on X.Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, is in Kyiv on a week-long visit. On Monday he met Zelenskyy and commander in chief Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, as well as Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief and Skibitskyi. Kellogg was briefed on Russian plans for a summer offensive and on the latest from the frontline in the east, where Russian troops are advancing.Skibitskyi said the US president had “more experienced” people around him than in his first presidential term and did not behave like a “classical” politician. “He’s more of a businessman. It isn’t easy to understand Mr Trump,” Skibitskyi added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeUS militaryNatoVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood they were suspected of being hired by criminals paid to carry out acts for Russia and Iran.Russia, Iran and China are behind most of the hostile state action Britain faces, police said, which has increased fivefold since 2018, when Russian agents used the military grade nerve agent Novichokto try to assassinatea defector in Salisbury, Wiltshire.Murphy said a Prevent-style scheme may be needed amid warnings that hostile state actions – such as targeting dissidents, espionage and sabotage – had risen much more than expected and it was feared it would grow further. He said that Russia used the Wagner group to carry out attacks in Britain.Murphy said: “We are increasingly seeing young people being drawn into [being] influenced by the Russian state, Wagner … that means we do need to think differently about how we might speak to these people about the realities of the risk they are taking.”The senior national coordinator for counter-terrorism, Vicki Evans, said there were risks for youngsters “particularly [in] online environments where they can easily be targeted”.She added: “The message to parents, teachers is … be vigilant, understand the risks … report if you are concerned.”For counter-terrorism chiefs the concern is that the ability of hostile state actions to lure in children, wittingly or unwittingly, will mirror that of terrorism, whereincreasing numbers are being detainedfor involvement in violent extremism.Men acting for Wagner Group convicted of arson on Ukraine-linked London warehouseRead moreHostile state action investigations, including assassination plots against dissidents, make up 20% of the police counter-terrorism command’s workload.Evans said: “Espionage operations target our democracy, target our institutions, they threaten to fracture public trust here in our communities and threaten to target the things that underpin our daily life and our way of life.”Last week, five men wereconvicted of an arson attackon a London warehouse containing crucial equipment for Ukraine’s effort to resist Russia’s invasion.The ringleader knew he was working for Russia but others may not have known, and that was typical of how criminal proxies were being used, police believe.A criminal proxy communicated with his Russian handler via a chatbot.Chatbots and artificial intelligence are also a growing threat in terrorism, an official report said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It is capable of harm but lacking in legal responsibility.“In its current form, it operates in a grey zone between human input and outputs. Responsibility may be shared but is hard to attribute because humans cannot be certain what Gen AI will generate next.”Hall warns AI could be used to encourage attacks and propaganda: “New-looking propaganda may be enabled by Gen AI, such as racist games with kill counts; deepfakes of terrorist leaders or notorious killers back from the dead, speaking and interacting with viewers; true-seeming battles set to thrilling dance tracks; old images repurposed, souped up and memeified; terrorist preoccupations adapted as cartoons or grafted on to popular film characters.”Explore more on these topicsUK security and counter-terrorismPoliceMetropolitan policeRussiaIranEspionageChildrennewsShareReuse this content"

However, medical tourism packages rarely cover continued care in the case of complications or long-term nutritional or psychological support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They recognise they have a disease.”“I don’t even blame the surgeons abroad,” Ahmed added. “They see a gap in the market and they’re exploiting it. They’re able to supply surgery at a much cheaper price. What I don’t like is when we see patients with problems from poorly conducted surgery. That upsets me a lot.”The BMJ commentary calls for the urgent creation of international quality standards for weight loss surgery, including an accreditation process that patients can use to choose high-quality providers abroad. This, McGirr suggested, could be funded by providers. “There will be resistance to regulating the industry,” she said. “Undoubtedly, not all centres would seek accreditation or regulation.”Procedures include gastric sleeve surgery, in which the size of the stomach is decreased by more than 70%, and gastric band surgery, which narrows the intestine. Both aim to restrict eating by making a person feel full, leading to a reduction in appetite.Woman from Wales died after gastric sleeve surgery in Turkey, inquest hearsRead moreBotched surgery can lead to infections, surgical leaks, internal hernias and, in the worst cases, be fatal. Foreign Office figures from March 2024 revealed that at least 28 British people had died since 2019 due to complications from elective medical procedures performed in Turkey, many of which are thought to have been bariatric surgery. Last month, a doctor told the inquest of a 40-year-old British woman whodied following weight loss surgeryin Turkey in 2024 that he had dealt with more than 100 other patients suffering complications after undergoing similar procedures abroad.However, Ahmed said he had observed a decrease in patients attending A&E with acute complications in the last two years, which he puts down to people choosing to privately fund obesity drug treatments rather than surgery.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthTurkeyNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

It is one of a number of campaign initiatives focused on overhauling the tax regime being run by climate groups who say the revenue from the ultra-rich could fund investment, restore crumbling public services and help tackle the climate emergency.“Fixing our broken tax system so that it finally taxes those who earn their income from assets and wealth at the same rates as the majority of the population, who earn their money from work, is the fair thing to do,” said Hannah Martin, a co-director of GND Rising. “We must tax the booming fortunes of the super-rich to rebalance our economy and fund investment in our communities, our schools, libraries as well as much-needed climate action.”The campaign aims to highlight the growth in extreme wealth held by individuals and corporations in the UK. It calls on the government to introduce a 2% tax on assets over £10m, shut down tax loopholes and increase the tax paid on property and shares so that capital gains tax is equal to income tax. It is also urging the government to stop using public money to bail out big polluters such as failing water companies and fossil fuel firms.Tax experts at the Tax Justice UK campaign groupsay a 2% tax on wealth above £10m would raise £22bn every year, andthe other tax changesadvocated for by GND Rising could raise an additional £50bn in a single year.View image in fullscreenProtesters from Green New Deal Rising outside White’s gentlemen’s club on St James’s Street in London.Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty ImagesMartin said: “Climate campaigners are calling for wealth taxes because we have been told for years that ‘there’s no money’ to tackle climate change. But we can see along with the public there is enough money and it is being hoarded by the super-rich and polluting corporations. We need to unlock that wealth to tackle climate change and the cost of living crisis, and that means focusing on the government’s tax policies to win that change.”There has been a growing clamour for a wealth tax in recent months from some economists, thinktanks and trade unions. In recent weeks prominent Labour figures includingthe former leader Neil Kinnockhave added their voices.Opponents,the super-rich and their advisers and supporters, have raised concerns that such a move would result in the ultra-wealthy leaving the country, a narrative that has been amplified bya blizzard of news storiesover the past year.However, experts say there is no evidence of a mass millionaire exodus from the UK, with the overall number of millionaires and billionaires having risen steadily over the past two decades. At the same time most people are faced with stagnating wages, rising living costs and decimated public services.Zack Polanski, who is standing to be the new leader of the Green party, agreed there should be a wealth tax to ensure the ultra-wealthy – who are also the largest emitters – pay their fair share to tackle the climate crisis.He argued that under the current plans to reach net zero emissions by 2050 the poorest in society were being asked to “step up to tackle the climate crisis”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

They should instead ensure that the greenest option is always the cheapest. How dare they say there’s no money left at the same time they also refuse to tax the super-rich?”GND Rising’s Pay Up campaign staged a day of action last week during which more than 200 young people targeted sites connected to Britain’s ultra-wealthy, including the billionaires Jim Ratcliffe of Ineos, the Reform treasurer Nick Candy, and the founder of Bet365, Denise Coates. It said it intended to step up its campaign for a fairer tax system over the summer.Martin said climate action “must speak to the reality of people’s lives and their anger at the inequality they are seeing in their communities”.“The climate crisis and economy inequality are two sides of the same coin, because it’s the same broken system making billionaires richer, fuelling the climate crisis, and leaving working people to pick up the bill.”She warned that unless climate campaigners showed that climate action was “also about fixing inequality and the cost of living crisis, we risk our demands being dismissed as a ‘nice to have’ by politicians, ignoring the very real pain people are facing, and opening up our agenda to attacks by climate deniers like Reform”.Explore more on these topicsGreen politicsClimate crisisThe super-richTax and spendingEnvironmental activismProtestReform UKnewsShareReuse this content"

Rainfall was 20% less than the long-term average for the month, and it was the hottest on record for England. Reservoir levels have continued to fall as increased water use meets lack of rain, with overall storage across England at 75.6%. This is below the level during thesevere drought year of 2022, when they were at 77% capacity at this point in the summer. The Guardianrecently revealedthat England’s reservoirs are at their lowest levels for a decade.The government’s national drought group met on Tuesday to discuss their response to the prolonged dry weather, which has caused mass fish die-offs, low river flows, dangerous algal blooms and the beginnings of crop failures.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it was likely that yields for farmers would be lower than last year, particularly non-irrigated grains and straw.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

Wildfires, drying up wetlands and coastal sites, and the loss of breeding seasons for rare species have all been seen. The national drought group is asking recreational water users including anglers, swimmers and boaters to report any environmental problems they see, such as fish in distress.Officials said on Monday that as many as five of the Environment Agency’s 14 areas of England were expected to go into drought this summer after the hottest June since records began in 1884.Three heatwaves, which tend to increase water consumption, combined with a lack of rain, means that large swathes of England are heading towards drought and the damage to the environment that entails.Helen Wakeham, the Environment Agency’s director for water and the national drought group chair, said: “This has been the driest start to the year since 1976, and we need to make sure our water supplies can sustain us through the summer.“Today I have asked all the partners who make up the national drought group to step up their operational response to manage the drought and use water wisely. Environment Agency teams are out on the ground actively monitoring river levels and working to ensure there is enough water for the people and the environment.”Explore more on these topicsExtreme heatWildlifeDroughtWaterEnvironment AgencyExtreme weathernewsShareReuse this content"

Fine particles called PM2.5, which are small enough to get deep into lungs and are caused by burning wood and driving cars with internal combustion engines, dropped by 30%.The scientists, from the University of Reading, measured pollution levels at more than 500 sites around the UK. They looked at NO2and PM2.5levels along with surface ozone (O3).Despite the reductions of two of these pollutants, safety limits are still broken in the UK. The average number of days each year when NO2exceeded World Health Organization targets fell from 136 to 40 days, while the number of days PM2.5 particles were above the targets decreased from 60 to 22.Additionally, ozone increased by 17% over the decade. This pollutant is formed when sunlight interacts with NO2and volatile organic compounds produced by traffic and industry. It can be exacerbated by rising temperatures, which the UK is experiencing as a result of climate breakdown. The number of days when ozone exceeded targets doubled from seven to 14 a year.Dr James Weber, the lead author of the paper published in the journal Environmental Science: Atmospheres, said: “The UK has made progress on air quality but there is still a long way to go. Pollution from traffic is getting better but we need both local action and international cooperation to improve all types of air pollution. The fact that ozone is getting worse while other pollution improves shows we need to think carefully about how we tackle this problem and not focus on pollutants in isolation.”The scientists say that as different pollution types come from different sources, with NO2mainly coming from local traffic but PM2.5 particles travelling long distances, including from continental Europe, a range of approaches are required to tackle pollution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Then they start to appear – one telltale fin and then another. Soon, a pod of eight or nine dolphins can be seen moving through the sea, seemingly following the path of the boat.But as they start to jump and dive, fins cutting through the air, it becomes apparent that one dolphin is missing the appendage, his body breaking the surface but without the telltale profile of his companions. His name, given to him by a local environmental group, isOrae, which literally translates as “long”, but in this context means “wishing him a long life”.A video taken from a boat of a pod of dozen or so dolphins surfacing and diving in a bayOraeis one of about 130 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins living in the waters surrounding Jeju. Many display scars of the increasingly dangerous lives they lead after coming into contact with discarded fishing gear that entangles and cuts into them, or through close encounters with boats or jetskis operating around the island.Piloting the boat is someone known on the island as “Dolphin Man”, AKA Jeongjoon Lee, a Korean director known for his work on documenting and helping the bottlenose population.“Because the dolphins cannot cut the fishing lines themselves, we decided to cut them for them,” he says. “In one case, we had to cut wire from two different places, one was going in through the dolphin’s face to its body, and another from around its tail where it had become tangled.”View image in fullscreenJeongjoon Lee, who is known on Jeju as ‘Dolphin Man’. The director has made several documentaries about the local bottlenose population.Photograph: Young Nam Kim/KOEMNow, a coalition of campaigners and environmentalists want to take things further. They are hoping to have the bottlenose population recognised as a “legal person”, which would give them additional rights and make it easier to protect them.The idea is part ofa growing movementto recognise rights in law of nonhuman species and places, and is the first attempt in Korea to give such status to an animal.View image in fullscreenJeju’s dolphins bear scars from fishing lines and boat propellers.Photograph: YN Kim/KOEM“The idea is that if an individual or a company threatens their livelihood, then we could act on behalf of the dolphins to sue them or to take action in another way,” says Miyeon Kim, who works at Marine Animal Research and Conservation (Marc),the local NGOresponsible for naming the dolphins.“Different organisations that work with the dolphins have been pushing for this for two years now, but it’s very complicated and you have to get the Korean government, as well as the citizens of Jeju, to back such a move.”The dolphins are officially listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)as “near threatened”rather than threatened, but the IUCN states that a lack of data on the dolphins makes it difficult to assess whether this status is accurate.It’s important for us to be able to identify individual dolphins … but it’s also important for the islandersMiyeon Kim, activistSome subpopulations – there are pods throughout the Indian Ocean, south-east Asia and Australia – probably face much greater threats, it says, particularly those that live close to islands.Around Jeju these threats come from discarded fishing gear, dive and tourist boats that get too close, construction noise that affects the dolphin’s use of sonar, and pollution and runoff from the island’s many fish farms. The latest concern is the construction of thelargest windfarm in Korea, and one of the biggest in the world, off the coast of Jeju.Kim says part of Marc’s strategy is to personalise the dolphins in an effort to get local people to relate to them better. The group hasproduced a bookletwith each dolphin’s name against a picture of their dorsal fin.View image in fullscreenA pod of dolphins swims past a tourist boat off Seogwipo on Jeju Island.

People have to understand and really relate to endangered species in order for these kind of things [establishing legal personhood] to work.”In April, there was a small but significant victory with the designation of a marine protected area (MPA) on the west side of the island, with the specific remit of protecting the bottlenose dolphins.View image in fullscreenA spotter’s guide to identify the dolphins by their dorsal fins, produced by Marine Animal Research and Conservation.Photograph: handoutAt the moment the rules that govern the area include things such as preventing arbitrary development in it – but these need to be tightened further, says Kim. “The law bans more than two recreation boats coming within a 100-metre radius of the dolphins but there are a lot of different boats in that area including fishing boats, and at the moment we can’t do anything about those.”Microplastics found in dolphin breath for first time – studyRead moreFor Dolphin Man, who has dedicated so much of his time to swimming with, filming and helping the dolphins, any extra help to conserve the animals cannot come soon enough.“Sometimes I see so many boats surrounding the dolphins all watching them and chasing them around,” he says. “It is good that we now have a small space to begin to protect them more, but really we need to designate that whole side of the island as a protected area in order to keep them safe for the future.”This article was supported by theBloomberg Ocean FundandOceans5Explore more on these topicsDolphinsSeascape: the state of our oceansMarine lifeEndangered speciesWildlifeSouth KoreaConservationCetaceansfeaturesShareReuse this content"

While it recommended that primary schools teach sex education in years 5 and 6, in line with what pupils learn about conception and birth, it is not compulsory.“Primary schools should consult parents about the content of anything that will be taught within sex education,” the guidance says. “This process should include offering parents support in talking to their children about sex education and how to link this with what is being taught in school as well as advice about parents’ right to request withdrawal from sex education.”The guidance allows primary school teachers to discuss the sharing of naked images or online sexual content if it is something that is affecting their pupils, and they can discuss online sexual content where they know that children have seen pornography.The 47-page document also addresses online gambling, strangulation and suffocation, sextortion, deepfakes and suicide prevention, as well as “incel” culture and the links between pornography and misogyny.It has been broadly welcomed by school leaders, but some campaigners have expressed concerns about “watering down” earlier proposals on gender.Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at Sex Matters, said: “It’s a big shame that the Department for Education has watered down sections of the draft guidance it inherited from the previous government which sought to counter the trans activist positions adopted by many schools over the past decade.”Bayswater, a support group for “parents of trans-identified adolescents and young people”, said: “The new RSHE guidance fails to address the serious safeguarding issues around teaching gender identity to children.“As well as significantly weakening the clarity offered by the earlier draft guidance, this version introduces topics which are likely to be harmful to vulnerable children. For example, direct teaching about suicide may actually undermine suicide prevention strategies.”Margaret Mulholland, a special needs and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed “the clarity over biological sex and gender reassignment” in the guidance.“There are strongly held and sometimes polarised views over these issues and it is important to have a clear set of national guidelines to follow.”The government is expected to publish separate guidance for schools and colleges on gender-questioning pupils shortly.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, welcomed the fact that age limits have been dropped.“Schools already work hard to ensure that teaching is age-appropriate and this approach gives them the vital flexibility to respond to their own community and the needs of pupils in their schools,” he said.“However, the new guidance asks schools to teach more content with only the same amount of time available. Government cannot continue to impose additions to the curriculum without proposing how the additional teaching time needed is to be found.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Children were encouraged to wear outfits that reflected their nationality or family heritage to the event last Friday.Courtney Wright, a year 7 pupil, donned a union flag dress similar to – though more demure than – one worn by the Spice Girl Geri Halliwell in 1997.Her father, Stuart Field, said his daughter was removed from the celebration day and was not allowed to deliver her speech, which was intended to celebrate British values of fairness and politeness, as well as traditions such as drinking tea, talking about the weather and eating fish and chips.The school subsequently offered its apologies to Courtney. It said it deeply regretted the distress caused by the incident and was committed to “learning from this experience and ensuring that every student feels recognised and supported when expressing pride in their heritage”.In a post on Facebook last Friday, Field wrote: “On my way to collect my daughter from school. She’s currently being made to sit at reception waiting for me. The reason? It’s cultural diversity day at school where children can wear clothing representing their culture and write a speech about their heritage. She’s been told it’s not for her as she gets to celebrate being British every day.”A statement issued on behalf of the school by the Stowe Valley Multi Academy Trust said: “On Friday 11th July, an incident occurred during our Culture Celebration Day that caused considerable upset to one of our pupils, her family, and members of the wider community.“We deeply regret the distress this has caused and offer our sincere and unreserved apologies. We have since spoken directly with the pupil and her family to listen to their concerns and reflect on how this could have been handled better. We are committed to learning from this experience and ensuring that every student feels recognised and supported when expressing pride in their heritage.”The statement added: “As a school, we are reviewing our policies and strengthening staff training to ensure our practices reflect our values of inclusion, respect and understanding for all.

The Unite and GMB trade unions are understood to have warned EDF that urgent action is needed becausethe rodents are “everywhere”.A spokesperson forHinkley Point Csaid: “We join with our trades union partners in asking that the correct process is followed to resolve any grievance. Normal working throughout the site has been unaffected by this unofficial action.”Explore more on these topicsHinkley Point CEDF EnergyEnergy industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Responding to this scepticism, Foster will tell an audience of members of the Windrush generation at Hackney town hall that his job will be “to confront uncomfortable realities, not conceal them”.“If I am to be seen as a Dettol commissioner, as some have called me, let it be in the spirit of healing and protection, not sanitising the truth,” he will say. “Moral outrage still burns within me for people who had the legal and moral right to be here but were denied that.”Foster, a pastor from Nottingham, was named by the Home Office as Windrush commissionerin Juneand starts work this week. His appointment fulfils a promise made by the former home secretary Priti Patel to implement a series of recommendations designed to introduce comprehensive reform of the Home Office in the wake of the Windrush scandal, in which thousands of people, many of them from the Caribbean, were wrongly classified as immigration offenders despite having spent most of their lives in the UK.Foster plans to widen his role to address wider injustices, in addition to his core responsibility as “a champion of the Windrush generation’s legacy, ensuring this generation is remembered for their contribution – not just for a scandal”.He will say: “What began as a fight for justice for the Windrush generation has become a mirror reflecting the broader struggles faced by Black Britons and other marginalised communities. People have come forward not only with experiences of immigration injustice but with experiences of discrimination in housing, education, employment and policing. I want to ensure these voices are heard in the places where change happens.”A number of applicants to the Windrush compensation scheme have seen their applications rejected because they had applied under the misapprehension that the scheme would offer compensation not just to people wrongly labelled as immigration offenders but also to those who had experienced racist treatment in the course of their working lives or during their education in the UK.Applicants often viewed the compensation scheme as an “opening to express the longstanding hurt and pain they feel about discrimination”, Foster told the Guardian. “They want to express how discrimination and structural racism has affected them over the years. We need to create a space for those voices to be heard and ensure that the right action is taken.”Foster noted that there remained “suspicion and apprehension” towards the Home Office among the Windrush generation and their descendants, and said some people were still wary about coming forward to apply for citizenship documentation.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The presidentposted a handwritten note to Powell on social media last week, saying: “You have cost the USA a fortune and continue to do so. You should lower the rate – by a lot!”Trump takes on the Fed – but he has little power over central bank, economists sayRead morePowell has said in turn that rate cuts have been delayed by Trump’s tariff policies, which many policymakers fear will boost inflation. Data for June,published on Tuesday, showed the annual rate of inflation rising to 2.7%, from 2.4% a month earlier.Speaking to reporters asJP Morganreported its quarterly earnings on Tuesday, Dimon cautioned against interfering with the workings of the US central bank.“The independence of the Fed is absolutely critical – and not just for the current Fed chair, whom I respect, Jay Powell, but for the next Fed chair,” he said. “Playing around with the Fed can often have adverse consequences, the absolute opposite of what you might be hoping for.”Dimon’s remarks came as Bessent told Bloomberg TV that the White House would press ahead with choosing a replacement for Powell. “There are a lot of great candidates. And we’ll see how rapidly it progresses. It’s President Trump’s decision and it will move at his speed,” he said.Powell wasgiven a round of applause by fellow central bankersat a European Central Bank conference earlier this month in Sintra, Portugal, when he was asked about the president’s attacks.White House insiders have sent conflicting signals about Powell’s future. Bessent suggested Trump would not sack the Fed chair.“President Trump’s said numerous times he is not going to fire Jay Powell,” the treasury secretary said, adding: “I think an independent central bank is very important for the conduct of monetary policy.”But Kevin Hassett, director of Trump’s national economic council, said over the weekend that removing Powell was “being looked into”. Hassett is regarded as a potential contender for the role himself.Fed independence is seen as crucial to maintaining investors’ confidence, with policymakers deemed more likely to be able to bring inflation under control without political interference.Trump’s earlier attacks on Powell were seen as one factor behind the bond market selloff on Wall Street in April that led to the 90-day “pause” on tariffs – a deadline that has since been extended from 9 July to 1 August.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveJamie DimonJerome PowellUS economyDonald TrumpInflationTrump tariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone will have to contribute to the effort.”France is under pressure to bring its public deficit, running at 5.8% of GDP, under the 3% figure required by EU rules, and to rein in €3.3tn of public debt – on which the annual interest, of €60bn, could soon become its biggest budget outlay.The debt mountain represented a “mortal danger” for a country “on a cliff edge” and “still addicted to public spending”, Bayrou said, outlining steps he said would cut €43.8bn from the budget, reducing the deficit to 4.6% next year and 3% by 2029.Other measures would include an across-the-board freeze on government spending except for debt servicing and the defence sector, which PresidentEmmanuel Macrondemanded should be increased by €3.5bn next year and more in 2027.The budget squeeze will also entail keeping pensions at their 2025 level, capping welfare spending and reducing healthcare expenditure by €5bn. Civil service and government agency salaries would be frozen and public sector job numbers cut.The move to scrap public holidays is likely to meet strong resistance, although France has previously discussed combiningVE Daywith Armistice Day on 11 November, creating a single memorial day for the victims of the first and second world wars.“Cancelling two holidays is a direct attack on our history, our roots and on working France,” said Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally (RN), the largest single party in parliament. “No RN MP will accept a measure that amounts to provocation.”Other party leaders were equally damning. The proposals were “an organised hold-up”, said Fabien Roussel of the French Communist party. Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left LFI said it was “time to expel Bayrou” and “end this destruction, these injustices”.A Socialist party MP, Boris Vallaud, condemned it as “a brutal and unacceptable budget”. He added: “Asking always more from those who have little, and so little from those who have much, is neither serious, effective, nor just.”Macron’s decision to call a snap election last year delivered a hung parliament in which Bayrou does not have enough votes to pass a budget without the support of the left or the right, both of which oppose his proposals for different reasons.Without an agreement, the veteran prime minister could face a no-confidence motion similar to the one that toppled his predecessor, Michel Barnier, as early as October, when his detailed budget bill is due to go before to parliament.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronVE DayEasternewsShareReuse this content"

Without a firm, tangible and verifiable commitment from Iran, we will do so by the end of August at the latest.”Europeans have been largely elbowed aside from the Iranian nuclear issue by Donald Trump, who ordered the bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites last month, and this intervention can be seen as an attempt to reassert Europe’s influence.The end of August deadline starts a process that could lead to an armoury of sanctions being reimposed by 15 October, giving European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal – the UK, France and Germany – a continuing lever in negotiations with Iran. The European powers want to see the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate to Iran, in part to prevent Iran trying to reconfigure its nuclear programme after the damage inflicted by the US strikes in June.The way in which the 2015 nuclear deal was negotiated does not allow the other signatories, China or Russia, to veto the sanctions snapback, but the European states can defer the imposition of snapback beyond October to allow time for further consultation.The US, after leaving the nuclear deal in 2018, also cannot veto the UK or French move. The sanctions snapback would be triggered under chapter seven of the UN charter, making the reinstatement of six UN resolutions mandatory, including one that requires Iran to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, including at the research and development level.Another reimposed resolution would require all UN member states to prevent the transfer of any items, materials or technologies that could serve these activities or Iran’s missile programme.Iranian sanctions experts claim the reinstated resolutions would not automatically halt all Iranian oil exports, cut off Iran’s access to international financial systems, or cut off general trade communications. But all countries and international financial institutions would have to refrain from providing financial assistance, new commitments or preferential loans to the Iranian government, except for humanitarian and development purposes.Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, said recently that the activation of snapback “will mean the end of Europe’s role in the Iranian nuclear issue and may be the darkest point in the history of Iran’s relations with the three European countries, a point that may never be repaired.” He said: “It would mark the end of Europe’s role as a mediator between Iran and the US.”He told diplomats at the weekend “One of the big mistakes of the Europeans is that they think that the ‘snapback’ tool in their hands gives them the power to act on the Iranian nuclear issue, while this is a completely wrong perception. If these countries move towards snapback, they will make the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue even more complicated and difficult.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealIranMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

And now he’s on a mission to get the government to make Activate compulsory viewing in schoolsStuart HeritageTue 15 Jul 2025 05.36 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 05.38 EDTShareJoe Wicks is doing some burpees. He is being his usual Joe Wicks self, shouting matey encouragement as his lustrous hair bobs up and down in time. If you watchedPE With Joe, his daily lockdown-era YouTube series, it will be familiar. However, there is one important distinction. Wicks is now exercising in a void, surrounded by fuzzy little aliens. Welcome to Activate, his new frontier in getting children moving.“Obviously, PE With Joe had so much impact, and I’m so proud of that,” Wicks says over Zoom. “But I had this niggling feeling that I couldn’t do this for ever. I can’t visit every school because thousands and thousands apply for me to visit every year.”View image in fullscreenThe first episode of Activate is being launched on The Body Coach YouTube channel.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for ActivateActivate is Wicks’ answer to this problem. A collaboration with Studio AKA, which makes the magnificent Hey Duggee, it’s a series of five-minute animated workout videos in which he appears as a bright, animated avatar, guiding the viewer through a set of bodyweight exercises. These are no joke; the first episode is a lightly punishing round of squats, star jumps and burpees that would probably reduce a lot of adults to sweaty puddles.Activate is fun, visually beautiful and committed to making kids more active. In other words, it’s classic public service broadcasting. Which makes it even more baffling that nobody wanted anything to do with it at first.“No broadcaster could recognise or identify where it would go in their scheduling,” says Sue Goffe, CEO of Studio AKA. “We just kept getting turned down by everybody.”“We tried, man, we really, really tried,” sighs Wicks. “People loved it, but weren’t willing to invest. So we said, ‘You know what? We gotta make this happen ourselves.’”View image in fullscreenJoe Wicks poses with the Activate aliens.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for Activate“Joe and [his brother] Nikki are contagious,” says Goffe. “They are a delightful, formidable duo of energy, compassion and kindness. You can’t be unaffected by it, so we had to carry on. Roll forward to where we are now and we could never have imagined we would be here.”Where they are now is onYouTube. A few years ago, this would have been seen as a defeat but, in the past year or so, YouTube has become arguably the most dominant method of content consumption on Earth. Much of its colossal audience comprises kids, so now there’s a real sense that Activate is meeting its target audience where it lives.Furthermore, as soon as the first episode was complete, partners started rolling in. Universal Music has lent the series its catalogue – the first episode is soundtracked by Elton John’s I’m Still Standing – and now it has partnered with the British government. Wes Streeting, the secretary of state for health and social care, was at the launch this week, and there are pledges to fund and promote the next batch of episodes.I poke Wicks a bit, try to get him to gloat over all the broadcasters that turned him down, but he’s having none of it. “Success for me isn’t government backing,” he says. “The win for me is more kids exercising and doing these at home with their parents, doing them in school.”“I really think this is going to make a big difference to children’s health,” adds Goffe. “You know, it’s a big issue. One in five children are leaving school with obesity. That’s a terrible statistic. If we can contribute to making content that makes a difference, that’s a win.”View image in fullscreenActivate aims to reach schools and families across the UK.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for ActivateIt’s only natural that Activate will be compared with PE With Joe, and for good reason. That was the moment when Wicks – then a fitness instructor with boundless ambition and infinite enthusiasm for taking his top off – became a national treasure. He is now as synonymous with lockdown as banana bread and hitting saucepans on the doorstep. But PE With Joe had two things Activate doesn’t. First, it was just Wicks filming himself in his living room so it was cheap to make. Second, it gave lots of bored people an opportunity to spend some of their day looking atJoe Wicks. Meanwhile, Activate is expensive to produce and shows Wicks as a cartoony animation.This is something the producers wrestled with. “We were always trying to figure out, well, why is it animated?” says Kristian Andrews, who directed the series with Marcus Armitage. “Obviously, Joe has a massively successful schools tour where he’s engaging with kids, but he is just one person. And we pretty quickly realised when we were having these conversations with various broadcasters that, actually, not everyone knows Joe Wicks. Also he’s not, you know, the face of diversity. That was an opportunity to broaden it out by giving him some funny little characters to exercise with.”Plus, like everyone, Wicks isn’t getting any younger. “I love what I do, but there’s going to come a time where I probably can’t film the high-intensity HiiT workouts any more,” he says. “This is a scalable way of getting into schools, getting into homes.”But simple immortality isn’t enough for Wicks. He has far greater ambitions. “My dream, my moonshot, is that the education department makes it compulsory that every single day kids in primary schools do an Activate,” he adds. “That could really lift their mood and their focus – and their grades and their mental health – beyond anything else. I’m going to really push for that.”View image in fullscreenWes Streeting (centre back) and Joe Wicks (centre middle) with pupils and Activate characters.Photograph: Ben Montgomery/Getty Images for ActivateEven without a government initiative, this would seem likely. Primary teachers are crying out for cheap, quick and easy ways to get children moving. Plenty of schools already do a Daily Mile, where pupils go outside and walk around but, to the uninitiated, this tends to have an air of prison exercise. Something as vibrant and fun as Activate could change all that. Having a five-minute break between subjects to jump up and down at the behest of some irresistibly cute animated Minionesque characters seems a no-brainer.There will be more episodes after this first batch and the nature of how they are produced – they are, in their most essential terms, a series of looping animations – means they will become cheaper to make. This is a good thing, because everyone involved has high hopes for Activate. There are suggestions that, through the Universal partnership, musical acts will want to collaborate in animated form. And, although the current focus is on the UK, there are hopes the idea will translate internationally. But, at its core, Activate will always be a manifestation of one man’s desire to change the world five minutes at a time.“I have a genuine love for it,” Wicks says of his desire to get kids moving. “You might not love everything I say, or I might piss you off, but my intentions are good – and my intention is to help people. This is the most exciting thing I’m working on. PE With Joe, that moment is gone. I always said I’ll never do anything more meaningful than that. But if I can create change in the education system and push to make exercise the number one priority, I think that could be my greatest achievement.”Activate is on YouTube nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionJoe WicksFitnessChildrenHealthObesityYouTubefeaturesShareReuse this content"

As with professional athletes, there are dancers who show remarkable potential at a young age, some of whom make the grade and some of whom fade away.Though she was taken to ballet lessons aged three by her mother, who had herself wanted to dance, Yonezawa insists she was far from a natural ballerina at first.“I loved moving my body to music at nursery school. But ballet begins with putting your feet in some very awkward positions. I was often the slowest in the class to get them right,” recalls Yonezawa, speaking in Tokyo as the NBJ prepares for its first UK tour.View image in fullscreenStudents from the New National Theatre Ballet School take part in a daily class.

After Yonezawa’s parents separated, she moved with her mother from Tokyo to Nagoya, where she began to dance. But it took around a decade before she fell under ballet’s spell.Japan itself is something of a late ballet bloomer. Introduced from Europe in the early 20th century, ballet began to gain traction after the second world war. By the 1970s, Japan was producing exceptional dancers, including Yoko Morishita, who nearly all moved overseas to fulfil their ambitions. It was not until the NBJ’s founding in 1997 in conjunction with the New National Theatre in Tokyo that Japan had a resident ballet company.View image in fullscreenThe theatre during preparations between a matinee and evening performanceView image in fullscreenSpotlights cross as the company perform EtudesI made my way up to the heavens to shoot from the lighting gallery occupied by four follow-spot technicians, each clasping their own massive light cannon.

In 1995, she became the first Japanese ballerina to be a principal dancer at the Royal Ballet. Taking her acclaimed original production of Adolphe Adam’s Giselle to theRoyal Opera Houserepresents something akin to a homecoming for Yoshida, while being the company’s first full overseas tour (it has previously staged guest performances at Washington’s Kennedy Center and Moscow’s Bolshoi).Yonezawa is set to be the lead dancer for a couple of the Covent Garden performances of Giselle, a piece she finds both challenging and absorbing.View image in fullscreenThe National Ballet of Japan perform The Firebird, during a performance of Ballet Coffret, a triple bill showcasing 20th-century masterpiecesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAyako Ono as the Firebird, and Haruka Yoshida during EtudesI photographed the first show almost entirely from one position in the stalls, in order to get to know the productions and begin to plan how I might shoot the next four performancesDavid LeveneView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenNational Ballet of Japan perform EtudesView image in fullscreenNational Ballet of Japan perform Etudes“The first and second acts are completely different. Not just physically, but in the entire world they portray. Act 1 is the real world, and Act 2 is the afterlife. I go from a living person to something like a ghost, close to what we call ayureiin Japanese,” explains Yonezawa. “My body and inner self transform; Giselle’s love for Albrecht is the only constant. But even that evolves, from infatuation and excitement in Act 1 to something deeper, more eternal in Act 2. That enduring love becomes the theme.”She adds that every dancer interprets Giselle differently and that attempting to imitate other performances is a hiding to nothing.I often end up choosing the same pair of shoes, but I still go through the process each time ... it helps me tune inYui Yonezawa“Beautiful form isn’t enough. The relationship with your partner, your individual interpretation; it’s all essential. The smallest shift in emotion can change the audience’s perception. If you try to plan it too much, it feels fake. This makes it a very difficult work,” says Yonezawa.Although she danced for three years in the US, this will be her first lead role overseas, at a venue where Yonezawa says every ballet dancer dreams of performing. To prepare herself, she will rely on the same routine that has kept her, remarkably, injury-free for decades in an art form infamous for taking a heavy toll on the bodies of its star performers. That preparation was captured by David Levene over three March days in Tokyo as the company staged Ballet Coffret at its home theatre.“I’m certified in Gyrokinesis training [a method of opening up joints and muscles without overtaxing them that borrows from yoga], so I usually do that in the dressing room,” says Yonezawa.View image in fullscreenYonezawa trying on three pairs of ballet shoesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYonezawa prepares in her dressing room, and eating beetroot powder before a performanceView image in fullscreenYonezawa squeezes through a doorway in the costume for The Vertiginous Thrill of ExactitudeView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFinal adjustments for Yonezawa, and with the stage manager on his last day after 25 yearsView image in fullscreenYonezawa is exhausted after performing the very demanding production of The Vertiginous Thrill of ExactitudeShe also tries on three pairs of ballet shoes to see which one feels right for her body that day.“I often end up choosing the same pair, but I still go through the process each time,” she recounts with a laugh. “It helps me tune in.”A recent addition to her routine is eating beetroot powder a couple of hours before each performance. She believes it boosts endurance and suppresses blood pressure spikes triggered by the rigours of ballet.

The fact that ballet performances can connect with audiences across national and linguistic borders is one of the aspects of her art that she loves most deeply.“And in something like Act 2 of Giselle, when women in white costumes appear en pointe, it creates a world beyond our human one, without props – just with body,” Yonezawa says. “Expressing such spiritual form through this art shows the beauty of what ballet is.”View image in fullscreenA final curtain call for EtudesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenCurtain call during The Firebird, and audience applauseCurtain calls were monumental - advancing and retreating again and again, seemingly never-ending, back and forthDavid LeveneExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayBalletRoyal Opera HouseDanceJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It’s a follow-up of sorts toDora and the Lost City of Gold from 2019, with a new star in the shape of Samantha Lorraine, and aimed at slightly older kids than the cartoon. There are action sequences looted from Raiders of the Lost Ark that had my eight-year-old squealing at the screen, though as it’s determined to be undemanding and inoffensive, it’s got that plasticky quality that middling kids’ films tend to have.Lorraine plays Dora, a teenage explorer who’s grown up in the Amazon, raised on her grandfather’s stories about the Incas. For years, Dora has been searching for clues to find Sol Dorado, a legendary golden sun that will grant one wish, joined by her cousin Diego (Jacob Rodriguez). The scriptwriters deserve credit for resisting the temptation to bolt on a love interest; instead, we have cousin Diego in the role conventionally given to a female character: the pretty but non-essential sidekick.The movie’s villain is celebrity archaeologist Camilla the Crusader (Daniella Pineda) who runs a theme park called Jungle World, where Dora and Diego have summer jobs. When the pair go off in search of Sol Dorado with their pals, Camilla dispatches a band of desperadoes to chase them through Inca tombs booby-trapped with giant bugs and spiked floors. The movie is not lacking in adventure, perhaps what’s missing is a sense of fun. Dora didn’t have the kids hooting with laughter like they did at the real Indiana Jones.Dora and the Search for Sol Dorado is on Paramount+ now.Explore more on these topicsFilmAction and adventure filmsTelevisionreviewsShareReuse this content"

However, half a century of Jaws also means half a century of Jaws sequels, which is a different kind of fun. This week, Netflix has gathered together all four films for viewers to enjoy at leisure. The question is, which should you watch? The peerless original? Jaws 2, which is more or less a remake of the first? Jaws 3, which was shot for 3D seemingly just for the scene where a shark is exploded? Or Jaws: The Revenge, in which a shark with a vendetta chases Michael Caine around the Bahamas?

This stunning 1960 British noir has plenty going for it, like its tight, hardboiled plot – an inspector is tasked with tracking down a murderer after a jailbreak – and the gruffly unsentimental performances from Stanley Baker and John Crawford. It deserves to be rediscovered and heralded as a classic. However, Hell Is a City was also shot in Manchester – rare for a film – and provides a wonderful snapshot of the city 65 years ago.

Ghosted hews close to the template, to the point of feeling like a tribute act – but unfortunately not the kind of tribute act that sells out arenas but the kind that plays down the Dog & Duck of a Saturday night.Mercy (Jade Asha) is unhappily single, on the hunt for Mr Right, and hoping to improve her career (ideally from waitress to international acting superstar). Part of the film’s problem is that Bridget Jones’ Diary is of its time, and to hear a 30-year-old supposedly modern and progressive heroine in 2025 complain that she is a decade older than the majority of singles definitely feels dated. Thirty in 2025 is not the same as 30 in the 1990s, and it’s peculiar to watch someone today bemoan it as the end of their youth.It also doesn’t help that the Ghosted’s narration borrows so overtly from Bridget-speak, including the dropping of personal pronouns and definite articles as in the original – but without a diary as the prop, the point of these pleasing abbreviations vanishes completely. Meanwhile the attempts to wring the same humour from pratfalls and workplace calamities fails utterly.Bridget Jones’s Diary at 20: a gloriously messy ode to imperfectionRead morePerhaps worst of all, Mercy is still drawn to a cad long after he reveals himself to be dodgy. It’s as if Bridget had responded to Daniel Cleaver’s cheating not with vodka and Chaka Khan but by inventing terrible excuses for why it was OK and by letting herself be treated like a doormat. It may be true to how people behave in real life, but if you’re trying to create a fun romantic comedy, you need a perfectly imperfect heroine you can cheer on.Ghosted is on digital platforms from 21 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

There’s a more culpably hammy performance from Jamie Foxx, who rocks a ginormous, weirdly contoured afro so bizarre that it’s almost worth the price alone. (He is also one of many executive producers on the project.) But Foxx’s tonsorial effort is not enough to counteract the fact that this is a pretty lousy film, only worth it if you like “sneerwatching”.None of the big names mentioned above play the lead here. Instead, the hero is one Nash Cavanaugh (a name that sounds generated by an AI bot), as incarnated by a typically lumpen Scott Eastwood. Cavanaugh is a former soldier who was once drawn into the cult created by Foxx’s Leon Prudhomme, also known by his much cooler cult leader moniker, the Bokushi (“pastor” in Japanese). It turns out Prudhomme was originally bankrolled by De Niro’s Ashburn, a shady government agent who had hoped to create a mercenary army. But the Bokushi has instead created his own private Jonestown, full of other ex-soldiers sold on his self-help preaching about how PTSD need not define them, or something like that. What makes him so charismatic is never well defined, but presumably the veterans must be smitten with his R&B-inflected gospel crooning with a special backup band – a vanity moment that’s pure cringe.Viewers will have to pay close attention to parse out all the different timelines that the diced editing keeps flipping back and forth between. In the film’s present, Cavanaugh is approached by Ashburn to infiltrate the Bokushi’s compound with other secret agents before the FBI messes everything up with their own raid. Cavanaugh is hoping he’ll find his wife Evoli (Nora Arnezeder), who is either still part of the cult and will therefore need deprogramming, or is being held against her will. The murkily lensed climax involves, judging by the sound effects, a lot of rushing water and explosions, because only primal forces of such power could vanquish the Bokushi’s mighty hairdo.Tin Soldier is on Prime Video from 23 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsJamie FoxxRobert De NiroreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the 43rd year of my earthly course, as I was gazing with great fear and trembling attention at a heavenly vision, I saw a great splendour in which resounded a voice from Heaven saying to me, ‘O fragile human, ashes of ashes, and filth of filth! Say and write what you see and hear.”These are the words of 12th-century polymath Hildegard von Bingen (or Hildegard of Bingen), recalling the divine intervention that set her on the path to becoming one of history’s earliest and most influential composers.Hildegard has inspired reamsof scholarship and writing, films and even perfume, but right now her presence is most keenly felt in music, where her work has transcended the silos of early and classical music to influence experimental and feminist artists. “I felt an instant connection both earthly and unearthly,” the radical neo-medieval musicianLaura Cannellsays of Hildegard’s music. “It was like making a really good friend or falling in love. I can find darkness and light in it; it seems to be the perfect accompaniment to so much of life. My favourite quote from her is: ‘Even in a world that’s being shipwrecked, remain brave and strong.’ This optimism is needed.”In the last year, Hildegard has also inspired recordings by alt-popper Julia Holter, ambient experimentalists Larum, Catalan duo Tarta Relena and jazz duo Noah Preminger and Rob Garcia. Go back a few more years and the list expands to include New York vocalist Daisy Press – who combines Hildegard’s music with Hindustani ragas and performs it at sites from catacombs to Burning Man – as well as new age harpist Arianna Savall, experimental vocalist Megan Mitchell, Korean American sound artist Bora Yoon, and the doom metal musician Lingua Ignota, who was named after Hildegard’s mystical language. The abbess also inspired a 22-minute electric guitar piece by New Zealand underground stalwart Roy Montgomery, while folk-pop singer Devendra Banhart wrote Für Hildegard Von Bingen, which imagined her leaving her abbey behind and working on MTV. Grimes locked herself away like Hildegard for her 2012 album Visions, and in the 1990s even David Lynch produced an album of her music, performed by Jocelyn West (then Jocelyn Montgomery) of Miranda Sex Garden.But Hildegard’s big break didn’t come until almost nine centuries after she was born, with the 1985 recording A Feather on the Breath of God, directed by Christopher Page with soprano Emma Kirkby and Gothic Voices. Not much was expected of the release – “Lovely music, shame no one will buy it,” the sound engineer apparently said – but it sold in enormous numbers, clocked up accolades including a Gramophone award, and was sampled in club tracks by Orbital and the Beloved. It is still being repressed (most recently in 2024), and after that success, Hildegard releases began stacking up.View image in fullscreenWildly fruitful … engraving of Sister Hildegard by W Marshall in Fuller’s Holy State (1648)Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe rediscovery was perhaps inevitable. Although she wasn’t included in many musical histories until relatively recently, and was only fully canonised as a saint in 2012, we actually know a lot about Hildegard’s life. She was born in 1098 to a wealthy family, then taken into the care of a nun at Disibodenberg monastery in Germany’s Rhineland. She had already had visions from age three – neurologist Oliver Sacks suggested they were caused by migraines – but kept them private until appointed an abbess in her 40s. Medieval life expectancy meant these ought to have been her twilight years, but in fact the appointment triggered decades of wildly fruitful output. Her divine visions were transcribed; she wrote works on a raft of subjects; popes, kings and penitents sought her guidance.Her biographer,Fiona Maddocks, wrote that in order to fully get to grips with Hildegard’s output she would have liked to have become specialist in “12th-century Germany, medieval Latin, ecclesiastical history, the history of science and medicine, botany, mineralogy and petrology, zoology and theology, mysticism, music, painting and monastic architecture”. Hildegard is sometimes named the first composer in music history – although earlier names have since emerged – and is claimed as a feminist hero, radical polymath, ecological pioneer and, in some readings, queer icon, for the way she wrote of her love for her female mentors and peers.Her output comprises 77 liturgical, or plainsong, chants, known as her Symphonia, as well as a morality play with music that recounts the temptations of the flesh and the journey of a soul.Maddocks writesthat her music, with mellifluous melodies ornamenting the texts, “comes close to sounding like improvisation, developing organically rather than systematically”. Itfeelsfreeform in structure, soaring like a hawk in flight, tracing graceful patterns in the air and climbing to the heavens.Visionaries do things that stand outside of tradition – so their work has a timeless feelingJulia HolterHildegard’s melodies attracted Julia Holter, who drew on her work for the2024 song Materia. “Her melodic leaps create a singular harmonic world,” Holter says. “I’m always trying to write more melismatically – using more notes per syllable – and a lot of her music feels very melismatic.” Cannell, who has made various recordings drawing on Hildegard’s work, including an album in 2024, agrees: “There is so much movement, even if it’s not necessarily fast paced music. The melodies lift off straight away.”Part of the reason Hildegard resonates with contemporary musicians is that her music predates standardised tunings, so it often has an unfamiliar feel. We also don’t know exactly how it should be performed. Things such as pace, harmony or accompaniment are an open question, left to arrangers and performers to decide.View image in fullscreenJewelled and rich … a 13th-century illumination of Hildegard from the Biblioteca Governativa in Lucca, Tuscany.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori/Getty ImagesFor all her skill, Hildegard wouldn’t have thought of herself as a composer – that term is ours – and debate rages in some quarters over whether she wrote her music at all. It’s possible the compositions were simply attributed to her as the head of her organisation, like a High Middle Ages version of Damien Hirst. I ask Maddocks about this and she is open minded: “How do we judge, say, a poem by ‘Anon’? Or think of Mozart’s Requiem – one of his most popular works, finished by someone else? Does it matter, or can we accept it on its own terms?”One of Maddocks’ favourite pieces is Columba Aspexit, for its opening line which translates roughly as “The dove flew through the lattice window”. “The titles are always so vivid and the language is so purple, so jewelled and rich,” she says. “Even if its origins are biblical, there’s a great feeling of the [Bible book] Song of Songs, and some very poetic language.”Hildegard’s poetic visions inspired the multisensory opera the artist and musician Nwando Ebizie has been developing since 2019, called Hildegard: Visions. She relates Hildegard’s hallucinations to her own experience of a neurological syndrome called visual snow. “People with visual snow syndrome are known to have breakdowns or feel like the world isn’t real,” Ebizie explains, which is why she became interested in Hildegard’s breakdown. “Her whole body was racked with pain, she couldn’t do anything. Then a clear mission came from God, and in her 40s she had this great flourishing, because she went her own way.” Hildegard’s music wasn’t written in spite of her breakdown but because of it: “It was related to her unique perception, and connection with spirituality.”Holter thinks the visions are what fascinate us today: “People are interested in unique perspectives, with a greater understanding and interest in neurodiversity ... Anytime you have ‘visionaries’ who do things that stand outside of tradition, their work can have a kind of timeless feeling.” For Cannell, too, Hildegard’s breaking of convention makes her a hero. “So often women are curtailed by expectations around what is ‘too much’, or what’s acceptable in society,” she says, but with Hildegard, “we can look back through the centuries and see a woman both prolific and inspirational. She made stuff, and she connected with people.”This article was amended on 15 July 2025 to refer to Hildegard von Bingen as Hildegard at subsequent mentions, rather than Von Bingen.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockClassical musicExperimental musicReligionChristianityGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Luminaries of this new ‘Cold Oi’ scene explain the music’s eternal, anthemic appealTamlin MageeTue 15 Jul 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 07.21 EDTShareWearing washed 501 jeans, buzzcuts, boots and braces, punks and skinheads are packed into a small and sweaty venue. They’re pogoing to power chords and shouting along to the terrace-style chants coming from the stage.But this isn’t London’s 100 Club in 1978, it’s a gig by French band Syndrome 81 in the suburbs of Paris in 2025. They sound like a surprising but appealing mash-up of Cockney Rejects and the Cult. And they are part of a new wave of French Oi! punk bands who are blending scrappy, working-class angst with a firm nod to the country’s synth-soaked coldwave past.In the UK in the 1970s, Oi! erupted as a wave of rowdy street punk with solidly working-class roots, attracting a new set of skinhead fans with its simple but upbeat sounds, pairing power-chord riffing with anthemic vocals.Yet from Bordeaux to Brest, from Lyon and Lille to Paris, countless new additions to France’s punk scene are breathing post-punk and new wave influences into the genre. There are Rancoeur, with sparse post-punk, punchy basslines upfront in the mix, and there are Oi Boys, and Rixe, with their drum-machine-driven rhythms. Bands such as Chiaroscuro fuse typical Oi! snarls with darker melodies, while Utopie opt for frosty lo-fi riffing and uptempo synth-punks No Filter throw quasi-industrial keyboard twinkling into the mix.View image in fullscreen‘I never thought it would speak to people abroad’ … Syndrome 81.Photograph: Rick HardotThese bands gleefully experiment with Oi!’s common motifs, layering back-and-forth gang vocals over catchy synth hooks – variously construed as a whole new genre: French Oi, or sometimes Cold Oi, though the bands themselves often balk at such labels.And unlike the British scene that influenced them, these French bands are uniformly antifascist. Some, like Rancoeur, have vocally distanced themselves from the genre’shistoric far-right associations, after realising that some of their followers on social media were racist.France and England, with their landscapes deformed by industrialisation and unemployment, both have musical periods marked by angerThese post-punk currents kicked off across France in earnest about a decade ago, with groups including Zone Infinie, Traitre, Douche Froide, Litovsk and Hinin. Since then, this new wave of French Oi! bands have gained a zeitgeisty following in the international punk underground. Although the approaches of these bands differ, they tend to share some common notes: heavy on the atmosphere and with a broadly minimalist output, played with melancholic feeling and a lower tempo.The slowed-down sound of Syndrome 81, whose 2022 LP Prisons Imaginaires was met with acclaim, was “an accident, to be honest”, admits vocalist Fabrice Le Roux. The usual drummer for the group was unable to attend rehearsals, forcing the band to write slower songs that they could actually play.Misunderstood or hateful? Oi!’s rise and fallRead moreOther bands have leaned heavily into electronic influences. Matthieu Pellerin of Oi Boys picked a Yamaha rhythm box to bring a “cold and martial aesthetic” into their music. Rancoeur, meanwhile, started life as classic Oi! in the vein of Welsh band the Oppressed. But during Covid, says bassist and singer Julien Viala, the whole group started listening to post-punk and coldwave. When they could finally rehearse after lockdowns lifted, they all “arrived with new effects on our guitars”, and that’s when they named their sound “Cold Oi”, possibly coining the phrase.View image in fullscreenRancœur, originators of the term ‘Coil Oi’.Crucially, these bands singen français– something Syndrome 81’s Le Roux was sceptical about at first. “I thought singing in French could be sketchy,” he says. “Some bands are very good but when you listen to the lyrics, it sounds dumb and shitty. I never thought it would speak to people abroad.”But speak to people abroad it has. Multiple comments on widely streamed YouTube playlists and in online punk communities proclaim the superiority of French-sung Oi!, while even monolingual gig-goers attending tours in the US do their best to sing along in the language.While this gloom-tinged Oi! is having a moment in France, its influences run deeper. In the UK, after a fissure in classic Derbyshire Oi! band Blitz, the remaining members steered so abruptly into post-punk and new wave that they shed many of their fans in the process. But “Blitz opened the doors to new influences between Oi! and post-punk”, says Julien Viala of Rancoeur. “Every band tries to do something new. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t. We’re lucky to have a strong French punk history and I think a lot of new bands are inspired by old bands.”In France, 1980s Oi! bands such as Orléans’ Komintern Sect and Bordeaux’s Camera Silens – whose bassist and singer Gilles Bertin notoriously robbed a cash-handling company in Toulouse before going on the lam – are infused with a darker, heavily reverberated edge.Further back still, France has not only flirted with the punk avant garde but helped to define it, says Andrew Hussey, a historian of French culture and punk. “There was a lot of crossover between art, literature and rock music,” says Hussey, helping to drive more experimental sounds.Although influenced by UK bands such as the Clash, the pioneering French punks Métal Urbain plumped for a machine over a human drummer in the mid-1970s. These proto-industrial leanings influenced other French bands such as Bérurier Noir, who, at their most idiosyncratic and weird, create an uncanny kind of punk with mechanical beats.Le coldwave,meanwhile, with its icy guitars and synth melodies,was born in the late 1970s – a mixture of post-punk and new wave pop exemplified by bands such as Asylum Party and Marquis de Sade. All together, says Hussey, these new French Oi! bands take the real working-class energy of historic French punk and “graft it on to this European sensibility” with additional coldwave flair.How an 80s punk lyric became the rallying cry of French protests against the far rightRead morePellerin – who has retired Oi Boys but will soon release a new synth-driven Oi! band calledNuits Blanches, with members from Rixe and Headbussa – credits the shared commonalities of France and the UK with birthing these sounds. “Blitz were making Oi-wave in the early 80s,” he says. “France and England, with their pasts of struggle, of landscapes deformed by industrialisation, unemployment rates and endless autumns, have musical periods marked by anger.”That can be found in the UK post-punk of the late 1970s, he says, just as it can in the French emo scene of the early 00s or in this new crop of French Oi! bands. “With disillusioned voices over minor chords, there’s less of a tautological relationship, and a kind of subtlety to the music,” Pellerin says. “And it makes me happy that internationally, people are interested in France for all this too.”Explore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockFrancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

The powerful spy organization’s history is rich with failures and abuses – from the Cuban missile crisis to the post-9/11 torture program to its role in the overthrow of a long string of democratically elected leaders. But among the many consequences ofDonald Trump’s open hostility toward America’s intelligence community is that no less a CIA critic than Tim Weinernow sounds like a defender.To understand why, Weiner – author of the unsparing history of the agency, the 2007 bestseller Legacy of Ashes–suggested a thought experiment in a recent interview: imagine spending years as an intelligence officer, working diligently to subvert the Kremlin, only to watch the US stand with Russia, Iran and North Korea, as it did in February when it voted against a UN resolution condemning the invasion of Ukraine. In that moment, Weiner said: “You come to the realization, if you hadn’t already: ‘My God, the president of the United States has gone over to the other side. He has joined the authoritarian axis.’”I’m not known as a great defender of the CIA but neither am I a defender of willful ignoranceTim WeinerWeiner was sitting on the patio of his Brooklyn apartment, a sunny book-lined penthouse purchased with some of the proceeds of Legacy,the 700-page tome that, to his evident surprise, became one of the unlikeliest beach reads in recent memory. A former national security reporter for the New York Times,the author has spent nearly four decades laboring to unlock the agency’s secrets. His latest book, The Mission,which is out on Tuesday, is something of a sequel, picking up where Legacy left off to examine the evolution of theCIAsince 9/11. Based on interviews with numerous CIA officials (including, improbably, current deputy director for operations Tom Sylvester), it’s the story of an organization purpose-built for a bygone era, still adrift more than a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, failing to spot the emergence of a formidable new adversary in Al-Qaida, and then playing a panicked and catastrophic game of catchup. The results included misbegotten intel about WMDs, the depraved and ineffective torture program, the failure to predict the Arab spring and other screwups.But it’s the book’s final chapters, which find the organization blindsided by Russia’s influence operation on behalf of Trump’s 2016 campaign for the presidency, that readers may find most striking. Weeks before the election, Russia’s intelligence services, with an assist from WikiLeaks, began releasing a trove of hacked Democratic National Committee emails, dealing a devastating blow to Hillary Clinton’s campaign. It was, as Weiner puts it in The Mission,“an audacious act of political warfare [that] helped elect a demagogue president of the United States”. Weiner dismisses the theory that Trump is a Russian asset, but says it’s beside the point. “He’s Russia’sally.” (That said, as Putin is discovering this week, the president’s loyalties aresomewhat fluid.)The Mission by Tim Weiner review – unmasking the CIARead moreThe CIA soon embarked on a delicate balancing act: working to neutralize the very force that worked to put their new commander-in-chief in office. Tom Rakusan, then newly installed as the chief of the clandestine service, called a meeting of senior officials. “He told them, in so many word: ‘The Russians stole our fucking election. How do we make sure this never happens again?’” Weiner recounted. Agents who had spent the last 15 years working on counter-terrorism would turn their attention back to the Russian threat. “The call to arms proceeded, I’m quite confident, without his knowledge,” Weiner added, referring to Trump.Following two impeachments (and two acquittals), an insurrection and another election, Trump is back in the White House and bent on revenge. “Donald Trump hates the CIA,” Weiner said, noting that Trump considers the agency the beating heart of a “deep state” that he believes is working to undermine him. Consequently, the president has appointed “a coterie of dangerously incompetent and servile acolytes to the highest positions of national security”. Weiner describes the new CIA director, John Ratcliffe – a former personal injury attorney, Maga congressman and, briefly, director of national intelligence in Trump’s first term – as “a spineless person who will do whatever Trump tells him to do”.Shortly after we spoke, Ratcliffe ordered a review thatcriticizedthe CIA’s original report on Russia’s pro-Trump influence operation, and the former CIA director John Brennan became the subject of a criminal investigation by the FBI.The new director has also moved aggressively to implement a purge at the CIA’s Langley, Virginia, headquarters. “He’s attempting to rid the CIA of its most experienced officers,” Weiner said, “and to impose ideological purity tests. Ratcliffe said explicitly from the get-go that he aimed to align the leadership of the CIA with the president’s view of the world. Since the president’s view of the world is largely based on falsehoods and imaginary enemies, I think this will be an extremely difficult task.”View image in fullscreenTim Weiner.Photograph: Jessica D B DoyleMeanwhile, Ratcliffe dismissed hundreds of recently hired staffers and then sent their names to Elon Musk in an unclassified email that Weiner said was probably intercepted by the Russians and Chinese, who he posits are now presumably working to recruit them as spies. “All they need to do is to find people who are either deeply resentful or who might have a financial or a drug problem to be exploited.”Trump’s anti-diversity crusade will also have national security repercussions, Weiner predicted. In February, a judge allowed the administration to reassign the team responsible for diversifying the agency. “For decades, the CIA has tried to hire people who don’t look like they just got off the bus from Kansas on the very sound principle that if you want to spy in a nation like Somalia or Pakistan or China, it might be wise to have a workforce that is not made up exclusively of white guys, and who speak languages other than English,” Weiner said. “Diversity was one of the CIA’s few superpowers, and the mindless abolition of the effort to diversify the CIA’s officers and analysts was one of the most stupid self-inflicted wounds that Ratcliffe could have delivered.”Meanwhile, as Politico recently reported, alliesmay now be reluctantto share sensitive information with the US, no doubt mindful of the 2017incidentin which the president gleefully handed the Russian foreign minister a highly classified Israeli tip. “The CIA, to an extent that people rarely understand or appreciate, is really dependent on allied intelligence services,” Weiner explained. The appointment of Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, who oversees the CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies, only compounds the risk, Weiner said. Gabbard has never worked in the intelligence community and has beenaccusedof parroting Russian propaganda. “What ally would share secrets with a dangerously deluded person like that?”Weiner recognizes it might come as a surprise to some to hear him extolling the virtues of the agency he has previously skewered. “I’m not known as a great defender of the CIA but neither am I a defender of willful ignorance,” he said of the Trump administration’s seeming unconcern about the threats posed by foreign adversaries. “I do think that the mission of intelligence to divine the secrets of the enemies in the United States is worthwhile. There’s unfortunately no mechanism for defining the intentions of the president, and therein lies a danger.“What keeps me up at night,” he continued, “is the fact that Trump has put the instruments of American national security in the hands of crackpots and fools, and that their incompetence and ideological blinkers will blind them to a coming attack. If the United States gets hit again under Trump, he will destroy what is left of our democracy.” When I asked Weiner how he thought the CIA might respond to Trump’s provocations, he chuckled. “Is the CIA going to join the resistance? No,” he said flatly.That said, the spot where we sat was just blocks from the site where, weeks before, demonstrators had assembled for one of several thousand “No Kings” protests – thought to be the largest mass demonstration in US history. “We’ve learned, to our sorrow, that Robert Mueller is not going to save us,” Weiner said. “Barack Obama is not going to save us. The supreme court is not going to save us. But the other day, several million Americans marched in the street to protest the Mad King. And just as only we can defeat ourselves, I think only we can save ourselves.”The Mission by Tim Weiner is available now on Mariner BooksExplore more on these topicsPolitics booksCIAUS politicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpinterviewsShareReuse this content"

Dana A Williams, professor of African American Literature at Howard University, sets out to fill this gap, offering an impeccably researched account of Morrison’s stint at Random House between 1971 and 1983, against the backdrop of the Civil Rightsand the Black Arts movements. Reflecting ideas generated by that convergence, Morrison’s novels – described by the Nobel committee, when they awarded her the prize in literature in 1993, as giving life to an essential aspect of American reality – were driven by an unwavering belief in the possibility of African American empowerment through self-regard. Williams’s interest lies in showing how Morrison’s editorial career was informed by the same invigoratingly insular ethos. Whether writing or editing, her work was aimed at producing “explorations of interior Black life with minimal interest in talking to or being consumed by an imagined white reader”.Morrison saw early on how that kind of insularity could be wielded as both a weapon and a shield. Addressing the Second National Conference of Afro-American Writers at Howard in 1976, she urged the audience to recognise that “the survival of Black publishing, which […] is a sort of way of saying the survival of Black writing, will depend on the same things that the survival of Black anything depends on, which is the energies of Black people – sheer energy, inventiveness and innovation, tenacity, the ability to hang on, and a contempt for those huge, monolithic institutions and agencies which do obstruct us”. These words could well have been repurposed as a mission statement for her editorial career, which, as Williams points out, consisted of “[making] a revolution, one book at a time”. Change was coming in America. Morrison’s contribution would be to work towards change in the overwhelmingly white world of publishing: “I thought it was important for people to be in the streets,” she said during an interview for the documentary Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am, released in 2019. “But that couldn’t last. You needed a record. It would be my job to publish the voices, the books, the ideas of African Americans. And that would last.”Toni at Randomtraces the path that led from Morrison’s Jim Crow childhood to her storied literary career, briefly documenting her early years, during which storytelling was an “ever-present pastime”, as well as her academic life (Howard, followed by graduate studies at Cornell), before moving on to chapter-by-chapter case studies of some of the publications she oversaw during her stint at Random House. At times Williams’s book reads like a catalogue of those works, from The Black Book(a compendium of black life in America) towork by June Jordan, Lucille Clifton and Toni Cade Bambara, as well as autobiographies of Angela Davis, Huey Newton and Muhammad Ali, and Gayl Jones’sCorregidora(which was reissued in 2019). Nevertheless, it is a fascinating catalogue, not least because it is full of thrilling behind-the-scenes insights into what it took to get them published.Morrison chased blurbs and championed her projects with passion, tenacity and a moving sense of urgencyMorrison was keenly aware that success depended on proving that books such as these could sell; demand would have to be so high that, as Williams writes, “even the most recalcitrant salesperson would have no choice but to fall in line”. The first job was making sure the books were excellent. Williams provides a number of examples of Morrison’s exacting standards, including the fact that, while working on a collection of Huey Newton’s essays, she recommended deleting the weak ones and editing the rest, “even those that had been previously published”. But Morrison was also required to navigate “the irony of the need to be appealing to white people while also preserving enough distance from them to maintain Black privacy”, keeping one eye on the bottom line even while the other was on black consciousness. On one memorable occasion, when the poet Barbara Chase-Riboud stonewalled her about doing publicity (loftily describing it as “tap [dancing] for prizes and coverage”), Morrison fired off a flinty letter reminding her thatRandom Housewas “a commercial house historically unenchanted with 500 slim volumes of profound poetry that languish in stock rooms”.Morrison could be blunt when she had to be but, alongside this, Williams paints a picture of her as a fiercely protective editor, chasing blurbs and championing her projects with passion, tenacity and a moving sense of urgency, “scared that the world would fall away before somebody put together a thing that got close to the way we really are”. In addition, Williams highlights her convivial and collaborative approach, which led tothe development of close friendships with a few of her authors including, famously, Angela Davis, who lived with Morrison and her sons for a time while they worked on her autobiography.It is astonishing to consider that at the same time as doing all this Morrison was also busy raising two sons and writing her own novels, frequently leveraging her literary status in service of her editorial campaigns. Williams includes references to a 1978 interview in which Morrison hinted at how exhausting this was: “I want to stop writing around the edges of the day … in the automobile and places like that.”Which makes it even more astonishing to consider how little has changed since she fought this fight. According to Dan Sinykin, writing inLiterary Hubin October 2023: “In 1971, when Morrison became a trade editor, about 95% of the fiction published by the big commercial houses was by white authors. By 2018, that number only dropped to 89%.”In August 2024, Alexandra Alter and Elizabeth Harris pointed out in the New York Times that following the hiring of “a small but influential group” of black female editors in 2020, many had “lost their jobs or quit the business entirely … [leading] some … to question publishers’ commitment to racial inclusion”.In the UK the position is hardly any better. The fight is still necessary, and still exhausting. However, Williams’s book is a timely reminder of the need for an inward-looking response, and of the joy to be discovered along the way.Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is best when it is penetrated by Morrison’s own voice, in the form of excerpts from her correspondence. Here, for example, is Toni attempting to persuade Bill Cosby (with his reputation as yet untarnished) to write an introduction for The Black Book: “Let me just say … I want to publish books about us – black people – that will make some sense – to give joy, to pass on some grandeur to all those black children (born and unborn) who need to get to the horizon with something under their arms besides Dick and Jane and The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.” At the time she wrote those lines, I was one of those black children, and I am grateful that the books she published did exactly that. The same spirit of gratitude permeates Williams’s scholarly, informative and highly readable book.Toni at Random: The Iconic Writer’s Legendary Editorship by Dana A Williams is published by Amistad (£25).

It’s an experience that clearly informs Leila Mottley’s new novel, The Girls Who Grew Big, in which the struggles of pregnancy and motherhood loom large. Mottley’s work as a doula comes in addition to writing a bestselling debut novel,Nightcrawling, and featuring on Oprah’s Book Club; she was also youth poet laureate of Oakland, California, in 2018. But not much seems beyond the reach of the youngest ever writer to be longlisted for the Booker prize, back in 2022. The pity is that her considerable energy hasn’t translated into a more satisfying second book.The Girls Who Grew Big tells the story of a gang of teenage mothers and the impromptu community they form in the humid disarray and general dysfunction of Padua, a fictional small town in the Florida panhandle. Led by their de facto leader, Simone, the Girls are a scrappy, ostracised handful of outsiders, variously rejected by their families and harshly judged by locals. Down on their luck and often abandoned by the adults in their lives, they resourcefully become a collective, based in the back of Simone’s truck.At 20, Simone is the eldest, the mother of five-year-old twins Lion and Luck. When she finds herself unhappily pregnant again, she turns to the Girls for help. Among them is 17-year-old Emory, whose white family are appalled by her black boyfriend. She comes to the Girls when struggling to breastfeed her baby boy, Kai, and finds practical advice, sisterhood and support. Then new girl Adela washes up in town: a champion swimmer with college ambitions, exiled from her former life by an unplanned pregnancy and sent to stay with her grandmother for nine months. Emory is immediately infatuated, and soon the Girls find their community disrupted.Those are the bones of the book, and there’s clearly something potent here: the raw lives of teenage mothers, the fierce bonds forged in adversity, the alarmingly unequal access to good-quality maternity care in contemporary America. And yet The Girls Who Grew Big ultimately lands awkwardly, emerging as a mawkish paean to motherhood. This is a well-meant novel about decent things – sisterhood and solidarity – but its sentiment is never more sophisticated than this, and the writing too often sinks into the syrupy. Nightcrawling, Mottley’s novel about an impoverished teenage sex worker in Oakland who ends up at the centre of a police corruption case, was a startling debut: miraculously lucid, politically pointed and tenderly wrought. But in The Girls Who Grew Big, when Mottley reaches for gritty realism, she often gives us something that feels gratuitous instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s certainly striking, but it also reads like an unnecessary provocation. Simone reasons that her teeth are preferable to her boyfriend’s dirty pocket knife, “crusted in dried brown blood, shed fur from some long-dead animal, and Lord knows how many fishes’ yellowed intestines”, as Mottley seems intent on challenging the reader from the first. Later, calling in a favour, Simone reminds Emory that she “sucked on her nipple just last week to get a clogged duct to flow again”. Birth is messy and women’s bodies are unruly: Mottley insists we confront this. Her prose relishes the blood and milk, straight talk sometimes curdling into something more callow and needlessly graphic.Setting the novel in Florida allows Mottley dramatic licence and she makes the most of it. She has a hurricane hit Padua, and the Girls flee from it in their wildly veering vehicle. A storm fells a tree, which inconveniently closes the local Planned Parenthood clinic. An alligator turns up at Emory’s high school like a bad omen. An orca beaches itself as if summoned by the novel’s own need for symbolism and the Girls duly scramble to save it. Drama is Mottley’s preferred mode, and the set pieces – a cat fight between Adela and Simone; a tense reveal between Adela and her new boyfriend – feel melodramatic rather than real.But the Mottley of Nightcrawling is here too, writing with poetic clarity in fleeting moments. She is excellent at capturing the mysterious quality of this neglected patch of Florida: its close, salty air, its turquoise waters and its white sands. She is believable on passion. When Emory gazes at Adela, she feels “a crazed swirl at the bowl of [her] body”, and she longs “to know everything about her, even when she only gave me fractions”. But too often The Girls Who Grew Big feels overly ambitious, a virtuous rhapsody, determined to say something transcendent about young motherhood but stuck peddling folksy wisdom instead.The Girls Who Grew Big by Leila Mottley is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

But then his life fell apart. Anthony Kavanagh talks about sex work, addiction and the years he spent being forced to hide his sexualityTue 15 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareNobody could say that Anthony Kavanagh does not know how to laugh at himself. The day he was fired from his record label, he trudged across London in the rain, walking and walking, as the realisation sank in that he was no longer a pop star. Soaked, he went into a pub and the woman behind the bar offered him a grubby tea towel to dry off. Washed-up indeed, he thought.His memoir, Pop Scars, is sprinkled with darkly comic takes on what his life had become after 90s pop stardom. Known as Kavana, he had a Top 10 hit in 1997 with his cover of Shalamar’s I Can Make You Feel Good. “I’ve always somehow been able to find the humour, even at some of the darker times,” he says.And there were dark times. Making a joke about a Neil Sedaka song (“Oh, Carol. Oh fuck, more like”) to describe the reality of waking up in a stranger’s apartment; fragments of a memory of driving down Sunset Strip with Sedaka on the car stereo; the realisation he had been paid for the sex he couldn’t remember. Smoking crack in a skip in Hackney with a homeless woman he had just met, and whom he trusts with his bank card to go and score more drugs (“Note to self,” he writes, “never give a stranger your pin code when high”). There are funnier, less serious incidents – he earned a lifetime ban, he says, from the daytime TV show Loose Women after slurring his way through it and being “unhinged” backstage – but in general, it’s a fairly bleak account of addiction, pain and what happens when the pop machine spits you out.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe is very hard on himself, I say, when we meet in the offices of his publisher (at 47, he retains the boyish looks that made him a teen favourite). “Well, I had that narrative for a long time. I think when you have a lot of rejection …” He pauses. As an alcoholic in recovery, and three years sober, he is kinder to himself now. “But looking back, that’s definitely how I felt.”Writing the book has helped. “It’s given me some self-esteem which is, I think, what I’ve been lacking for a long time.” He worried he wasn’t a big enough name to be interesting to anyone now, until he started to view the book as a memoir of addiction, “and that includes the fame part, because really I was only chasing a feeling. Approval, basically.” And what happens after fame disappears. “I have a bit of empathy for the young me, because although I was driven and ambitious and smart, I was also very naive.”Growing up in Manchester in the 1980s, born to parents who already had a 20-year-old daughter, Kavanagh wanted nothing more than to be a pop star. Smash Hits magazine was his bible – every fortnight, he’d bring it home from the shop, “take it in my bedroom and go through the pages. It was just an escape into this fantasy world.”Bullied, and with the dawning realisation he was gay, he found school an ordeal, but he also had an iron belief that he would be a famous pop star one day. Where did that come from? “Delusion?” he says with a laugh. “Maybe wanting to escape. I just had a feeling, and I would go around telling everyone that it was a given – I was going to be on Top of the Pops.”View image in fullscreenPerforming live in 1997.Photograph: David Wardle/Avalon/Getty ImagesWhen he became successful – Top 10 singles in the UK, adored in Asia – the picture he gives is of an excited and confused teenager in a bewildering world. It would have been easier, he thinks, if he’d been in a boyband, because at least there would be backup. He had body image issues: he had been overweight as a young teenager, and people around him still commented that he was “chubby”. “I used to get a bit fearful sometimes in the photoshoots.” Mostly he was afraid of being outed, when his success with his teenage girl fans depended on him being a “straight” pop star. “There was fear in general, regardless of being a pop star. I hadn’t told my parents. I didn’t tell my sister till I was 18. It was a different age then.”Sometimes, on tour with other artists, he would share a passing glance with another man and wonder if they were interested. “You’d have a little feeling, but I dared not say to you, in case you then tell somebody else.” On one tour, he and Stephen Gateley, from the boyband Boyzone, spent the night together.Keeping his sexuality hidden must have been incredibly difficult. “It was, and that’s where alcohol came in as a comfort. It’s crazy when I look back now, the time that we were in. It was a constant act, and it was exhausting – but you just got on with it, because I was so lucky for this to happen to me, and I must be grateful. I put everything into the ambition.”It’s strange, Kavanagh says, to be doing interviews again at a time where he doesn’t have to hide his sexuality, and there is more understanding of the pressures on young pop stars and power dynamics in relationships. “We didn’t talk about mental health. Today you hear they give artists aftercare or therapy, but there wasn’t any of that then. I suppose I didn’t have the knowledge to ask, either. What would I have asked for? We didn’t use those words back then. And when it’s so fast, fast, fast, and there’s a lot of ‘yes’ people, and you’re told how fantastic you are, that’s enough sometimes to make you feel OK.” It made it harder, he says, when only a few months later, the fame bubble popped. “Especially if it becomes your identity,” he adds.View image in fullscreenIn 1998.Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty ImagesEven when he was successful, he says, “I was never satisfied. I won a Smash Hits award – like, that was the holy grail to me. It doesn’t get much better than that. But then, I think maybe the addiction side, you want something else. I kept wanting more and more. At 21, I decide I’m going to go and live in America, I’m going to make it there.” He laughs at himself – the young man who had just been dropped by his record label, and who genuinely believed he could move to Hollywood and pick up an Oscar. “It’s like, OK, that’s a normal thing to do.”It actually started well: he got an agent, and a small part in a soap within the first week, but only for a couple of episodes. He was trying to release his own music, become a songwriter, go to auditions, but mostly he was lonely, burning through his money and drinking more and more. Sometimes drugs, too, including crystal meth. But, he says, “Alcohol was the start and the end. I would never have taken drugs without alcohol. But yeah, I was like a loose cannon for some of those times, got myself into some situations.” Such as waking up in a stranger’s flat, realising he had been paid for sex.Kavanagh ended up living in a motel, then eventually returned home after seven years – in 2006 – penniless. It meant losing his parents’ home, which he had been paying the mortgage on. “That comes with a whole load of guilt, because I’m moving two elderly parents, they’ve lost this house. So that’s more reason to drink.”His years out of the UK meant everyone had forgotten about him. He looked around at the people who had grown up with him – former pop stars and actors such as Ant and Dec, and Billie Piper – who had successfully reinvented themselves, and felt as if he’d made a mistake. “So then there’s shame and regret with that.” He smiles. “There was no jungle [the I’m a Celebrity … reality show] in them days to go on when your pop career is washed up. When I disappeared … ‘I’ll make it in Hollywood!’” He tried to stage a comeback, releasing a “best of” album and appearing on reality shows including Celebrity Big Brother and Grease Is the Word, but he sabotaged many opportunities by being drunk. He started hanging around with the singer Amy Winehouse, who had her own alcohol addiction, and crashing at the flats of his few remaining loyal fans, drinking more.View image in fullscreenHaving his hair cut by Katie Price on Celebrity Big Brother in 2015.Photograph: ShutterstockSigning on at the jobcentre back in Manchester, he was scared of being recognised – people had started, dishearteningly, to ask him: “Didn’t you used to be Kavana?” “I was so wrapped up in my own shame,” he says. “I was having to drink.” And alcohol worked for him, he says, “for a long time. I’m not sitting here saying: ‘Oh, it was tragic, it was awful.’ Alcohol got me through my father’s death. It kind of got me through my sister’s death [from cancer in 2019]. It got me through feeling nervous, it got me through going on stage, homesickness. But I didn’t realise what it was doing to me.”By the time he was essentially homeless, living secretly with his mother in her sheltered housing flat, Kavanagh was deep in addiction. He applied for a place at rehab mainly, he says, to have somewhere to live, and was sober for six months before spectacularly relapsing on a songwriting retreat, and drinking neat vodka in a phone box. In London, he would go through a cycle of attending AA meetings, then drinking again. By the time he was buying three-litre bottles of cheap cider to drink in the mornings (along with tins of cat food, to create, he thought, an air of respectability), he knew he was in trouble.“Alcohol became as important to me as oxygen to survive,” he says. “That sounds quite melodramatic to somebody that has never experienced that, but I knew the game was up. I wanted to stop, but I physically couldn’t.” He would often spend the rest of the day at a Costa coffee shop, pretending to work on his phone and sipping wine from a paper cup.One day, an email from a lawyer came through. A newspaper had agreed to settle a defamation case he’d long forgotten about from the 90s, and the sum was more than he had seen in a decade. “I’m drinking wine out of the coffee cup, and just that divine timing,” he says.He called his AA sponsor, and asked for help to find a private rehab clinic. “At that point I needed to be locked up,” he says. A friend drove him there, and Kavanagh remembers the friend telling staff he thought alcohol had caused him brain damage. “To think that I’d got myself in that state.” Kavanagh thought alcohol would kill him. “I’ve seen it happen to others, and I think it scared me that last time in rehab.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianFor whatever reason, rehab worked, and Kavanagh has been sober for three and a half years. He wakes up, “and I pray to a god that I don’t understand, and just say, ‘You drive today.’ I go to meetings, I try to be of service. Anything that takes me out of thinking and negotiating things in my head, I’ve learned, is what helps. Connecting with others.”Kavanagh wrote his book during the first year of sobriety. “I’ve got access to this new life now, but I just have to remember that that’s where it took me last time.” He is proud to call himself an author, and might make some music again at some point. He’d quite like to do a one-man show.Does he still crave approval and recognition? “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t crave approval. I’m not sure about being hugely famous, because I know how fleeting it can be, but there’s definitely something to be said about putting something you’ve done out and getting positive feedback. Or people connecting to me.”Pop Scars by Anthony Kavanagh (Bonnier Books Ltd, £22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

He and co-star Edward Bluemel discuss bust lips, hot pants and queering the Bard’s storyTue 15 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 06.48 EDTShare‘Ithink of it as a very sexy, dangerous game of Elizabethan cat and mouse.” Ncuti Gatwa is describing his new project with theRoyal Shakespeare Company, a two-hander about William Shakespeare and fellow playwright Christopher “Kit” Marlowe. In Born With Teeth, Will and Kit collaborate on a play about Henry VI – for “collaborate”, read flirt, fight and ruminate betrayal.Gatwa plays Marlowe and Shakespeare is Edward Bluemel; the pair last worked together on TV’s Sex Education. Bluemel followed that series about horny teens with playing a vampire (A Discovery of Witches), an MI6 agent (Killing Eve) and a brooding lord (My Lady Jane), while Gatwa was cast as one of the Kens in the Barbie movie and starred in a little thing called Doctor Who.Sitting on a sofa just before rehearsals begin, they make amiable, nicely contrasted figures. Gatwa with cropped hair and tight white T-shirt, his bangle and ring shining gold. Tousle-haired Bluemel in black, silver rings in ear and on finger. He’s eager and chatty; Gatwa seems more guarded, until his laugh explodes seemingly out of nowhere.View image in fullscreen‘A gift of a job’ … Gatwa in Doctor Who.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Dan FearonA note from playwright Liz Duffy Adams in the Born With Teeth script says that the actors’ ages or looks don’t matter, “as long as they are wildly charismatic”. I have to ask: do they feel well cast? They guffaw, and Bluemel leans forward. “I’m here to break it to everyone that you, Ncuti, are wildly charismatic.”So who are these characters? “It’s fascinating to dig into these men who were more than likely queer in different ways,” says Bluemel. “Marlowe wears his heart on his sleeve – plays like Edward II are brazen and brave depictions of queer love. Shakespeare is scared – he wants to talk about things, but via ancient Rome or picturesque Ephesus.” In the play, Will avers, “I want to hide in my work, like an outlaw in the forest.” Kit derides his colleague as “careful Will, who won’t”.How sincere is a snog? A question I ask myself after every snog …Marlowe, Gatwa declares, “dances with danger”. The play leans into his supposed career as an agent of Elizabethan spymasters, and the peril that brings for everyone in his orbit. Mistrust lends the dialogue an erotic shimmer – and neither knows who is being played. “How sincere is a snog?” grins Bluemel. “A question I ask myself after every snog …”Drama thrives in history’s gaps. Adams has Kit scorn research for their Henry VI play: “Sources?Are we to take direction from historians?” Gatwa doesn’t share that sentiment himself, but mentions a note from Daniel Evans, their director: “All that research is not going to teach you how to act the characters.” Even so, they enjoyed a research week, “getting under the skin of that world, which doesn’t feel too different from the world we’re in now.”It’s certainly a rollicking read. “It starts fast, and they’re deep into each other’s lives, unpicking each other,” Gatwa says. “When we first read the play there was a lift-off, it’s so human – their attraction to each other, their jealousy and insecurities.”Adams drops “some real deep cuts, lots of Easter eggs” for the drama nerds, says Bluemel. “There’s some beautiful passages. If you set yourself the challenge of writing dialogue for Marlowe and Shakespeare, you’ve got to write pretty gorgeous stuff, which Liz has. The play is rooted in history, but so much is exciting, fun conjecture – where we as actors can really enjoy ourselves.”View image in fullscreen‘Much more comfortable on stage’ … Bluemel with Amy Morgan in 2017’s Touch.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianEnjoying themselves on stage is what these actors signed up for – they’d both originally imagined theatre careers (“then TV got its greasy mitts on you,” teases Bluemel). Shuddering, Gatwa summons his training for screen acting. “Do you remember the first time you saw yourself on camera? Horrible.” Bluemel, who dreamed of “performing Shakespeare in a National Trust garden”, still feels “much more comfortable on stage – maybe because I can’t watch myself”.He hasn’t performed in Shakespeare since a student attempt in Cardiff as Leontes in The Winter’s Tale, though “I always have my ears pricked up to do some Shakespeare”. Gatwa followedMercutio in Romeo and Juliet in Manchesterwith Emma Rice’s riotousA Midsummer Night’s Dream at Shakespeare’s Globe. A more recent retooled classic was the National Theatre’s audaciousThe Importance of Being Earnest. “It was chaos every single night,” he beams. “Delicious, delicious chaos.” Rather like Born With Teeth, he says, the show brandished a queer subtext that was hiding in plain sight. “In academic conversations, there’s a tendency to play that stuff down. It was nice to bring it out to the forefront.”Kit and Will were provincial lads who flourished in London. How about the actors playing them? Gatwa would travel up for auditions on the overnight bus from Glasgow (“Thirty quid!”). He waxes nostalgic: “Megabus Gold, I loved it. You sleep all night, get into Victoria Station, brush your teeth and head off to your audition.” He tried out for a role in Shakespeare in Love in theWest Endjust after being attacked by three strangers on his way home from a nightclub. “I had just gotten jumped, and had big problems with my mouth,” he says, recalling the swelling that went on to explode during his meeting. “I was in the audition for flipping Sonia Friedman [the leading impresario] and it popped. I left in the worst mood, but got the job.”In Gatwa’s words, “the best actors are all working at McDonald’s”. The line between making it and not can feel arbitrary. “A lot of right place, right time, and parts that lend themselves to you as an actor,” Bluemel confirms. “I always think: if I was the casting director, would I cast me in this? Sometimes the stars align.”The Time Lord in the room is, of course, Doctor Who, the role that Gatwa has just relinquished after two not-uncontroversial seasons. Few roles are such magnets for unfiltered opinion – has he managed to tune out the chatter? “I’m quite good at shutting the noise out,” he says. “It’s loud. But it’s very cool and exciting to be in the middle of this huge thing – there’s haters, there’s lovers, it’s all going on. It is an absolute gift of a job, and a gift of a community. The Whovians are so deeply in my heart, I can’t tell you.”View image in fullscreen‘Delicious chaos’ … Gatwa as Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest.Photograph: Marc BrennerQuite apart from the challenge of making the character your own, is there any coaching for the attention around the series? “Yes, there was, but I don’t think it can ever prepare you for what it feels like. They put security outside my mum’s house, my brother’s house, and I would say: what could possibly be the need?And then the need comes.” Only someone who has stood at the eye of this storm can understand it. “I was just at Glastonbury and bumped into Matt Smith in a club,” he adds, “and we had great, deep chats about that job and how there’ll never be another like it in our lifetimes. We’ll never work that hard again. Never be as stimulated and stretched. It’s also very exhausting, so it’s lovely to delve into other projects.”Bluemel’s roles too attract a fair degree of attention. So is there an ideal level of fame: offering opportunities but protecting you from intrusion? “My ideal is to work on good stuff and make a living from it,” says Bluemel. “Some of those big jobs, from a professional point of view, might be amazing, but at what cost? It changes people’s lives irrevocably.”As a student, Gatwa was a go-go dancer at one of Glasgow’s “pivotal gay clubs. They had these shower cubicles that were open to the club. I would dance in the showers in a pair of hot pants and next morning wake up and work on sonnets.” Is dancing good for confidence? “You need a lot of front – or a lot of shots! Yes, it was good for confidence, chatting to different people every night. Go-go dancing sets you up for life!”Born With Teeth may not require hot pants, but it has required both actors to let go of some inhibitions. Movement directorIra Mandela Siobhanprescribed some initial trust exercises. “When someone’s falling into your arms, lifting you up, throwing you around, a trust builds,” Gatwa says. “There’s all sorts of push and pull,” adds Bluemel – the performance will involve “a high adrenaline vulnerability”.Gatwa needs the bathroom, so we wrap up, giving Bluemel the last word on Born With Teeth. “It feels modern and current,” he says. “A clash of ambitions, jealousy, romance – ultimately, two very complicated people who can’t decide what they think of each other. I hope it feels like a horny Elizabethan whirlwind.”Born With Teeth is atWyndham’s theatre, London, 13 August until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreWilliam ShakespeareChristopher MarloweNcuti GatwaWest EndRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Seasoned travellers explain how to stay happy and hunger-free, whether you’re trekking in Thailand or on a mini-break in BerlinRachel DixonTue 15 Jul 2025 05.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 13.17 EDTShareThis spring, I spent five weeks travelling around Mexico – my longest time away from home since becoming a vegan two and a half years ago. It was a learning experience: lots of incredible vegan food, gallons of fall-back guacamole and the odd cheese-related disaster. This is what I found out about being a vegan on holiday, and the advice I received from more seasoned vegan travellers.Choose your destination wisely“I have been completely blown away by the difference in attitude and progressiveness of places,” says Alexis Gauthier, aMichelin-starred vegan chef. “I’ve found the cuisines of Mexico, India and the eastern Mediterranean/Levant all vegan-forward. Their use of beans and pulses as a fundamental ingredient and minimal reliance on dairy means they make excellent choices for a vegan holiday.” I second Mexico: pretty much everywhere serves beans, rice and guacamole, and most restaurants will knock up some veggie tacos.View image in fullscreenVegan tacos in a restaurant in Mexico.Photograph: Rachel DixonBut don’t rule anywhere out – even France“I’m sorry to say my beloved homeland of France has not yet caught up with the world with vegan food, but there are ways to be smart,” says Gauthier. “In the north it is more difficult, as everything is still mostly based on heavy cream, butter and red meat. Paris is changing – there are now lots of really exciting places opening, especially bakeries.” That wasn’t my experience. I was in Paris last autumn, and it was still difficult to find vegan options.“In the south it’s better, as menus naturally rotate around seasonal vegetables,” continues Gauthier. “Falafel is popular, as is socca [chickpea flatbread], panisse [chickpea fries] and tapenade. I swear you can live on really good tomatoes, aubergines, basil, chickpeas, olive oil and olives for ever! And there is always France’s greatest dish: ratatouille, my favourite dish in the world.”Holidaying in the UK may be harder than you think“Don’t assume that all of the UK is vegan-friendly,” says Holly Johnson, editor ofVegan Food & Living magazine. “What’s normal in a cafe in Bristol is weird and wacky, and even offensive, to those in more remote farming communities. I once got laughed out of a corner shop in Devon for asking for oat milk.”Go on a city break“Berlin is an amazing city for vegans, with a real forward-thinking scene, as are Brighton and Vienna,” says Gauthier. I would add London, where eating out is effortless (although expensive), and Mexico City, where I ate exclusively at vegan restaurants.Peta, the animal rights organisation, hasfree vegan city guidesto Berlin, New York, Rio de Janeiro and Sydney, plus one for the Indian state of Goa.Give the countryside a chance“I’ve learned never to assume that there won’t be vegan options,” says Elisa Allen from Peta. “I was recently in a small village in rural Ireland. An online search hadn’t turned up any options, so I was pleasantly surprised when the local cafe had two home-baked vegan cakes and a vegan lasagne. The owner’s daughter had recently gone vegan, so they were inspired to expand their menu.”Look for an alternative sceneView image in fullscreenSunset in El Cuyo, Yucatán, Mexico.Photograph: Megapress Images/AlamyIn El Cuyo, a laid-back fishing village at the northern tip of Mexico’s Yucatán peninsula, practically every restaurant had hummus and tofu on the menu.Use the Happy CowappEvery expert I spoke to recommended theHappy Cow app and website, and I relied heavily on it in Mexico. “Happy Cow is your best friend for seeking vegan options while travelling. You can use it to research local restaurants beforehand or while you’re strolling around a city,” says Chelsea Harrop fromVeganuary. “You can filter by vegan and vegetarian eateries, as well as restaurants with plant-based options if the rest of your travel party isn’t eating vegan. I’ve visited many small towns in Ireland and the Scottish islands where I didn’t expect to find anything vegan at all, and Happy Cow has always served me well.”Learn some helpful phrases in the local languageNot everyone is familiar with the word vegan. Sascha Camilli from Peta says: “A friend of mine tried saying ‘vegan’ in Bali and they all thought she meant ‘pagan’. In Portugal, I’ve been offered gluten-free food because they didn’t know what vegan meant.” A simple explanation, such as “No meat, dairy or eggs, please”, will help. Harrop says: “Learn the words for ingredients such as egg, milk and fish so you can spot them on menus. Phrases such as ‘I don’t eat fish’ or ‘Does it contain egg?’ are also useful.”Carry a cheat sheet“In Egypt, I had an infographic in Arabic that said exactly what I didn’t eat,” says Camilli.Peta’s Sadie Buckles says: “When I visited China, my professor helped me make a little card that said: ‘I am a strict vegetarian. No meat, dairy, eggs, fish, milk or cheese. Onions and garlic are OK.’ In China, they will ask if you are Buddhist vegetarian, which means no pungent foods such as garlic, onion, leeks, chives and shallots.”Call aheadJennifer White from Peta contacts restaurants and hotels in advance to explain she’s vegan. “Be super nice about it, and chances are they will make you a lovely meal even if they don’t have anything on the menu,” she says. Johnson says: “I find that most chefs are happy to accommodate, and actually excited to cook something a bit different. I always make sure I show my gratitude – they might just add more plant-based options to the menu in future.” I phoned ahead on a city break to Genoa, and chefs prepared delicious dishes around seasonal ingredients such as artichokes.Stay in a vegan hotelTheVegan Welcomewebsite lists 35 hotels around the world that are 100% vegan in the cuisine they offer. It also has a directory of vegan-friendly hotels. Retreat-style holidays almost always cater well for vegans, too.Consider self-cateringView image in fullscreen‘Exploring the shops and markets is a great way to connect with the local culture.’Photograph: Posed by model; Maria Korneeva/Getty Images“If you’ve researched your destination and it doesn’t seem vegan-friendly, choose self-catering,” says Harrop. “This way, you can explore the shops and markets, which is a great way to connect with the local culture.” Emma Robinson from Veganuary says: “One of my favourite activities as a traveller is visiting traditional markets. I enjoy looking at the unfamiliar produce and trying to figure out what it is and how to prepare it.” In Mexico, I tried chaya, a spinach-like plant; nopales, the fleshy fronds of the prickly pear; and huitlacoche, offputtingly described as corn fungus, but tasty in a taco. Buy the basics at supermarkets, says White: “They are surprisingly well stocked in many countries, and you can find oat milk, tofu etc.”Use social media“Make the most of online vegan communities when planning your trip, especially Facebook groups and influencers on Instagram and TikTok,” says Harrop. “Most large cities are likely to have a vegan community and there are vegan travel groups on Facebook that are full of invaluable tips.”Make your vegan quest part of the holidayView image in fullscreen‘Don’t be afraid to go off the beaten path to uncover local vegan treasures.’Photograph: Coldsnowstorm/Getty Images“When travelling, I treat vegan cafes and restaurants as tourist destinations in their own right so I can work them into my itinerary,” says Harrop. “Don’t be afraid to go off the beaten path to uncover local vegan treasures – it’s a rewarding way to connect with a city’s culture.” Sophie-Anne Nabhan-Sandison from Veganuary did just that in Dubrovnik. “We found an amazing little vegan restaurant hidden away and it was one of the best meals I have ever had,” she says. Last summer, I sought out avegan restaurant in Lindos, Rhodes, and even my gyros-addicted boyfriend had to admit it was worth the trip.Harrop has a word of warning. “If you have your eye on a certain place, always double-check it’s open on the days you’re travelling. I once spent over an hour walking to a vegan cafe in Paris only to find it was closed when I got there.”But don’t be boringIt’s really frustrating for your non-vegan travel companions to trail round after you for hours, looking for somewhere you can eat. If you find somewhere that ticks everyone else’s boxes – full of local people, on a beautiful piazza – will it kill you to eat bread and salad for a night? “All my friends and family are so supportive – they wouldn’t want to take me anywhere that’s meat-heavy,” says Johnson. “However, I’d never stop them going, and if necessary I’d just eat before or afterwards and join in the fun.”Research ‘accidentally vegan’ dishesView image in fullscreen‘Every country will have a vegan staple’ … focaccia with tomatoes.Photograph: Sabinoparente/Getty Images/iStockphoto“I recently went to Cyprus and a lot of the country’s traditional dishes were vegan-friendly,” says Johnson. “Hummus, falafel, olive bread and certain meze dishes are all packed with flavour, so you don’t feel you’re missing out.”Ed Winters, author ofThis Is Vegan PropagandaandHow to Argue with a Meat Eater, found the same on holiday in southern Italy. “I was pleasantly surprised by how much local cuisine was plant-based or could easily be made suitable for vegans. For example, one of the most famous foods from Puglia is focaccia barese with tomatoes and olives.” Every country will have a vegan staple such as rice, wheat, oats, maize, lentils, beans, potatoes, taro or yam.Ask (politely) for alterationsIn France, says Gauthier, you could request chickpeas on your salad instead of goat’s cheese or tuna. In Mexico, I asked for my enfrijoladas “sin huevos”: soft tortillas smothered in refried beans, greens, tomato sauce and ground pumpkin seeds, minus the fried eggs on top. Many restaurants are happy to accommodate simple requests like this. On the other hand, sometimes you have to take no for an answer. At one cafe, I asked for hummus on my toast instead of butter and jam (hummus was on the menu). They said no. I offered to pay extra. Still no.Seek out vegan versions of local dishesView image in fullscreenHangover-busting … barbecue mushroom torta with roast potatoes and bean chilli.Photograph: Rachel DixonNo vegan goes to Spain to eat Thai green curry – we want tapas and paella like everyone else. On a trip to Germany last year, I found restaurants were particularly good at offering plant-based versions of traditional dishes such as schnitzel (breaded meat) and maultaschen (filled dumplings). Oaxaca in Mexico had several places serving vegan takes on pozole (soup made from hominy – a type of dried corn – with soya chunks instead of meat), chilaquiles (stewed tortilla chips, minus the usual dairy) and tortas (a kind of hearty sandwich), including a hangover-busting barbecue mushroom version.It’s OK to go off-piste sometimesOn longer holidays, you might find yourself craving a change from the local cuisine. Chinese, Indian, Thai, Korean and Japanese restaurants usually cater well to vegans – in Mexico City, I found an incrediblevegan ramen place.Read – and write – reviewsVegan travellers tend to be a helpful bunch, highlighting plant-based dishes in restaurant reviews on Tripadvisor, Google and so on. Make sure you return the favour, says Harrop: “Always remember to leave your own reviews to help other travellers seeking vegan options. Share photos of the dishes and menus if you can.”Use map apps to your advantageIt sounds ridiculous, but when I fancied a change from Mexican food, I searched for “tofu” on my phone’s map. It led me to a fantasticJapanese smokehouse and sake bar, which served agedashi tofu and vegan sushi. White says: “Some countries have navigation apps that are more widely used than Google Maps. For example, South Korea hasNaver. Download and use those apps instead.”Pack snacksMuch like at home, it’s always wise to carry snacks. Johnson says: “Don’t ever assume there will be anything to eat, especially at an airport. Once you’re on the flight, most airlines do offer a vegan optionif you’ve ordered it– but don’t forget that said vegan option might just bea banana and a pair of chopsticks.” Harrop suggests snack bars and nuts; I carted a packet of fancy granola around Mexico.And plant milk“Always take oat milk,” says Johnson. “There’s nothing worse than waking up in a hotel room, excited for your morning cup of tea, and seeing those sad little pots of UHT cow’s milk.” I like travel-sizedOatly sachetsif I’m on the move.Try vegan activitiesI once did a cookery class in Thailand and learned about ingredients such as banana blossom, which I now use regularly in curries. Lots of cities have vegan food tours, and companies such asNaturetrekoffer wildlife holidays staying at vegan hotels.Support animalsView image in fullscreenA West Indian manatee at the Sian Ka’an biosphere reserve, Mexico.Photograph: Rodrigo Friscione/Getty Images/Image SourceI visited theSian Ka’an biosphere reservein Yucatán – the entry fee helps protect the habitat of manatees, sea turtles, jaguars, pumas and more. But choose carefully. “Fifteen years ago, I went to Thailand and was so excited to see a baby elephant in a restaurant. Now, I’d avoid places like that,” says Johnson. “Research shows that wild animals being used for human entertainment have most certainly suffered some kind of abuse and are kept in unnatural and often cruel conditions. I would love to try authentic experiences such as safaris or visiting an animal sanctuary, but it’s important to check the provenance of the company or organisation first.”Accept you will have slip-upsIn one restaurant, I ordered what I thought was a vegan dip, only to be presented with a bowl of melted cheese. And at a tiny campsite in the middle of the jungle, miles from anywhere, I was given scrambled eggs for breakfast. “This has happened to me a few times over the years,” says Johnson. “I don’t let it worry me – we all slip up sometimes and I just carry on as normal. Obviously that’s different if you have an allergy, but I’m vegan for different reasons.”Don’t sweat about supplementsAt home, I take avegan supplement. On holiday, life’s too short. I just drinkthe odd green juiceand try to eat a varied diet. Johnson does take a multivitamin on holiday, but says: “It’s not something I worry too much about – no one is going to die of a deficiency during a week or two away.”You can still have an ice-creamView image in fullscreenDark chocolate ice-cream tends to be dairy-free.Photograph: fhm/Getty ImagesVegans aren’t condemned to a life of sorbet. In particular, dark chocolate ice-cream is often dairy-free.If all else fails, there’s always chips“I would suggest always ordering a side of fries with every salad or curry,” says Gauthier. “It keeps the holiday vibe high!”Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Any lighter, fresher alternatives?Louis, FalmouthIf Julie Lin, author ofSama Sama: Comfort Food from my Malaysian-Scottish Kitchen, were to hazard a guess, it would be that Louis is buying shop-bought sauces: “They’realwayssweet and dense,” she says. “There’s a phrase we use in Malaysia,agak agak, which means to season until you know that it’s good for you.” And that’s only ever going to come from making it yourself, which for Lin often means her “master wok” sauce. To make a bottle, she combines 75g white sugar, three teaspoons of MSG, and 75ml rice-wine vinegar, and whisks until the sugar dissolves. Stir in 300ml light soy sauce and 100ml dark soy sauce, followed by 50ml sesame oil. Pour that into a sterilised jar or bottle, give it a shake and keep for a month at room temperature. That’s then ready to go, or customise it with, say, chilli or garlic, because one stir-fry sauce is not going to fit all. While the basic master wok number is a good shout for stir-frying noodles, rice or vegetables, however, “if you’re going for a lamb stir-fry, for example, you’ll probably want to add some cumin, garlic and maybe make it more vinegary.”For Justin Tsang, author ofLong Day? Cook This: Easy East Asian Recipes with a Twist, it’s all about balance: “The perfect stir-fry sauce has to be salty, sweet and umami, but it shouldn’t be one more than the other; it should work in harmony.” If your sauce is bordering on too sweet or dense, anything “a bit tart or fruity” will work wonders: “That could be some sort of acid, such as lime juice to finish, or vinegar, or a splash of sharp Worcestershire sauce,” says Tsang, who has also been known to add HP Sauce to the mix. Alternatively, get to know your onions: “Using the finest grater on a box grater, grate a white onion into an almost-pulp, then mix into your sauce, along with a splash of vinegar – that will cut through any sweetness and make it lighter.”Another shortcut to flavour is chicken stock. “People don’t think to add it to stir-fry sauce, but it waters it down and just makes it nice,” Tsang says. If noodles (egg, flat rice, vermicelli) are in play, he’d also whack in a load of finely grated garlic and ginger – “use a microplane to get them really fine” – plus fish, oyster and soy sauces: “But only enough to make you think it’s not going to do anything, because it will still build layers of umami.”If the goal is something lighter and brighter, Lin would knock up a quickbihun goreng, which starts with a base of onion, chilli and garlic. “Add whatever protein you fancy [chicken, pork, prawns, tofu], then tip in some light and dark soy sauce, sugar, vinegar and a bit of chilli oil.” In with some cooked rice noodles, then add any crunchy veg you have to hand: “Green beans or beansprouts, but don’t cook them too long that they lose their crunch, because you want some texture.” If you’re feeling brave, Lin adds, shove everything to one side of the pan, pour a beaten egg into the other side and scramble.” Let everything come together and serve with sambal and maybe a fried egg. Well, two eggs are always better than one.Got a culinary dilemma?

It’s one of those recipes where the ease is almost embarrassing. How can something so delicious be so straightforward? The burgers themselves are a simple food processor job; if you don’t have one, use chicken mince and make sure you really mix in the curry paste and courgette by hand. The accompaniments are also key: the lime-pickled shallots, the abundance of herbs and the creaminess of the mayo all work so well together. Turn up to a barbecue with a tray of these and I guarantee you’ll be dishing out the recipe in no time.Red curry chicken and courgette burgersPrep10 minCook30 minMakes43 shallots, peeled and finely slicedSea salt andblack pepper2 limes500g skinless and boneless chicken thighs1 courgette(about 250g), trimmed and coarsely grated2 tbsp red Thai curry paste4 burger buns4 tsp chilli jam4 tbsp mayonnaise, to serve½ 25g bunch each freshcoriander and mint, leaves pickedPut the sliced shallots in a small bowl and season with a good pinch of sea salt. Squeeze over the juice of one and a half limes, toss and set aside to pickle.Roughly chop the chicken thighs and put them in a food processor with the grated courgette and a third of the lime-dressed shallots. Blitz until the chicken is minced, then add the curry paste, season well and blitz again until smooth. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into four even-sized balls (if you are preparing them in advance, cover and store in the fridge.When you’re ready to cook, light the barbecue or put a griddle pan on a high heat. Smash the burgers either before you put them on the barbecue/griddle, or directly in the pan/on the grill, then cook for about five minutes on each side, until cooked all the way through.Meanwhile, cut the buns in half horizontally and toast for a minute on the cut side only. When the burgers are ready, baste each one with a teaspoon of chilli jam, so they’re sticky and glossy on the outside, then cook for a minute more.Spoon mayonnaise on the cut side of the bottoms of the buns, top with the cooked burgers, then finish with the picked herbs and the remaining lime-dressed shallots. Top with the bun lids and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodBurgersBarbecueMain courseMeatChickenSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"

They will also ask for proof of insurance and your vehicle logbook (V5C), if you have one.You don’t need an international driving permit in the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Iceland if you have a photocard licence issued in the UK.However, if you have a paper licence, you will need to update it to a photocard or get an IDP. Go togov.uk/driving-abroadfor details.… and what gear to packSome countries require drivers to carry certain things. For example, in much of Europe, including popular destinations such as France, Italy and Germany, you need a warning triangle. In some countries, including Germany and France, you will need a hi-vis vest, too.Don’t forget to use headlamp beam converter stickers to stop your headlights dazzling other road users. These are compulsory in places such as France. They can be bought easily for a few pounds.If you don’t have these things, an easy option is to pick up a European driving kit from retailers such as Halfords (£32.50 at time of writing) or the RAC (from £25.99).View image in fullscreenSome countries in mainland Europe require drivers to carry a warning triangle and a hi-vis vest.Photograph: Miguel Tamayo/AlamyUse a ‘UK’ stickerYou will need a sticker for your vehicle if your number plate doesn’t include the UK identifier with the union flag.If it has a GB identifier with the union flag, a euro symbol, a national flag of England, Scotland or Wales, or numbers and letters only, you must display a UK sticker clearly on the rear of your vehicle.If you are in Spain, Cyprus or Malta, you must display a UK sticker no matter what is on your number plate.However, you don’t need a UK sticker or identifier to drive in Ireland.Ensure you’re insuredAll UK car insurance policies automatically provide you with third-party cover while in EU countries, plus a few others including Switzerland. This covers your legal liability to others – for example, if you injure someone in an accident or damage their property – but won’t cover damage to your own vehicle.Most people will want to take their comprehensive cover with them, so check with your provider to see what is, and isn’t, included in your policy. The good news is that plenty of insurers automatically include driving elsewhere in Europe with their comprehensive cover. For example, with LV= you are covered for up to 180 days over the policy year, while all of Admiral’s comprehensive insurance, except for its Essential policies, includes 90-day European cover.View image in fullscreenCheck with your provider what is included in your car insurance policy.Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/AlamyBear in mind that with some companies you may only be covered for 30 days over the year.With others, such as Aviva, you only get third-party cover as standard, and if you want comprehensive for driving in Europe, you have to buy a policy add-on.Alternatively, you can buy short-term European car insurance from another provider to cover your trip. You can get this through a price comparison website. “You might find this to be an easier solution than adding cover to your existing policy,” MoneySuperMarket says.Get breakdown coverAgain, check if you are already covered. New cars often come with European roadside assistance, or breakdown cover, while the vehicle is in warranty. It may also be included in a monthly service plan or if you have the car serviced at a main dealer.A number of bank accounts – particularly paid-for ones – include European breakdown cover. Among them are Nationwide’s FlexPlus (which costs £18 a month), Monzo’s Max (from £17 a month) and the Co-operative Bank’s Everyday Extra (£18 a month).Barclays offers customers a “travel pack” add-on, costing £14.50 a month, that includes European breakdown cover and worldwide travel insurance (there is a six-month minimum term).For a big road trip it may be wise to go for something offering a bit more than a budget policyIf you don’t have any European breakdown cover, a few weeks’ worth should not break the bank.A Compare the Market comparison of single-trip policies for a 2019 Volvo V40, based on two weeks in France in August, found the cheapest policy was £31.79 from Cover My Breakdown.However, for a big road trip, unless you have a super-reliable car that has not given you any problems, it may be wise to go for something offering a bit more than a budget policy. For the scenario mentioned, the RAC would charge either £82.30 or £133.74 depending on the level of cover, while the AA wants £100.03, or £85.74 if you are a member.Beware clean air rulesIf you are driving to France, you need to be aware of the country’s low emission zones, and the clean air sticker – called aCrit’Air vignette– that you are required to display if you plan to enter one of a number of urban areas.These stickers are used to identify the vehicle’s emission levels and, in some cases, restrict access in order to improve air quality.“Although France’s National Assemblyvoted [in May this year] to scrap low emission zones(ZFEs), the rules around Crit’Air stickers haven’t changed yet. UK drivers still need the right sticker to enter many French cities,” the RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis says.Fail to comply and you could face a fine of up to €180 (£155).There are six categories in the Crit’Air vignette system, from green for the cleanest vehicles (for example, 100% electric) to dark grey for the dirtiest.View image in fullscreenBe aware of any stickers you may be required to display.Photograph: Elena Dijour/AlamyDrivers need to applyvia the official French government websiteand ensure their sticker is displayed before they enter France – so do not leave this until the last minute. For British vehicles, the sticker costs €4.91 (£4.23) including postage.Le Havre and its port are within a low emissions zone, says Brittany Ferries, while other cities operating zones include Caen, Rouen, Rennes and Nantes. Paris and Lyon have particularly strict rules.The RAC hasa useful webpagewith lots of information on the scheme and which towns and cities need a sticker, and the French government website for the schemehas information and a map.Think tollsWhen planning your trip, don’t forget to factor in the cost of any motorway tolls and consider how you will pay them.It now costs about €125 (£107) in tolls to drive from Calais to Nice on the south coast of France (so roughly double that for a return trip). You can avoid them, but this will almost certainly add time to your journey.ViaMichelin has a useful tool atviamichelin.co.uk/routesthat will calculate the estimated total cost of tolls and fuel for your journey.There are payment services you can sign up to that let you use the automated lanes so you can drive straight through and beat any queues, but unless you are planning a lot of journeys, it’s probably easier to pay as you go by credit card at the booths or machines. (That is, if you have a front seat passenger to lean out of their window to pay)Emovis Tag, for example, sells tags for France, Spain and Portugal, butthere are several upfront and ongoing charges, which may mean it is not cost-effective to use them for a one-off trip. If they do look good value for your break, LeShuttle’s car service isrunning an offeron the tags.The RAC has useful online guides to tolls inFranceandSpain.Explore more on these topicsMotoringMoney hacksConsumer affairsTravel insuranceEurope holidaysInsurancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.Thick white cloud hangs outside the windows of Rifugio Segantini, a mountain hut 2,373 metres up in the Italian Alps. But it is shifting, revealing glimpses of the majestic Brenta Dolomites before us: a patch of snow here, a craggy peak there. The view is tantalising, and a couple of times I have run outside in a kind of peekaboo farce to see the full display, only for it to pass behind clouds again.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.The refuge – cosy, wooden-clad and packed with hikers – is named after the Italian landscape painter Giovanni Segantini, who was inspired by these mountains. His portrait hangs on the walls and his name is embroidered on the lace curtains. A simple stone building with blue and white shutters in Val d’Amola, the refuge is dwarfed by its rugged surrounds, with Trentino’s highest peak, the snow-capped 3,556-metre Presanella, as a backdrop. The entries in the guestbook are entirely by locals.These jagged, teeth-like Dolomites appeared pastel pink in the sunset; now they’re slate-grey, foreboding, capped with snowFor most British hikers, the eastern parts of the Dolomites, like the Tre Cime di Lavaredo and Lago di Braies, towards Cortina, are better known. Few come to Trentino, and fewer still come to this part of the Adamello Brenta nature park. This, I am told, is the wild part of these mountains: less explored, with fewer tourists, and rousing “bigger emotion”, according to my mountain guide Nicola Binelli. (He climbed Presanella for the first time when he was six.)I’m here to sample the new Via delle Valli (the Trail of the Valleys), a network of 50 hiking routes covering 50 of Trentino’s mountain valleys, which launches this month. It runs from ski capital Madonna di Campiglio down to Lake Idro, taking in both the Brenta Dolomites and the Adamello glacier, Italy’s largest. Some are gentle family-friendly strolls; others are remote challenging climbs for which a mountain guide is recommended. Trails can be walked in a day, or strung together in a multi-day trek, making use of the area’s mountain huts (open from June to September) and bivouac shelters. But exploring the whole route is a long-term project, intended to be walked over weeks, months or even years.View image in fullscreenAn alpine lake from Val Nambrone.Photograph: Mauritius Images/AlamyThese trails existed before, but they have been unified under the Via delle Valli. Their signage is being updated, maps and GPX files have beenmade available online, and a “Valley Passport” has been introduced, which hikers can stamp at each valley as an encouragement to return. Each valley has a local ambassador, intended to pass their love and knowledge of the area on to others.The initiative, which has been three years in the making, is the brainchild of local tourist board manager Loredana Bonazza, who was inspired by Spain’s famous Camino de Santiago. The idea, she explains, is to tempt mountain-lovers away from the area’s hotspots, like Madonna di Campiglio and Val Genova, and towards adventures on lesser-charted trails. “Every valley is different,” she says. “We forget everything [in the mountains]: our stress, our jobs, our family problems. You really feel connected with the mountain. The result is:per scoprire; per scoprirsi. To discover; to discover yourself.”My focus is on two contrasting valleys – the rocky, rough Val D’Amola and neighbouring verdant Val Nambrone, where we begin by exploring one of its jewels: the breathtaking (literally) Lago Vedretta, at 2,600 metres. We climb from another hut, Rifugio Cornisello (newly renovated and all timber and glass), through green alpine pastures, up over a rocky lip, where the lake appears in all its glory. The landscape remains frozen, even in late June, with sheets of ice thawing into pale blue water. You’d be forgiven for thinking it was Patagonia, rather than Italy.The landscape remains frozen, even in late June. You’d be forgiven for thinking it was Patagonia, rather than ItalyThere are around 100 bears in Trentino, as well as wolves, foxes, chamois, falcons and eagles. But on the way back to the refuge, where we are spending the night, we take a detour up above the turquoise Lago di Cornisello Superiore to spot fluffier mountain residents: marmots.There are plenty of them up here, promises Debora Rambaldini, ambassador for Val Nambrone and the first woman in the area to become a forest guard. We follow her up a lush green spur dotted with wildflowers, and stand in silence, listening to the sounds of rushing water. Rambaldini puts a finger to her lips. There, a flush of reddish fur, a marmot darting between rocks, bushy tailed. And better still, another sunbathing on a rock below, eyeing us with suspicion.View image in fullscreenThe Adamello glacier is the largest in Italy.Photograph: Ale Astu/Getty ImagesThe following day, we head to Val D’Amola. The route takes us around the inky Lago Nero and up over the Bocchetta de l’Om pass, backpacks fully loaded. Val D’Amola is only a few kilometres away, but it is a different world. It ismore peat and bog, more Lord of the Rings. The water – grey here, not blue – thunders rather than babbles. But after lunch it’s our ascent up to Quattro Cantoni, a steep ledge and the gateway to the next valley, that reveals more of these mountains’ wild side. The cloud hangs low and thick, and apparently a storm is coming – soon. The sky rumbles above. Scrambling over rocks, tiptoeing on ledges and gingerly crossing patches of snow, the route is humbling: a reminder to improve my mountaineering skills. But safely back at Segantini, I feel elated. And the storm never comes.At Segantini, just as we sit down for our hearty mountain dinner of polenta, the clouds finally part. Seen from Cornisello, these jagged, teeth-like Dolomites appeared pastel pink in the sunset; now, they are slate-grey, foreboding, capped with snow. They fill the whole horizon. As the sky darkens, we can see the twinkling lights of another hut, the vast Tuckett which sleeps 120 people, slowly appear on their black flanks.I head to bed happy, and feel my heart racing with the altitude. It’s a small, six-bed dorm room, with a window that looks back towards the way we came. Occasionally, distant flashes of lightning illuminate the room, disrupting the dark and quiet. Sleeping – and waking – above 2,000 metres, though, is special. Ordinary life, below the clouds, feels a long way down. Time slows, you can only focus on the present, the company, the view.Afterwards, a little part of me will stay up here at Segantini, waiting to come back and explore more of these wild mountains and the secrets of the Via delle Valli.The trip was provided byTrentino Marketingand thelocal tourist board.Dorm rooms at atRifugio Cornisello€65 B&B or €90-€100 half-board, and€85half-board atRifugio Segantini.

I was desperate for a PlayStation 1. I pointed at the Big W price tag and asked: “Dad, is this expensive?”He said that nothing was expensive for us, as long as I got good marks in my tests.We went to the counter. The saleswoman was a blond middle-aged lady.“Now, tell me, my dear,” he began. “Is this your best price?” I went outside to let Dad work the trade.On the way home, PlayStation in tow, I asked him why he always did that.I was quick to ignore parental guidance, but when dad told me to take cheese off my car I should have listened | Elias VisontayRead moreHe told me that I should never be afraid to bargain: “If you don’t ask, you don’t get!”Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must-reads, pop culture and tips for the weekend, every Saturday morningDad has been putting this maxim to the test every day of his life. In theory, it might sound like some lofty invocation to be courageous, to tackle every challenge boldly. In practice, it’s the more banal reality of him asking the guy at the Aldi counter if there are any further reductions on liquorice bullets.In 2022, more than 20 years after the release of the PlayStation 1, I follow Dad into a Volkswagen dealership. Now hunched with sciatica, he still has a purposeful confidence and a rugged but wearied charisma about him.He wants me to feel satisfied with a purchase that will make me proud for a long time after I drive away. He also thinks I’m stupid with salespeople, liable to say and pay too much.With his walking stick, he hits a hub cap here and strikes a bonnet there. He is declaring his presenceThere is only one car we’re really interested in, and it’s not even a Volkswagen. Dad says European cars are too hard to maintain. I give the game away almost immediately, spotting the 2014 Kia Cerato, which Dad discovered after extensive digging online, parked outside with all the other preowned vehicles.I tell him it looks like it’s in good shape.Dad pulls me aside abruptly and tells me, in Arabic, not to let the dealers know I like the car.Inside the dealership, Dad begins his predatory shark game. His face is grave: vague curiosity, little expression. He circles the gleaming, air-conditioned lot. With his walking stick, he hits a hub cap here and strikes a bonnet there. He is declaring his presence.In his home city – El-Qantara el-Sharqîya, a small town on the Suez canal – fishermen would throw their lines into the canal and wait for hours for fish to take the bait. Today, Dad is also baiting his catch, deliberately provoking the sales staff – standard issue white guys in navy blue polyester suits. Who is the hungriest fish?I follow him from afar, swallowing my frustration and preparing myself for a drawn-out pursuit. After about 10 minutes, someone approaches. Dad asks the skinny salesman what he thinks of the Kia.The salesman says it doesn’t matter what he thinks, what matters is what Dad thinks. With this, he opens the Cerato’s door and gestures for us to sit down.Dad lumbers laboriously into the front seat. He examines the freshly detailed interior. The steering wheel, the rear-view mirror, the glove compartment. He glances at the logbook. Nothing escapes his gaze or his barrage of questions about the previous owners, registration dates and thoroughness of the last service.Dad pulls the car on to the street. I’m in the passenger seat and the salesman is in the back.The salesman reminds us of the 50km/h speed limit. Dad puts his loafer down hard on the accelerator.“Acceleration a bit slow,” Dad says as he charges down a shopping strip, causing a small woman to jump back from the pedestrian crossing and knock over her fabric wheelie trolley. We arrive back at the dealership. The salesman’s composure is intact and Dad’s face is like a slate of old granite in the Valley of the Kings. I’m anxious about the possibility that I will not take this car home today, because Dad won’t like the price.View image in fullscreenDaniel Nour and the 2014 Kia Cerato.Photograph: Daniel NourThe salesman says the car is in great condition, and asks if we would like to drive home with it today.Dad mumbles some protestations about the condition of the car. That’s when our salesman surprises me.He tells us there are plenty of other buyers interested in the car and that he won’t waste our time if we won’t waste his.

My father and the salesman have some things in common. Both men are hungry, both appreciate the value of a dollar and both have nothing else on today.Dad says we’re interested, we just need a fair deal.He starts listing extenuating circumstances that might sway this austere salesman to our favour. They include me having a perfect driving record and being able to pay in cash today. I was suspended for speeding twice and the only thing in my wallet is an expired Medicare card.The salesman looks unconvinced. That’s when Dad reveals his juiciest bait.We also have a good car for trade-in, he announces and offers the salesman a key.The salesman, eyebrows raised, takes the key and trudges outside to look at my sister’s 1999 Toyota Yaris, which I’ve been driving for five years.A few minutes later, he returns with his manager. Dad leans over to me with a warning, that he’s going to say some bullshit about what’s wrong with the car. Sure enough, we’re told about a “thumping noise” emitted by the gearbox, scratches to the exterior and the age of the vehicle. They can only offer a deduction of $2,000 on the asking price.My heart drops. I turn to my father, my eyes pleading. I’m on the verge of tearsDad scoffs and says they must be joking.The manager – a man of quieter gravity than his protege – speaks up. He tells Dad that he can see how serious we are about making a purchase, but that with all these liabilities in mind and the state of the market, he can’t go any lower without losing money for the dealership. My heart drops. I turn to my father, my eyes pleading. I’m on the verge of tears.“I’m afraid $14,500 is the best I can do, Mr Nour,” the manager says.Dad tells him that for $14,000, I will shake his hand today.This is all too much. My head feels light and there’s a catch in my throat. I need a break. I go to make a cup of coffee at the courtesy De’Longhi espresso machine.When I come back, I find the salesman grinning and Dad chuckling softly. Something has changed between these two men – game recognises game. The real arbitration, however, is between Dad and the manager.The manager wearily says he can’t budge further. “It’s $14,200 or nothing.”View image in fullscreenDad turns to me seriously, with his eyes wide in a questioning stare. He has fixed the contest, but mine is the deciding vote. Will I accept the terms?I reach forward to shake the manager’s hand.After a half-hour session of contract-signing and payment transactions, Dad stops on the way out, looking to see if I will say anything else. I surprise myself and ask if they can throw anything else in to sweeten the deal. Dad laughs.I drive off that day with a new car, two branded umbrellas and a feeling that I have just scored the freshest gaming console on the market and finished all my homework.This is an edited extract fromHow to Dodge Flying Sandals and Other Advice for Life($29.99; Affirm Press)This article was amended on 16 July 2025 to correct the year of the car model from 2004 to 2014.Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleFamilyParents and parentingMotoringTransportfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Neglecting plant hygiene can lead to the spread of pests, diseases and infections. Using dirty scissors, pots or tools can transfer fungi, bacteria or pests from one plant to another. Similarly, letting dust build up on leaves can restrict photosynthesis.Houseplant clinic: I’m off on holiday. How will my plants survive?Read morePrescriptionSterilise secateurs, gardening scissors and tools with alcohol or diluted household disinfectant before use. Wipe the blades before putting them away, particularly after pruning diseased leaves or stems. Reusing pots is great, but remember to scrub away old soil that might harbour pathogens. Gently clean your plants’ leaves with a damp cloth to remove dust.PreventionCheck plants weekly for signs of pests or disease. Maintaining cleanliness by wiping leaves, removing debris and sterilising pots and trays will reduce the risk of disease and allow your plants to flourish.Got a plant dilemma?

But it has been denied a release in Indian cinemas, where it has been deemed controversial because of the nationality of the film’s co-star, Pakistani actor Hania Aamir.The militant attack in Kashmir on 22 Aprilreignited India-Pakistan tensions, and as a result the Indian government mandated the removal of all digital content originating from Pakistan. Sardaar Ji 3 was filmed in the UK in February 2025, well before the attack, but the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE) – a film industry workers’ union – urged India’s Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) to deny the film a release certificate on the basis of Aamir’s nationality.It’s not about her [Aamir’s] presence – it’s about ideology. Anything that challenges the majority’s narrative is blockedAnurag KashyapIn its first week, Sardaar Ji 3 earned 336m rupees (£2.9m) overseas, a stellar performance for a non-Hindi movie, and recorded the biggest opening for an Indian film in Pakistan.Experts such as film producer and distributor Girish Johar say the film would probably have doubled those earnings had it been released in India, especially with a crowd puller like Dosanjh as its star.Celebrated Indian film-makerAnurag Kashyap, a vocal opponent of censorship, argues that Dosanjh is “India’s biggest cultural ambassador”. He adds: “The ones objecting to the film are simply badge-wearing patriots trying to win some extra brownie points with those in power. And Diljit, being as visible and loved as he is, is an easy target.”View image in fullscreenSardaar Ji 3 was shot in the UK before the attack in Kashmir reignited India-Pakistan tensions, but its release in India has been delayed because of Hania Aamir’s Pakistani nationality.Photograph: White Hill StudiosKashyap argues that the outrage surrounding the presence of a Pakistani actor is a smokescreen. “It’s not about her presence – it’s about ideology. Anything that challenges the majority’s narrative is blocked.” The refusal to release Sardaar Ji 3 sends a clear message, he says. “The bigger the financial loss, the more afraid people will be to dabble in non-populist storytelling.”Asim Nawaz Abbasi, editor of the Dayspring, a Pakistani youth-focused newspaper believes withholding the film may be backfiring. “The controversy has intensified interest in the film in Pakistan.

Then it went on to 37, 45 and 85. The committee had viewed the movie seven times already, making fresh cuts each time, raising the number to 127.

As the prime minister noted, it is entirely right to provide a haven to people in the most dire need, and international collaboration is key to solving the global problem of displacement. But for the pilot to be successful, the UK government must keep these three things front of mind.First, the scheme must be open to all people in need of protection – and the process must be quick and simple. This will mean a fairer, safer alternative to Channel crossings, so that no one falls into the hands of smugglers.Second, humanity and compassion must be at the heart of the scheme. We’re concerned that more people could be detained through this process. We know the impact that living in detention has on people’s physical and mental health. There must be proper assessments to prevent people with health conditions, trauma or other vulnerabilities from being placed in harmful environments. Tailored support, advice and information at all stages of the new process will be essential.Finally, it’s important that people with a close family connection – including siblings – in the UK can access the scheme. Families should be together. We know from our decades of experience supporting refugees across the UK that being with loved ones is essential for people to rebuild their lives and integrate.Behind every number crossing the Channel is a human being with hopes and fears. They have endured unimaginable suffering, and too many are losing their lives.Alex FraserDirector of refugee services, British Red CrossHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It starts with a joke, 10 July).Did we all dream Spitting Image, Saturday Night Live, Have I Got News for You, Ben Elton, or Jo Brand’s “battery acid” quip about Nigel Farage? The left practically invented modern political satire as we know it – and rightly so. Holding power to account through ridicule is not only legitimate but essential. But suddenly, when humour points the other way, it becomes seditious? Dangerous? Please.Humour is neither inherently leftwing nor rightwing – it is anti-hypocrisy, anti-power and often subversive. To suggest that jokes from the right (which I accept are sometimes crass, reductive or tribal) are somehow uniquely dangerous while ignoring the gleeful savagery historically dished out to Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, George Bush or more recently Donald Trump, is not analysis – it’s tribal whingeing.What truly undermines progressive societies is the retreat from self-awareness. The idea that “our” humour is noble and “theirs” is insidious. The moment any movement begins to believe it has a monopoly on moral legitimacy and irony, it’s already drifting toward parody. A healthy society can laugh at itself from all angles. If you’re afraid of jokes, maybe it’s not the comedians who need to be challenged but the fragility of the ideas being defended.John ButlerAnstey, LeicestershireContra George Monbiot, isn’t the real problem with the left precisely that we have lost the ability to mock our enemies? Don’t we need more venomous satire of our own – fighting fire with fire? The Guardian’s own Martin Rowson is a great example: relentless, scabrous and merciless towards those who themselves show no mercy. Richard Pryor, Lenny Bruce and Jo Brand all used humour as a thought experiment about how our society could be otherwise.Anyone who has seen Eddie Murphy’s “first black president” ducking and dodging assassin’s bullets as he makes a speech will have seen the racial dynamics of the US embodied in a really funny comedy routine.Being permanently offended rather than seeking to cause offence in return shows how house-trained and academicised the left has become. If “humour permits obscene ideas to seep into the range of the possible”, we need to recognise that socialism is the obscene idea that capitalism seeks to repress and try to cause some offence of our own.Nick MossLondonGeorge Monbiot is right to highlight the right’s use of humour to normalise their odious ideas, but progressives have used humour in a similar way to normalise ideas that those they are targeting find hard to accept.Oscar Wildewas a master at this, with his plays attended in droves and loved by the very people he was lampooning. Did they recognise themselves on stage, resplendent in their pomposity and condescension? Subconsciously at least, they must have, and I suspect he did as much to change society for the better as anyone.It is, as Monbiot points out, a powerful tactic and one that we can continue to employ against those who would use it against us.Phil UribeLlandrindod Wells, PowysHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This is true of many thousands of parents with children in the system.Does John really believe that there are parents in enough numbers who are successfully exaggerating their children’s special educational needs and disabilities to have caused a notable increase in the bill for Send provision? Please.I ask him to do some research and instead ask why the government keeps letting these vulnerable children down before pointing the finger at parents who are simply fighting for their children to access education, the same as any other child deserves in the country.Suzanna NolanEast Molesey, SurreyHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Looting raids on other villages killed 38 civilians and dozens more people were missing, it added.WHO says attack on Sudanese hospital killed more than 40 civiliansRead moreMore than 3,400 people have fled the recent fighting, according to the UN.Emergency Lawyers said: “It has been proven that these targeted villages were completely empty of any military objectives, which makes clear the criminal nature of these crimes carried out in complete disregard of international humanitarian law.” It placed the responsibility with the RSF’s leadership.The army has taken firm control of the centre and east of Sudan, while the RSF is working to consolidate its control of western regions including North Kordofan.Fighting between the RSF and the army restarted this month in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur state, after a weeks-long lull.In fighting last Friday that lasted hours, the RSF captured a livestock market, prison and military base in El Fasher and entered the city’s centre. The Sudanese army pushed the paramilitary group out the next day but RSF forces continued shelling the city using drones.El Fasher, the largest city in Darfur and a stronghold of the Sudanese army, is the last major city in the Darfur region that is not under RSF control. It has witnessed rising violence this year as the Sudanese army and RSF forces fight over it. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled the city to nearby Tawila since April.Areportreleased early this month by Médecins Sans Frontières showed systematic patterns of violence including looting, mass killings, sexual violence, abductions, starvation and attacks against markets, health facilities and other civilian infrastructure in El Fasher.Early this month, the UN sounded the alarm over the worsening conditions in Sudan, saying the situation was particularly dire in El Fasher, where those remaining were facing “extreme shortages” of food and clean water.The US and human rights groups have accused the RSF of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. Its soldiers have carried out a series of violent looting raids in territory it has taken control of across the country.The RSF leadership says it will bring to justice anyone found responsible for such acts.Sudan’s civil war has created theworld’s largest humanitarian crisis, driving more than half the population into hunger and spreading diseases including cholera across the country. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more than 12 million people have fled their homes since the fighting broke out two years ago, and a global reduction in aid spending has stretched the humanitarian response.The UN’s office for humanitarian affairs haswarnedthat Darfur’s rainy season, which is expected to continue until October, threatens to exacerbate the humanitarian situation by increasing the risk of floods, access constraints and outbreaks of disease.Reuters contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSudanAfricaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

They killed thousands of unarmed people and looted supplies, terrorising local people into compliance. The next year, Niger became officially absorbed into French west Africa.In Birni-N’Konni alone, an estimated 400 people were massacred in a day. Entire villages along the mission’s path – including Tibiri, Zinder and smaller communities – were burned and looted, with corpses hung at their entrances. Some survivors fled to neighbouring Nigeria and never returned.View image in fullscreenA picture depicting the death of a French military officer surrounded by Senegalesetirailleursin the battle of Kousséri in 1900.Photograph: World History Archive/AlamyWhen Paris dispatched Col Jean-François Klobb to replace Voulet in July that year and end the bloodletting, the superior officer was shot to death by soldiers acting on the latter’s instructions.In recent years, France has begun to engage with its historical wrongdoings in Africa even as anti-French sentiments soar across the continent. In 2021, President Emmanuel Macronadmitted France’s responsibility in the Rwandan genocide. A year later, Paris acknowledged the 1945 massacre of tens of thousands of Algerian civilians in Sétif. In May 2023, it issued a formal apology for the brutal repression of the 1947 Malagasy uprising.Still, there has been a reluctance to acknowledge the Voulet-Chanoine mission, which is largely absent from French schoolbooks and only faintly remembered in Niger’s national curriculum. Instead, there was a bureaucratic cover-up and accounts of survivors’ descendants have been weak or subdued, often due to decades of silence and trauma.The case relied on documents written by Nigerien historians and limited archival materials including reports by Voulet himself, said the British-Senegalese lawyer Jelia Sané who worked with the affected communities. The communities are now requesting access to official archives in order to reveal the true extent of the atrocities.“The graves of some of the [French] troops are still in those communities today, even though the victims were never memorialised,” said Sané.For Hosseini Tahirou Amadou, a history and geography teacher in Dioundiou who began the campaign in 2014, acknowledging the atrocities would be the first step in the right direction. “After this recognition, now we can move on to the next step, which is reparation,” he said. “During these crimes, precious objects linked to our history were stolen to France. We need their return.”In its response to the UN special rapporteur, the French government neither denied nor admitted the atrocities, but cited the principle of non-retroactivity of international law, saying any treaties it was deemed to have contravened were ratified long after the incident occurred.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Paris also said it was yet to receive restitution requests concerning MAC-related looted artefacts or human remains from Nigerien authorities.“They don’t dispute [the incident] overtly or implicitly … they don’t really engage with the facts,” Sané said. “However, it’s not really possible for them to dispute these things because they investigated a number of these allegations themselves.”The case findings will be included in the next UN human rights report and presented to the general assembly in October. Historians say it could promote continent-wide conversations on reparations.The African Union has labelled 2025 theYear of Reparations, after a decade of sustained lobbying by four Nigerien communities that was accelerated in 2021 after the release of theBBC documentary African Apocalypse, which was screened in French and Hausa around the country.In 2021, Germanyformally acknowledged colonial-era genocides in Namibiaand pledged €1.1bn over 30 years in aid as a form of symbolic reconciliation, though it stopped short of calling it reparation or compensation.The matter of monetary compensation is yet to be addressed by the communities as the exact number of victims remains unknown. However, the historian and former higher education minister Mamoudou Djibo is adamant that things are not at that stage yet.“We are not beggars,” he said. “Our demand for reparation is not systematically that we are given money but that first of all, France recognises that it has committed crimes against humanity. When this is recognised, we will be ready to dialogue.”In its letter, France said its schools taught the history of colonisation and that “the level of curriculum-writing leaves great pedagogical freedom to teachers to address these themes”, but did not clarify if the Voulet-Chanoine mission was included.Back in Niger, Amadou is waiting for the crimes to be taught in French schools and for what he considers the bare minimum – a memorial to the massacre. “These communities deserve to have monuments, because these are things that should not be forgotten,” he said.Explore more on these topicsNigerAfricaColonialismFranceEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

The legislation, combined with the president’s own executive actions, will cause an extra 7bn tonnes of planet-heating gases to be released in just the next five years,analysisof Princeton University datahas found.This pollution will worsen an already escalatingclimate crisisthat is causing wildfires to become longer and fiercer. Scientists havefoundthat extreme fire years are becoming far more common around the world as it heats up, with the area of land burned in the US westincreasingeightfold since the 1980s. The climate crisis caused 15,000 people in the US to die from toxic wildfire smoke just in the 15-year period until 2020, recent researchdiscovered.View image in fullscreenThe sun sets behind the US Capitol on 3 June in Washington DC. Smoke from recent wildfires in Canada has drifted into the Washington metropolitan area, causing a haze in the sky.Photograph: Kevin Carter/Getty ImagesMore than 100 wildfires are burning in Canada’s Manitoba province, causing smoke to cascade southwards into the US midwest. More than 20 million people in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan have been subjected toair quality alertstelling them to stay inside.Canada has had a string of major wildfire years, most notablyin 2023, and the climate crisis is a major factor in this, according to John Abatzoglou, a climatologist and wildfire expert at University of California, Merced.“We are seeing a very clear increase in fire risk, we are getting hotter and drier conditions that are elevating the fire danger,” he said. “We have had hot, dry, tinderbox conditions in 2023, 2024 and this year as well.“These aren’t one-off events, the odds are now stacked for widespread, chronically hot and dry landscapes that will burn. Every year with additional carbon emissions will make it much more challenging for the decades ahead.”The Republican letter to Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador, mentions “a lack of active forest management” and arson as reasons for the conflagrations but does not mention climate change. The current Canadian fires, however, are centered in remote boreal forests that do not have a long history of human intervention and are usually ignited by lightning rather than arson, Abatzoglou said.Canadian wildfires prompt air-quality alerts across five US statesRead more“It’s very hard to suppress fire in these areas,” he said. “I’m not sure how much we can do to manage our way out of this problem, other than ramp down our carbon emissions to address climate change.”Climate groups were scathing of the letter. “Trump andRepublicansin Congress just passed a bill that will increase pollution and put Americans at greater risk from the danger of extreme weather,” said Pete Jones, the rapid response director of Climate Power.“If the GOP wants to know who’s responsible for the health impacts of climate change in the US, they should take a closer look at their own voting records.”All of the six Republican letter authors were contacted for comment. A spokesperson for the Canadian embassy said: “Canada takes the prevention, response, and mitigation of wildfires very seriously. We can confirm that the letter has been received by the embassy and has been shared with the relevant Canadian agencies. We will respond in due course.”Explore more on these topicsRepublicansCanadaWildfiresUS politicsAmericasClimate crisisPollutionnewsShareReuse this content"

Chinese buyers have lined up to buy the semiconductors in response to the news, according to early reports.“It’s so innovative and dynamic here in China that it’s really important that American companies are able to compete and serve the market,” he said. He noted that half of the world’s AI researchers are in China.Huang recently met withDonald Trumpand other US policymakers and this week is in Beijing to attend a supply chain conference and speak with Chinese officials.

The emergence of China’s DeepSeek AI chatbot in January renewed concerns over how China might use the advanced chips to help develop its own AI capabilities that would compete with those from the US.In January, before Trump began his second term in office, the Biden administration launched a new framework for exporting advanced computer chips used to develop artificial intelligence, an attempt to balance national security concerns about the technology with the economic interests of producers and other countries. Then in April, Trump’s White House announced that it would restrict sales of Nvidia’s H20 chips and AMD’s MI308 chips to China.Nvidia had said the tighter export controls would cost the company an extra $5.5bn, and Huang and other technology leaders have been lobbying Trump to reverse the restrictions. They argue that such limits hinder US competition in a leading-edge sector in one of the world’s largest markets for technology.They’ve also warned that US export controls could end up pushing other countries toward China’s AI technology.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationNvidiaChinaDonald TrumpUS politicsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

From May 2020 China imposed $20bn in trade sanctions on Australia followinga long list of grievances, including foreign investment controls, national security settings and the Morrison government’s push for an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic.Albanese matched Xi’s calls for calmer relations.“I note your comments in your opening remarks about seeking common ground while sharing differences,” he said.Which political animals will be at Anthony Albanese’s meeting in China? | Fiona KatauskasRead more“That approach has indeed produced very positive benefits for both Australia and for China.”Speaking after the meeting, Albanese said the Port of Darwin’s ownership was not raised. Labor and the Coalition both pledged during this year’s election campaign to take back ownership from a Chinese-linked company,even using taxpayer funds if necessary. China has objected to the plans.Albanese said he raised the case of theChinese-Australian academic Yang Hengjun, but that he did not expect an immediate end to his detention after asuspended death sentence rulingin February 2024.“PresidentXi Jinpingand I agreed dialogue must be at the centre of our relationship,” Albanese said.“If you don’t have communication, you can have misadventure and misinterpretation.”He promised “patient, calibrated advocacy” by the government on a range of sensitive issues.The Trump administration has been pushing Labor to make clear if Australia would commit troops to a conflict with China over the fate of Taiwan, something Labor is unwilling to do. Albanese said Australia supported “the status quo” in Taiwan.Coalition senator James Paterson noted on Tuesday that the US had not declared whether it would come to Taiwan’s aid in the event of an invasion, and Australia should not have to either.“It’s had that policy consistently since 1979 – when the Taiwan Relations Act passed Congress – so it wouldn’t be appropriate for the US government to ask Australia to do more than the United States is willing to do in relation to that,” he told ABC radio.Albanese said he raised the live fire exercise by the Chinese navy off the New South Wales coast earlier this year with Xi, who noted that Australia engages in military exercises too.“I said what I said at the time: it was within international law, there was no breach of international law by China, but that we were concerned about the notice and the ways that it happened, including the live fire exercises,” Albanese said.The prime minister later met China’s premier, Li Qiang, who said relations between the two countries had “moved beyond a low point and returned to the right track of stability and development,”.Since the pair last met in October last year “a lot has happened in the world”, Li said, and there was growing instability and uncertainty in the global economy.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

When it looked like one of the guards might block one of the camera operators, she intervened immediately, telling them to step back. It was deftly done.”China strictly controls media reporting, censors its own citizens, including on social media, and closely monitors foreigners visiting the country.Asked about the incident, Albanese said he respected the media and wanted to answer questions.“China has a different system obviously with the media, but certainly I am here, being accountable, I came straight here, and I’m going straight back,” he said.Earlier the opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said China had disrespected Australia by conducting live fire military exercises, forcing commercial planes to change their routes.She called on Albanese to object to China’s push to grow its reach across Indo-Pacific nations.“The prime minister should speak frankly about the increasing influence that China has in the region, and speak about the importance to Australia of the US relationship,” she said.Explore more on these topicsAustralian foreign policyAustralian mediaAnthony AlbaneseXi JinpingChinaAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, companies have moved their supply chains outside China in an attempt to avoid tariffs, and Chinese businesses have also been developing non-US markets. But no country can replace the purchasing power of US consumers.The trade war has spread into non-tariff measures, such as restrictions onrare earths exports, causing manufacturing slowdowns for western carmakers.China’s policymakers face a daunting task in achieving the annual growth target of about 5% – a goal many analysts view as ambitious given entrenched deflation and weak demand at home.Wei Yao, an economist at Société Générale, said: “Despite a strong first half, the outlook is set to sour in [the second half of the year] as export front-loading fades and the impact of US tariffs becomes more visible.“Renewed weakness in house prices and the fading impact of subsidies also cast doubt over the sustainability of the consumption recovery.”Indeed, the solid headline GDP numbers held little sway for most households including Mallory Jiang, a 30-year-old doctor in the southern tech hub Shenzhen, who told Reuters she and her husband had pay cuts this year.“Both our incomes as doctors have decreased, and we still don’t dare buy an apartment. We are cutting back on expenses: commuting by public transport, eating at the hospital cafeteria or cooking at home. My life pressure is still actually quite high.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Police had also been in regular contact with Falconio’s family.“He’s [Murdoch’s] not being too forthcoming in regards to engaging with police, but we will continue doing what we have to,” he said.“There may be someone out there that he’s confided in, whether or not that’s family or friends, we just don’t know.“Like any ongoing police investigation, you want to solve it, you want to try to at least bring some sliver of resolution to Peter’s family by bringing home his remains.”Murdoch’s family issued a statement on Wednesday, acknowledging his death.“To many, Bradley Murdoch is known only for the events that led to his conviction in 2005 for the murder of British backpacker Peter Falconio, a crime for which he has always denied responsibility from his arrest until his death,” his family said.“But to those who truly knew him, he was much more than the headlines.When given the opportunity, Brad was a devoted father, father-in-law, and proud Poppy who never missed a chance to brag about his grandchildren. He was a beloved brother, uncle, and friends.”The family said Murdoch maintained his innocence until his death.“We understand that the public perception of Bradley will always be shaped by his conviction, but our intention is simply to share the man we knew, the version of him that was rarely, if ever, seen beyond our family and close friends,” his family said.“He was deeply loved.

That number fell to 186 in term 1 of 2024 and a trend of 50% declines continued throughout terms 2 and 3.The vaping crackdown is designed to stop younger people migrating to smoking. Tobacco use remains Australia’s leading cause of preventable death and kills more than 24,000 people each year.Butler said a major decrease in vaping and smoking rates would take time, “but we are here for the long haul for a healthier Australia”.It follows 2023 data analysed by Cancer Council Victoria’s Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer that foundan uptick in the proportion of 14-to-17-year-olds using tobacco and vaping, with the centre noting it was the first increase in teen smoking since the early to mid-1990s.Explore more on these topicsHealthVapingSmokingMark ButlerAustralian politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

Without a firm, tangible and verifiable commitment from Iran, we will do so by the end of August at the latest.”Europeans have been largely elbowed aside from the Iranian nuclear issue by Donald Trump, who ordered the bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites last month, and this intervention can be seen as an attempt to reassert Europe’s influence.The end of August deadline starts a process that could lead to an armoury of sanctions being reimposed by 15 October, giving European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal – the UK, France and Germany – a continuing lever in negotiations with Iran. The European powers want to see the return of the UN nuclear inspectorate to Iran, in part to prevent Iran trying to reconfigure its nuclear programme after the damage inflicted by the US strikes in June.The way in which the 2015 nuclear deal was negotiated does not allow the other signatories, China or Russia, to veto the sanctions snapback, but the European states can defer the imposition of snapback beyond October to allow time for further consultation.The US, after leaving the nuclear deal in 2018, also cannot veto the UK or French move. The sanctions snapback would be triggered under chapter seven of the UN charter, making the reinstatement of six UN resolutions mandatory, including one that requires Iran to suspend all activities related to uranium enrichment and reprocessing, including at the research and development level.Another reimposed resolution would require all UN member states to prevent the transfer of any items, materials or technologies that could serve these activities or Iran’s missile programme.Iranian sanctions experts claim the reinstated resolutions would not automatically halt all Iranian oil exports, cut off Iran’s access to international financial systems, or cut off general trade communications. But all countries and international financial institutions would have to refrain from providing financial assistance, new commitments or preferential loans to the Iranian government, except for humanitarian and development purposes.Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian foreign minister, said recently that the activation of snapback “will mean the end of Europe’s role in the Iranian nuclear issue and may be the darkest point in the history of Iran’s relations with the three European countries, a point that may never be repaired.” He said: “It would mark the end of Europe’s role as a mediator between Iran and the US.”He told diplomats at the weekend “One of the big mistakes of the Europeans is that they think that the ‘snapback’ tool in their hands gives them the power to act on the Iranian nuclear issue, while this is a completely wrong perception. If these countries move towards snapback, they will make the resolution of the Iranian nuclear issue even more complicated and difficult.”Explore more on these topicsIran's nuclear programmeIran nuclear dealIranMiddle East and north AfricaEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Everyone will have to contribute to the effort.”France is under pressure to bring its public deficit, running at 5.8% of GDP, under the 3% figure required by EU rules, and to rein in €3.3tn of public debt – on which the annual interest, of €60bn, could soon become its biggest budget outlay.The debt mountain represented a “mortal danger” for a country “on a cliff edge” and “still addicted to public spending”, Bayrou said, outlining steps he said would cut €43.8bn from the budget, reducing the deficit to 4.6% next year and 3% by 2029.Other measures would include an across-the-board freeze on government spending except for debt servicing and the defence sector, which PresidentEmmanuel Macrondemanded should be increased by €3.5bn next year and more in 2027.The budget squeeze will also entail keeping pensions at their 2025 level, capping welfare spending and reducing healthcare expenditure by €5bn. Civil service and government agency salaries would be frozen and public sector job numbers cut.The move to scrap public holidays is likely to meet strong resistance, although France has previously discussed combiningVE Daywith Armistice Day on 11 November, creating a single memorial day for the victims of the first and second world wars.“Cancelling two holidays is a direct attack on our history, our roots and on working France,” said Jordan Bardella of the far-right National Rally (RN), the largest single party in parliament. “No RN MP will accept a measure that amounts to provocation.”Other party leaders were equally damning. The proposals were “an organised hold-up”, said Fabien Roussel of the French Communist party. Jean-Luc Mélenchon of the radical left LFI said it was “time to expel Bayrou” and “end this destruction, these injustices”.A Socialist party MP, Boris Vallaud, condemned it as “a brutal and unacceptable budget”. He added: “Asking always more from those who have little, and so little from those who have much, is neither serious, effective, nor just.”Macron’s decision to call a snap election last year delivered a hung parliament in which Bayrou does not have enough votes to pass a budget without the support of the left or the right, both of which oppose his proposals for different reasons.Without an agreement, the veteran prime minister could face a no-confidence motion similar to the one that toppled his predecessor, Michel Barnier, as early as October, when his detailed budget bill is due to go before to parliament.Explore more on these topicsFranceEuropeEmmanuel MacronVE DayEasternewsShareReuse this content"

If it’s launchers, that’s possible,” he added.Each Patriot system comes with six launchers. Germany has agreed to provide two Patriot systems, with the Netherlands donating a third, Skibitskyi said. “That would be 18 launchers for three batteries, which is close to 17. The US administration and the Pentagon will give us further details,” he added.The possibility of the US providing long-range Tomahawk missiles to Ukraine, as discussed by Trump and Zelenskyy this month, is likely to enrage Vladimir Putin. The precision cruise missiles are capable of striking Moscow and have a range of 1,600km. Previous Ukrainian requests were rejected by the Biden administration.During a call on 4 July, Trump asked Zelenskyy if he could hit the Russian capital and St Petersburg. According to Skibitskyi, Zelenskyy replied: “Yes, absolutely. We can if you give us the weapons”. Trump on Tuesday said Ukraine should not target Moscow.Aid donations to UkraineThe Trump administration has so far not agreed to send Tomahawks. If it did provide the weapons, Ukraine would struggle to deploy them, Skibitskyi said. “They are not easy to use. The main launchers are combat ships or strategic bombers. We don’t have any strategic bomber aircraft,” he recognised.But he said it was crucial Ukraine had the ability to conduct “kinetic” strikes deep inside Russia against high-value military targets. Discussions were ongoing with Washington over lifting restrictions imposed by the last administration on the use of Atacams, US provided missiles with a 300km range – about 190 miles.The Washington Postreported on Tuesdaythat the Trump administration was likely to allow Atacams to be used inside Russia at their full range, and was considering sending additional missiles. Currently, they can only be fired into Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, and not used on Russian territory.Skibitskyi said the Kremlin had already moved its strategic military bases more than 500km from its border with Ukraine. Kyiv was only able to hit them using unmanned kamikaze drones which can carry 5okg of explosives. Atacams, by contrast, have a 500kg payload and can cause greater destruction.“It’s very important for us to get approval from the US to use long-range missiles,” he said. “We want to destroy and to disrupt, in accordance withNatoprocedure.”Zelenskyy said he had a “really good conversation” with Trump following Monday’s announcement of a big weapons package. He said he discussed with the US president how to achieve “a lasting and just peace” and to stop Russian bombardment of Ukrainian cities, which have beenhit in recent weeks by hundreds of drones and missiles.Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands on Tuesday said they wanted to participate in Trump’s plan forEuropeto buy US weapons for Ukraine.Pledged European aidPoliticians in Kyiv have broadly welcomed the improvement in relations with the US, following Zelenskyy’s disastrous White House meeting with Trump in February. But there was also frustration that US tariffs and secondary sanctions on Russia have been postponed again, with Trump setting a deadline of 50 days.In an interview with the BBC, Trump said he was “disappointed, but not done” with Putin.Russian officials have dismissed Trump’s threat as “hot air”, pointing out he has changed his mind several times on sanctions and other issues. “Trump issued a theatrical ultimatum to the Kremlin. The world shuddered, expecting the consequences … Russia didn’t care,” the former president Dmitry Medvedev wrote on X.Trump’s envoy to Ukraine, Gen Keith Kellogg, is in Kyiv on a week-long visit. On Monday he met Zelenskyy and commander in chief Gen Oleksandr Syrskyi, as well as Kyrylo Budanov, Ukraine’s military intelligence chief and Skibitskyi. Kellogg was briefed on Russian plans for a summer offensive and on the latest from the frontline in the east, where Russian troops are advancing.Skibitskyi said the US president had “more experienced” people around him than in his first presidential term and did not behave like a “classical” politician. “He’s more of a businessman. It isn’t easy to understand Mr Trump,” Skibitskyi added.Explore more on these topicsUkraineEuropeUS militaryNatoVolodymyr ZelenskyynewsShareReuse this content"

It’s all of them. It’s a full complement, with the batteries,” Trump said.He did not go into any more detail, but made clear the weapons would be entirely paid for by Washington’s European allies, and that initial missile deliveries would come “within days” from European stocks, on the understanding they would be replenished with US supplies.At a White House lunch with religious leaders later in the day, Trump said the deal was “fully approved, fully done”.“We’ll send them a lot of weapons of all kinds and they’re going to deliver those weapons immediately … and they’re going to pay,” he said.Graphic showing how Patriot missile defence system worksAt his meeting with Trump, Rutte said there was a significant number of Nato allies – including Germany, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Canada – ready to rearm Ukraine as part of the deal.“They all want to be part of this. And this is only the first wave. There will be more,” he said.The German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said last week that Berlin wasready to acquireadditional Patriot systems.Aid to UkraineTrump claimed there was one country, which he did not name, but which had “17 Patriots getting ready to be shipped”. Monday’s deal would include that stockpile, or “a big portion of the 17”, he said.Such an arms delivery would represent a significant reinforcement of Ukraine’s air defences. Kyiv is currently thought to have only six Patriot batteries, at a time when it is coming under frequent and intense Russian drone and missile bombardments.At the same time, Trump expressed increased frustration with Vladimir Putin, whom he accused of giving the impression of pursuing peace while intensifying attacks on Ukrainian cities. He gave the Russian president a new deadline of 50 days to end the fighting or face 100% tariffs on Russian goods, and more importantly, sweeping “secondary tariffs”, suggesting trade sanctions would be imposed on countries who continue to pay for Russian oil and other commodities.Map showing areas of Russian-controlled territory and recent Russian advances in Ukraine“The secondary tariffs are very, very powerful,” the president said.The announcement marked a dramatic change for the administration, both in substance and tone.The Trump White House had not only made clear it would continue its predecessor’s policy of continuing to supply Ukraine out of US stocks, but the president and his top officials have been derisive about Kyiv’s chances of prevailing.Trump’s hazy Ukraine arms announcement marks a tonal U-turnRead moreOn Monday, Trump delivered his most admiring language on Ukraine and its European backers to date, with Rutte on one side and the US vice-president, JD Vance, the administration’s biggest sceptic on US involvement in Europe, on the other.“They fought with tremendous courage, and they continue to fight with tremendous courage,” Trump said of the Ukrainians.“Europe has a lot of spirit for this war,” he said, suggesting he had been taken by surprise by the level of commitment shown by European allies at the Nato summit in The Hague last month. “The level of esprit de corps spirit that they have is amazing,” he said. “They really think it’s very, very important.“Having a strong Europe is a very good thing. It’s a very good thing. So I’m okay with it,” he said.Graph showing numbers of Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine by date in 2025Trump described his deepening disillusion with Putin, and suggested his wife, Melania, may have played a role in pointing out the Russian leader’s duplicity in talks over a peace deal.Kyiv hails US weapons deal as Moscow dismisses Trump’s sanctions threatRead more“My conversations with him are always very pleasant. I say, isn’t that a very lovely conversation? And then the missiles go off that night,” Trump said. “I go home, I tell the first lady: I spoke with Vladimir today. We had a wonderful conversation. She said: Really? Another city was just hit.”Ukrainian regional officials reported at least six civilians killed and 30 injured by Russian bombing in the past 24 hours. The country’s air force said Moscow had attacked with 136 drones and four S-300 or S-400 missiles.“Look, I don’t want to say he’s an assassin, but he’s a tough guy. It’s been proven over the years. He’s fooled a lot of people,” Trump said, listing his predecessors in the White House.“He didn’t fool me. But what I do say is that at a certain point, ultimately talk doesn’t talk. It’s got to be action,” he said.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Andrii Kovalenko, a member of Ukraine’s national security and defence council, posted a one-word response: “Cool.”There was still scepticism however, over whether even the promise of new weaponry for Ukraine combined with the threat of trade sanctions would be enough to halt Russia’s offensive.Illia Ponomarenko, a Ukrainian journalist and blogger wrote: “How many Ukrainian lives could have been saved if, from the very beginning, Trump had listened to wise and honest people about helping Ukraine, instead of the artful lies of that cannibal Putin on the phone?”.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUS foreign policyRussiaNatoTrump administrationEuropeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

He decried what the family saw as indifference from the US government over the murder of one of its citizens.“Somebody needs to be held accountable,” he said.Israeli settlers kill American-Palestinian visiting relatives in West Bank, says familyRead more“He wanted to be a businessman ever since he was young. He was planning on expanding, finding a wife, having a family. That was his dream but it was cut short at 20 years old, cut short unjustly.”Musallet was beaten with clubs and bats, and died in the same attack that killed a 23-year-old Palestinian man. Razek Hussein al-Shalabi was shot and left to bleed to death, the Palestinian health ministry said.Hasem Musallet said the settlers prevented ambulances from reaching the injured men, and that a brother watched Sayfollah take his last breath.Hiba Rahim, deputy executive director of the Florida chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), said Musallet’s family wanted Donald Trump, and the departments of justice and state, to prosecute his killers under US law.She also condemned a statement from the state department that said it had no comment on Musallet’s death “out of respect for the privacy of the family and loved ones during this difficult time”.Rahim said: “We’re not asking, and his family is not asking, for silence. We’re asking for accountability.“If Sayfollah was killed by anyone else or in another country, there would already be investigations, there would already be attempts for arrest, and calls for arrest and outrage in Washington.“Where is the outrage from our government? Where is the accountability?”The state department did not respond to a request from the Guardian for further comment.Later on Mondayin a post to X, Mike Huckabee, the US ambassador to Israel, made the first official acknowledgment by the Trump administration of Musallet’s death using his name.“I have askedIsraelto aggressively investigate the murder of Saif Mussallet [sic], an American citizen who was visiting family in Sinjil when he was beaten to death,” Huckabee wrote.“There must be accountability for this criminal and terrorist act. Saif was just 20 yrs old.”Hasem Musallet broke down in tears during the Monday press conference as he remembered his nephew as “just a very rare soul” who would help anybody in need. He said Musallet was on a trip with family members from Florida, and enjoying time in the mountains and barbecuing with friends in the West Bank in the days before his death.“He was very loving, caring. Just like any other 20-year-old he would go out with his friends after work, he’d watch comedy, he’d go out driving, he’d go to the beach. He would come to my house always, and come to his grandmother and give her a hug and kiss her hand,” Hasem said.The Israeli military claimed the incident happened after stones were thrown at Israelis and that “a violent confrontation developed” and said it was looking into the incident. Rahim dismissed this, saying: “There were no clashes. These are the same lies we hear every time a guilty party is guilty of monstrous activity like what we saw with Sayfollah’s death.“This isnot an isolated tragedy. There’s a devastating pattern of Americans being killed in Israel, brutalized and murdered with impunity by Israeli forces and settlers.”Musallet’s death is part of agrowing wave of violenceby Israeli settlers in the West Bank.

Syrian state media also reported Israeli strikes on Tuesday in the nearby province of Deraa.Israel, which wants to weaken the new administration in Damascusto maintain its military dominance in the region, said it had struck several tanks in Sweida as a “warning”.Syria’s foreign ministry condemned in a statement what it called “treacherous Israeli aggression” and said “a number of our armed forces and security personnel” as well as “several innocent civilians” were killed.In Lebanon, Israeli aircraft bombed the Bekaa Valley region and killed 12 people, Lebanese state media reported, including a strike on a camp for displaced people. Reuters cited an unnamed Lebanese security source saying that five of the dead were Hezbollah fighters.Map of Lebanon and SyriaThe Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said Tuesday’s strikes sent a “clear message” to Hezbollah, a faction Israel has fought against for decades, including by repeatedly invading Lebanon.The strikes on Lebanon and Syria did not appear to be coordinated, but follow a pattern of regular Israeli assaults on armed forces across the region, including in Palestine, Iran and Yemen.In Syria, the transitional government has said it had sent the forces south to end days of clashes between Druze and Bedouin groups, who remained armed following the end of the civil war.The defence minister earlier on Tuesday announced a ceasefire in the Druze-majority southern city of Sweida.View image in fullscreenSyrian security forces in an area between Mazraa and Walga near the predominantly Druze city of Sweida.Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP/Getty ImagesAfter an “agreement with the city’s notables and dignitaries, we will respond only to the sources of fire and deal with any targeting by outlaw groups,” the defence minister, Murhaf Abu Qasra, said in a statement.According to the interior ministry in Syria, which isstruggling to achieve stabilityafter a 13-year civil war, more than 30 people have been killed and nearly 100 others injured in the clashes.However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor with sources inside the country, reported at least 203 dead. The dead include 92 members of the Druze minority, it said, as well as 93 security personnel and 18 Bedouins.The clashes initially broke out between armed groups from the Druze and Sunni Muslim Bedouin clans, the observatory said, with some members of the government security forces “actively participating” in support of the Bedouins.On Tuesday, the observatory reported government forces had carried out what it called an “execution” of 12 Druze civilians in Sweida. Unverified footage online showed the bloodied bodies of 10 people in civilian clothes.Israel’s militaryhas previously moved in troops and attacked key military sites across Syria by air. It said its strikes on southern Syria were to enforce the complete demilitarisation of the area, with which it shares a frontier. It also said they were intended todefend the Druzeminority living there, although leaders from the sect rebuffed that claim.Syria announces ceasefire after deadly clashes between Druze and Bedouin fightersRead moreSyria’s minority populations, which also include Christians, Alawites, Shia Muslims and Kurds, are wary of the new Sunni-led administration after a devastating civil war in which the former ruling Assad family exploited and ignited sectarian division to protect itself. Since the overthrow of the former president, Bashar al-Assad, continuing sectariankillingshave marred the new government’s first months.The Syrian interior ministry spokesperson Noureddine al-Baba told the Associated Press that the clashes in Sweida “are fundamentally not sectarian in nature”.“The real conflict is between the state and bandits and criminals, not between the state and any Syrian community,” he said. “On the contrary, the state views the Druze community in Sweida as a partner in advancing the national unity project.”Roughly 1 million Druze people, who follow an offshoot of a branch of Shia Islam, live in Syria, Lebanon and Israel.View image in fullscreenPeople carry a man wounded during clashes between Bedouin and Druze fighters.Photograph: Bakr Alkasem/AFP/Getty ImagesDruze religious authorities had called for a ceasefire in the area on Monday, saying they were not opposed to the Syrian central government.But Sheikh Hikmat al-Hijri, one of the three Druze spiritual leaders in Sweida, later expressed his rejection of the entry of general security forces into the province, demanding “international protection”.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller by members of a Bedouin group who had set up a checkpoint, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.The UN deputy special envoy for Syria, Najat Rochdi, said in a statement that the clashes underscored the “urgent need for genuine inclusion, trust-building, and meaningful dialogue to advance a credible and inclusive political transition in Syria”.Israeli forces in Decemberseized a UN-patrolled buffer zoneon Syrian territory along the border with the occupied Golan Heights and have launched hundreds of airstrikes on military sites in Syria.While many Druze in Syria have said they do not want Israel to intervene on their behalf, factions from the Druze minority have also been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus afterAssad fled the countryin December during a rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups. On several occasions, Druze groups have clashed with security forces from the new government or allied factions.In May, Israeli forces struck a site near the presidential palace in Damascus, in what was seen as a warning to Syria’s interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa. The new president has repeatedly said he is not interested in a conflict with Israel while Syria struggles to rebuild.The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse contributed to this reportExplore more on these topicsSyriaIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaLebanonnewsShareReuse this content"

It also criticised the former minister, who also held the human rights brief, for taking up the role with such a close association to a repressive government.According to the most recent reports from Human Rights Watch, the Bahraini government has in effect silenced political opposition, banned independent media and subjected internal opponents to brutal treatment including torture.In a letter to Ahmad from April, Acoba advised that the risk in Ahmad taking up the role was low. It said: “You said that you had no involvement in policy development, contractual and/or commercial decisions specific to the KHC. You also said that you did not have official dealings/ contact with the KHC during your time in office.“You did not have any involvement in decisions specific to the KHC during your time in office. The committee therefore considered the risk this appointment could reasonably be perceived as a reward for decisions made, or actions taken in office, is low.”However, in the complaint submitted to Acoba and seen by the Guardian, Ahmad wasphotographed at the centrein February 2022 alongside the British ambassador, in his role as the prime minister’s special envoy for preventing sexual violence.Two days later, the Bahraini news agency filed a report saying that Ahmad “praises the King Hamad Global Center for Peaceful Coexistence’s programmes in combating hate speech and extremism” and was picturedreceiving a trophy boxfrom the deputy chair of the centre.Documents released under a Freedom of Information request confirm that the KHC was on Ahmad’s itinerary for an official government visit.In February 2023, Bahraini media reported Ahmad meeting Betsy Mathieson, the vice-chair of the KHC, where he is quoted as saying: “Our cooperation with the Kingdom of Bahrain and the King Hamad Global Center for Peaceful Coexistence will continue in every possible area.”Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Bird’s advocacy director, who filed the complaint, said: “It is impossible to conclude that the risk of benefiting from his former role is low, given that he concealed his involvement with the centre while occupying a ministerial position. This decision must be urgently reviewed in light of the ample evidence of those contacts.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ahmad did not respond to the request by the Guardian to disclose this.It is understood Ahmad believes the Acoba process was thorough and that the Foreign Office was fully consulted about his role. He is also understood to have met Bird during his time as Middle East minister.An Acoba spokesperson said: “Acoba does not endorse any role; its function is to provide independent advice under the government’s business appointment rules to protect the integrity of government. The committee seeks information from the applicant and a former minister’s department before formulating its advice. Acoba publishes its advice letters – including the information provided and consideration – on its website when a role is taken up. If there are allegations of non-compliance with the government’s rules or Acoba’s advice, these will be investigated. Findings of any breaches are published online and reported to government.”Explore more on these topicsHouse of LordsTransparencyBahrainConservativesMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It said UN member states had an obligation “not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the situation created by Israel’s illegal presence in the occupied Palestinian territory”.The UK has yet to say what steps if any it is required to take in response to the ICJ opinion.The Colombian president and conference host, Gustavo Petro, says the meeting will show that the world is finally moving from condemnation of Israel’s military action to collective action to bring it to a halt.The aim is to agree a detailed plan of political, economic and legal actions, but there are range of views over how far states can go politically or legally to isolate Israel, a country that feels secure so long as it maintains US support.The Hague Group was initially brought together by South Africa and Colombia, but since then support has grown and it now includes Algeria, Brazil, Spain, Indonesia and Qatar.Albanese, the UN special rapporteur for the occupied Palestinian territories, is determined to show that the US state department sanctions will not cow her.“For too long, international law has been treated as optional – applied selectively to those perceived as weak, ignored by those acting as the powerful. This double standard has eroded the very foundations of the legal order. That era must end,” she will say in Bogotá.“The world will remember what we, states and individuals, did in this moment – whether we recoiled in fear or rose in defence of human dignity. Here in Bogotá, a growing number of states have the opportunity to break the silence and revert to a path of legality by finally saying: enough. Enough impunity. Enough empty rhetoric. Enough exceptionalism. Enough complicity. The time has come to act in pursuit of justice and peace – grounded in rights and freedoms for all, and not mere privileges for some, at the expense of the annihilation of others.”Albanese will say that the UN charter and universal human rights instruments must remain everyone’s compass. “I trust that more states will align their policies with these fundamental principles as we move forward in this existential hour – for both the Palestinian and the Israeli people, and the integrity of the international legal order itself,” she will say.The sanctions on Albanese were imposed by the US state department for what it called her “shameful promotion” of action by the international criminal court against the US and Israel.Albanese will directly address the sanctions in Bogotá. “These attacks shall not be seen as against me personally. They are a warning to everyone who dares defend international justice and freedom. But we cannot afford to be silenced – and I know I am not alone,” she will say. “This is not about me or any other single individuals but about justice for the Palestinian people at the most critical juncture in their history.”In anarticle for the Guardianpublished last week, Petro framed the stakes of the conference. “We can either stand firm in defence of the legal principles that seek to prevent war and conflict, or watch helplessly as the international system collapses under the weight of unchecked power politics,” he wrote.A Hague Group conference in January attended by only nine nations committed to implementing the provisional measures of the international court of justice, issued on 26 January, 28 March and 24 May 2024.In practice this meant measures such arms embargos against Israel by preventing the docking of vessels at any port, if applicable, within their territorial jurisdiction.Varsha Gandikota-Nellutla, the executive secretary of the Hague Group, said: “We meet in Bogotá with a twin imperative: to end Israel’s impunity and sever the cords of complicity. The international court of justice has already made its rulings, deeming Israel’s continued presence in the Palestinian territories as unlawful. There is no absence of legal clarity.“States will now deliberate how to enforce their obligations – from ceasing arms exports and preventing harbour for vessels carrying military equipment to ensuring justice for all victims.”Explore more on these topicsPalestinian territoriesIsraelIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsInternational court of justiceColombiaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

In a statement to the Commons, he said he had felt “deeply concerned about the lack of transparency” around the data breach and “deeply uncomfortable to be constrained from reporting to this house”.1:14Data leak of Afghan scheme was 'serious departmental error', says UK defence secretary – videoHealey told MPs that he was first briefed about the topic when he was in opposition in December 2023 by the junior Conservative defence minister James Heappey, at which he was “issued with the superinjunction at the start of the meeting”. Its existence was also made known to the speaker, Lindsay Hoyle.However, the minister told MPs that neither Keir Starmer nor any other member of the current cabinet was briefed about the gagging order until “on taking office after the general election”.The minister said the leaked spreadsheet also included details of MPs, senior military officers and government officials linked to individual claims. The defence official who passed on the information in error had “mistakenly believed they were sending the names of 150 applicants”.In fact it contained 33,000 records among which was “personal information associated to 18,714 Afghans who had applied either to the ex gratia or the Arap [Afghan relocations and assistance policy] scheme on or before 7 January 2022”.The defence secretary said Labour would now halt the Afghan Response Route, which will cost a total of £850m and will help an estimated 6,900 people. Stopping the scheme will save a projected additional spend of £1.2bn, defence sources said – meaning the potential cost could have risen to more than £2bn.There were, Healey said, about 900 Afghans who were in Britain or in transit, with 3,600 family members at the cost of £400m and the UK would “honour the 600 invitations already made to any named person still inAfghanistanand their immediate family” – a number estimated at 1,800.Halting the scheme, however, would mean another 9,500 people would not come to the UK, he added.Three schemes, including the ARR, were created to help Afghans come to the UK after the Taliban takeover. So far, 36,000 people have arrived from the country, as of the end of March, and the government says the total cost of all relocation schemes will be between £5.5bn and £6bn.A Cabinet Office memo dated February 2025 that formed part of the evidence submitted to the court suggested that keeping open the ARR, the policy at the time, would mean relocating 25,000 Afghans at a time when “the UK’s asylum and immigration system is under strain”.Afghans have been betrayed yet again by this shocking UK data leak – and many don’t even know if they’re affected | Diane TaylorRead moreIt said the scheme would be extended by five years at a total cost of £7bn – but government officials said yesterday that sum was an error – and the figure in fact applied to the cost of all three Afghan resettlement schemes at the time. The other two were closed to new applicants at the beginning of July, with the costs now reduced, they said.One law firm, Barings, said it was pursuing potential legal action on behalf of 1,000 affected people, many of whom were linked to the Afghan armed forces during the period when the UK and other western militaries were based in the country.Adnan Malik, a lawyer with the firm, said: “This is essentially a database for anyone who wants to know who assisted the armed forces in Afghanistan.” He added: “If you’re someone whose family member or friend was killed by these individuals I’m sure you will want to take vengeance.”The initial decision to seek an injunction was taken by Ben Wallace, defence secretary until the end of August 2023. “We were determined that no harm came to those on the lists. The injunction was not about [a] cover-up. The judge, not us, decided on it being super,” he said.But it was maintained while Grant Shapps was defence secretary, with the ARR scheme devised to mitigate the risk following the leak. One ally of Shapps said: “We came in after the incident,” but added that it was “believed strongly” there was a duty to protect all those named on the list.Court judgments show that the size of the ARR kept increasing under the Conservatives. Ministers on the cabinet’s domestic and economic affairs committee decided in November to relocate 150 affected persons and their families, a figure that had risen to 2,300 people and 11,500 family members by March 2024.Labour said it had taken a year since coming to power to review the situation, and that decisions were taken after the commissioning of a review by Paul Rimmer, a retired civil servant whose conclusions were also shared with and published by the high court.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

It was unlikely, Rimmer said, that “merely being on the dataset would be grounds for targeting”.The official told ministers that “given this context, the ARR policy appears an extremely significant intervention, with not inconsiderable risk” to the government. He warned it raised questions about “value for money” given “the UK domestic housing system is under acute pressure; with record levels of homelessness and wider public service pressures”.In the high court, Chamberlain said the conclusions of Rimmer’s review “fundamentally undermine the evidential basis” on which he and the court of appeal in separate hearings had relied to decide that the MoD superinjunction should be upheld. The dramatically reduced threat assessment meant the extraordinary legal mechanism could no longer be justified.Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceMilitarySuperinjunctionsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaInjunctionsnewsShareReuse this content"

I thought the British government was very strong and now I’m in a very different situation.”The correspondence Abdullah and others received from the UK government, sent in English, Pashto and Dari, warned that the recipient’s email address had been used to make a resettlement application and that some personal data may have been compromised.It advised the recipient to “limit who can see your social media profiles and not accept friend/follow requests from individuals you do not know and trust”. It also urged the recipient not to take phone calls or respond to messages or emails from unknown contacts.“As some applications included the personal data of others (including family and dependents) you should assume that their data may also be compromised, and they should exercise the same precautions,” it added.Abdullah, who is being represented by the law firm Leigh Day, said his only hope is that the British government now speeds up his application.Ahmed, a former soldier who conducted operations in Afghanistan with British troops, said he wept when he realised his details were included in the dataset.He came to the UK with his wife and children under the Arap scheme after the fall of Kabul in August 2021, but many of his relatives are still in Afghanistan.Shortly after his arrival in the UK, his two younger brothers – one of whom had been involved in military operations – tried to flee the Taliban after the family home was raided but the pair were shot dead at the Iranian border.Ahmed, whose name has been changed for security reasons, said the leak included his Arap application number, which he had used to make a case for his wider family.“I was very worried and I started crying,” he said, describing the moment he realised he was a victim. “I thought everything is safe here. We did a lot of operations with British troops. I’m afraid. I’m worried about my brother and wife’s family and my colleagues because lots are in Afghanistan still. These things happen. The Taliban killed a lot of my friends as well.”He added: “I have a request to the British government: please don’t forget about our colleagues. A bad situation is going to happen in a couple of months if they don’t bring them here.”Prof Sara de Jong, a founding member of the Sulha Alliance, which helps ex-interpreters and others who worked for Britain, said it was “incredibly concerning” that theMinistry of Defenceroutinely asked Afghans for the most sensitive of personal data but couldn’t be trusted with data protection.“It is a horrible irony that the UK government had to save Afghans from their own data blunder, instead of prioritising those who are the Taliban’s prime target,” she said.“The vast amount of resource to cover up this error, could have been much better spent. For example, we see inexcusable delays in processing applications for family members at severe risk and many injured interpreters never received compensation.”Explore more on these topicsMinistry of DefenceData protectionImmigration and asylumAfghanistanMilitaryDefence policySouth and central AsiafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Many of the Afghans who backed it, worked for it or believed in broader western promises of long-term support for democracy and human rights were at risk.Despite Taliban promises of moderation in 2021, there was no room for complacency. The militants marked their previous capture of Kabul in 1996 by killing a former president and hanging his mutilated body from a lamp-post. They assassinated officials, activists, journalists and others throughout the war.Yet, at most, western embassies’ plans for immediate evacuations focused only on international staff. The UK timeline for processing asylum requests of Afghans who remained, and who had worked for or fought with British diplomats and troops was measured in months.As the Taliban marched towards Kabul, foreign secretary Dominic Raab’s decision to manage the situation from a beachholiday in Cretesummed up the UK government’s lack of urgency.With Afghan lives at immediate risk and Britain’s long-term credibility on the line, Raab clarified that although he was not available to take a call with the Afghan foreign minister, “no one was paddle-boarding” at the beach.It was an attitude that may have been bolstered by a similar approach in other European capitals. After Kabul fell, Afghan employees turned up for work at one embassy to find internationaldiplomats had been evacuatedovernight, while they hadn’t even been warned to stay at home.Desperate crowds gathered around the airport as western governments tried to set up mass evacuation operations on the fly. Nearly 200 people were killed by an Islamic State suicide attack on people waiting hours for a chance to leave.In the UK, civil servants were pulled in from their normal jobs to work around the clock processing in hours asylum that would normally have needed weeks. It was exhausting, stressful work, and many of them felt personal responsibility for ensuring vulnerable individuals could reach safety.They did not feel that burden was shared by everyone in government. Whistleblowers said the then-prime minister, Boris Johnson, ordered Whitehall to prioritise the evacuation of staff and pets from an animal rescue charity, not a historical Taliban target. He denies this, but hundreds of emails about the issueclogged upofficial inboxes.Those whose asylum requests were being considered by UK authorities, because of work at the embassy or with British forces, at least had hope of a route out.Neither the US nor its allies appeared to have given serious thought to the safety of Afghans whose work on issues like democracy and women’s rights had been key to the western mission – but who had no obvious route for asylum because they were not directly employed by foreign governments.Desperate social media messages went around seeking any refuge for prominent lawmakers, athletes and activists whose work and lives made them obvious targets.In less than two weeks, the airlift ended. Some of those who did not make it to the airport went into hiding to try to escape the revenge attacks that began almost immediately. Hundreds of killings have beendocumented by human rights groups.Others fled to Iran or Pakistan, where Afghans struggle to get refugee status. The UK system returned to its usual lethargic timelines after the media spotlight moved on, so families waited in terrified limbofor asylum bids to be processed, fearing expulsion back to Afghanistan and Taliban agents operating abroad.Now thousands of people inside Afghanistan and beyond it must grapple with another layer of fear and uncertainty about what the Taliban know of their work with foreign forces, their family networks and their desire to escape.Not all those Afghans who sought resettlement in the UK were eligible, but applying for asylum should not have put them at greater risk. The damage of the leak has been compounded by the decision to leave people affected in the dark for years, so they could not even make informed decisions about managing their security.As it has done again and again, the UK has let down Afghans who made the mistake of believing the basic principles Britain claims for itself and promised for Afghanistan.Explore more on these topicsAfghanistanSouth and central AsiaImmigration and asylumnewsShareReuse this content"

Aged 114 years old.“He succumbed to injuries caused by a vehicle accident while crossing the road close to his home.”The secret of the world’s oldest marathon runnerRead moreSingh made his name by beating a number of records for marathon times in different age brackets. The centenarian became an inspiration for countless athletes by running marathons past the age of 100.A profile on the Olympics website said Singh was born in Punjab, then under British rule, on 1 April 1911 and was the youngest of four children in a farming family. He moved to England and settled in east London with his son after the death of his wife, Gian Kaur, in Jalandhar.It was not until 2000, aged 89, that he took up running, quickly rising to fame by completing his maiden marathon in London in six hours and 54 minutes. This time knocked 58 minutes off the previous world’s best in the 90-plus age bracket.Singh ran numerous marathons, completing the 2003 Toronto WaterfrontMarathonin five hours and 40 minutes, his personal best. On 16 October 2011 in Toronto, he is thought to have become the first centenarian to run a marathon.The MP Preet Kaur Gill said on X: “Saddened to hear about the passing of Fauja Singh. I had the honour of meeting him. A truly inspiring man. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me.“A reminder that age is just a number, but attitude is everything. Rest in power, legend.”Her fellow Labour MP Jas Athwal, who represents Ilford South, said on X: “Deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Sardar Fauja Singh Ji. He was legendary – a man who continued running until he was 101. He was a global Sikh icon, that inspired millions across the world.“His spirit and legacy of resilience will run on forever.

The BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner described last October how he had to“crawl to the toilet”on a flight and said he had been left stuck on landed planes at least four times. In 2022 an elderly man requiring assistancefell down an escalatorat Gatwick and later died.Lady Grey-Thompson’s report warns of “a clear gap in the training and awareness of security staff in the treatment of disabled passengers and their equipment”, and it says ground staff need training to “understand the importance of equipment and the impact of damage on passengers”.It highlights widespread confusion for passengers in booking and airline policies on seats, companions and assistance dogs, or travelling with health conditions that require medical equipment such as oxygen or medication. The group also found there was limited awareness of non-visible impairments, contributing to “unintentional exclusion and undignified treatment”.They said more work was needed to address mobility aids, with many stowed in the hold and damaged, and passengers sometimes denied boarding due to battery safety requirements, causing “significant stress, inconvenience and in some cases physical harm”.Grey-Thompson said there were “tough challenges” but the scope for action was limited by the international nature of aviation, meaning following the 19 key recommendations in the report would owe more to goodwill than enforcement.The former wheelchair athlete, who has herself been left stranded on planesand trains, added: “Some of the cases of poor experiences hit the media headlines but the reality is most do not.”According to data from the Civil Aviation Authority, 5.5 million passengers requested assistance at a UK airport in 2024, approximately 1.9% of all passengers – a proportion 40% greater than just before the pandemic, and double that in 2010.The transport secretary, Heidi Alexander, said: “Everyone should be able to travel with dignity and be respected at every stage of their journeys, including disabled passengers. That’s why we established this group in November last year, and I welcome this report’s findings which will clear the runway for greater accessibility in aviation. I know industry is working hard to make services more inclusive for all and I look forward to seeing these proposals becoming a reality.”Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “As demand for assistance services continues to increase, airlines remain committed to removing barriers so that flying is accessible to all.”Karen Dee, the chief executive of AirportsUK, said: “The recommendations in this report will help build on the work already being done by airports and the wider sector to ensure air travel is accessible to all.”Explore more on these topicsAir transportDisabilityAirline industryTanni Grey-ThompsonnewsShareReuse this content"

The rationale for doing this is unclear, and was probably one of pragmatism and practicality, relying on medical staff to provide the additional expertise when required.“This lack of planning may have been responsible for driving the resentment felt by some resident [doctors] and potentially exposed patients to unnecessary risk.”One of her main recommendations is that PAs should not see “undifferentiated or untriaged patients”, meaning those who have not yet been diagnosed by a doctor. Leng recommended further work to establish which patients they should be able to see and to set clinical protocols that would enable PAs to diagnose patients with mild ailments.“Let’s be clear, [the role of PAs] is working well in some places, but there indeed has been some substitution and any substitution is clearly risky and confusing for patients,” she said.Leng recommended PAs should be renamed “physician assistants” and AAs “physician assistants in anaesthesia” to ensure that patients and their families are clear on whether they have been seen by a doctor. She observed that this confusion was the core concern voiced by the bereaved families she had spoken to, who believed it was a contributing factor in their loved ones’ death.She noted in her report that despite the role’s rapid expansion since it was introduced in the early 2000s, there was limited data and evidence on whether PAs were safe or unsafe. Most concerns related to PAs being the first clinician to see patients unsupervised. “Making the wrong initial diagnosis and putting patients on an inappropriate pathway can be catastrophic,” she said.The report found that “relatively few doctors felt it was appropriate for PAs to diagnose illness” and it identified disparities between the tasks PAs considered right for them to carry out and what doctors thought.Leng recommended that newly qualified PAs work in hospitals for two years before they are allowed to work in GP surgeries or mental health trusts, enabling them to start their careers where there are more training opportunities and supervision.Resident doctors’ strikes would be gift to Nigel Farage, warns Wes StreetingRead moreShe also recommended more leadership training for doctors, who shared concerns about the lack of preparation for supervision duties, and better career development for PAs and AAs. She suggested a named doctor supervise each PA, while uniforms, lanyards, badges and staff information should be standardised to “distinguish physician assistants from doctors”.Dr Tom Dolphin, the chair of the British Medical Association, said the report “laid bare the catastrophic failures in NHS leadership that have put patients at serious risk of harm”, but he argued the recommendations did not go far enough on national patient safety standards.“Prof Leng has succeeded in exposing how NHS England introduced these roles and encouraged their expansion without any robust evidence of their safety,” he said. “The report reveals inadequate national leadership, no accountability and no attempt to listen to the concerns raised by doctors, patients and coroners.“The blurring of lines between doctors and non-doctors, aided and abetted by the GMC [General Medical Council], has been an unfolding disaster for all to see, and many doctors today will be relieved to see that they were right to raise the alarm,” Dolphin said.Dr Naru Narayanan, the president of the hospital doctors’ union, the HSCA, said: “Safety concerns will continue until a properly defined national scope is established. The review acknowledges this by calling for standardised job descriptions and clinical protocols. This work needs to be fast-tracked.“Given how poorly these roles have been defined, and the fact physician assistants earn more after a couple of years of clinical training than resident doctors do after nearly a decade in medicine, it’s not surprising there’s been tension. We’ve got a shortage of medical training places and a limited supply of trainers. Additional support and time for senior doctors, as recommended by Prof Leng, are essential.”Explore more on these topicsNHSDoctorsHospitalsHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

However, medical tourism packages rarely cover continued care in the case of complications or long-term nutritional or psychological support.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

They recognise they have a disease.”“I don’t even blame the surgeons abroad,” Ahmed added. “They see a gap in the market and they’re exploiting it. They’re able to supply surgery at a much cheaper price. What I don’t like is when we see patients with problems from poorly conducted surgery. That upsets me a lot.”The BMJ commentary calls for the urgent creation of international quality standards for weight loss surgery, including an accreditation process that patients can use to choose high-quality providers abroad. This, McGirr suggested, could be funded by providers. “There will be resistance to regulating the industry,” she said. “Undoubtedly, not all centres would seek accreditation or regulation.”Procedures include gastric sleeve surgery, in which the size of the stomach is decreased by more than 70%, and gastric band surgery, which narrows the intestine. Both aim to restrict eating by making a person feel full, leading to a reduction in appetite.Woman from Wales died after gastric sleeve surgery in Turkey, inquest hearsRead moreBotched surgery can lead to infections, surgical leaks, internal hernias and, in the worst cases, be fatal. Foreign Office figures from March 2024 revealed that at least 28 British people had died since 2019 due to complications from elective medical procedures performed in Turkey, many of which are thought to have been bariatric surgery. Last month, a doctor told the inquest of a 40-year-old British woman whodied following weight loss surgeryin Turkey in 2024 that he had dealt with more than 100 other patients suffering complications after undergoing similar procedures abroad.However, Ahmed said he had observed a decrease in patients attending A&E with acute complications in the last two years, which he puts down to people choosing to privately fund obesity drug treatments rather than surgery.Explore more on these topicsObesityHealthTurkeyNHSnewsShareReuse this content"

In2023 it was forced to reverse burying in concrete a Victorian bridgein Great Musgrave, Cumbria, on the route of a scheme to join two heritage railway lines.View image in fullscreenA deluge of water inside the disused Queensbury tunnel.Photograph: Graeme Bickerdike/Forgotten RelicsThe mayor of West Yorkshire, Tracy Brabin, who backed calls to reopen the 1.4-mile tunnel which was closed to railway in 1956, has expressed disappointment at the government’s decision. In 2021, while standing at the entrance of the tunnel, she described plans for a subterraneancycle path linking Bradford and Keighley to Halifaxas a “great facility for our community”.Campaigners accused the government of “investing in destruction” and ignoring the views of 8,000 planning objections to the plan to infill the tunnel. They are due to meet Lilian Greenwood, the minister for the future of roads, next week to urge her to reverse the decision.In a letter to campaigners, Greenwood said converting the tunnel for cycling would be too costly in “the challenging fiscal environment” and that “safety risks need to be addressed.”Today we welcomed West Yorkshire mayoral candidate@TracyBrabinand Bradford South MP@JudithCumminsto the tunnel to discuss the benefits of a#BradfordHalifaxGreenwaywith a tourist spur to Haworth/Keighley.If we're serious about#ActiveTravel, we have to make this happen.pic.twitter.com/oRSGFSiQOj— Queensbury Tunnel (@QburyTunnel)April 27, 2021NH’s contractors estimate it would cost £26.4m to convert the tunnel. But campaigners have dismissed this figure as “gold-plated” and claim the tunnel could be brought back into use as a greenway for only £13.7m – not much more than the £7.2m spent to shore it up from 2018 to 2021 including at least £3.9m now required to infill the structure.They also point to a study by the charity Sustrans published earlier this year which found the proposed route would generate £3 in social, economic and tourism benefits for every £1 spent on it.Norah McWilliam, the leader of the Queensbury Tunnel Society, said: “The government is making an investment in destruction to satisfy the needs of a roads body that only cares about its own narrow interests. Community aspirations to bring positive benefits from our fabulous historic asset mean nothing to these spreadsheet shufflers.”She added: “These new millions and the seven lost in a black hole four years ago could have paid for the tunnel’s repair, safeguarding it for a role at the heart of an inspiring and sustainable active travel network – something Bradford and West Yorkshire could be proud of.”Graeme Bickerdike, the engineering coordinator for the society, said: “The minister claims that her decision is based on a ‘full view of the facts’, but the evidence seems to have come exclusively from National Highways which has a proven track record for exaggerating risk, misrepresenting condition evidence and frittering away public funds.“There is no justification for another costly tunnel intervention at this time as the 2018-21 works have reduced what was already a low risk profile.”View image in fullscreenAn impression of how a cycle path through the disused Queensbury rail tunnel between Bradford and Halifax could look.Photograph: Graeme Bickerdike/Four by ThreeBrabin said she shared the disappointment of campaigners, but said she understood the government’s decision. She said: “To ensure everyone’s safety the government had to act quickly to secure the site, and the realities of public finances meant a difficult decision needed to be made.“We remain committed to helping support alternative routes for walking, wheeling and cycling between Bradford and Calderdale.”A Department forTransportspokesperson said: “Given the continued deterioration of the Queensbury tunnel, and in the absence of local funding to develop it as a transport link, National Highways has been instructed to carry out works to maintain public safety.“This has been a difficult decision but ultimately, we have a responsibility to safety and delivering value for the taxpayer.”Explore more on these topicsYorkshireTransportActivismTransport policyRail travelnewsShareReuse this content"

While it recommended that primary schools teach sex education in years 5 and 6, in line with what pupils learn about conception and birth, it is not compulsory.“Primary schools should consult parents about the content of anything that will be taught within sex education,” the guidance says. “This process should include offering parents support in talking to their children about sex education and how to link this with what is being taught in school as well as advice about parents’ right to request withdrawal from sex education.”The guidance allows primary school teachers to discuss the sharing of naked images or online sexual content if it is something that is affecting their pupils, and they can discuss online sexual content where they know that children have seen pornography.The 47-page document also addresses online gambling, strangulation and suffocation, sextortion, deepfakes and suicide prevention, as well as “incel” culture and the links between pornography and misogyny.It has been broadly welcomed by school leaders, but some campaigners have expressed concerns about “watering down” earlier proposals on gender.Helen Joyce, director of advocacy at Sex Matters, said: “It’s a big shame that the Department for Education has watered down sections of the draft guidance it inherited from the previous government which sought to counter the trans activist positions adopted by many schools over the past decade.”Bayswater, a support group for “parents of trans-identified adolescents and young people”, said: “The new RSHE guidance fails to address the serious safeguarding issues around teaching gender identity to children.“As well as significantly weakening the clarity offered by the earlier draft guidance, this version introduces topics which are likely to be harmful to vulnerable children. For example, direct teaching about suicide may actually undermine suicide prevention strategies.”Margaret Mulholland, a special needs and inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), welcomed “the clarity over biological sex and gender reassignment” in the guidance.“There are strongly held and sometimes polarised views over these issues and it is important to have a clear set of national guidelines to follow.”The government is expected to publish separate guidance for schools and colleges on gender-questioning pupils shortly.Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, welcomed the fact that age limits have been dropped.“Schools already work hard to ensure that teaching is age-appropriate and this approach gives them the vital flexibility to respond to their own community and the needs of pupils in their schools,” he said.“However, the new guidance asks schools to teach more content with only the same amount of time available. Government cannot continue to impose additions to the curriculum without proposing how the additional teaching time needed is to be found.”In the UK and Ireland,Samaritanscan be contacted on freephone 116 123, or emailjo@samaritans.orgorjo@samaritans.ie.

Prices remained stable in the spring, particularly as many of Trump’s highest tariffs were paused; however, they started increasing in May and have continued to rise in June.Annual inflation rose to 2.7%in June, up from 2.4% in May, according to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services each month. Core CPI, which leaves out energy and food prices, ticked up slightly to 2.9%, compared with 2.8% in May.The prices of appliances, furniture and toys, products typically manufactured outside the US, all rose. Food prices increased by 3%, with the price of beef rising by more than 2% over the month, coffee up 2.2% and citrus fruit prices rising 2.3%. While the price of eggs has been dropping over the last few months, a dozen eggs are still 27% more expensive than last year.Inflation remains far below the price peaks seen three years ago, when price increases reached as high as 9%, and even a year ago, when increases were closer to 3%. But tariffs have appeared to halt inflation’s downward path.According to theYale Budget Lab, Americans now face an average tariff rate of 18.7% – the highest rate since 1933. That includes 30% tariffs on China, a 50% tariff on steel and aluminum, 25% on auto parts and a universal 10% tariff on all imports.The levies currently in effect do not include those Trump is threatening to impose on other large US trading partners. Over the weekend, Trumpthreatenedthe EU and Mexico with 30% tariffs and Canada with a 35% tariff. Brazil is set to face 50% tariffs as punishment for the trial of theTrump ally Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil’s former president, who is facing charges of attempting a coup.Prices will probably be pushed up much higher should these tariff rates go into effect, but it is unclear if and when that could happen. Trump initially set negotiation deadlines to 9 July, but pushed it back to 1 August as the date approached. Trump’s trade advisers have said they aim to end negotiations by Labor Day at the beginning of September.Reacting to the latest inflation news, Trump renewed his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. “Consumer Prices LOW. Bring down the Fed Rate, NOW!!!,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.As prices remain volatile, the Fed appears unlikely to adjust interest rates anytime soon, despite cutting rates three times in the fall. Fed officials, including the central bank’s chair, Jerome Powell, havesaidthat price increases are expected to continue in the summer, drawing away from the Fed’s 2% inflation target.Explore more on these topicsUS economyTrump tariffsInflationTariffsDonald TrumpTrump administrationEconomicsnewsShareReuse this content"

In recent years, companies have moved their supply chains outside China in an attempt to avoid tariffs, and Chinese businesses have also been developing non-US markets. But no country can replace the purchasing power of US consumers.The trade war has spread into non-tariff measures, such as restrictions onrare earths exports, causing manufacturing slowdowns for western carmakers.China’s policymakers face a daunting task in achieving the annual growth target of about 5% – a goal many analysts view as ambitious given entrenched deflation and weak demand at home.Wei Yao, an economist at Société Générale, said: “Despite a strong first half, the outlook is set to sour in [the second half of the year] as export front-loading fades and the impact of US tariffs becomes more visible.“Renewed weakness in house prices and the fading impact of subsidies also cast doubt over the sustainability of the consumption recovery.”Indeed, the solid headline GDP numbers held little sway for most households including Mallory Jiang, a 30-year-old doctor in the southern tech hub Shenzhen, who told Reuters she and her husband had pay cuts this year.“Both our incomes as doctors have decreased, and we still don’t dare buy an apartment. We are cutting back on expenses: commuting by public transport, eating at the hospital cafeteria or cooking at home. My life pressure is still actually quite high.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The change does not apply to the UK, where Starbucks has its head office in Chiswick, west London.“We do our best work when we’re together,” Niccol said in amessage to employees, referred to as “partners”, on the company’s website about “re-establishing an in-office culture”. “We want leaders and people managers to be physically present with their teams.”He added: “Being in-person also helps us build and strengthen our culture. As we work to turn the business around, all these things matter more than ever.”Starbucks says cutting shop staff in favour of automation has failedRead moreStarbucks has 16,000 corporate support employees worldwide, including coffee roasters and warehouse staff. It employs about 360,000 people worldwide, including 5,600 in the UK, most of whom work in its cafes.The four-day office policy will come into effect on 29 September. Niccol, who has been in the job for almost a year, has said he wants to take Starbucks back to its coffeehouse roots by improving customers’ experience in its cafes and reducing reliance on mobile and takeaway orders.He said: “We know we’re asking a lot of every partner as we work to turn the business around. And we understand that the updated in-office culture may not work for everyone.“To support those who decide to ‘opt out’, we’re offering a one-time voluntary exit programme with a cash payment for partners who make this choice.” The company did not state the size of the sum.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

On Tuesday, a survey showed thata fear of having to return to their office desksis having an impact on workers’ wellbeing.In February, Starbucks asked its vice-presidents who were working remotely tomove to Seattle or Toronto. It is now extending this requirement to all support centre “people leaders”, who are expected to relocate within 12 months.In its previous announcement,Starbucks set out plans to lay off 1,100 corporate employeesand close several hundred open or vacant job positions, the biggest job cuts in its history, in order to reduce costs as it struggled with rising inflation and economic uncertainty.Niccol faced environmental criticism last year for his 1,000-mile commuteto work in the office three days a week. The company allowed him to travel in from his home in Newport Beach, California, to its head office in Seattle via a private jet instead of relocating. Since then, he has bought a home in Seattle and is frequently seen at the company’s headquarters,a spokesperson told Associated Press.Explore more on these topicsStarbucksWorking from homeFood & drink industrynewsShareReuse this content"

Much will depend on whether a trade agreement between the EU and the US can be reached by 1 August,” the port said in a statement.European carmakers from Volkswagen to Volvo had been hoping that a deal would have been sealed last week after Trump’s original deadline for a tariff deal with the EU was due to expire.Before Trump arrived in the White House they paid a 2.5% tariff on exports but since April they are being charged an extra 25%, adding tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a family-sized car in the US.Ports across Europe have been tested by Brexit, the coronavirus pandemic, the port congestion caused by container shortages in 2024, with congestion a widespread issue across all northern ports, said Justin Atkin, the UK and Ireland port representative of the Port of Antwerp-Bruges.Compared with Brexit, the tariff impact has been “more of an instant shock” he said.“With the pandemic, we had lockdown, then we were out of lockdown, then back into lockdown, and people got used to managing it after being unprepared. Whereas here … people have talked about tariffs in the build up [to Trump] but I don’t think anyone expected the level and the severity of the instantaneous action.”The port couldn’t put a figure on the number of cars waiting to be transported but said it was in the thousands.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Has Jonas Vingegaard’s Visma-Lease a Bike team at times been towing the bunch deliberately in order to ensure that Tadej Pogacar retains the yellow jersey? It’s a gloriously arcane question, the kind that only comes up in the Tour’s opening phase, but it distracts from a point that could be key in the next 10 days: how the two teams manage the race will probably be decisive.Firstly, a brief explainer. The received wisdom in cycling lore is that holding the yellow jersey early in a Grand Tour can be as much a curse as a blessing, because the daily media and podium duties cut into recovery time. Hence the thinking goes that Visma might have been chasing down the odd move purposely to keep Pogacar in themaillot jaune, so that he will be answering media questions and hanging about waiting to go on the podium, while Vingegaard has his feet up. Only Visma’s management know if this was the case, but what is certain is that the febrile atmosphere between the two teams will intensify from here on in.Onley and Blackmore lead the charge of young Britons at Tour de FranceRead moreIn that context, Monday’s slog through the Massif Central was a score draw between the two armadas. Pogacar could afford to lose yellow to Ben Healy of Ireland as it buys his UAE team some down time at least on Wednesday and Thursday, when Healy’s EF squad will have to control the race. On the other hand, Simon Yates’s opportunistic stage win on Monday redressed the balance a little in favour of Visma; at this stage of the Tour, any amount of positive momentum is welcome.The tone had been set for the opening 10 days – and possibly the whole Tour – about 15km from the finish of the first stage into Lille on 5 July when Vingegaard and his lieutenants Matteo Jorgenson and Edoardo Affini surged to the front of the peloton in a cross wind and split the race. Pogacar was not to be caught out, but only one of his men made the split of about 40; Vingegaard, on the other hand, had three with him.Visma have no option but to try to find openings, to probe UAE’s defences constantly to seek the single chink in the armour that may enable their leader to pull back some of his 1min 17sec deficit to Pogacar. Hence an abortive attempt to split the field on Sunday into Châteauroux led by Wout van Aert, and Monday’s classic display of tactical mountain racing, with Yates and the Belgian Victor Campenaerts sent ahead in a breakaway just in case either Vingegaard or Jorgenson managed to elude Pogacar and his men.This kind of racing has paid massive dividends for the Dutch squad in the past, most recently at the Giro d’Italia, where Yates managed an unlikely overall victory with the support of Van Aert, at the expense of UAE’s starlet Isaac del Toro. The scenario that is the stuff of nightmares for the UAE management is the one that Visma (in their previous incarnation as Jumbo-Visma) engineered in 2022, when UAE were first reduced in numbers by illness, and were then put to the sword by Vingegaard, Van Aert and Primoz Roglic in the Alps.Roglic has moved on, but Jorgenson is an adequate replacement; he has twice won the Paris-Nice stage race and finished eighth in the Tour last year while supporting Vingegaard. The obvious tactic for Visma in the next 10 days will be to burn off Pogacar’s support riders to engineer a situation in which the Slovenian ends up on his own on a mountain with Jorgenson and Vingegaard, who can attack him one by one. Pogacar may well prove equal to the task, but there is only one way to find out. Any one of the four high mountain stages in the Alps and Pyrenees would be adequate, and they only need Pogacar to flinch once.Nerves will have been sharpened by João Almeida’s heavy crash on Friday en route to Mûr-de-Bretagne, which forced him to quit the race on Sunday. With Rafal Majka sitting out this Tour, that has deprived the double Tour winner of his principal mountain wingman. Almeida – “the best teammate in the world,” as Pogacar put it – would have provided substantial support: he has notched up nine wins this year, including the Tour of Switzerland.“Someone will have to step in,” said the UAE director of sport, Simone Pedrazzini, but the uncomfortable fact is that Almeida offered a back-up option, a man who could mark a breakaway and potentially work towards finishing on the podium. Neither Adam Yates or Jhonatan Narváez is a like-for-like replacement, while another UAE climber, Pavel Sivakov, looked distinctly out of sorts on Sunday and Monday. UAE will need him to recover during Tuesday’s rest day.There are questions around Visma as well. Yates’s stage win on Monday suggests he is back to top form after his struggles on the opening stage, but thus far Van Aert has blown hot and cold, completely absent at times, shy of his best at others, but capable of finishing second to Jonathan Milan on Saturday into Laval. It remains to be seen if he is merely riding himself in having taken a break after the Giro.In past Tours, he has proven capable of smashing the entire race into smithereens on any mountain stage, and if Visma are hoping to take the fight to UAE in the next 10 days, they need him to quickly rediscover that same blistering form.Explore more on these topicsTour de France 2025Tadej PogacarJonas VingegaardTour de FranceCyclingcommentShareReuse this content"

The person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the agreement had not been announced.Former NFL QB Bridgewater suspended from high school coaching jobRead moreThe contract paying the two-time All-Pro an average of $30.1m a year comes a day after the Jets agreed to a lucrative extension with their No 1 wide receiver, Garrett Wilson. That deal is worth $130m, as the organization locked up two foundational players – who are both 24 – for the long-term future.“I appreciate the Jets organization for believing in me, my teammates for the blood, sweat, & tears we put in, and JETS NATION... I appreciate y’all supporting me ... Thank you GOD,”Gardner posted to Xon Tuesday.Gardner, who turns 25 before Week 1, was the No 4 pick in the 2022 draft out of Cincinnati. He established himself as one of the league’s top cornerbacks during his first two professional seasons, including being selected the AP Defensive Rookie of the Year.After a down year by his standards, he is out to prove naysayers wrong, saying he has always been an underdog. After recently declining to say whether he wanted to be the richest player at the position, Gardner now has that distinction.“Man, I just wanted to show my teammates, show the coaches how much I’m bought into this,” Gardner said. “I want to win. I want to change the organization. I want to be a part of changing the organization.”The Jets have the longest active playoff drought in theNFL, dating to a trip to the AFC championship game in the 2010 season. The organization hopes the new regime of general manager Darren Mougey and coach Aaron Glenn – himself a three-time Pro Bowl cornerback in his playing days – can lead a successful turnaround.Explore more on these topicsNew York JetsNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

The 2021 policy also stated athletes designated female at birth transitioning to male and undergoing testosterone hormone therapy were ineligible to compete in the NWSL.There are currently no known transgender athletes playing in the NWSL, though there have been in the past. Canadian international Quinn, who won a gold medal at the 2020 Olympics, played for Washington Spirit and Seattle Reign until 2024, and hadpublicly criticizedthe league’s policy. Japan international Kumi Yokoyama came out as a transgender man in 2021 and subsequently played for Washington Spirit and Gotham FC.NWSL’s Angel City wear ‘Immigrant City Football Club’ shirts after Los Angeles raidsRead moreIt was widely understood that the 2021 policy remained current but a spokesperson for theNWSLtold the Guardian: “The 2021 policy is not in effect and has not been since Commissioner [Jessica] Berman was hired in March of 2022. The NWSL does not currently have a policy in this regard.”The NWSL did not respond to questions about why the policy was not renewed and if there were plans for the NWSL to create a new policy in the future.England’s Football Associationand theScottish Football Associationbanned transgender women from playing in women’s football earlier this year following aUK supreme court decisionin April that ruled the legal definition of “woman” refers to “biological sex.”The United States Soccer Federation (USSF), the senior co-host for the 2026 World Cup, does not have a policy on transgender players for national teams. A USSF source, speaking anonymously to provide context to the lack of policy, explained: “There are no elite transgender players in our player pool and what happened with England and Scotland has nothing to do with us. If there was a player who fell under this area we would have to make a decision but we [would be] damned if we do and damned if we don’t.”Asked about policy for non-elite players, a spokesperson for the governing body pointed to the federation’sPolicy Manualwhich states amateur players “may register with the gender team with which the player identifies [and] shows the stated gender is sincerely held, and part of a person’s core identity. Documentation satisfying the herein stated standard includes … government-issued documentation or documentation prepared by a health care provider, counselor, or other qualified professional not related to the player.”California changes high school sports rule after Trump post over trans athleteRead moreThe general lack of guidance from the leading US soccer authorities comes amid a broader cultural environment in which the rights of transgender people have been under scrutiny, if not outright attack. In June, the US supreme court ruled that Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming treatment did not discriminate on the basis of sex, with the courtset to heara case concerning transgender athletes’ participation in student sports.“Right now, it is incredibly terrifying to be a transgender person in the United States,” a formerly high-profile advocate for transgender sports told the Guardian, requesting anonymity for fear of personal safety.Multiple organizations usually supportive of LGBTQ issues are maintaining a low profile on the issue of transgender participation in sports and official policy.Human Rights Campaignreferred questions from the Guardian on transgender athletes toAthlete Ally, an organization created to publicly and prominently support LGBTQ athletes. Athlete Ally did not respond to multiple requests for comment.The lack of policy and public support for transgender athletes has created an open goal for lobby groups seeking to establish laws and policy banning transgender women from participating in women’s sports.“The tide is changing here in the United States,” Beth Parlato, a legal advisor to the Independent Women’s Forum, said. “Everyone is looking at this.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSoccer with Jonathan WilsonFree weekly newsletterJonathan Wilson brings expert analysis on the biggest stories from European soccerEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe Independent Women’s Forum is a politically conservative multi-issue group that has taken a leading role in banning transgender women from women’s sport. Swimmer Riley Gaines,who was part of a class action lawsuit against the NCAA, is an ambassador for the organization. IWF advocates for and supports lawsuits demanding bans for transgender women in women’s sport and has advised governing bodies on writing transgender policy.“If we hear there are men trying to compete in the women’s soccer league we would start just like we did with women’s golf,” Parlato told the Guardian. “We hadplayers come forward and express that they needed help. We reached out to the governing [body] with all of our information and data. We did a petition drive for women’s golf where we were able to secure thousands of names and then the policy changed. We did what we can to effect change with the governing body and we were able to do it. We would do the same for women’s soccer.”Parlato’s organization is highly organized and employs detailed strategy for various campaigns. A focus on college and school sports that receive government funding has been successful, but IWF is now eyeing influence across the wider sports industry.Parlato outlined a playbook deployed for previous campaigns: “Athletes will come to us as a group and we will directly contact the governing body. We [create] a lot of media around them, go all over national media, digital media, social media, national news outlets, op-eds, articles, petition drives, letters to the governing board and we [create] an action center where we drive all of that advocacy. After so many months [of pressure] they change their policy. We would do that again [for soccer].”Parlato said IWF, if invited, would work with soccer organizations to create policy: “We would be happy to give that [advice] but they haven’t approached us. The tide is changing here in the United States. Out of 50 states, 28 have used our model legislation [or] they have passed their own laws, and codified it in law that men cannot participate in women’s sports. We are very excited by that.”“The other 22 states are deep, deep, [Democratic] states like California, and New York and Maine, Illinois, Michigan and New Mexico,” she added. “Deep blue states where it is harder [to get laws passed]. We are trying to get laws passed federally. It has been difficult [but] we are going to keep working.”For the transgender community, the speed of the shut out from women’s sport and lack of public support paints a different picture to the legal and policy success for IWF.“It is not red, white and blue here for millions of people,” said the transgender advocate requesting anonymity for safety reasons. “There are a lot of [transgender people] in the country but not a lot that are heard from. It’s an easy population to scapegoat. We are seen as a throwaway and as a small tiny fraction of the population.”Explore more on these topicsFootballUS sportsTransgenderUSA women's football teamNWSLWomen's footballnewsShareReuse this content"

He haswon three majors, been ranked world No 1 since 2023, and is the favourite for the Open this week. But during an extraordinary press conference at Portrush on Tuesday, the American peered into an existential void as he asked himself: what is the point of it all?Scheffler was clearly happy, and his determination to win this week was clear. He also spoke eloquently on the challenges of links golf. But a hitherto unremarkable press conference suddenly veered into a deeper philosophical search for meaning when the 29-year-old was asked how long he had ever celebrated a victory.McIlroy vows ‘the story isn’t over’ as he revels in Royal Portrush support at the OpenRead moreIt turned out the answer was a few minutes. And Scheffler was only getting started, as he then promised to quit golf if it ever affected his family life.“There’s a lot of people that make it to what they thought was going to fulfil them in life, and you get there, you get to No 1 in the world, and they’re like what’s the point?” he said. “I really do believe that, because what is the point? Why do I want to win this tournament so bad?“That’s something that I wrestle with on a daily basis. Showing up at the Masters every year, it’s like, why do I want to win this golf tournament so badly? Why do I want to win the Open Championship so badly? I don’t know. Because, if I win, it’s going to be awesome for two minutes. Then we’re going to get to the next week and it’s: ‘Hey, you won two majors this year; how important is it for you to win the FedExCup playoffs?’ And we’re back here again.”Scheffler was clearly in a good mood. But he conceded that any joy he felt from his achievements was only fleeting and didn’t give him much fulfilment. “To get to live out your dreams is very special, but at the end of the day I’m not out here to inspire the next generation of golfers,” he said.“I’m not out here to inspire someone to be the best player in the world, because what’s the point? This is not a fulfilling life. It’s fulfilling from the sense of accomplishment, but it’s not fulfilling from a sense of the deepest places of your heart.”Perhaps such an approach, along with his deepest held religious beliefs, helps to explain why Scheffler has looked so ice‑cool even when the pressure is ratcheted up to the max.View image in fullscreenScottie Scheffler’s Open press conference veered into a deeper philosophical search for meaning.Photograph: Francisco Seco/AP“We really work so hard for such little moments. I’m kind of sicko; I love putting in the work. I love getting to practise. I love getting to live out my dreams. But at the end of the day, sometimes I just don’t understand the point.“I don’t know if I’m making any sense or not. It’s just one of those deals. I love the challenge. I love being able to play this game for a living. It’s one of the greatest joys of my life, but does it fill the deepest wants and desires of my heart? Absolutely not.”Instead Scheffler said that his family mattered far more – and he would stop playing professional golf if it ever affected his relationship with his wife, Meredith, and his son, Bennett.“Every day when I wake up early to go put in the work, my wife thanks me for going out and working so hard,” he said. “When I get home, I try to thank her every day for taking care of our son. That’s why I talk about family being my priority because it really is.“I’m blessed to be able to come out here and play golf, but if my golf ever started affecting my home life or it ever affected the relationship I have with my wife or my son, that’s going to be the last day that I play out here for a living.Quick GuideFive groups to follow at the Open with rounds 1 and 2Show6:35am (rd 1) /11.26am (rd 2):Padraig Harrington, Nicolai Hojgaard, Tom McKibbinTwo-time Open champion Padraig Harrington leads an eye-catching first group with two rising European stars. Denmark's Nicolai Hojgaard, 24, already has a Ryder Cup appearance under his belt, while Tom McKibbin, 22, who finished tied-fourth in LIV Golf Andalucía, will be hoping to make an impression in his native Northern Ireland.9:58am (rd 1)/2.59pm (rd 2):Xander Schauffele, JJ Spaun, Jon RahmXander Schauffele will be bidding to become the first golfer since Harrington in 2008 to defend his Open title. JJ Spaun, making his Open debut, said his closest links experience was playing Bandon Dunes in Oregon, but as the only golfer to finish under-par at the US Open, he will fancy his chances. Former world No 1 Jon Rahm rounds out a group of major champions.10:09am (rd 1)/3:10pm (rd 2):Shane Lowry, Collin Morikawa, Scottie SchefflerMuch has been said about Scottie Scheffler's effortless dominance, which will finally be put to the test on Portrush's treacherous links course. \"I think it fits my strengths because I like to do things very creatively,\" he said pre-tournament. Former champions Collin Morikawa and Shane Lowry, who won at Portrush in 2019, complete the trio.10:42am (rd 1)/3:43pm (rd 2):Matti Schmid, Ryggs Johnston, Richard Teder (a)Richard Teder will be one of nine amateurs among the 156-strong field to watch. The 20-year-old Estonian, who picked up golf by accident, dramatically qualified for the Open by holing out from 90 yards in a sudden-death play-off. He is no stranger to links golf, having played in kids' tournaments in Scotland and shot competitive rounds at courses like Royal St George's and Ballyliffin.2:48pm (rd 1)/9:47am (rd 2):Robert MacIntyre, Bryson DeChambeau, Justin RoseMajor success has come fleetingly close for Justin Rose in recent attempts, and the Englishman will again be a crowd favourite as he aims to add to his 2013 US Open win. Meanwhile, the contrast in styles between Bryson DeChambeau, who has traditionally struggled with links golf, and Scotland's Robert MacIntyre is one to keep an eye on.3:10pm (rd 1)/10.09am (rd 2):Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, Tommy FleetwoodAll eyes are on home favourite Rory McIlroy as he returns to Portrush after missing the cut in 2019. McIlroy left that tournament with regrets, but comes here after his Masters victory. Tommy Fleetwood finished second at Portrush in 2019 and may be best placed to end his Major drought, while Justin Thomas is also looking to rediscover his mojo.Ervin AngWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.“This is not the be all, end all. This is not the most important thing in my life. That’s why I wrestle with, why is this so important to me? Because I’d much rather be a great father than I would be a great golfer. At the end of the day, that’s what’s more important to me.”That doesn’t mean, of course, that Scheffler isn’t deeply determined to win his first Open title at Portrush, having achieved his best finish of seventh at Troon last year.“It’s great to win tournaments. But sometimes the feeling of winning only lasts a few seconds. It’s pretty exciting and fun, but it just doesn’t last that long.”Explore more on these topicsThe OpenScottie SchefflerEuropean TourPGA TourGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

How can a side packed with some of the world’s finest players continually make early exits at tournaments, fail to look cohesive and even endure a chastening8-0 defeat against Englandat Euro 2022? How can great talents such as Barcelona’s Caroline Graham Hansen, Chelsea’s Guro Reiten and the Ballon d’Or winner Ada Hegerberg not thrive together in their national-team kit?Stop there. Hold that thought. Something is stirring. Norway topped Group A at Euro 2025 with three wins from three and face Italy on Wednesday in the quarter-finals. Is this the summer when Norway will deliver on their potential, offered not just by Graham Hansen, Reiten and Hegerberg but Arsenal’s Frida Maanum and players from Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Lyon? And with an English head coach in the former Wales manager Gemma Grainger.Euro 2025 is shaping up to be a roaring success. Now for more jeopardyRead moreNorway are the second-most successful team in Women’s European Championship history, with two titles, but have not lifted this trophy since 1993. So far, though, 2025 has been a year of long waits ending in football; whether it was the Real Madrid women’s team winning their first clásico, an English women’s team lifting a European title for the first time since 2007, or Inter qualifying for the Women’s Champions League for the first time.In the men’s game, Crystal Palace, Newcastle and Tottenham ended trophy droughts, Paris Saint-Germain got theirfirst men’s European Cupand Harry Kane won a trophy. Rory McIlroy finally got his Masters. Last month, South Africa’s men’s cricket side won theirfirst global trophy in 27 years.Maybe there is something in the air this year. Maybe, 20 years after the slogan “good things happen to those who wait” began to be phased out in a well-known Irish stout’s advertising, 2025 is the year when that comes true.Norway have been waiting 25 years for international women’s football success, since their Olympic gold in Sydney in 2000, and have waited 30 years to hoist a major trophy, since winning the 1995 Women’s World Cup, at a time when the star of their team was Hege Riise, who temporarily preceded Sarina Wiegman in the Lionesses dugout. But in contrast, they had crashed out in the group stages of the past two European Championships. In the past two Euros they crashed out at the group stage.View image in fullscreenArsenal’s Frida Maanum scored twice in Norway’s 4-3 win against Iceland in their final group game at Euro 2025.Photograph: Nick Potts/PAThe former Tottenham and Norway men’s goalkeeper Erik Thorstvedt, who got 97 caps and is in Switzerland as a pundit for the Norwegian broadcaster TV 2, says the past few tournaments were “a bit disastrous” but he says: “I think we have become a bit of a victim of the general rise in level of women’s football. Because we were quite early to it, we had lots of girls playing football quite early, so we had an advantage, but now when the big nations really go for it, and they become professional and you have academies in Spain and stuff like that, it’s becoming more difficult to beat those teams. And now you have all the other late developers that are maybe in population a bit bigger than Norway, so it becomes difficult to beat them too.”Norway defeated Switzerland, Finland and Iceland by a one‑goal margin. Thorstvedt was unimpressed by the performances in their first two wins but says: “I’m so much more optimistic and so much happier now after the third match because, against Iceland, we played really well.“It was like: ‘Take these shackles off my feet so I can dance.’ Suddenly it was enjoyable, suddenly it was like we have got a good team. There was no pressure because we had already won the group, so that mentality might have played into it, so I just hope we get to see a Norway team that plays with freedom.”Italy are higher in Fifa’s world rankings than any of those three group opponents and are on a good run. Thorstvedt says: “I’ve seen all of Italy’s good matches and they’re a good team. If Norway can beat Italy and reach a semi-final you can’t argue with that – it’s a humongous success. If we lose to Italy, I think the final verdict will be determined by the way we lose, maybe, whereas if we win that would be totally incredible. Gemma Grainger seems to have created a good atmosphere in the group and things are looking good.”Explore more on these topicsWomen’s Euro 2025Norway women's football teamWomen's footballfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, with Uefa deeming that move came too late to save them, having ruled that Textor’s Eagle Football Holdings Ltd had controlling stakes over both the French club Lyon and Palace, a protest organised by the supporters’ group the Holmesdale Fanatics was attended by hundreds of fans who marched from Norwood High Street to Palace’s stadium.“Uefa: morally bankrupt. Revoke the ruling now,” read a large banner at the front of the march, with another reading: “Football: created by the poor, stolen by the rich.” Palace fan Josh Harness said: “It’s not fair that we’ve won the oldest Cup competition in the world and then been demoted from theEuropa League.“We earned the right to be there and all we can do is show our support for the club. The delay over the decision also means we can’t start planning for next season yet because we didn’t know what competition we were going to be in.”The group behind the tifos that were on display at the Wembley FA Cup semi-final and final against Aston Villa and Manchester City respectively, the Fanatics had said it was “time to act” and called on supporters “of all teams to join us”. “Those who are disillusioned with the state of modern football, those who are tired of the authorities favouring a small cartel of larger clubs all in the name of profit, and those who want to bring football back to the fans, where it belongs,” said a statement announcing the protest.“We must come together for our voice to be heard around Europe. This will not be an isolated action, but the beginning of the campaign against those responsible for the moral and financial corruption that has plagued the modern game. Let us remind Uefa and the Cas that this ruling can, and should, change.”A petition that calls on Uefa to restore Palace to the Europa League has also been signed by almost 3,000 people since being posted on Friday. Uefa rejected an attempt by Textor and fellow American co‑owner David Blitzer – the majority shareholder of the Danish club Brondby, who have also qualified for the Conference League – to place theirshares in a blind trustbecause they had missed the March deadline.Use of a blind trust has enabled other clubs with the same owners to play together in a Uefa competition. Sources at the European governing body confirmed that it had cleared both clubs to play in the same competition having deemed that Blitzer does not have a decisive influence at Palace.However, writing on X over the weekend, Parish questioned the logic behind the current system. “Let’s put this ‘THEY missed the deadline’ nonsense to bed. Let’s say Me, Josh, David and everyone other than Eagle football had placed our shares in a ‘blind trust’ before March 1st. Three random people would have had control of the club since then but by Uefa’s interpretation of the rules we would still be out of the Europa League.”Explore more on these topicsCrystal PalaceEuropa LeagueUefaFootball politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

We were celebrating her success at Arsenal, but not so much now. We’ll see. Stina is an incredibly powerful footballer and very intelligent with her runs. She’s a hard player to play against in that respect.”Euro 2025 is shaping up to be a roaring success. Now for more jeopardyRead moreThe two players were on the same Arsenal side in May when Blackstenius scored the winner against Barcelona in the Champions League final. And trying to separate the friendship they have when they step on to the pitch in Zurich on Thursday can be challenging. “It’s different because playing each other in training comes with restrictions, it’s rare that I get to play against Stina in this setting. I enjoy it, I like Stina,” Williamson said with a grin. “It’s tough to remove all of that to just go at it, you don’t want to focus on it too much, there’s lots of things that come into play when you play against a teammate, but I think I’ve known Stina long enough now that I know who she is and it’s time to focus on us.”As a centre-back, Williamson will be directly up against her club colleague, but she is wary of pinpointing Blackstenius’s threat alone. “When you have a team who work for each other like Sweden, then you don’t need to necessarily have a crazy standout threat because everyone plays their roles,” she said. “They are hard to prepare for in that sense. The discipline for them all to complete their jobs on the pitch makes them a dangerous side.”View image in fullscreenStina Blackstenius scores Sweden's first goal against Germany in the 4-1 win.Photograph: Martin Meissner/APWilliamson’s focus in this tournament is staying present, replicating her mantra of the 2022 Euros. “I want to enjoy it and spend time with my teammates,” she said. “It’s a great environment and I love being around them all. Beth Mead was laughing at me the other day because I did the day in the life of her, which meant I didn’t go back to my room and I was very sociable. By the end of the day I sleptgood.“I said to her: ‘I don’t know how you do this every day,’ and she said: ‘This is my every day’. I said: ‘Yes, it’s crazy to me, I’m not that type of person’. But it’s little things like that, just trying to be around more. In 2022 I slept most of the time that I wasn’t on a pitch so yes, a bit different this time.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMoving the GoalpostsFree weekly newsletterNo topic is too small or too big for us to cover as we deliver a twice-weekly roundup of the wonderful world of women’s footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

She’s a funny character, but she can be serious and she has so many experiences of her own and an incredible perspective, she does actually help us out. When she retired we were begging for somebody to employ her within the FA just to bring her along. I’m glad that she is here and she’s found a way to be here.

Bayern and Barcelona have been linked with the Colombia international this summer and the Bundesliga champions submitted their first bid on Tuesday. Liverpool rejected the approach and reiterated that the 28-year-old was not for sale.The Premier League champions value Díaz at more than €100m given his status on the domestic and global stage and market prices. There is also longstanding interest in the winger from the Saudi Pro League. Liverpool’s valuation is based on their accounting position rather than an asking price.Díaz has two years remaining on his deal and there have been no talks so far over an extension.

But it would take a significant improvement on Bayern’s offer to test Liverpool’s resolve to keep him.Liverpool have spent almost £200m this summer and remain in the market for a centre-forward, with Newcastle’s Alexander Isak high on their list. A striker was a priority before the tragicdeath of Diogo Jota.The potential sale of Díaz and Darwin Núñez, who has interest from Napoli and clubs in Saudi Arabia, would help the champions fund what would need to be a club record deal for Isak but Liverpool’s understanding is that the Sweden international is not for sale.Newcastle have made a club record £70m move forHugo Ekitikeand, although that has been rejected by Eintracht Frankfurt, a breakthrough in that pursuit could have implications for Liverpool’s chances of landing Isak. As things stand, however, Liverpool expect Isak to remain on Tyneside.View image in fullscreenAlexander Isak, pictured at Newcastle’s training camp in Austria, remains a Liverpool target.Photograph: Serena Taylor/Newcastle United/Getty ImagesEkitike has also been linked with a move to Anfield, and Liverpool continue to monitorMarc Guéhi’s situationat Crystal Palace.

Sign up now!Michael ButlerTue 15 Jul 2025 10.21 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 11.01 EDTShareOH BROTHERIt is well known that the birth of two global sportswear companies, Adidas and Puma, was fuelled by a family feud between two German brothers,Adi and Rudolf Dassler. After working together for 30 years, the pair fell out shortly after the second world war; Rudi founding Puma in 1948 and Adi starting, you guessed it, Adidas in 1949. What started the rift is a point of contention. The most common explanation is that Rudi had an affair with Adi’s wife, Käthe, for which he was never forgiven. Other theories suggest it was Rudolf’s increasing suspicion that his brother was behind his conscription into the German army and thus his short imprisonment by the allies.The brothers reportedly never spoke again and, likea scene out of a Twix advert, set up rival factories on opposite sides of the river Aurach, which runs through the small town of Herzogenaurach. The global headquarters of Puma and Adidas remain there today, two miles apart. The town is still divided: bars, bakeries and barber shops are all affiliated with one or the other, while the two biggest football clubs, FC Herzogenaurach and ASV Herzogenaurach are sponsored by Puma and Adidas respectively. The two companies appear to detest each other: Lothar Matthäus – son to a family of Puma workers who grew up in Herzogenaurach and played for FC – only signed for Bayern Munich in 1984 on the condition he could continue to wear Puma boots, becoming the first ever player at the Adidas-sponsored Bavarian giants to do so.Football Daily is not privy to the details as to why Puma has decided tospend £1bn in a partnershipfor the next 10 years, but it certainly seems like a bold move to fork out £100m-a-year – a record per-year contract for a Premier League club and a gargantuan increase on Puma’s £65m-per-year deal it signed in 2019 with City – on a divisive club awaiting a verdict on 115 financial charges and a side that seems to be, based upon performances last season andat the Copa Gianni, slightly on the wane. Might Puma’s new deal have something to do with topping Adidas’s paltry-looking £60m a-season deal with City rivals Liverpool,signed only a few months ago? It feels like a bit of a stretch, but as City and Liverpool or Adi and Rudi Dassler know so well, ego and tribalism can lead to some wild decisions.Whatever the reasons behind the extraordinary agreement, City suits must be delighted to have renewed a deal with a company not linked to their owners. “We joined forces with Puma with the ambition to challenge ourselves and go beyond the expectations,” whooped chief suit Ferran Soriano. “We have achieved this and more over the last six seasons. Today’s renewal and extension solidifies our relationship and projects it to an even brighter future.” After watching Chelsea – a club famous fortheir own financial gymnastics– trouser around £85m for their Copa Gianni triumph, the Puma deal certainly softens the blow for City’s early exit from the tournament. Just how the £1bn will be invested remains to be seen but at least Pep Guardiola can afford a few moredelayed kick-offs.QUOTE OF THE DAYIt’s unacceptable that in the 21st century, people with dwarfism are still used for entertainment at private parties, particularly when public figures are involved. The dignity and rights of our community cannot be a source of amusement under any circumstance” – Carolina Puente, president of the Association for People with Achondroplasia and Other Skeletal Dysplasias, vows to take legal action over the reported hiring of people with dwarfism as entertainment at Lamine Yamal’s recent 18th birthday party, condemning the practice as discriminatory. The player’s representatives are yet to comment.FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERSAs an Arsenal supporter for many a decade, I should just like to say that The Auld Triangle pub you referred to (yesterday’s Football Daily), was to those who should easily remember, in fact originally named the Plimsoll Arms. People I knew were always perturbed by its renaming, so despite the fact that it’s now a gastro pub, I’m glad that, name-wise, it’s returning to its roots. Make mine a Guinness!” – Colin Grant (and others).When I first came to London in 1997, I moved into a house on St Thomas’s Road, opposite the Auld Triangle. The landlord was grouchy when it was busy, but really approachable when it was quiet (non-match days). Arsenal fans really sustained that pub, because in the off-season, sometimes we would be the only patrons in the pub. I remember quiz nights with the bullet-headed, no-necked Robbie (‘It’s ahnly a paaaahnd!’), an intimidating figure, but a stand-up comedian in his own right. Happy days” – Paul Chan.To describe Cole Palmer as scooting through ‘Wythenshawe high street’ (yesterday’s Football Daily) is to misunderstand the type of settlement that Wythenshawe is. As an overspill housing estate on the edge of the Greater Manchester conurbation, its pencil-pushing post-war town planners did not see fit to install anything as grand as a high street, but a civic centre grandly named the ‘Forum’ and pedestrianised shopping area can be found sitting nearish to the middle of this somewhat amorphous suburban mass. I wouldn’t expect a London-centric, anti-northern email to be aware of all this, and this lazy journalism points to a wider decline at the centre of our once great, free press” – Mike Lovelady.View image in fullscreenWythenshawe, earlier.Photograph: Molly Darlington/ReutersIf there’s one thing to be thankful about at the Copa Gianni, it’s that Donald Trump didn’t squeeze his corpulent rump into a full Chelsea strip first, like the last guy to sneak his way into the Blues’ cup-raising celebrations” – Declan Hackett.If you have any, please send letters tothe.boss@theguardian.com.Today’s winner of our prizeless letter o’ the day is … Declan Hackett.

They have become, mostly, slick affairs. This summer, Arsenal will visit neighbouring Singapore for games against Newcastle and Milan. Then to Hong Kong for an unusual north London derby against a Tottenham team that will also travel to South Korea to face Newcastle. Liverpool visit Japan and Hong Kong just weeks afterManchester Unitedwere in action there on a post-season tour, which they finished in Malaysia.Taking flight: how Premier League clubs are racking up 175,000 summer air milesRead moreNot all has changed, though.Arsenalreceived an undisclosed sum back in the mists of time and generating revenue is still the order of the day. There are millions of fans in Asia who want to see their favourite teams and if they are lucky enough to live in the continent’s richer countries – you don’t see many exhibitions in Laos or Bangladesh, by contrast – clubs are happy to oblige. Sneering at such exhibitions is easy; harder is staying up into the early hours, weekend after weekend, season after season.“These opportunities don’t come around often,” Sawita Chuasukontip, an Arsenal fan in Thailand, says. “There’s real excitement as everyone eagerly anticipates the team’s visit to Asia, from the announcement of the tour to the ticket sales. Many fans can’t make the trip to Europe to see games. That’s why the club’s visit is so significant, it gives fans the chance to experience their favourite team up close without the long journey.”Fans in Malaysia felt the same when Manchester United visited in May. “It’s important as most of us can’t afford to fly across the world to see them live and fans do enjoy them,” says Aysha Ridzuan, a fan and Kuala Lumpur-based sports social media consultant. “For some, it’s like a dream come true to see them up close.”United’s time in Malaysia almost turned into a nightmare with a 1-0 loss to an Asean All Stars team and negative headlinesabout the behaviour and attitude of certain players. “It’s a shame the recent one didn’t go so well – arriving so soon from a tough season,” Ridzuan adds. “But I hope they don’t take a long time to come again because it’s proven that they have a huge fanbase here. Even after an awful season, over 70,000 people still turned up to see them in action.”The verdict on the performance was not kind after the defeat, but these kinds of games are becoming less common. “Fans are bored of European teams coming in and playing against the national team or All Star teams, that’s been done to death and very rarely creates a good match,” Marcus Luer, who stagedthe United v Liverpool clash in Bangkok three years ago, says. There is a growing trend of big European clubs facing rivals instead of hastily assembled local sides. This may lead to higher prices but fans have shown they want the occasion to be as authentic as possible.They also want the clubs to show they care. “I just want them to make the most of their tour, like reaching out to underprivileged fans, like children in remote areas or those with limited financial resources,” Jittakorn Srikhamkhrua, a ThaiLiverpoolfan and influencer, says. “I’d like the club to create more tangible opportunities for these individuals.”View image in fullscreenMohamed Salah meeting Liverpool supporters in Hong Kong in 2017.Photograph: Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC/Getty ImagesThe more clubs do on tour, the better it is. Fans in Asia want to feel valued and not just as a source of revenue. “It not only helps strengthen connections with the fans but might also encourage more Asian supporters to travel to Europe to watch matches in person,” Chuasukontip says. “Importantly, it shows the clubs’ commitment and care for their fans, even from a distance.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question is, will clubs be prepared to invest in them?” If so, then the visits could go to a new level. “Asian tours have never peaked because European clubs have never taken them as seriously as they should,” Chadwick says.It is not just about engaging with current fans but winning over new ones, too. Lifting major trophies is the best way and, while it could be that gruelling trips to Asia in pre-season do not help, this is the reality in which clubs operate. “Research has always shown that the main point of engagement for many prospective fans is on-field success,” says Chadwick. “But engagement is not simply about watching 90 seconds of highlights on mobile devices, audiences want touch and feel experiences … finding a balance between success and experience is one of the big challenges European clubs face.”Explore more on these topicsPremier LeagueFriendliesManchester UnitedArsenalLiverpoolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The appeal by the ITIA is therefore upheld and the decision rendered by the independent tribunal is set aside.”Moore had previously said she felt her reputation, ranking and livelihood was “slowly trickling away” for 19 months during her initial suspension.The 32-year-old had also filed a cross-appeal at Cas “seeking to dismiss the ITIA appeal, dismiss the nandrolone result in the ADRV or alternatively confirm that she bears no fault or negligence”.However, Cas said the cross-appeal was declared inadmissible and her four-year period of ineligibility would start from Tuesday, with credit for any provisional suspension that has already been served.“Our bar for appealing a first-instance decision is high, and the decision is not taken lightly,” the ITIA’s chief executive, Karen Moorhouse, said in a statement.“In this case, our independent scientific advice was that the player did not adequately explain the high level of nandrolone present in their sample. Today’s ruling is consistent with this position.”Moore is ranked 187th in the world in doubles and No 864 in singles – 11th in Britain in doubles and No 27 in singles. In recent times, she has been taking part on the ITF World Tennis and WTA 125 tours, the rungs below elite level. She is also a former Billie Jean King Cup team member, and in February 2022 – five months before her provisional suspension – Moore became Britain’s No 1-ranked women’s doubles player for the first time. She competed in doubles at this year’s Australian Open, losing alongside Austria’s Julia Grabher in the first round.In a 2019 tournament in Sunderland, Moore made headlines afterstaging an astonishing comebackfrom 0-6, 0-5 and 30-40 down to beat France’s Jessika Ponchet.Explore more on these topicsTennisDrugs in sportnewsShareReuse this content"

France have emerged as leading contenders to face the Lions in a warm-up match before the tour of New Zealand in 2029 and, according to Benazzi, could also fulfil the same role before the inaugural women’s tour in 2027, also to New Zealand.The Breakdown | Five areas where the Australia v Lions Test series will be won and lostRead moreMore recently, however, there has been a groundswell of support for a tour of France, with leading Top 14 sides such as Toulouse and Bordeaux offering the prospect of competitive warm-up matches before a mouthwatering series againstLes Bleusin contrast to the currently one-sided tour of Australia. The former Wales scrum-half Mike Phillips last week became the most recent former Lion to throw his weight behind the prospect, suggesting a tour of France would be a “gamechanger”.Benazzi, who is also the president of the Six Nations and narrowly lost out to Brett Robinson in last year’s election to be World Rugby chair, is seeking to make France regular opponents on the Lions’ fixture list. Asked about the prospect of a future tour of his country, Benazzi said: “If you look at the legacy and the reputation of the Lions, of course they have the tradition with the south, our position as a neighbour is that we can do something together in the future.“We had contact, not formally, just a friendly chat with the guys from the Lions and they started thinking maybe it would be a good idea. We don’t have a formal decision now but maybe we will talk about having two meetings with the [women] and the Lions and the men and the Lions in the future. Maybe in 2027 and 2029. We don’t think of just one shot, we think of a programme for the future. It’s good for everyone because it’s powerful and we want to share it with this institution.“I want to spend a bit of time with the staff and just think about how we can build a new business model with this institution between France and the Lions. For me and for France, we want to build something interesting for both. How we can build something bigger for rugby, for everyone around the world with this meeting and secondly, how we can build some business between the two institutions, the Lions and France, and everyone will be happy with that.”It is understood the Lions are open to exploring possibilities with France, which would provide an attractive option for supporters unable to afford expensive trips to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Benazzi was eager to stress that France are not looking to replace any of the three southern hemisphere nations but the FFR’s interest increases the pressure on the Wallabies to be competitive against the Lions in the coming series. An agreement for the 2029 tour with New Zealand is considered a given but the Lions are not formally committed to tour South Africa in 2033 or Australia in 2037.Benazzi also believes the French public and players would fully buy in to the concept and expressed confidence an arrangement could be reached with the Top 14 to avoid clashing with the end-of-season run-in. “We don’t want to steal something from the south,” he added. “We just want to do something extra. It’s a legacy and that’s very important but we have a lot of things to share together. Being neighbours is important for supporters. I spoke with an agency that brings a lot of people to Australia this year and they said to me it would be very good business for people coming from the UK to France.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Dawson has also been preferred to Rehan Ahmed, Will Jacks and Tom Hartley, all spinners who have played Tests for England in recent years.The 35-year-old is a much better batter than Bashir or Leach, with a first-class average this summer of 44.66 and across his career of 35.29, and a total of 18 first-class centuries.“Liam Dawson deserves his call-up,” said the England selector Luke Wright. “He has been in outstanding form in the County Championship and consistently puts in strong performances for Hampshire.”Bashir broke his finger while fielding off his own bowling during India’s first innings at Lord’s, but despite the injury batted in England’s second innings and bowled 5.5 overs on the final day,taking the decisive wicketas the Test was won by just 22 runs. Ben Stokes, the captain, said: “It’s a big shame, but I think the courage he showed to go out there and bat for us, and being willing to sit there on the bench waiting for his moment to come on and bowl, just proves how much it means to everyone who gets the opportunity to put the shirt on. “Not even a couple of breaks is going to stop anyone getting out there.”Quick GuideEngland squad for fourth Test against IndiaShowBen Stokes (Durham; captain); Jofra Archer (Sussex); Gus Atkinson (Surrey); Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire); Harry Brook (Yorkshire); Brydon Carse (Durham); Zak Crawley (Kent); Liam Dawson (Hampshire); Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire); Ollie Pope (Surrey); Joe Root (Yorkshire); Jamie Smith (Surrey; wicketkeeper); Josh Tongue (Nottinghamshire); Chris Woakes (Warwickshire).Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Essex’s Sam Cook and Jamie Overton of Surrey, who were both in the squad for the third Test, have been released to their respective counties to play in the County Championship.

Of the £306.1m generated in 2023 just three teams – Surrey, Lancashire and Warwickshire, with income boosted in all three cases by hosting Ashes Tests that year – were responsible for 44%. By contrast the three poorest counties – Leicestershire, Derbyshire and Northamptonshire – between them generated just 5.56% of the total.England call up veteran spinner Liam Dawson to replace Bashir for fourth Test with IndiaRead moreThe England and WalesCricketBoard’s annual payment to counties, of just over £88m in 2023, made up 27% of their combined income, but while it constituted just 6% of Surrey’s it made up 71% of Northamptonshire’s, and 67% of Leicestershire’s.The report suggests that the fact counties do not themselves control such a vital revenue stream could threaten their financial sustainability, particularly given concerns that it will be reduced if income from future domestic and international media rights sales decreases.“We would probably have been talking about 18 counties going down to 14, 13, 12, even” professor Rob Wilson, the report’s co-author, said. “Essentially the picture is counties [are] overly reliant onECBfunding. And if you take that ECB funding out, they are technically insolvent. They simply do not make enough money to wash their face. Then you have this unicorn that is the Hundred which will to a degree solve some of those short- and medium‑term financial issues.”Wilson described the arrival of the Hundred money as “a crucial turning point in the domestic game … an extraordinary opportunity, but it has to be managed with real prudence”.He said: “It’s really easy if you just look at the numbers to say those counties are almost insolvent because they don’t generate enough to sustain themselves. So without that grant, they disappear.“The reality is that the ECB revenue structure enables the counties to exist in the formats they’re in. And that’s going to be turbocharged with the Hundred money. What’s important is that the ECB look after that money and how they distribute it so the clubs don’t waste it.”While counties are due to profit from the £520m generatedby the sale of Hundred franchises, 65% of that would disappear if they paid off the £338.6m debt they held in 2023, most of it concentrated in those with the highest annual incomes.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Ramore Restaurant Group suffered a combination of furious online backlash and ridicule after hiking the price of a chicken pasta dish from £14.95 to £27.95 for Open week.AI generated images online showed local heroes Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke cleaning dishes, alongside commentary suggesting this is what they would have to do to pay a restaurant bill.‘What is the point?’ Scottie Scheffler questions golf and life before OpenRead moreThe company owns Portrush’s Harbour Bar, Ramore Wine Bar, Basalt and Neptune and Prawn. At the Ramore Wine Bar, a chicken and bacon burger rose in price from £7.95 to £17.95. The operators blamed increased costs associated with the Open as cause for the situation.With more than 275,000 spectators expected in town for the Open, price changes would not be regarded as unusual but the scale of Ramore’s alterations drew sharp focus.In a statement, the Ramore Group said it was “aware of recent conversations around pricing during the Open” and as a result had “revised and adjusted” menus immediately.The statement added: “As a family-run business proud to be part of the Portrush community, our goal throughout this week is to deliver the best possible experience and ensure safety for those visiting.“In anticipation of the large influx of guests, we’ve employed over 30+ agency staff to support our kitchens and front-of-house teams, 30+ security personnel operating around the clock to ensure everyone’s safety and more than 20 entertainers performing across our six venues seven days a week.“We have simply been investing more as a business for our customers to ensure enjoyment and safety. Which of course creates additional business bills. We would also like to remind people that there is a family behind this business. A family who are involved every day, trying their very best, and reading every single comment. Everyone can make mistakes, however nobody deserves slander and hatred.”The Northern Ireland assembly member, Cara Hunter, told the BBC: “I think that even if some messaging had been put out to say that prices were increasing, it might have been a little less shocking.

The £100m a-year deal extends their agreement until at least 2035 and is a marked increase from the previous £65m-a-year deal with the German kit manufacturer that ran until 2029.The contract is thought to be the first £1bn deal in English football and a record per year for a Premier League club. In July 2023 Manchester United sealed a 10-year contract with Adidas worth about £900m, and four months ago Liverpool agreed amulti-year deal with Adidasthought to be worth £60m a-season.Since City’s contract with Puma started in 2019, Pep Guardiola’s side have won four Premier League titles and became the second English team toclaim the treble.Ferran Soriano, the chief executive of City Football Group, said: “We joined forces with Puma with the ambition to challenge ourselves and go beyond the expectations. We have achieved this and more over the last six seasons. Today’s renewal and extension solidifies our relationship and projects it to an even brighter future.”Puma is also a partner of the City Football Group clubs Melbourne City, Girona, Lommel, Mumbai City, Montevideo, Palermo, Bolivia, Bahia and Estac.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Serafini was found guilty of killing Robert Gary Spohr, 70, who was found dead in a house from a single gunshot. Serafini was also found guilty of shooting Spohr’s wife, Wendy Wood, then 68, twice in the head. She recovered from the injures but took her own life one year later. Her family said the trauma of the attack led to her death.Prosecutors said the fatal incident involved a dispute over a property renovation project. Jurors were presented with text message evidence of the escalation of the disagreement and premeditation prior to the shooting. One text message by Serafini sent prior to the attack read, “I’m going to kill them one day.”Serafini, who played seven years in the majors, and 33-year-old Samantha Scott were charged as co-defendants last year. In February, Scott pleaded guilty to an accessory charge and during the trial was introduced as a close friend of one of the Spohrs’ daughters, Erin. Erin was married to Serafini and testified that they had an open marriage and was aware Scott was romantically involved with her husband. Erin Spohr testified that she did not believe Serafini murdered her father or shot her mother.Video surveillance from the home and surrounding area showed a man wearing a hood, face covering and a backpack walking to the Spohrs’ home before the homicide. Evidence presented at the trial alleged Serafini waited for three hours in the house before attacking the couple.Spohr and Wood’s daughter, Adrienne, said Serafini was guilty of a “heinous and calculated” crime.“It’s been four years since my mom and dad were shot and it’s been four years of just hell,” Adrienne Spohrsaid after the guilty verdict.“Today, finally, justice was served.”Serafini is scheduled to be sentenced on 18 August.TheMinnesota Twinsselected Serafini, a native of the San Francisco area, with the No 26 overall pick in the 1992 MLB draft. He made his debut in 1996 and went on to appear in 104 games with the Twins, Chicago Cubs, San Diego Padres, Pittsburgh Pirates, Cincinnati Reds and Colorado Rockies before his retirement in 2007.Serafini made more than $10m during his baseball career but lost much of it due to a divorce settlement and failed investments.Explore more on these topicsMLBMinnesota TwinsBaseballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

He had reached the All-Star break with a major league-leading 38 home runs. He became the second Mariners player to take the title after three-time winner Ken Griffey Jr.Raleigh was pitched to by his father, Todd, former coach of Tennessee and Western Carolina. His younger brother Todd Raleigh Jr did the catching.Just the second Derby switch-hitter after Baltimore’s Adley Rutschman in 2023, Raleigh hit his first eight left-handed, took a timeout, then hit seven right-handed.

Olson, disappointing his hometown fans, did not go deep on his first nine swings and finished with 15, He also was eliminated in the first round in 2021. Chisholm hit just three homers, the fewest since the timer format started in 2015.Raleigh won $1m as well as the title.

The 24-carat gold Tiffany trophy presented to Reece James by Donald Trump in New Jersey, in one of the most surreal scenes seen in a sports stadium, will be up for grabs again in four years. The event could well be bigger, Fifa intends it to be better and the presentation will surely not be as brash.Gianni Infantino was widely criticisedfor imposing the Club World Cup on an indifferent sporting public, against a backdrop of hostility from players’ unions and domestic leagues, but his belief that top clubs would back his vision has been vindicated, albeit largely because of the $1bn (£740m) prize fund. With Chelsea banking £85m for winning seven matches, others are keen for a slice of the pie.Trump’s presence at Chelsea’s trophy lift was a fitting coda to a misguided tournament | Jonathan WilsonRead moreThe Guardian reported last month that Fifa isconsidering expanding the competitionto 48 teams in 2029, and it is facing calls from some clubs to stage it more frequently. During talks involving Fifa, the clubs and the confederations in Miami during the tournament, it is understood Real Madrid raised the prospect of holding the tournament every two years in an echo of Arsène Wenger’s abortive campaign for a biennial World Cup.Madrid have been the Club World Cup’s biggest success in commercial terms, their fans responsible for 25% of ticket sales. The club need to service a €1.2bn (£1.04bn) loan taken out to fund the redevelopment of the Bernabéu and are determined to cash in on their global appeal.Fifa has no plans to accede to Madrid’s wishes, because even Infantino accepts that would be overkill, but discussions over expanding to 48 teams in 2029 remain very much on the table. Infantino, in a rare public appearance at which he took questions on Saturday, at Fifa’s new office at Trump Tower, name-checked Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United, Tottenham, Barcelona, Napoli and Milan as clubs he would love to have involved in the 2029 tournament. Clubs from the old world still bring in the biggest cheques in the new.Sunday’s defeated finalists, Paris Saint-Germain, are the only European club to have qualified for 2029, by winning this year’s Champions League. As it stands Chelsea will have to earn the right to defend their title through European performances, although that could change.View image in fullscreenThe enthusiasm for the Club World Cup in South America, as evidenced by the fans at games, has been one of the successes of the competition.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockFifa officials have privately conceded that the qualification process is up in the air, as is the venue. As revealed by the Guardian,Qatar staked its claimto bid in meetings in Miami last month, but there is a sense that Fifa would prefer a joint production from the 2030 World Cup hosts, Morocco, Spain and Portugal. Morocco and Spain, though, want to host the competition alone and Portugal has expressed no interest.The broadcaster could stay the same, with Fifa indebted to Dazn for bankrolling the tournamentwith a $1bn global deal, funded by the purchase of 10% of the company by Saudi Arabia’s SURJ Sports Investment. Infantino praised “a one-of-a-kind revolutionary contract with Dazn” on Saturday, and the streaming company is happy with the results of its biggest venture yet.Viewing figures have yet to be made public, but Dazn insiders say they are delighted with the engagement and that it brought more than 2bnviews, with about 5% of viewers signing up to its premium service. The ratings have been particularly high in Brazil on the back of Fluminense reaching the semi-finals and Palmeiras the last eight, with more than 180m views. Chelsea’s first game against Los Angeles brought 8m log-ons to the Dazn app, with the global audience reaching about 25m when sub-licence deals such as Channel 5 in the UK are included.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

There’s plenty we still don’t know – videoX’s expert witness, RMIT economics professor Chris Berg, provided evidence to the case that it was an error to assume a large language model can produce such content, because it is the intent of the user prompting the large language model that is critical in defining what can be considered terrorism and violent extremism content.One of eSafety’s expert witnesses, Queensland University of Technology law professor Nicolas Suzor, disagreed with Berg, stating it was “absolutely possible for chatbots, generative AI and other tools to have some role in producing so-called synthetic TVE”.“This week has been quite full of them, with X’s chatbot Grok producing [content that] fits within the definitions of TVE,” Suzor said.He said the development of AI has human influence “all the way down” where you can find intent, including Musk’s actions to change the way Grok was responding to queries to “stop being woke”.The tribunal heard that X believes the use of its Community Notes feature (where users can contribute to factchecking a post on the site) and Grok’s Analyse feature (where it provides context on a post) can detect or address TVE.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Roose said TVE required users to report the content to X, which went into a “black box” for the company to investigate, and often only a small amount of material was removed and a small number of accounts banned.Suzor said that after the events of last week, it was hard to view Grok as “truth seeking” in its responses.“It’s uncontroversial to say that Grok is not maximalising truth or truth seeking. I say that particularly given the events of last week I would just not trust Grok at all,” he said.Berg argued that the Grok Analyse feature on X had not been updated with the features that caused the platform’s chatbot to make the responses it did last week, but admitted the chatbot that users respond to directly on X had “gone a bit off the rails” by sharing hate speech content and “just very bizarre content”.Suzor said Grok had been changed not to maximise truth seeking but “to ensure responses are more in line with Musk’s ideological view”.Earlier in the hearing, lawyers for X accused eSafety of attempting to turn the hearing “into a royal commission into certain aspects of X”, after Musk’s comment referring to Inman Grant as a “commissar” was brought up in the cross-examination of an X employee about meetings held with X prior to the notice being issued.The government’s barrister, Stephen Lloyd, argued X was trying to argue that eSafety was being “unduly adversarial” in its dealings with X, and that X broke off negotiations at a critical point before the notice was issued. He said the “aggressive approach” came from X’s leadership.The hearing continues.Explore more on these topicsXSocial mediaArtificial intelligence (AI)Digital medianewsShareReuse this content"

This week,Elon Musk’s X, formerly Twitter, saw its artificial intelligence chatbot Grok go Nazi. Then its CEO resigned. In the past three years of Musk’s ownership of the social network, it feels like X has weathered at least one public crisis per week, more often multiple.Musk’s chatbot melts down, then wins a military contractLast week, Musk’s artificial intelligence firm, xAI, saw its flagship chatbot Grok declare itself a super-Nazi, referring to itself as “MechaHitler”. It made racist, sexist and antisemitic posts, which the company deleted.One example, via my colleagueJosh Taylor:Grok referred to a person with a common Jewish surname as someone who was “celebrating the tragic deaths of white kids” in the Texas floods as “future fascists”.xAIapologizedfor the bot’s “horrific behavior”. Earlier in the week, Musk himself had handed down a mandate that Grok be less “woke”.In spite of the meltdown, xAI announced on Monday that it had won a contact of up to $200m with the US Department of Defense along with other major AI developers. The deal is for developing and implementing artificial intelligence tools for the agency.This contract may be the most blatant example of Musk flexing his newfound connections in government that the public has seen yet. Despite Grok’s flailing and incendiary output, xAI has been rewarded alongside firms that have demonstrated far superior control of their AI products. Other companies in the group of contract winners, which include Google, OpenAI and Anthropic, have demonstrated the viability of their chatbots and implemented robust guardrails against offensive output. All three firms make public commitments to safety testing. Grok, by contrast, has made headlines repeatedly for its controversial and offensive output, as in May when itranted about “white genocide” in May, echoing Musk’s own talking points. Musk’s most notable comments on his AI’s safeguards have been that they are too restrictive.My colleagueNick Robins-Earlypoints out that xAI is reaching for revenue and investment anywhere it can get it:The DoD’s contract will give xAI a boost of revenue as it seeks to compete with more established AI developers like OpenAI, which is led by Musk’s former associate turned rival, Sam Altman. Musk has been heavily promoting xAI and attempting to use other parts of his tech empire to support its future, including having SpaceX invest $2bn into the startup, allowing it to acquireX, formerly, Twitter, and announcing on Sunday that Tesla shareholders will vote on their own investment in xAI.Chaos is plaguing Musk’s empireView image in fullscreenPhotograph: ReutersThe world’s richest person seems to be growing desperate as a result of the turmoil roiling his kingdom. He has said he will form anindependent political party. xAI is pursuing financial Jenga. Tesla’ssales are plummeting; its wobbly Robotaxis areunder investigation. SpaceX’s giant rockets keepexploding after liftoff.Nick Robins-Earlyagain:Musk has found himself embroiled in controversy outside of X in recent months. His political alliance with Donald Trump, which began during the 2024 campaign and resulted in Musk’s appointment as a special government employee and the creation of the so-called “department of government efficiency”, imploded in June in full public view. The tech tycoon has committed to starting an independent political party.Meanwhile, Tesla, the source of the majority of Musk’s wealth, has seen its sales fall precipitously in response to his political activities, with prospective buyers and current owners alike shying away from the controversial CEO. SpaceX, Musk’s rocket company, has struggled with its latest rocket, the massive Starship, which has repeatedly exploded after liftoff.Linda Yaccarino, X’s embarrassed public face, falls off the glass cliffView image in fullscreenLinda Yaccarino, the CEO of X Corp, in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 7 January.Photograph: Patrick T Fallon/AFP via Getty ImagesOn Wednesday, X’s CEO, Linda Yaccarino, announced she would step down from her role at the social network. It was the day after Grok went Nazi.My colleagues Johana Bhuiyan and Nick Robins-EarlyassessedYaccarino’s tenure:In two years, Yaccarino has had to contend with the unpredictability of Musk, ongoing content moderation and hate speech issues on the platform, increasingly strained relationships with advertisers and widespread backlash her boss received for his role in Donald Trump’s administration. Her response in some cases was to remain silent; in others, she chose to defend the company. Through it all, however, experts say it was clear Yaccarino was the chief executive in title only.Rather than become a destination for mainstream talent, a streaming powerhouse or the “everything app” that Yaccarino promoted, X has largely become a megaphone for Musk to air his grievances, boost and then feud with Trump, and promote his companies. Far-right influencers, porn spambots and meme accounts proliferate, while many media outlets have deprioritized the platform or left it altogether. Misinformation and extremism are rampant, sometimes coming from Musk himself.When Yaccarino was hired, the Guardian published a story headlined “Linda Yaccarino: does Twitter’s CEO have the most difficult job in tech?”. The article describes the obstacles facing Yaccarino at the start of her tenure, which she never overcame. Two years later, we can say with certainty that she did have the most impossible job in tech: reining in Musk.My colleague Kari Paulreportedin 2023:Musk promised to bring in a new CEO – a position he himself described as a “painful” job that anyone would be “foolish” to take on.When Yaccarino was appointed as the company’s first female CEO, there was much talk about her standing on a “glass cliff” – a concept that has emerged through research positing that women are more likely to be promoted to higher positions when companies are in crisis and failure is more likely.Much of her success, analysts said, would depend on how much Musk was willing to share control. The chaotic nature of the X announcement for some has dashed the hope that Yaccarino can clean up Musk’s mess.Twitter has been in a downward spiral since Musk took over, grappling with a $13bn debt burden and a massive exodus of advertisers – historically the company’s main source of income. Twitter is looking for new revenue streams, and the “everything app” could be a path to doing so.“If she’s successful, she goes down in the history books. And if not, she becomes a footnote,” said Jasmine Enberg, social media analyst at the market research firm Insider Intelligence.The wider TechScapeSony WH-1000XM6 review: raising the bar for noise-cancelling headphones‘I was nervous to ask for your socials’: why missed connection posts are making a comebackNvidia becomes first company to reach $4tn in market valueAmazon asks corporate workers to ‘volunteer’ help with grocery deliveries as Prime Day frenzy approachesAn AI-generated band got 1m plays on Spotify.

And there was certainly a cracking two‑parter atWimbledonthis year. First came the news that 300 line judges had been replaced by artificial intelligence robots. Then, a few days later, it turned out there were some embarrassing gremlins in the machine. Not since Roger Federer hung up his Wilson racket has there been a sweeter spot hit during the Wimbledon fortnight.First the new electronic line-judging system failed to spot that Sonay Kartal had whacked a ball long duringher match against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova– which led to the Russian losing a game she otherwise would have won. Although, ironically, it happened onlybecause an official had accidentally switched the system off.‘It’s useless’: how Wimbledon reacted to electronic line calls … in 1980Read moreThen a Taylor Fritz forehand was called out despite landing four feet inside the baseline. This timethe system had been confused by a ballboystill being on court when the American began his serve.In truth, it was far less serious than in the Kartal one. But it didn’t matter. The narrative was established. Technology was robbing us of our jobs,stealing our cherished traditions. And the twist? It also suggested that computers couldn’t replace human judgment after all.Rather lost in all the outrage was the fact that Wimbledon was actually using a souped-up version of the same Hawk-Eye system that it has employed since 2007. And a couple of incidents, albeit embarrassing ones, should not make us ignore the broader reality. Technology is far better than the human eye. It makes far fewer errors. And it’s not even close.Long ago, researchers estimated that line judges get around 8% of close calls wrong. But, if anything, players’ judgments are far worse.When I asked IBM how often players got it right when they challenged a line call at Wimbledon last year, I expected it to be about 50/50. But of the 1,535 challenges across the men’s and women’s singles in 2024 just 380 – less than 25% – were overturned. In other words, when a player thought the ball was out and made a challenge, they were wrong three out of four times.And there is a wider point, which a Wimbledon official stressed to me about the use of technology in sport: sporting bodies are using it not only because players, by and large, want it, but because it protects the integrity of sport and officials too. Gone are the days when a decision went against supporters or gamblers and they shrugged their shoulders. Nowadays they abuse players and officials on social media and mutter about dark conspiracies.At the last Rugby World Cup,Wayne Barnes even spoke ofreceiving “threats of sexual violence to my wife, threats of violence against my children – and you’re like, is that really what sport is about?” He is far from alone. In such a fevered environment, anything that helps an official has to be a good thing.View image in fullscreenUmpire Nico Helworth deals with the aftermath of the electronic line-calling system being briefly turned off during Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova’s match with Sonay Kartal.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianAnd even when referees do their best, they are unconsciously influenced by crowds. One study asked 40 qualified football referees to judge 47 incidents from a match between Liverpool and Leicester; half watched with crowd noise, the control group in silence. Those viewing the footage with crowd noise awarded significantly fewer fouls (15.5%) against Liverpool compared with those watching in silence.Another study in Norway found that successful teams were more likely to be given favourable penalty decisions. Psychologists call this influence conformity. And say what you like about machines, they are immune to that, too.Critics of technology in sport are often deeply resistant to change. They also demand perfection. But to quote Voltaire, perfect is the enemy of good. Instead, we should be asking, is the tech better and more accurate than what was in place before – and is there scope for further improvement?skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It will continue to get better. And while there are plenty of critics of VAR, the way Fifa has used it at the World Cup and Club World Cup – with fewer delays and letting fans see the replays the officials watch – shows it can work. Let’s hope the Premier League was taking notes.One thing is clear, though. More is to come. That’s according to Matt Drew, who founded the integrity department at StatsPerform, a leading data and sports integrity provider.“No system is 100% perfect, but they are demonstrably more accurate than relying purely on human decision-making,” he says. “Sports believe that technology helps them get more decisions right and protects officials and players from abuse. The best ones – like in tennis and cricket – also balance it in a way that preserves the fan experience. And they are going to continue to use and refine it, so it becomes more accurate.”What might we see? Well, at the International Olympic Committee’s artificial intelligence conference last year it showed a diver in real time, with a screen immediately telling a judge the height of his jump, the number of rotations in the air and how close his legs were to his torso as he spun. Each element of the dive was also split into sequences, with everything analysed in less than a tenth of a second. The idea was to give every judge a far better idea of the quality of the dive and be able to award a fairer score. Who would be against that?Meanwhile as the machines continue their rise, more traditions will inevitably slip away. From September, for instance, the NFL will replace its “chain gang” of officials who walk on to the pitch to mark first downs with Hawk-Eye technology. In truth, I will miss them. But having someone guess where the ball should be placed feels far closer to the 18th century than the 21st.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But the influence of nationalist leaders sympathetic to Trump has caused a splitTue 15 Jul 2025 10.28 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 11.09 EDTShareDonald Trump’s trade policy has been labelled “Taco” – “Trump always chickens out” – by his critics. But when it comes to his latest trade war with the EU, it’s Brussels that risks chickening out. The US and the EU have been negotiating for months on an agreement. This week Trump made the shock announcement that the US would hit the EU with punitive tariffs on goods at a crippling30% ratefrom 1 August. This was in addition to separate steel and aluminium tariffs, and cars at even more punitive rates.BlindsidedBrussels negotiatorscalculated the economic damage, and ministers talked aboutretaliation. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, warned that “all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests” would be taken. But so far, despite the tough words, the EU isholding back.The hope of finding a reasonable compromise, which is the German chancellor Friedrich Merz’s preoccupation, makes economic sense. But the political fallout of the EU’s reticence and perceived weakness could be immense.The original Brussels strategy in talks with the US was to aim for a “0% for 0%” tariff agreement. It argued that the overall transatlantic trade balance should be considered, including services as well as manufactured goods. Because, although (as Trump complains bitterly) the EU enjoys a significant trade surplus in goods with the US – to the order of €200bn a year – it consistently features a deficit in services, in particular tech services, standing atabout €150bna year.When the UK reached an early “framework deal” with the US, accepting a 10% US tariff on its exports, but leaving negotiations open for exemptions on a number of specific sectors, it was considered dismissively, in EU circles, a bad deal.A 10% tariff is, after all, pretty high. Keir Starmer shaking hands on that appeared to be sealing the end of the free-trade era. The assumption was that given the EU’s economic size and the dependence on the European markets for certain US exports, Harley-Davidson bikes for example, Brussels had the clout to do a lot better: to induce Washington into a more trade-friendly deal.Indeed, China, whose economic weight is comparable to the EU’s and much higher than that of the UK, used its leverage to secure a trade truce, which is as much, if not more, inBeijing’s interestthan Washington’s. Washington and Beijing are now working towards a summit in the autumn.With Europe, negotiations have not turned out so well. As the Trump administration resumed sabre-rattling again recently, threatening Mexico, Canada and Brazil, the volatility made the EU jittery, eager to seal a deal no matter what. Back in the spring, on Trump’s so-called “liberation day”, the EU had been firm in threatening substantial retaliation, including venting the possibility of its “nuclear” option, a trade anti-coercion instrument that would severely restrict US access to the EU internal market. All of that was put on hold after the White House blinked first, dialling down from its original 20% tariff threat to a baseline of 10%, alongside higher sectoral tariffs.The prevailing view among EU member states then was that rather than follow Trump down the rat hole of a tit-for-tat trade war, they should negotiate an overarching free-trade deal. In the background, European governments also feared that Trump would leverage their military defence dependency on the US by lashing out, especially against Ukraine, at the Nato summit in The Hague.The Hague summit came and went in June. No agreement on trade materialised, but talks were ongoing. Then Trump launched his latest bombshell, throwingagriculture and pharmaceuticalsinto the mix as well.But once again, the EU has taco-ed out. A package of potential counter-tariffs drawn up to hit US exports worth €21bn annuallyhas been delayed. The European Commission is working on an additional retaliatory list, including US goods such as aircraft, alcohol and food, originally amounting to a value of €95bn. But this has beencut to €72bn, and may never come into effect. Talk about implementing the anti-coercion instrument is shelved for now. In the meantime, the US is applying tariffs on about€380bn of annual importsfrom the EU.As with all sanctions, retaliatory tariffs would be self-harming. It makes economic sense to focus instead on doubling down on removing trade barriers with other countries. In this respect, the European Commission has been active. Alongsidefree-trade agreementswith four of the Mercosur group (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and Mexico, which were reached before Trump took office, the EU has stepped up the pace in talks with Australia, New Zealand and India, and has launched negotiations with the UAE. After many years, it has just reached adeal with Indonesia. It has also proposed to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, featuring 11 Asia-Pacific countries plus the UK, to deepen relations and explore the possibility of developing a new World Trade Organization, given the original has been blocked by the US for many years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To cite the most obvious sore point, ratification of the free trade deal with the Mercosur bloc remains stuck. Nonetheless, there is real momentum behind the EU’s trade policy both with countries in the “rest of the west” and with the “rest” in the global south.But none of this alters the reality that succumbing to Trump’s bullying on trade may be a political boomerang for Europe. Although trade is managed by the EU collectively, not by individual governments, policy decisions still require approval by a qualified majority of member states. And it is no secret that European countries are divided between doves and hawks.The doves are prevailing so far. These include rightwing, nationalist, Trump-friendly countries such as Giorgia Meloni’s Italy, countries such as Germany that are heavily exposed to trade with the US, and northern and eastern member states that fear Trump’s wrath on defence. Put together, they constitute a solid majority. So solid that if the US were to carry on bullying, the EU may continue bending to breaking point, perhaps going as far asloosening its digital regulations, which is arguably the real prize Trump is after. This genuflection to Washington would amount to a significant unravelling of European integration. And although rightwing EU governments share responsibility for the appeasement adopted so far, they would also capitalise politically on a bad deal, blaming “Brussels bureaucrats” for the damage.If, for instance, the EU ends up agreeing to a 15% or 20% US tariff base, plus higher sectoral tariffs – in other words a worse deal than the UK’s – it will be hard to argue that European unity has been a source of strength. Europe’s tilt towards nationalism and the far right is weakening the continent. As it does, it’s strengthening those far-right forces undermining Europe’s interest.Nathalie Tocci is a Guardian Europe columnistExplore more on these topicsTrump tariffsOpinionEuropean UnionEuropeDonald TrumpTariffscommentShareReuse this content"

Of course he does – and I’ll take a lie detector test to prove itArwa MahdawiHe may be insecure and lack any obvious qualifications, but he’s also extremely devoted to Donald Trump. And isn’t that what really matters?Tue 15 Jul 2025 08.31 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 12.09 EDTShare‘Once upon a time, in the land of the free, there lived a wizard called Kash the Distinguished Discoverer.” That piece of verbal wizardry is the opening line of a children’s book trilogy calledThe Plot Against the King(aimed at children aged three and above) by a Mr Kash Patel. The first book, published in 2022, is like Harry Potter for conspiracy theorists. Kash helps King Donald battle Hillary Queenton and a “shifty knight”, who have been spreading lies about the king working with the Russionians. In the final book in the trilogy (The Plot Against the King 3: The Return of the King) a couple of villains called Comma‑la‑la‑la and Baron Von Biden make an appearance.Not so long ago, publishing deeply weird books about the president while also promotingwild QAnon conspiracy theorieswould get you put on some kind of watchlist. Now it gets you a top job as the guy in charge of watchlists. Patel is not just a children’s book author; he is also the director of the FBI. His chief qualification for the role appears to be hisextreme devotionto President Donald Trump. He certainlydidn’t have any FBI experiencebefore getting the job as head of the agency.I don’t know if Patel suffers from impostor syndrome – a condition that normally afflicts overqualified women – but he does seem a tad insecure. Last week theNew York Times reportedthat Patel’s FBI has “significantly” increased its use of lie detector tests to screen employees for loyalty. According to the Times, some people have specifically been asked if they’ve ever been rude about their boss; “disparaging Mr Patel or his deputy, Dan Bongino … could cost people their job”. Woe betide the FBI underling who admits that they think Patel’s official photo onthe US Department of Defense website(which has beenmuch-memedonline) looks as if he’s just been caught smoking joints behind the bike shed and is trying his very best to act sober.Polygraph tests, which track physiological reactions (eg did your heart rate spike?) while you answer questions, arenotoriously unreliable. They can be successfully gamed by people who know how they work and are adept at controlling their bodily responses in high-pressure situations. You know, people like FBI employees. That said, it’s certainly possible that the FBI is secretly in possession of infallible lie-detecting technology (called something like WaterboardingAI™?).While Patel may come across as insecure, paranoid and generally doolally, he is notalwayswrong. In his 2023 opus Government Gangsters: The Deep State, the Truth, and the Battle for Our Democracy, which is written for “grownups”, he writes about how power works in Washington.“I regularly used to tell people that the fastest way to move up in the government is to just screw up, and the bigger the screw-up, the bigger the promotion,” he writes. “Every person implicated in your mistakes has an interest in covering up what they did, so they will promote you. That means the people at the very top are usually the most immoral, unethical people in the entire agency.” No comment there.Anyway, I think I’ve screwed up myself. Like a dimwit, I’ve just realised that all of the above might sound a tad disparaging towards Patel. Which, as a British-Palestinian on a green card that’s up for renewal, was certainly not my intention. So, just to clarify, Kash, I’ve been writing inEnglish-English. While American English tends to be blunt, the king’s English is a whole different kettle of fish.When we say, “That’s very interesting,”for example, we often mean it’s absolute tripe. When we say “quite good”, it means either that something was indeed quite good or that it was actually quite disappointing – you’ve got to read the room. Calling something “not bad”, on the other hand, often means it’s very good.And, of course, the British are also very fond of sarcasm, which Americans can sometimes miss. So, with thegreatestrespect, Mr Patel, I do not think you are an idiot. I think you are a “distinguished discoverer” and the greatestFBIdirector to ever walk God’s green Earth. And I’ll even take a lie detector test to prove it.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Up to 100,000 Afghans could have been placed at risk after a British soldier,according to the Times, sent the names of 33,000 people who supported British forces to a contact he hoped would help verify their applications for sanctuary in this country. The story behind these numbers is one of real people who had already been living in fear for years, and who have been treated abhorrently by the British state.As soon as it became clear that the information could fall into the Taliban’s hands and lead to these people and those close to them being targeted, the highly secret Operation Rubific was launched. This debacle occurred under the previous Conservative government, which obtained a superinjunction preventing several media organisations that were aware of the leak from reporting on it.The current government commissioned an independent review ordered by the defence secretary, John Healey, into the level of risk to those whose details are contained in the leaked database. It was carried out by the retired civil servant Paul Rimmer. He concluded that if the Taliban has acquired or does acquire this database it is unlikely to substantially change an individual’s exposure, given the volume of data already available.Today at noon, the superinjunction was lifted. This conclusion raises questions about why it was allowed to continue for so long.Until now the Afghans affected, reportedly 24,000 of whom have already been brought to the UK or will come in the future, were not aware of the full facts. Many more on the database remain inAfghanistanor in a precarious situation in neighbouring countries. Many who fled to Pakistan and Iran have been rounded up and sent back to Afghanistan, where they live in daily fear of being targeted by the Taliban, whether or not their names are on the leaked database.Immigration lawyers with Afghan clients had not been informed about the leak and were puzzled about why some of their clients who were seeking asylum in the UK were granted leave to remain outside the rules.Today it has become apparent why this happened: the government knew more than it was letting on about the very real level of risk some of these Afghans were exposed to.But much still remains unknown about today’s revelations – exactly who is affected, what is the likely risk to them and their families, and whether or not this information is already known to the Taliban.It isn’t the first time personal data relating to Afghans who worked with overseas forces in Afghanistan before the Taliban takeover in August 2021has leaked. One interpreter airlifted to the UK with his family soon after the takeover started receiving threatening messages from the Taliban on his Afghan number – he had brought his Afghan sim card with him for ease of communication with family members who remained in hiding.“It was terrifying to wake up in the morning, put my Afghan sim into my phone to pick up family messages and hear these threatening messages from the Taliban saying they knew where I was living in London and that my family and I were in danger,” he said.Rimmer’s findings are likely to give little comfort to the tens of thousands of Afghans who put their trust in British and American forces and worked with them for many years. Many were already living in fear. Not knowing whether or not their names are being viewed by the Taliban can only compound that feeling.Today the focus is rightly on the disclosure of the gigantic leak, but this bigger issue has been affecting many Afghans since the fall of the Taliban and will continue to affect them for many years to come. While responsibility to protect Afghans who put their trust in overseas governments does not lie with the UK alone, and should be shared equally between the countries that pulled out in August 2021, the truth is that many lives are now at greater risk because of the countries that hastily and chaotically abandoned Afghanistan.It is no coincidence thatin 2023 and 2024, Afghanistan was the top country of origin for people who had crossed the Channel in small boats. For them, the dinghy is the last-chance saloon when they have no other option to reach safety. Many want to come to the UK for the same reason British officials in Afghanistan sought them out: because they speak excellent or perfect English. But we have shut them out of the legal routes to arrive here, which are all now closed.Jamie Bell of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who has represented many Afghans, told me: “Not only did the government’s Afghan schemes not help who they were supposed to help, but administrative incompetence appears to have potentially put thousands at risk from the Taliban. This is a further betrayal of so many who were integral to western efforts in Afghanistan who have already been forced to wait years for a lawful relocation decision.”Today’s disclosures are an as-yet unquantifiable failure to Afghans who assisted us. But it is not the only failure. They will continue to try to reach the UK by irregular means because we have failed to protect them. While it is welcome that 24,000 people have been brought here, or are due to come here, many more are still living in danger. There is no sign of that changing any time soon.Diane Taylor writes on human rights, racism and civil libertiesDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The next day she develops a headache and vomiting. Then, as her hands grow cold, her parents take her to the local children’s hospital.Minutes after the child is triaged as lower priority, her mother tells the emergency department clerk that she is concerned about white patches in her daughter’s eyes. A junior doctor decides this can wait.One minute later, the child’s mother is back at the desk. This time, a nurse documents a high temperature and heart rate but doesn’t act. An hour later, the child can barely speak. A nurse acts. Two hours later, the child is dead.The diagnosis: fatal sepsis due to Streptococcus A, the same bacteria that causes strep throat and tonsillitis.The subsequentcoroner’s inquestin 2023 uncovers excruciatingly painful details and missed opportunities.On the night of the incident, one nurse was responsible for nine patients (a reasonable ratio is one to four) but sometimes two nurses were responsible forup to 60 patients. Combined with a shortage of other resources, disaster was waiting to happen.Contrary to assumptions, parents of sick children don’t cry wolf, they act judiciously and respectfullyFor their part, the parentsdescribedrepeated failed attempts to escalate their concerns, their anxiety for their child mixed with worry about “being kicked out of the hospital for being rude”. They described staff avoiding eye contact and seemingly not taking the spectre of a rapidly deteriorating child seriously enough.The whole ordeal was unbearable, so it was only a matter of time before several Indian professionals asked me what I intended to do, implying that also being Indian, I had an obligation to raise the uncomfortable issue of racism in healthcare. But given the string of omissions that resulted in the tragedy, I found it glib to attribute the entire occurrence to racism or unconscious bias – and indeed, no such allegations or findings were made during the inquest.I reflected on the question of what I should do as a parent who has experienced bothlossandmedical emergencies.When your child’s life hangs in the balance, or worse, that child dies, in that moment, there are no healing words, only noise. It was impermissible for anyone to say, “I know how you feel.”I also reflected on the question as a doctor who has made her share of errors. No matter how many inquests absolve the individual and implicate the system, the avoidable death of a patient is an intensely personal failing. It is a memory that clings to you, wakes you up in the middle of the night and humbles all but the most insight-less person.I didn’t write about the incident at the time, but the thought that gnawed at me was, “if only someone had listened to the parents”. Recently a group of Australian researchers has designed a pragmaticstudyto examine the relationship between parental concern for clinical deterioration and critical illness.Over a period of two years, across nearly 74,000 children younger than 19 presenting to a paediatric emergency department or inpatient unit, parents were asked one simple question: “Are you worried your child is getting worse?”Of the nearly 190,000 responses, just under 5% indicated concern for clinical deterioration. The first notable finding, therefore, was that contrary to assumptions, parents of sick children don’t cry wolf, they act judiciously and respectfully.The second sobering finding was that compared with patients whose parents did not have a documented concern, patients whose parents reported a concern were more likely to be admitted to intensive care, receive mechanical ventilation and die during admission. As if this were not lesson enough, parental concern was found to be more strongly associated with ICU admission thananyabnormal vital sign including abnormal heart rate or breathing, cardinal signs of deterioration relied upon by clinicians. In 19% of cases, parents reported a problem several hours before any vital sign abnormality.When the time comes to die, what end-of-life care would doctors choose for themselves? | Ranjana SrivastavaRead moreI had to read this multiple times to absorb the significance.It’s all very well to have bright rooms and fancy equipment but what is the most child-friendly thing of all? It’s to ask the parents if they are worried.If the findings can be replicated, this “intervention” will turn out to be blindingly simple and yet, potentially life-saving. This is the stuff of good medicine – cheap, effective, widely applicable.Coming from the world of adult medicine and geriatric oncology, what applies to sick children applies just as much to sick adults. Caregiver concern should be labelled a vital sign. But while we all know the importance of eliciting such concern, the truth is that it is commonly neglected.Now, there is evidence to insist on change – not just to record concern proactively but to build robust systems that respond quickly.As I wrote this column, I kept thinking of the bereft parents who don’t need a study to validate their bitter lived experience.No one can remedy their loss but the least healthcare professionals can do is pledge to patients and their carers to never again to put our assumptions before their instincts.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

What should be some of the very best places for nature are the absolute worst. Across vast tracts of some of our most beautiful landscapes, life is rapidly ebbing away. Where once there was purple heather, bilberry and buzzing insect life, there are now over-grazed, sheep-infested ecological disaster zones. For a nation of nature lovers, it’s a disgrace.One of the very worst areas is the Dartmoor commons. These exemplify everything that is wrong about England’s upland management. Ina recent Natural England surveyof Dartmoor’s protected sites, only 26 out of 22,494 hectares (55,583 acres) were found to be in an ecologically favourable condition – that’s 0.1%. All theblanket bogsand all the heathland surveyed are in an appalling state, and in many places these once wonderful habitats are in decline.On Dartmoor’s high moor, where there should be a diverse blanket bog, we see huge areas dominated by a single species –purple moor-grass. This hardy plant flourishes in degraded conditions, and is a wretched symptom of the historical extraction, erosion and drainage of the underlying peat, which was compounded by excessive burning and year-round grazing in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. This moor grass flourishes at the expense of peat-forming sphagnum mosses – the botanical engineers of healthy bogs. That legacy of intensive farming haunts us with the ghastly spread of impenetrable tussocks of moor grass as far as the rambler can ramble. Meanwhile, livestock –particularly sheep– continue to destroy what little heather moorland is left.This modern-day tragedy of the commons is the result of a land that has been pushed far beyond its ecological limits by the farmers and commoners who have rights over it. But this is also a national scandal – because it is the taxpayer, you and I, who pay for this destruction.Here is a hard, unpopular but simple fact: farming in this place does not make any money. According toa Duchy College Rural Business School reportin 2023, each ewe put on the Dartmoor commons loses its owner £16.90. And there are a lot of sheep. The only way these losses are maintained is through public subsidies. From the 1970s to the 1990s, farmers and commoners werepaid per headof animal – so the more you grazed, the more cash you got. Some sense prevailed in the late 1990s when the first nature schemes came in and public payments were made to actuallyreduce the numbers.The problem is that numbers were never reduced enough; the grazing rates ended up being an unscientific compromise. For instance, on the huge Forest of Dartmoor common, the higher-level stewardship scheme allows an average of 0.52 ewes per hectare. Ina Natural England 2020 studyof 25 years of schemes in the Lake District, the habitat response was universally good only where the stocking rates were below 0.4 ewes per hectare.View image in fullscreenSheep on the slopes of Cat Bells, a peak in the Lake District.Photograph: halbergman/Getty ImagesBut here is the greatest scandal. Over the past decade, more than £32m has been paid toDartmoorcommoners through higher-level stewardship schemes – schemes that exist specifically to improve nature on sites that should be protected by law. And guess what? Not one common has improved, and many have got worse.The government’s supposed regulator, Natural England, has tried to improve things. Back in 2023 it made a stand, being clear that if it was to agree to schemes being extended, it would need to see changesto those stocking rates. The backlash from the farming fraternity was wild, and a politically drivenindependent reviewsaw NE make anembarrassing climb-down. Public fundscontinue to be wasted, and the law isnot being enforced. That’s why an organisation calledWild Justicehas stepped up and secured a judicial review, which is being heard on 15 and 16 July. Our wish is that the Dartmoor Commoners’ Council adheres to its legal obligations and acts to reduce stocking rates to ensure the habitat recovers.It’s not even as if this land is contributing to food security. Grazing on Dartmoor falls withinthe least productive 20% of land, which produces less than 3% of the food produced in England. In short, the public is propping up an environmentally destructive, loss-making industry that makes a minimal contribution to the nation’s food supply, all while damaging Dartmoor’s greatest asset: its nature. It’s madness!We are in a planet-threatening climate and nature crisis; we cannot afford not to make positive changes now. We need the government’s newland use frameworkto lend weight to taking this minimally productive land out of any pretence of significant food production, and concentrating instead on its real potential for essential nature restoration. Dartmoor’s blanket bogs, for instance, are internationally scarce habitats that, if restored, can store carbon and help regulate the flow of water, thus reducing flood-risk downstream. We need to remove the sheep, restore and rewet the bogs, and then leave them alone. At the very least, the public should not be subsidising sheep grazing on the uplands.There are also some good farmers out there who want to do more to restore nature. If they put nature first, they deserve the public’s support to restore our uplands with more suitable animals and more sustainable practices that the local community and our national parks can be proud of. Those farmers who don’t want to change should be penalised for causing damage, not rewarded. Their destructive actions should be as illegal as dumping rubbish on protected areas or deliberately setting fires.The time for unjust compromises is over. We have to stop pouring millions into ecological collapse. Dartmoor and our other uplands are failing ecological systems propped up by wasting taxpayers’ hard-earned cash. If we truly care about nature, the climate, or even fiscal responsibility, we must stop funding failure and invest in healing: in carbon-binding peat, in wild and wonderful nature, in healthy landscapes that breathe life. Our uplands need a healthy future, and that future starts with change – radical, urgent and unapologetic.Chris Packham is a naturalist, broadcaster and campaignerExplore more on these topicsBiodiversityOpinionDartmoorFarmingGreen politicsConservationWildlifeEnglandcommentShareReuse this content"

There have been endless examples of this gruesome phenomenon in the past 21 months;Monday’s reporton the BBC’s scrapped documentary about the plight of children in Gaza is just the latest instance.Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone was a rare example of the unbearable experiences of Palestinians being properly investigated by Britain’s public broadcaster. But within the media, this documentary has become a bigger scandal than the suffering of Palestinian children.When a researcher named David Collier, who has written widely in defence ofIsrael, discovered that the 13-year-old narrator of the film, Abdullah, was the son of the deputy agriculture minister in Hamas’s government, all hell broke loose. After a deafening chorus of condemnation from pro-Israel lobby groups, British newspapers and the government, the documentary was taken off iPlayer.Monday’s review states that the failure to disclose this connection violated the BBC’s editorial guidelines, which stipulate that the corporation must “provide full transparency to its audience”. But it concludes that Hoyo Films, the independent production company that made the film, did not intentionally mislead theBBC. It says Hoyo’s view had been – rightly – that Abdullah’s father had a “civilian or technocratic” position within Hamas as opposed to a political or military role, and that it had simply “made a mistake” in not informing the BBC.Here is the crucial point. All of Abdullah’s words were scripted by the production company, since he was the narrator. The report “[does] not consider that anything in the narrator’s scripted contribution to the programme breached the BBC’s standards on due impartiality”, and found no evidence that Abdullah’s father or family influenced the script in any way. In other words, it was completely irrelevant who his father was.There was no substantial justification for taking this documentary off air. The immediate repercussions were that the young narrator and his family were inundated with abuse and harassment, with Abdullah declaring thatthe BBC was to blameif anything happened to him. Such fear is hardly baseless: thousands of children have been slaughtered by Israeli troops, including the 12-year-old Mohammed Saeed al-Bardawil,one of the few witnessesto Israel’s killing of paramedics and first responders in March.Caution has turned to cowardice – the BBC is failing viewers with its Gaza coverage | Karishma PatelRead moreIn the past few days, Israeli forces have killed Palestinian childrenwaiting to collect nutritional supplementsandothers waiting for water. The latter incident, they claimed, was a “technical error”. Is this the explanation for how one of the world’s most sophisticated militaries, with technologyallowing it to knowexactly who it is about to kill in its strikes, has plausibly killed tens of thousands of children sinceOctober 2023?Still, in Britain there is infinitely more scrutiny of this documentary than of these historic crimes. The culture secretary, Lisa Nandy, has even demanded to knowwhy no one has been sackedat the BBC after its decision to air the documentary. In Nandy’s upside-down world, a single detail in a documentary that exposes the killing of children should destroy careers. What about her colleagues who have supported the continued supply of military equipment for Israeli forces as they commit a livestreamed genocide?The media backlash against this documentary prompted the BBC to pauseanotherdocumentary, Gaza: Doctors Under Attack, which investigated Israeli attempts todestroy Gaza’s healthcare system(so far, this haskilled at least 1,580healthcare workers). The BBC pulled the film despite it having been approved at every level, with no factual objections to anything in it (the documentary was ultimatelybroadcast on Channel 4). According toBen de Pear, the documentary’s executive producer and a former Channel 4 news editor who wrote about the decision in the Observer, BBC script meetings were dominated by discussions about potential objections from Collier and the lobby group Camera. Collier’s pro-Israel social media output is instructive: he has written that “Jewish people have every reason to seethe Palestinian flagas a flag of genocidal hate”, and that “the Palestinian identity, and especially the ‘refugees’ were developed ONLY as a weapon against Israel”.The furore has been used to justify the idea that the BBC is biased against Israel, yet the exact opposite is true. In adamning report, the Muslim Council of Britain’s Centre for Media Monitoring found that the BBC gave Israeli deaths far more coverage in its articles when measured on a per-fatality basis – and using the overly conservative official Gaza death toll. The vast majority of emotive words, such as “massacre”, “atrocities”, “slaughter”, “barbaric” and “brutal”, were reserved for Israeli victims. Israeli voices were heard far more often than those of Palestinians. This has angered many within the BBC, too, who want to report fairly on the conflict: more than 100 have signed a lettercriticisingthe choice not to air Gaza: Doctors Under Attack.Meanwhile, the historic context for Israel’s crimes against Palestinians has been ignored and erased. The numerous statements of genocidal and criminal intent by Israeli leaders have barely been acknowledged. Like other western media outlets, the BBC has stripped Palestinian lives of their worth, ignored and whitewashed Israeli crimes and repeatedly treated Israeli denials of atrocities as credible, even when those denials are repeatedly exposed as lies.Morality has been turned on its head. The BBC must be perceived as pro-Israel, despite the overwhelming evidence of its crimes. The scandals must be reserved for documentaries about Palestinians, rather than the horrors those Palestinians endure. But here lies the problem. Thanks not least to the work of Palestinian journalists, much of the world has already witnessed the atrocities that are being committed by the Israeli state. They can see the mismatch between what they know to be true and what media outlets such as the BBC report.The BBC has alienated its natural supporters and is detested by the right because it’s a public broadcaster. Its journalistic failures in the Conservative years increasingly undermined faith in its editorial standards. Now, its failure to accurately report on the great crime of our age has only deepened that outrage.

Why are we expected to settle for this?Tue 15 Jul 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 07.38 EDTShareThere is a longstanding practice in UK politics and media to force disabled people to fight for their basic rights – a kind of gladiatorial scrap in which the Colosseum is replaced by the set of Good Morning Britain.With the government’s welfare reform billjust passed by MPs, this has felt all the more stark. In the last week alone, the leader of the opposition, Kemi Badenoch, hasused a speechto declare she does not “believe” that one in four people are disabled, as if the Equality Act were based on vibes. “Twenty-eight million people in Britain are working to pay the wages and benefits of 28 million others,” she went on. “The rider is as big as the horse.”Days earlier, GB Newsaired a discussionin which a comedian “joked” that the best way to reduce the disability benefits bill was to starve or shoot disabled people.Faced with this level of discourse, campaigners have little choice but to argue the most obvious of truths: if the political and media class advocates policies that leave disabled people hungry and dirty, the disabled community must explain why we should be allowed to eat and be clean.As the number of people with long-term health conditions has increased, the living standards that disabled people are expected to accept have only declined. That many of these cases are related to mental health –often incorrectly seenas mild, less real, or unaccompanied by physical conditions – has only encouraged this backlash.In the last fortnight, I have watched disabled activists go on breakfast news and argue that wheelchair users deserve help to leave the house. I’ve seen chronically ill people make reels on social media listing for strangers the intimate items they need disability benefits to pay for.I realise I’ve done similar in my work over the last 15 years: whether it is arguing for disabled people’s rightto sleep on unsoiled sheetsor – as of last month – to receive enough care tochange their bloodied sanitary towels.Disabled people have to prove our humanity on repeat, sharing ever more intimate details of our lives and bodies to prove ourselves worthy, not least of taxpayer money. Each time it happens, I can feel myself shrink and shift a little more. It is ironic – or telling – that the degradation reminds me of a disability benefits assessment.Such a political culture not only psychologically damages disabled people, it damages our ability to gain our full rights. Toni Morrison saidthe function of racism was distraction, and I think it is similar for ableism. The political cycle of the past decade – a government introduces a cut to disability support, much of the media argues it’s valid, a minority outlines why it isn’t – not only legitimises dismantling the safety net, it wastes disabled people’s time that we could be using elsewhere. If you are busy arguing that social care cuts shouldn’t force disabled people togo to bed at 6pm, there is little energy left to lobby for better access to pubs and restaurants, or simply to enjoy going to one.Whenever a politician or pundit suggests benefit claimants are splurging taxpayer cash on booze and fags, I tweet that I’m off to spend my personal independence payments on Moët. I do that partly because I like to give people a chance to call a Guardian columnist a champagne socialist, but mainly because I am increasingly exhausted by the confines of the conversation. Years of austerity measures coupled with media scapegoating – on top of existing structural inequality and attitudes – has in many ways reduced disability in the public consciousness to the lowest common denominator. Forget ambitions to hire more disabled talent in senior roles or to improve access to social and sporting venues – Britain prefers to discuss whether disabled people should be allowed to eat and go to the toilet.I recently published a book, Who Wants Normal?, in an attempt to carve out a nuanced look at disabled life: the joy, humour and talent alongside the pills and the prejudice. In promoting it, I chose to turn down any interview with a broadcaster who has a track record of ableism or go on a “pundit v pundit” format in which bigotry and equality are pitched as equal points of view. I have no interest at this point in debating whether disabled people deserve human rights, or in shying away from advocating for a rich and fulfilling life lest we appear ungrateful or angry.It is time this country focused not just on disabled people’s right to survive, but on their right to live. Rather than talking about cutting benefit rates, let’s explore raising them to a level where they actually cover thegrowing extra costs of disability. Instead of calling disabled jobseekers lazy, let’s discuss the real causes of disability unemployment:biased employersand alack of practical support and fundingin the workplace. Rather than further isolating disabled people, we could makepublic spacesand infrastructuremore accessible – because no one can be an equal member of society if they can’t get in their local shop or on the bus.There is a popular adage that says non-disabled people should care about such things because they could one day become disabled or ill themselves. That’s true. The pundits and politicians belittling disability today could, with just the hand of bad luck, wake up tomorrow with Parkinson’s or ME. But real progress won’t come from non-disabled people caring about disability rights because it might one day affect them – it will come from caring that it already affects someone else.Half the battle in all of this is challenging the unspoken belief that some of us – typically those with limited health, money or status – do not actually deserve the same quality of life as others who have more. Few people without disabilities in Britain would settle for an existence of food, heat and a wash. The question is: why should disabled people?Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist.

East Germans were insulted in the streets, shelters were attacked and children from the former GDR were bullied at school. There was a widespread fear that the weekly influx of thousands of people would overwhelm the welfare system and crash the housing and job markets. The public consensus? It needed to stop.That same year, Kathleen Reinhardt and her parents moved from Thuringia in the former GDR to Bavaria. She was in primary school, and her new classmates greeted her with lines such as: “You people come here and take our jobs. You don’t even know how to work properly.”View image in fullscreenKathleen Reinhardt, curator of the German pavilion at the 2026 Venice Biennale.Photograph: Georg Kolbe MuseumIt was a formative shock. Reinhardt, who was recently appointed curator of the German pavilion at the 2026 Venice Biennale, has an eye for imbalance, for what is missing, for who is not being considered. That she will representGermanyat one of the art world’s most prestigious exhibitions is – against this backdrop – not just remarkable, it’s historic.Thirty-five years after reunification, a different kind of German story is being heard. At a time of polarisation, when supposedly stable institutions and even the global order itself are faltering, figures such as Reinhardt – someone who understands “otherness” and has lived betweentwo worlds–are exactly what is needed. In her career, Reinhardt is known for going where things are uncomfortable, for entering terrain that is politically fraught or typically avoided by curators. She thrives in the difficult – and confronts it.Perhaps this is because she was born in a small GDR town in the early 1980s and was raised under socialism, but then grew up in Bavaria – the very embodiment of West German order. Reinhardt studied American literature (with a focus on Black writing), art history and international management in Bayreuth, Amsterdam, Los Angeles and Santa Cruz. She speaks four languages and holds a PhD on the American conceptual artist Theaster Gates. She has managed the studios of the South African artist Candice Breitz and the Kosovar artist Petrit Halilaj, and has curated high-profile exhibitions at the Dresden state art collections.In 2022, she became director of the Georg Kolbe Museum in Berlin. Located on a quiet, tree-lined street in what still smells like old West Berlin, the museum was once sleepy and conformist. But it now attracts curators, artists and critics with its radical reprogramming. Reinhardt’s exhibitions there aim to reveal ambivalences, focusing on fracture rather than polish.But it’s not just her CV that points to something worth noting about millennial Germans shaped by the GDR. I interviewed Reinhardt a few weeks ago, and I came away realising that women like her play in a league of their own. She wants to understand how it all connects – who we are today and the past we emerge from – while keeping a healthy scepticism towards grand narratives. That in itself feels almost avant garde in a time when stories from then and now are being instrumentalised, appropriated, bent or simply glossed over.View image in fullscreenThe Dancer’s Fountain by Georg Kolbe.Photograph: Georg Kolbe MuseumOn one of her first walks through the museum’s garden, Reinhardt encountered The Dancer’s Fountain by Georg Kolbe – a 1922 commission from the Jewish art collector Heinrich Stahl, who was later deported to Theresienstadt and murdered. The fountain had vanished during the Nazi era, resurfaced in the 1970s and was reinstalled with no explanation. At the top: a graceful, dancing female figure. At the base: stylised Black male bodies supporting the basin.Reinhardt’s reaction? She started to dig. Working with art historians and provenance researchers, she traced the fountain’s journey, uncovered records and identified a likely model whom Kolbe had used. She brought to light the complex and violent histories of the 20th century inherent in this object, becoming the first director in the museum’s 75-year history to refuse to look away.Earlier this summer, she invited Lynn Rother to the museum to take part in a panel discussion on provenance research, its current status and future potential. Like Reinhardt, Rother has an East German background. Born in 1981 in Annaberg-Buchholz, she now lives between Berlin,Lüneburg and New York. She is the Lichtenberg-professor of provenance studies at Leuphana University and the founding director of its Provenance Lab. Last year, the Museum of Modern Art in New York created a new position just for her: its firstcurator for provenance.Rother’s work is also about the stories behind objects. Who owned them? Who lost them – and why? Her research lays bare the darker infrastructures behind museum collections: looting, coercion, legal grey zones. She exposed thelargest art deal of the Nazi eraand now leads two major digital research projects backed by €1.8m in funding, exploring how machine-readable data can help trace – and eventually close – gaps in provenance.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Museums and the art market have benefited, directly and indirectly, from the tragedies of the 20th century. Some works in today’s collections were acquired through murky channels in moments of extreme horror. The great challenge of Rother’s work is to recognise and document those entanglements.You could say it’s a dirty job. Provenance researchers are seen as troublemakers. Their work sometimes leads to restitution, and with it, uncomfortable questions about national narratives and institutional pride. Rother’s team recently ran a computational analysis of provenance records and found a striking pattern: married women were systematically erased. Even when a work had belonged to a woman, her husband was listed as the owner. “That’s not a clerical error,” she said. It shows that structural discrimination and patriarchal mechanisms are just as present in the art market as anywhere else.Like Reinhardt, Rother has spent years inside global institutions. I haven’t shared their stories just to chart the rise of two exceptional women, but because it’s been a hard-fought road since German reunification in 1990. We, the women from the East, have come a long way. For years, we were ridiculed, overlooked and reduced to stereotypes. Even Angela Merkel was first seen as a quiet little girl, then branded aMutti, a motherly figure, a term simultaneously condescending and comforting and used to downplay her authority.But we’re no longer a punchline. Today, women from the East – not just in politics and culture, but now also in the global art world – hold some of the most influential positions. To me, the stories of Reinhardt and Rother show howexclusion and institutional rigidity can – slowly, painfully – become insight. How memory, for those shaped by the GDR, is rarely linear. And how power, when approached from the margins, can be exercised more critically, and with greater care.View image in fullscreenThe museum’s exterior.Photograph: Georg Kolbe MuseumIn Bavaria, Reinhardt often felt she wasn’t in – but not completely out either. “What I had was school. Education. That was my little step up.” Her parents, a factory worker and a utility clerk, provided support but no privilege. It was similar for Rother, who was driven from early on. After studying art history, business and law, she earned a traineeship at Berlin’s state museums in 2008. There, she came to see that it wasn’t only about hard work – her origins suddenly mattered.She was constantly asked: “Are you from East or West?” The hierarchy was obvious. Westerners ran the institutions. Eastern directors were deputies – at best. Even the art mirrored this: East German works were written off as second-rate.Both women have long rejected the patronising West German gaze. The “east”, Reinhardt argues, is not a special case, but a prism – a way to look at broader geopolitical lines and ask bigger questions about how we approach history and transformations in societies. Or in Rother’s words: “With artworks, labels matter. But we as people shouldn’t be bound by them.”What these women offer isn’t nostalgia. It’s clarity. A resistance to simplification. A belief that history is not a finished room. In Reinhardt’s office, there’s a poster that reads: “You don’t have to tear down the statues – just the pedestals.” Both of these millennials are doing just that – carefully, insistently, telling it all again. We need more like them.Carolin Würfel is a writer, screenwriter and journalist who lives in Berlin and Istanbul.

Making housing part of healthcare sounds radical, but international evidence and pilot programs show it could improve health outcomes and almost pay for itself in lower hospital bills within a few years.What does the evidence show?Other countries have run the experiment already.

It reported that the number of hospital admissions for respondents fell, while primary care visits rose. This is consistent with findings from previous studies and suggests that people had the stability to see a GP instead of waiting for a crisis.These results echo alandmark trialin Canada, which saved the public purse for every dollar spent – and even more when high-need participants were counted.Should housing be part of healthcare?We mayspend $1,500 a nightkeeping someone in an emergency ward, but balk at $70 a night to keep them in a studio flat with a visiting support worker.Here’s a bold proposal: make secure housing a Medicare item.Our health and housing systems sit in separate silos. The federal government funds Medicare, and states shoulder much of the social housing bill. A hospital can claim activity-based funding for a mental health admission, but not for preventing that admission with a rent subsidy.Give GPs the option to refer eligible patients.

When hospital admissions drop, the Treasury should return a slice of those avoided costs to the housing portfolio. Canada’s model found that every dollar invested saved money in health and justice spending for people with complex needs.What would it cost?Finland’s Housing First units average about15,000 Euros(about $26,000) a year each, including support. Roughly 38,000 Australians are stuck in what theAustralian Institute of Health and Welfare calls persistent homelessness. Because that number is measured over two years, about 18,000–20,000 people enter chronic homelessness each year. Funding 10,000 Housing First places would cover around half the annual flow, a practical first step. The NSW’s Together Home evaluation suggests emergency and inpatient savings alone could help foot the bill; factor in reduced policing, courts and ambulance use, and the program could get closer to net-positive within a parliamentary term.A call the government should not ignoreAustralia’s Medicare levy exists because we once agreed no one should skip the doctor for fear of the bill. The same logic should apply to housing.When a lack of secure shelter risks driving poor health outcomes, leading to increased health costs, refusing to fund evidence-based housing interventions makes little social or economic sense.If the Albanese government is serious about “getting bang for taxpayer buck”, one answer is a stable address.

But a staggering toll continues to mountTue 15 Jul 2025 13.40 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 14.11 EDTShareOn Sunday, an Israeli strike killed six Palestinian children – and four adults – as they queued for water in a refugee camp. The deaths of children may be the most terrible part of any war. It is not only the suffering of the innocent and powerless, and the unimaginable pain of surviving parents – as dreadful as those are – but the knowledge of lives ended when they had barely begun, of futures that should have stretched long into the distance severed in an instant.As shocking as Sunday’s deaths were, they are commonplace in Gaza: a classroom-worth of children have been killed each day since the war began. What marked them out was that so many deaths happened at once and publicly; and that Israel’s military felt obliged to acknowledge its responsibility – though without any great contrition. It claimed that a “technical error with the munition” caused it to miss its intended target and added that it “regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians”.What does this bloodless, bureaucratic language have to do with the bloody deaths of six already traumatised children? These deaths were not a mistake. They were a tragedy – like those of the 10 children killed days before, as theyqueued outside a clinic. The Israeli military said, again, that it regretted any harm to civilians. And yet the bodies of children pile up. Children killed as theysheltered in former schools; children killedas they fled Israeli forces; children killed as they slept at home.Gaza’s ministry of health says thatmore than 17,000of the 58,000 Palestinians killed are children. Israel says that it seeks to minimise harm to civilians. The death toll belies that and Israeli intelligence sourcestold reporters last yearthat at times they were permitted to kill up to 20 civilians to take out even junior militants – with the preference being to attack targets when they were at home, because it was easier.Those six thirsty children should not have needed to queue for water due to what the UN calls a human-made drought. Human Rights Watch believes that thousands of Palestinians have died due toIsrael’s deliberate pattern of actions to deprive them of water, which it alleges amounts to thecrime against humanity of extermination as well as acts of genocide. Those 10 hungry children should not have required nutritional supplements, but Israelcontinues to choke off aidand civilians are starving. Unrwa says that a tenth of the children screened in their clinics are malnourished.Tens of thousands of children have been seriously injured; many are amputees. As of February last year, around 17,000 had been identified asunaccompanied or separatedfrom their families. The very young are among those least able to cope with hunger and disease. How many will survive this conflict? How many will be able to remain in Gaza? How many will be able to live anything like a normal life one day? How many will see only vengeance or despair ahead of them?Meanwhile,Israeli parentscall for the hostage release and ceasefire deal that must end this conflict, and which Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted. Allies, including the EU and Britain, remain complicit in this war. They should ask themselves what they would do if their children faced for even one day what those in Gaza have endured for month after month.The children of Gaza have the same rights as children anywhere – to water, to food, to shelter, to education, to play, to hope, to joy. To life. Yet on Sunday, Israel killed Abdullah Yasser Ahmed, Badr al-Din Qarman, Siraj Khaled Ibrahim, Ibrahim Ashraf Abu Urayban, Karam Ashraf al-Ghussein and Lana Ashraf al-Ghussein.They were children. They were loved.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He explains why he needed to join them in the trenchesCharlotte HigginsTue 15 Jul 2025 10.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 13.18 EDTShareIt was in Sloviansk, in the rear of eastern Ukraine’s frontline, that I first met journalist and film-maker Mstyslav Chernov. It was the autumn of 2023 and he was telling me about the film that would later win him and his team an Oscar:20 Days in Mariupol, a horrifying documentary assembled from the news footage he and his team had gathered there, in the first month of the full-scale invasion. That September day of our interview, though – amid what would turn out to be Ukraine’s disappointing counteroffensive of 2023 – he was making his second film, one that took him to the heart of the combat zone, called 2,000 Meters to Andriivka. It is, if anything, even more powerful than its predecessor: a piece of frontline reporting that truly deserves the name, its footage gathered from soldiers’ own bodycams as well as from Chernov and his small crew on the ground among them. He puts the viewer into the trenches alongside the combatants. It is terrifying, bloody and heartbreakingly sad. You will not emerge from this film unchanged.The soldiers on whom Chernov focuses are members of Ukraine’s 3rd Assault Brigade. They have a mission: to liberate the village of Andriivka, in the Donetsk region, and hoist the blue-and-yellow flag above it. Their sole route to this village is through a narrow strip of forest with flat, open fields either side. The wood, with its sketchy cover, is both their protection and, in many cases, their grave. The painful, dangerous advance through this 2km provides the structure of the film. And yet, for all that the film borrows the conventions of a thriller for its propulsive plotline, it is its tenderness, both in its gaze and in the relationships between the men that it depicts, that really destroyed me.View image in fullscreenTight-lipped determination … paramedics attend to a wounded comrade.Photograph: Mstyslav Chernov/AP PhotoThis tenderness, this melancholia, is partly a result of what happened after the shoot, Chernov tells me: during the months of editing, most of the men he focused on were killed. In the film they do indeed raise the flag over Andriivka, or what was left of it, which was piles of abject rubble. But in 2024 it was lost again. And so 2,000 Meters to Andriivka may be a thriller of sorts. But on a deeper level, it is a lament and a memorial. “The film slowly became more about honouring memory, honouring names,” says Chernov. The news of the deaths trickled in while he was standing on red carpets for 20 Days in Mariupol. One reached him while he was in London picking up a Bafta. “There was always guilt,” he says, “there was always a feeling of the absurd to know what’s happening with those men and boys while I was experiencing the normality of the world outside Ukraine.”He talks about the Ukrainian premiere of 2,000 Meters to Andriivka, in Kyiv in May. The relatives of the dead men came. They had not seen the movie in advance. One of the characters, whose callsign, or military nickname, was Sheva, talks about his wife in the film. After the screening – which was followed by a 10-minute standing ovation – that woman came to Chernov, he says, and told him: “Thank you: now I will be able to show his grandson who his grandfather was.” He adds: “I could strip this film down to one basic meaning: which is of being able to salvage at least pieces of these people’s lives, for their families.”What is so touching about the moments in which we get to know Sheva is that he comes across as anything but conventionally heroic. He even asks Chernov to stop filming him: he hasn’t done anything worth recording yet, he says. But despite his evident fear, he is doing it anyway: which some might say is the definition of true bravery.View image in fullscreen‘These landscapes are part of our DNA’ … 2,000 Meters to Andriivka.Photograph: Mstyslav ChernovOne night in Kyiv, a Ukrainian friend asked me if I thought the film was anti-war. It is a good question. It is clear from Chernov’s work that he hates war – and he told me so, in so many words. But to call it anti-war would be a category error. It is true that there is absolutely no glory in 2,000 Meters. It is true that it dares to show us the pain of wounded men, their deaths, ordinary humans, who had ordinary jobs before the invasion, bleeding out for a few metres of Ukrainian soil. It is true that the men’s goal might seem futile – raising a Ukrainian flag over a pile of ruined houses is a strange kind of “liberation” for the village of Andriivka, which has become a mere name, rather than any kind of community. But Chernov shows deep respect and empathy for the fighters who, with tight-lipped determination, are trying to fend off Russia’s violent and pointless aggression. War came to them – to their homes, to their families, to their land – and they are having to fight it.I feel that I am in forests of Verdun 100 years ago, rather than next to my home townThe camera lingers on the breathtaking, big-skied landscapes of eastern Ukraine: expansive forests, glorious steppe, stretches of it burned and scarred by trenches and tanks beyond recognition. The film unfolds not far from Chernov’s native city of Kharkiv, 18 miles (30km) from the Russian border. “This is the landscape of my childhood,” he says. “This is what you see when you go to your grandmother’s village house, and then you run off to a field and steal some corn when you’re hungry, or play hide and seek in the forest with your friends. These landscapes are part of our DNA.” That connection was partly what made him and his crew take cameras and move among the fighters in the thick of the battle, at great risk to their lives. “This film could have existed purely in its bodycam form,” he says, “but it was incredibly important for me to actually walk on that ground, to experience those landscapes and to feel how they changed. To feel the pain and the anger and the surprise that I can’t recognise them any more, that I feel that I’m on another planet, that I feel that I am in forests of Verdun 100 years ago, rather than next to my home town.”Specific the landscape may be, but Chernov talks too about finding inspiration in the first world war paintings of Paul Nash – particularlyWe Are Making a New World, whose shell-pitted northern French landscape could be straight out of the Donetsk region. I am reminded, too, of another bleak painting in theImperial War Museum: Christopher Nevinson’sPaths of Glory. It shows two British soldiers face down, dead, in the forest. It was banned at the time by British censors: dead German soldiers were acceptable in a painting, but dead British soldiers were not. Chernov’s film, I am absolutely sure, would not have survived that kind of censorship. It is too raw, too tragic. It shows the death of Ukrainian men, though, after debates in the edits, the screen mercifully blacks out during the moments of oblivion – an effect akin to the way you can’t help closing your eyes in fear, Chernov says, when something explodes near you.The film has a deep moral purpose: it wants to show the reality of war, beyond the positive political speeches and the Ukrainian media’s “avoiding of difficult news”. “There is an acknowledged problem,” says Chernov, “and that’s probably the problem that’s troubling the Ukrainian soldiers the most right now. It’s not the lack of support by the US. It’s not the fact that Russia is clearly not prepared to finish this war. It’s not the fact that the soldiers [will] probably need to stay at the frontline for years and keep fighting and losing their friends. It’s the fact that part of Ukrainian society has distanced itself from the soldiers.”View image in fullscreen‘Ukrainian society has distanced itself from the soldiers’ … Mstyslav Chernov.Photograph: Julia Kochetova/The GuardianIt is true: spending time in Ukraine, it is clear this is a subject of deep national anxiety. People worry, with justification, how the gaps in experience between them – between those on the frontline, those with family members fighting, those who are refugees, those who have avoided the draft – will ever be stitched together. Chernov tells me about a special screening he held for soldiers that happened to be in an ordinary Kyiv multiplex, where the other visitors were eating popcorn and watching blockbusters. “I could see the faces of the soldiers that came out from the cinema after watching 2,000 Meters,” he says. “And they said to me, ‘Mstyslav, we want these people to go and see 2,000 Meters. We want them to know what we are going through.’”The film is, he says, all about distance. Those perilous 2km to Andriivka, of course, but also implicitly about “the 3,000km to Paris. About what Russian TV tells its own people: that it would take a Russian tank only 24 hours to get to the Bundestag. Or 20 minutes for a Russian nuclear missile to fly to London.” And the distance between the combatants’ beating hearts and the viewers of the film – which is zero.2,000 Meters to Andriivka is out on 1 AugustExplore more on these topicsFilmDocumentary filmsUkraineEuropefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Nick Hytner cast me in his production ofHenry IV Parts One and Two, with Michael Gambon as Falstaff. It was front-page news: the expectations on him were so ridiculous. And it didn’t quite work, at first.My central role was Westmoreland, but Nick had sort of amalgamated him with several boring lords, normally played by kindly old veteran actors, and “sexed” it up with a young cast. So as a young actor I had an assortment of funny little cameos, working with Gambon.Michael always played as if the most interesting person on the stage was the one he was talking to. His mission to corpse me, to just get something from me – a reaction, a laugh, whatever it was – was so alive in his eyes. And I’ve tried to do that ever since. I mean, sometimes you look into somebody’s eyes on stage and you’re looking into a void. But when Gambon found somebody that he could connect with, it was more fun than I’d ever imagined.In the recruiting scene in Gloucestershire, three-quarters of the way through, when Shakespeare really puts the brakes on the story, I was Francis Feeble, whom Falstaff enjoys calling a “woman’s tailor”. Nick had managed to coaxJohn Woodout of retirement to play Justice Shallow [meeting his old friend Falstaff]. I was too young really to understand the impact he had had on a certain generation of theatregoers. But there was always a gasp of excitement when he appeared.View image in fullscreen‘He stopped his insouciance and raised his game’ … Michael Gambon as Falstaff in Shakespeare’s Henry IV.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/the GuardianGambon was in his pomp, “the Great Gambon”, but John Wood scared the bejesus out of him. He was scary, the great intellectual Shakespearean with a famously quick temper. He was by then diminished with emphysema but still had astonishing power even when forced to use his falsetto. Gambon suddenly had to try hard. He stopped his insouciance and raised his game.Wood’s first line was two words, “come on”, repeated three times. You need a master to make use of that. It took maybe two minutes for him to say them. But an alchemy of connection happened. I could feel it at the back of the stage. Wood was doing absolutely nothing, not playing, absolutely trusting Shakespeare fundamentally. It was magnificent.We didn’t get great reviews. But the production rapidly became legendary in acting circles because Gambon became the Lord of Misrule, soaking backstage with water fights. It got to the point where I was permanently wet, we all were. Michael would throw a water bomb at me as I walked on stage. The poor actors in the building doing the other shows had to step through puddles. Gambon was Falstaff on and off stage, it was as simple as that, and we becamethe Rogues’ Company.That anarchy off stage made the show better. It’s horribly pretentious to say, but I think this was the spirit of Shakespeare’s company. There was this conviviality, this camaraderie. People were turning up to work early, leaving late, even hurrying their scenes to get back to the action.I also learned something that directors and producers and critics don’t want to know about – which is that productions evolve, especially during the “little hiatus” in aNational Theatreproduction while another show is opening. In ours, Richard Harris had just died and Gambon had got the Dumbledore gig. So the production company flew him out to America and he had new titanium gnashers fitted.‘Delicate, dangerous, anarchic’: Daniel Craig, Michael Mann, Matthew Macfadyen and more remember Michael GambonRead moreWhen he came back, he suddenly had these brilliant teeth. We heard lines that had been indistinct the first time, when we had thought he didn’t know his lines. We took 20 minutes off the show, which is unheard of, because he had become so distinct and clear. For the final three weeks you saw an astonishing piece of work.Elliot Levey is in Giant at theHarold Pinter theatre, London, until 2 AugustAs told to Lindesay IrvineExplore more on these topicsStageThe play that changed my lifeTheatreNicholas HytnerMichael GambonNational TheatreWilliam ShakespearefeaturesShareReuse this content"

With that holy grail of British history, the Bayeux tapestry, about to belent by France to the British Museum, we could say the same. In 1885,Elizabeth Wardleof Leek, Staffordshire, led a team of 35 women in an extraordinary campaign to embroider a meticulous, full-scale replica of the entire early medieval artwork. With Victorian energy and industry they managed it in just a year and by 1886 it was being shown around Britain and abroad.View image in fullscreenNo mean feat … photograph of Elizabeth Wardle stitching.Today that Victorian Bayeux tapestry is preserved in Reading Museum, and like the original, can beviewedonline. Are there differences? Of course. The Bayeux tapestry is a time capsule of the 11th century and when you look at its stitching you get a raw sense of that remote past. TheLeek Embroidery Societyversion is no mean feat but it is an artefact of its own, Victorian age. The colours are simplified and intensified, using worsted thread, as Wardle explains in its end credits, “dyed in permanent colours” by her husband Thomas Wardle, a leading Midlands silk dyeing industrialist.The Wardles were friends with the radical craft evangelist William Morris – a clue that Elizabeth’s epic work of replication should be seen as part of the Victorian passion for medieval history that encompassed everything from neo-gothic architecture to Walter Scott’s novel Ivanhoe and Morris’s Kelmscott Chaucer – in which the poems are illustrated with woodcuts. In this Victorian dream of the past, sympathies were very much on the Saxon side. The Norman conquest was seen as a national tragedy in which traditional Anglo-Saxon freedoms were crushed by the “Norman Yoke”. It’s ironic that this underdog version of British history, with brave Saxons defying the wicked conquering Normans, prevailed at a time when they were themselves conquering or colonialising much of the planet. That immigrant Victorian Karl Marx wrote that when people are “revolutionising themselves and things … they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service, borrowing from them names, battle slogans, and costumes”. This perfectly describes 19th-century Britain, which hid its creation of modern industrial capitalism in medieval styles. And when it came to reproducing theBayeux tapestry, it was a new technology that made it possible – photography.View image in fullscreenVictorian replica of the Bayeux tapestry housed in Reading Museum, Berkshire.Photograph: David Gee/AlamyWardle and her team based their embroideries on what was considered at the time a nationally essential photographic project. In the 1870s, the British government itself commissionedJoseph Cundallto photograph the entire Bayeux tapestry. You can picture his intrepid expedition setting out by the boat train with red-coated soldiers to guard the camera and a team of bearers. A Ripping Yarn.Cundall’s monochrome photographs were hand-coloured by art students back in Britain – and censored. Like other medieval art, including manuscripts illuminated by monks, the Bayeux tapestry has a plenitude of monsters and obscenities in its marginalia, including male nudes with graphically depicted penises. One naked man stands with a flamboyant erection, which may be part of the tapestry’s realism about the psychology of war. When the Leek Embroidery Society borrowed a set of Cundall’s photographs, they of course copied the false colours and underpants from these supposedly objective recordings.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Cundall created his own continuous photographic replica, mounted on two ornate wooden rollers so that you can scroll through it in your private library. Perhaps this is what its most recent private owner, the late Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts, used to do. When his estate went on sale his “tapestry” got much less attention from the media than other treasures such as his first edition of The Great Gatsby. But it was sold for £16,000 – to the Bayeux Museum in Normandy. At least in Bayeux it’s in safe hands, just as the original has been for at least 600 years.Explore more on these topicsArt and designTextile artBayeux tapestryPhotographyArtfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It was 2008, pre-Hardy and Hiddleston, post-Bale and Grant;Jim Sturgesswas a rising star and the latest handsome young Brit to break Hollywood. Having landed the lead role in casino thriller 21, Sturgess needed a love interest: cue a slew of chemistry tests with a roll call of beautiful young women, a process Sturgess remembers now as “the most exposed blind date you could ever possibly put yourself through, with five producers watching you from afar”.Kate Bosworth got the role, but one actor lingered in Sturgess’s mind: an effervescent Australian calledTeresa Palmer. “When you do those chemistry tests, they put you through it, so we spent the whole day together,” Sturgess says. “I was really hoping she was going to get the part, because we got on really well. She’s Australian, I’m English, and we were both in Hollywood going, ‘Where the hell are we?’”Palmer didn’t get the part, but Sturgess never forgot her. And, almost 20 years later, Sturgess and Palmer have been reunited – for Mix Tape, a wistful romantic drama about two people who reunite after 20 years apart.Told in four one-hour episodes (you’ll wish it was much, much longer), Mix Tape follows two teenagers, Dan and Alison, as they woo each other with letters and mix tapes in 1980s Sheffield (which means we get some amazing needle drops: the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Cure, Joy Division). Guileless young Dan (Rory Walton-Smith) is completely smitten, but Alison (Florence Hunt) is guarded, desperately trying to hide her difficult family life at home. When she suddenly disappears – for reasons revealed much later – Dan is completely heartbroken.View image in fullscreen‘I never forgot her’ … Sturgess with Teresa Palmer in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/SuboticaSturgess, now 47, plays adult Dan: a music journalist who never left his home town and, despite being married, never really moved on from his first love. When he discovers Alison (Palmer) is now a bestselling author living in Sydney, he sends her a friend request online. Letters and cassettes are swapped for Facebook messages and Spotify playlists, but the feelings remain the same.Palmer tells me Sturgess is “the kindest, warmest, coolest, most effortless actor I’ve ever worked with. And that dudereallyhas great taste in music,” she adds. “He is that character – he is the real deal.” Before filming even began, Sturgess and Palmer were sending each other playlists, with Sturgess putting her on to UK rappers like Kano, Dizzee Rascal, Ocean Wisdom, Little Simz. “It was just like the show,” he says. “Twenty-odd years later, we were reconnecting.”In his 20s, Sturgess made his name as the romantic lead in the Beatles musical film Across the Universe and opposite Anne Hathaway in One Day, but he has spent the past few years in roles that require guns and running – thinkHard SunandGeostorm. But Sturgess is made for this work, with his crinkly eyed smile and soft eyes. Last year was all about “rodent boyfriends” – well, you can take yourMike Faist, because Sturgess is the OG rodent boyfriend, with a face particularly suited for yearning.“I’ve been working on my yearning,” he laughs. “I’m actually very attracted to romance stories, more so as I get older. They’re just so human – it’s literally two people navigating their feelings and their emotions, which is really beautiful and interesting.”Mix tapes were a “big, big part” of how Sturgess wooed girls. “It works!” he laughs. “A mix tape was a really big deal back then! That was why I was so attracted to young Daniel – I was that guy!” As a teenager, he was obsessed with US hip-hop and guitar bands from Northern England; he vividly recalls listening to the Stone Roses on his Walkman while delivering newspapers. “That’s what’s so beautiful about Mix Tape – it is about that period when you first fall in love, when you first hear music,” he says. “Your receptors are just so wide open and everything is so important to you. And that’s why, when people ask you what your favourite band is, you’ll probably say what your favourite band was when you were 16.”View image in fullscreenEstates of desire … Sturgess with Cara Delevingne in the spectacular box office flop London Fields.Photograph: Steffan Hill/Head Gear Films/AllstarSturgess had a hand in choosing the music used in Mix Tape and even taught Walton-Smith and Hunt how to make mix tapes on cassette: “It blew their minds. They were like, ‘This is an art form. And this is a lot of work!’” he laughs. “I was explaining to them how you couldn’t just get the music off the internet – you had to own it, all your mix tapes came from what was in your collection. They couldn’t believe it.”Director Lucy Gaffy let Sturgess in on the audition process for young Dan; they picked Walton-Smith, a complete newcomer who will be in everything soon. “There was a real gentleness to Rory that some of the other actors didn’t bring,” says Sturgess. “He’s got that natural Northern swagger and charm to him. And it was his first job! He was so wide open and desperate to learn. Beautifully inquisitive. He was brilliant. I’m really proud of what he’s done.”When Sturgess was his age, he was too afraid to ask for help: “I was dropped in at the deep end.” He never formally trained as an actor, but he got the bug as a six-year-old when he was cast in a production of Wind in the Willows. “I was not very good at school. I struggled to concentrate … I was slightly tarnished with the naughty brush. But I just took to [acting]. I still remember the sense of community, of making something together – which I still crave now.”View image in fullscreenSturgess with Anne Hathaway in One Day.Photograph: Focus Features/Sportsphoto/AllstarWhen he was cast oppositeEvan Rachel WoodinAcross the Universe, Sturgess was propelled to international stardom. “I didn’t really know what I was doing. I was just a kid from England, playing in bands – and suddenly this movie thing happened. Everything changed quite quickly. I didn’t really understand how to navigate myself through all that. I didn’t have anybody guiding me. I’d be invited to these big parties, but I would always not go. It was a bit scary, it feels a bit mad.”Over the years, he’s been in the very good (Cloud Atlas), the worthy of reappraisal (Across the Universe – “I feel like if it came out now, it might have done all right,” Sturgess muses), and the very bad (London Fields, a spectacular box office flop overshadowed by the subsequent tawdry trial between his co-stars, Johnny Depp and Amber Heard). He’s passed on some big opportunities (playing Spider-Man on Broadway) and said yes to much smaller parts that made him happy. If anything, he’s learned to focus on the experience of making something, rather than the reception: “It’s such a rollercoaster ride … If your end goal is just to have it be well received and get all the admiration that might come with that, you’re going to fall over a lot. You’re going to trip yourself up. If it is well received, that’s the icing on the cake. I don’t really read reviews. I just don’t. I’m not trying to hide from them or anything. I’m just never that interested. If I read a bad one, I’ll probably agree, you know? Fair enough!”View image in fullscreen‘My face was plastered all over Vegas’ … Sturgess with Kate Bosworth in the 2008 casino thriller 21.Photograph: Columbia/Sportsphoto/AllstarAt the premiere for that casino film 21, which was held in Las Vegas, he remembers his face was plastered across billboards on the Strip, on the blackjack tables at the hotel and even on his room key. What is his relationship with fame now? “It is easier,” he says. “I was definitely more famous when I was younger and, sometimes, I wish I’d enjoyed it a bit more. But I shied away from fame a lot. I had it at an arm’s length. And, looking back, I think I would have got more out of it if I opened myself up to it and embraced it, if I wasn’t quite so wary of it all.” Now, he is recognised “just enough that I’m quite flattered when it happens”.These days, Sturgess is performing music under the monikerKing Curiousand his next film will be4 Kids Walk Into a Bank, alongside Liam Neeson and – you guessed it– Teresa Palmer, who plays his girlfriend again. Is this what they’re doing now, a la Fred and Ginger, Kate and Leo, Hanks and Ryan? Sturgess laughs. “If you could just find somebody you got on with and kept making relationship movies … well, I’d be down!”Mix Tape is on BBC Two andiPlayerin the UK.

He and co-star Edward Bluemel discuss bust lips, hot pants and queering the Bard’s storyTue 15 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 06.48 EDTShare‘Ithink of it as a very sexy, dangerous game of Elizabethan cat and mouse.” Ncuti Gatwa is describing his new project with theRoyal Shakespeare Company, a two-hander about William Shakespeare and fellow playwright Christopher “Kit” Marlowe. In Born With Teeth, Will and Kit collaborate on a play about Henry VI – for “collaborate”, read flirt, fight and ruminate betrayal.Gatwa plays Marlowe and Shakespeare is Edward Bluemel; the pair last worked together on TV’s Sex Education. Bluemel followed that series about horny teens with playing a vampire (A Discovery of Witches), an MI6 agent (Killing Eve) and a brooding lord (My Lady Jane), while Gatwa was cast as one of the Kens in the Barbie movie and starred in a little thing called Doctor Who.Sitting on a sofa just before rehearsals begin, they make amiable, nicely contrasted figures. Gatwa with cropped hair and tight white T-shirt, his bangle and ring shining gold. Tousle-haired Bluemel in black, silver rings in ear and on finger. He’s eager and chatty; Gatwa seems more guarded, until his laugh explodes seemingly out of nowhere.View image in fullscreen‘A gift of a job’ … Gatwa in Doctor Who.Photograph: BBC Studios/Bad Wolf/Dan FearonA note from playwright Liz Duffy Adams in the Born With Teeth script says that the actors’ ages or looks don’t matter, “as long as they are wildly charismatic”. I have to ask: do they feel well cast? They guffaw, and Bluemel leans forward. “I’m here to break it to everyone that you, Ncuti, are wildly charismatic.”So who are these characters? “It’s fascinating to dig into these men who were more than likely queer in different ways,” says Bluemel. “Marlowe wears his heart on his sleeve – plays like Edward II are brazen and brave depictions of queer love. Shakespeare is scared – he wants to talk about things, but via ancient Rome or picturesque Ephesus.” In the play, Will avers, “I want to hide in my work, like an outlaw in the forest.” Kit derides his colleague as “careful Will, who won’t”.How sincere is a snog? A question I ask myself after every snog …Marlowe, Gatwa declares, “dances with danger”. The play leans into his supposed career as an agent of Elizabethan spymasters, and the peril that brings for everyone in his orbit. Mistrust lends the dialogue an erotic shimmer – and neither knows who is being played. “How sincere is a snog?” grins Bluemel. “A question I ask myself after every snog …”Drama thrives in history’s gaps. Adams has Kit scorn research for their Henry VI play: “Sources?Are we to take direction from historians?” Gatwa doesn’t share that sentiment himself, but mentions a note from Daniel Evans, their director: “All that research is not going to teach you how to act the characters.” Even so, they enjoyed a research week, “getting under the skin of that world, which doesn’t feel too different from the world we’re in now.”It’s certainly a rollicking read. “It starts fast, and they’re deep into each other’s lives, unpicking each other,” Gatwa says. “When we first read the play there was a lift-off, it’s so human – their attraction to each other, their jealousy and insecurities.”Adams drops “some real deep cuts, lots of Easter eggs” for the drama nerds, says Bluemel. “There’s some beautiful passages. If you set yourself the challenge of writing dialogue for Marlowe and Shakespeare, you’ve got to write pretty gorgeous stuff, which Liz has. The play is rooted in history, but so much is exciting, fun conjecture – where we as actors can really enjoy ourselves.”View image in fullscreen‘Much more comfortable on stage’ … Bluemel with Amy Morgan in 2017’s Touch.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianEnjoying themselves on stage is what these actors signed up for – they’d both originally imagined theatre careers (“then TV got its greasy mitts on you,” teases Bluemel). Shuddering, Gatwa summons his training for screen acting. “Do you remember the first time you saw yourself on camera? Horrible.” Bluemel, who dreamed of “performing Shakespeare in a National Trust garden”, still feels “much more comfortable on stage – maybe because I can’t watch myself”.He hasn’t performed in Shakespeare since a student attempt in Cardiff as Leontes in The Winter’s Tale, though “I always have my ears pricked up to do some Shakespeare”. Gatwa followedMercutio in Romeo and Juliet in Manchesterwith Emma Rice’s riotousA Midsummer Night’s Dream at Shakespeare’s Globe. A more recent retooled classic was the National Theatre’s audaciousThe Importance of Being Earnest. “It was chaos every single night,” he beams. “Delicious, delicious chaos.” Rather like Born With Teeth, he says, the show brandished a queer subtext that was hiding in plain sight. “In academic conversations, there’s a tendency to play that stuff down. It was nice to bring it out to the forefront.”Kit and Will were provincial lads who flourished in London. How about the actors playing them? Gatwa would travel up for auditions on the overnight bus from Glasgow (“Thirty quid!”). He waxes nostalgic: “Megabus Gold, I loved it. You sleep all night, get into Victoria Station, brush your teeth and head off to your audition.” He tried out for a role in Shakespeare in Love in theWest Endjust after being attacked by three strangers on his way home from a nightclub. “I had just gotten jumped, and had big problems with my mouth,” he says, recalling the swelling that went on to explode during his meeting. “I was in the audition for flipping Sonia Friedman [the leading impresario] and it popped. I left in the worst mood, but got the job.”In Gatwa’s words, “the best actors are all working at McDonald’s”. The line between making it and not can feel arbitrary. “A lot of right place, right time, and parts that lend themselves to you as an actor,” Bluemel confirms. “I always think: if I was the casting director, would I cast me in this? Sometimes the stars align.”The Time Lord in the room is, of course, Doctor Who, the role that Gatwa has just relinquished after two not-uncontroversial seasons. Few roles are such magnets for unfiltered opinion – has he managed to tune out the chatter? “I’m quite good at shutting the noise out,” he says. “It’s loud. But it’s very cool and exciting to be in the middle of this huge thing – there’s haters, there’s lovers, it’s all going on. It is an absolute gift of a job, and a gift of a community. The Whovians are so deeply in my heart, I can’t tell you.”View image in fullscreen‘Delicious chaos’ … Gatwa as Algernon in The Importance of Being Earnest.Photograph: Marc BrennerQuite apart from the challenge of making the character your own, is there any coaching for the attention around the series? “Yes, there was, but I don’t think it can ever prepare you for what it feels like. They put security outside my mum’s house, my brother’s house, and I would say: what could possibly be the need?And then the need comes.” Only someone who has stood at the eye of this storm can understand it. “I was just at Glastonbury and bumped into Matt Smith in a club,” he adds, “and we had great, deep chats about that job and how there’ll never be another like it in our lifetimes. We’ll never work that hard again. Never be as stimulated and stretched. It’s also very exhausting, so it’s lovely to delve into other projects.”Bluemel’s roles too attract a fair degree of attention. So is there an ideal level of fame: offering opportunities but protecting you from intrusion? “My ideal is to work on good stuff and make a living from it,” says Bluemel. “Some of those big jobs, from a professional point of view, might be amazing, but at what cost? It changes people’s lives irrevocably.”As a student, Gatwa was a go-go dancer at one of Glasgow’s “pivotal gay clubs. They had these shower cubicles that were open to the club. I would dance in the showers in a pair of hot pants and next morning wake up and work on sonnets.” Is dancing good for confidence? “You need a lot of front – or a lot of shots! Yes, it was good for confidence, chatting to different people every night. Go-go dancing sets you up for life!”Born With Teeth may not require hot pants, but it has required both actors to let go of some inhibitions. Movement directorIra Mandela Siobhanprescribed some initial trust exercises. “When someone’s falling into your arms, lifting you up, throwing you around, a trust builds,” Gatwa says. “There’s all sorts of push and pull,” adds Bluemel – the performance will involve “a high adrenaline vulnerability”.Gatwa needs the bathroom, so we wrap up, giving Bluemel the last word on Born With Teeth. “It feels modern and current,” he says. “A clash of ambitions, jealousy, romance – ultimately, two very complicated people who can’t decide what they think of each other. I hope it feels like a horny Elizabethan whirlwind.”Born With Teeth is atWyndham’s theatre, London, 13 August until 1 NovemberExplore more on these topicsStageTheatreWilliam ShakespeareChristopher MarloweNcuti GatwaWest EndRoyal Shakespeare CompanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Rather than walk back down the several flights he’d already climbed, he drunkenly decided to jump all the way down to the reception level. When he regained consciousness, a bemused Courtney Love was staring down at his prone body. As was an irate hotel manager, who swiftly barred the band from staying there for years, before the crumpled musician was scooped up to go and spend a few days in hospital.It was not easy to get barred from the Columbia hotel, but Radio 4 were not the only ones who managed it. Once, at 6am, members ofOasisdecided to throw all the furniture in the bar out of the window, piece by piece. When items landed on the hotel manager’s Mercedes, the band had to scarper before the police arrived. It played such a significant part in Oasis’s story that Noel Gallagher wrote a song in tribute to it, Columbia, based on his escapades there back when he was a roadie for Inspiral Carpets.“It was rock’n’roll central,” says Inspiral Carpets’ Clint Boon. “The coming and going in the car park was amazing. All these minibuses of bands pulling up. I remember Noel heckling Paul Weller one time.” For working-class kids from Manchester, it was a big deal to be suddenly surrounded by idols. “To see Noddy Holder in the bar was like ... we’ve arrived,” says Boon. “We just stood around him in awe. Noel would have been with us in that gaggle of excited young northerners, and ultimately went on to cover one of Noddy’s songs,” Slade’s Cum on Feel the Noize.Oasis: Columbia – videoThe Columbia – located in leafy west London in Grade II listed Victorian townhouses across from Kensington Gardens – was known for its cheap rooms, flexible bar opening hours in a time well before 24-hour licenses, and its look-the-other-way attitude. It became a go-to spot for musicians in the 1980s when Liverpool outfit the Teardrop Explodes started staying there. “We had some wild parties and mad drug-taking,” says David Balfe, who played keyboards in the band. “The staff seemed quite philosophical about it – I presumed they weren’t getting a lot of business.”Word quickly spread. “Bands at the time had difficulty finding hotels that were relaxed as to the peculiarities of their behaviour,” says Balfe. “So suddenly everybody was staying there: Soft Cell, ABC, Depeche Mode.” Soft Cell’s Marc Almond practically lived there between 1982 and 1983, and in his autobiography he recalled it as a “bohemian gathering of musicians, bands and hangers-on” and a “who’s-who of the early 80s music scene”. He paints a stand-offish scene in the breakfast room populated by the Human League, Talk Talk and Kajagoogoo. “Every morning we all sat there, trying to be more aloof than one another,” he wrote. “Buttered toast and disdain.”Unusually, the Columbia outlasted its first flush of fame and continued to be a buzzy place for decades. It was such a magnet for groups that celebrated photographer Mick Rock would hang around looking to discover new bands to shoot. “In the 90s it becametheplace to descend on, after hours, irrespective of whether we knew anyone actually staying there,” says music publicist Andy Prevezer. “The historical importance of that place should not be overlooked. To this day I go past it and feel an almost irresistible urge to go into the building and misbehave.”View image in fullscreenColumbia denizens … from left: Marc Almond and Dave Ball of Soft Cell.Photograph: LJ Van Houten/ShutterstockNot everyone has such fond memories though. Miki Berenyi of Lush remembers it as being filled with “tame and boring conversations” and finding the place “a bit dismal”. The Auteurs’Luke Haineswent one further in expressing his dislike of it. On the 1996 song Tombstone he sings “taking out the garbage at the Columbia hotel / We’ll take the fucking building out, Baader Meinhof style.” The Columbia was, Haines says, a “signifier of everything I thought was crap at the time: boring cliched rock’n’roll behaviour, boring rock bands who thought they were the Faces, but who were about to be dropped after their first single on London Records.”Haines has one fond memory of hanging out with the late Grant McLennan of the Go-Betweens there, but for him it’s largely a place fogged with regret. He says heading there would seem like a good idea in a taxi over, but then you would end up “sitting with some sweating random bass player you had never met before and hoped to never meet again, drinking lager until you both passed out. It was the natural endgame of what went on backstage: getting drunk and taking drugs with people you don’t like and having awkward conversations.” For him, it holds no comparison to other mythologised hotels. “New York had the Chelsea Hotel, which was a dump, but a glamorous dump, where you might run into Jackie Curtis, Jobriath or Alan Vega,” he says. “London had the Columbia where you’d end up stuck in a conversation with a marketing manager from East West records or a session player for Babylon Zoo.”View image in fullscreenNot a fan … Miki Berenyi of Lush.Photograph: Martyn Goodacre/Getty ImagesNevertheless, the bands and industry people kept coming. Balfe even held his wedding reception there. “It was the only hotel that meant anything to me in London,” he says. Publicist Steve Phillips recalls having to climb a drainpipe to get back in one night after being booted out for something or other, so keen was he for the party to continue.Despite its reputation – with documented stories of open sex and drug use in public areas – the manager during these wild years refuted it. “If we’re known as the rock’n’roll hotel I don’t know why,” Michael Rose, known for smoking a pipe and wearing a suit at all times, said in a radio documentary. “It’s a family-run hotel. It is a Victorian building and we try as far as possible to leave that Victorian atmosphere in it. We are a conservative family and I don’t think any of us have any interest in pop music whatsoever.”Clint Boon creases up when I mention this. “I don’t remember any Victorian values,” he laughs.The party continued well into the new millennium. “It was like a rock’n’roll frat house,” says Karen Ruttner, a music industry veteran who spent the early 2000s staying and partying there, along with the likes of the Strokes, Interpol,Kings of Leonand the Killers. “I was young and wide-eyed and loved the movie Almost Famous and all those old stories of bands hanging out together causing chaos. That was how I dreamed things in the music business would be, so to see it actually unfolding in front of me was like: wow, this stuff actually happens.”View image in fullscreenBath time … from left: David Keuning, Brandon Flowers, Ronnie Vannucci, Mark Stoermer of the Killers.Photograph: Rob Verhorst/RedfernsTwo of those bands almost came to blows at the Columbia. When Interpol’s black-clad bassist Carlos Dengler poked fun at Kings of Leon for looking like Lynyrd Skynyrd, as they shuffled around smoking weed in their bell bottoms with big moustaches, the band’s drummer Nathan Followill struck back. “We were like, ‘You vampire-looking motherfucker, we will break this bottle and cut you,’” he said in the scene oral historyMeet Me in the Bathroom.The Killers stayed there on their first UK tour, sharing rooms and a bathtub to puke in: they were not used to the levels of excessive drinking that took place at the bar that never closed. “Time seemed to start slowing down when you got through the entrance and eventually it stopped entirely if you stayed long enough,” recalls Conor McNicholas, NME editor at the time. “I remember everyone just slipping endlessly towards an alcohol coma.”‘Without a parka, I’ll look like an idiot’: Oasis fans’ fashion at the reunion tourRead moreTastes finally changed in the mid-to-late 2000s and bands began to go elsewhere. Today, the Columbia has had a refurb and while it now happily trades off its storied history, it’s no longer an anything-goes playground for the sleepless and inebriated. Similarly, cultural changes have taken hold: such excessive alcohol and drug consumption has lost its charm for many younger bands. And of course nobody is celebrating how tortured hotel staff had to clean up after entitled people trashing stuff for kicks. But, for some, the Columbia feels like a symbol of a pre-smartphone past. “As a participant in that madness, you were almost invisible,” says Boon.For Ruttner, it was a chance to peek into a world that she feels has since vanished. “The biggest thing that’s been lost in the age of social media, apart from privacy, is mystique,” she says. “There was a period when musicians had such a curated image that you only knew what they wanted you to know or the music press told you. That’s what made them so exciting, forbidden and sexy. The Columbia was an embodiment of that bygone rock’n’roll era: of icons hanging out together, being messy, and getting into trouble.”Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockIndieLondonOasisLuke HainesInterpolfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But then his life fell apart. Anthony Kavanagh talks about sex work, addiction and the years he spent being forced to hide his sexualityTue 15 Jul 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 08.01 EDTShareNobody could say that Anthony Kavanagh does not know how to laugh at himself. The day he was fired from his record label, he trudged across London in the rain, walking and walking, as the realisation sank in that he was no longer a pop star. Soaked, he went into a pub and the woman behind the bar offered him a grubby tea towel to dry off. Washed-up indeed, he thought.His memoir, Pop Scars, is sprinkled with darkly comic takes on what his life had become after 90s pop stardom. Known as Kavana, he had a Top 10 hit in 1997 with his cover of Shalamar’s I Can Make You Feel Good. “I’ve always somehow been able to find the humour, even at some of the darker times,” he says.And there were dark times. Making a joke about a Neil Sedaka song (“Oh, Carol. Oh fuck, more like”) to describe the reality of waking up in a stranger’s apartment; fragments of a memory of driving down Sunset Strip with Sedaka on the car stereo; the realisation he had been paid for the sex he couldn’t remember. Smoking crack in a skip in Hackney with a homeless woman he had just met, and whom he trusts with his bank card to go and score more drugs (“Note to self,” he writes, “never give a stranger your pin code when high”). There are funnier, less serious incidents – he earned a lifetime ban, he says, from the daytime TV show Loose Women after slurring his way through it and being “unhinged” backstage – but in general, it’s a fairly bleak account of addiction, pain and what happens when the pop machine spits you out.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianHe is very hard on himself, I say, when we meet in the offices of his publisher (at 47, he retains the boyish looks that made him a teen favourite). “Well, I had that narrative for a long time. I think when you have a lot of rejection …” He pauses. As an alcoholic in recovery, and three years sober, he is kinder to himself now. “But looking back, that’s definitely how I felt.”Writing the book has helped. “It’s given me some self-esteem which is, I think, what I’ve been lacking for a long time.” He worried he wasn’t a big enough name to be interesting to anyone now, until he started to view the book as a memoir of addiction, “and that includes the fame part, because really I was only chasing a feeling. Approval, basically.” And what happens after fame disappears. “I have a bit of empathy for the young me, because although I was driven and ambitious and smart, I was also very naive.”Growing up in Manchester in the 1980s, born to parents who already had a 20-year-old daughter, Kavanagh wanted nothing more than to be a pop star. Smash Hits magazine was his bible – every fortnight, he’d bring it home from the shop, “take it in my bedroom and go through the pages. It was just an escape into this fantasy world.”Bullied, and with the dawning realisation he was gay, he found school an ordeal, but he also had an iron belief that he would be a famous pop star one day. Where did that come from? “Delusion?” he says with a laugh. “Maybe wanting to escape. I just had a feeling, and I would go around telling everyone that it was a given – I was going to be on Top of the Pops.”View image in fullscreenPerforming live in 1997.Photograph: David Wardle/Avalon/Getty ImagesWhen he became successful – Top 10 singles in the UK, adored in Asia – the picture he gives is of an excited and confused teenager in a bewildering world. It would have been easier, he thinks, if he’d been in a boyband, because at least there would be backup. He had body image issues: he had been overweight as a young teenager, and people around him still commented that he was “chubby”. “I used to get a bit fearful sometimes in the photoshoots.” Mostly he was afraid of being outed, when his success with his teenage girl fans depended on him being a “straight” pop star. “There was fear in general, regardless of being a pop star. I hadn’t told my parents. I didn’t tell my sister till I was 18. It was a different age then.”Sometimes, on tour with other artists, he would share a passing glance with another man and wonder if they were interested. “You’d have a little feeling, but I dared not say to you, in case you then tell somebody else.” On one tour, he and Stephen Gateley, from the boyband Boyzone, spent the night together.Keeping his sexuality hidden must have been incredibly difficult. “It was, and that’s where alcohol came in as a comfort. It’s crazy when I look back now, the time that we were in. It was a constant act, and it was exhausting – but you just got on with it, because I was so lucky for this to happen to me, and I must be grateful. I put everything into the ambition.”It’s strange, Kavanagh says, to be doing interviews again at a time where he doesn’t have to hide his sexuality, and there is more understanding of the pressures on young pop stars and power dynamics in relationships. “We didn’t talk about mental health. Today you hear they give artists aftercare or therapy, but there wasn’t any of that then. I suppose I didn’t have the knowledge to ask, either. What would I have asked for? We didn’t use those words back then. And when it’s so fast, fast, fast, and there’s a lot of ‘yes’ people, and you’re told how fantastic you are, that’s enough sometimes to make you feel OK.” It made it harder, he says, when only a few months later, the fame bubble popped. “Especially if it becomes your identity,” he adds.View image in fullscreenIn 1998.Photograph: Tim Roney/Getty ImagesEven when he was successful, he says, “I was never satisfied. I won a Smash Hits award – like, that was the holy grail to me. It doesn’t get much better than that. But then, I think maybe the addiction side, you want something else. I kept wanting more and more. At 21, I decide I’m going to go and live in America, I’m going to make it there.” He laughs at himself – the young man who had just been dropped by his record label, and who genuinely believed he could move to Hollywood and pick up an Oscar. “It’s like, OK, that’s a normal thing to do.”It actually started well: he got an agent, and a small part in a soap within the first week, but only for a couple of episodes. He was trying to release his own music, become a songwriter, go to auditions, but mostly he was lonely, burning through his money and drinking more and more. Sometimes drugs, too, including crystal meth. But, he says, “Alcohol was the start and the end. I would never have taken drugs without alcohol. But yeah, I was like a loose cannon for some of those times, got myself into some situations.” Such as waking up in a stranger’s flat, realising he had been paid for sex.Kavanagh ended up living in a motel, then eventually returned home after seven years – in 2006 – penniless. It meant losing his parents’ home, which he had been paying the mortgage on. “That comes with a whole load of guilt, because I’m moving two elderly parents, they’ve lost this house. So that’s more reason to drink.”His years out of the UK meant everyone had forgotten about him. He looked around at the people who had grown up with him – former pop stars and actors such as Ant and Dec, and Billie Piper – who had successfully reinvented themselves, and felt as if he’d made a mistake. “So then there’s shame and regret with that.” He smiles. “There was no jungle [the I’m a Celebrity … reality show] in them days to go on when your pop career is washed up. When I disappeared … ‘I’ll make it in Hollywood!’” He tried to stage a comeback, releasing a “best of” album and appearing on reality shows including Celebrity Big Brother and Grease Is the Word, but he sabotaged many opportunities by being drunk. He started hanging around with the singer Amy Winehouse, who had her own alcohol addiction, and crashing at the flats of his few remaining loyal fans, drinking more.View image in fullscreenHaving his hair cut by Katie Price on Celebrity Big Brother in 2015.Photograph: ShutterstockSigning on at the jobcentre back in Manchester, he was scared of being recognised – people had started, dishearteningly, to ask him: “Didn’t you used to be Kavana?” “I was so wrapped up in my own shame,” he says. “I was having to drink.” And alcohol worked for him, he says, “for a long time. I’m not sitting here saying: ‘Oh, it was tragic, it was awful.’ Alcohol got me through my father’s death. It kind of got me through my sister’s death [from cancer in 2019]. It got me through feeling nervous, it got me through going on stage, homesickness. But I didn’t realise what it was doing to me.”By the time he was essentially homeless, living secretly with his mother in her sheltered housing flat, Kavanagh was deep in addiction. He applied for a place at rehab mainly, he says, to have somewhere to live, and was sober for six months before spectacularly relapsing on a songwriting retreat, and drinking neat vodka in a phone box. In London, he would go through a cycle of attending AA meetings, then drinking again. By the time he was buying three-litre bottles of cheap cider to drink in the mornings (along with tins of cat food, to create, he thought, an air of respectability), he knew he was in trouble.“Alcohol became as important to me as oxygen to survive,” he says. “That sounds quite melodramatic to somebody that has never experienced that, but I knew the game was up. I wanted to stop, but I physically couldn’t.” He would often spend the rest of the day at a Costa coffee shop, pretending to work on his phone and sipping wine from a paper cup.One day, an email from a lawyer came through. A newspaper had agreed to settle a defamation case he’d long forgotten about from the 90s, and the sum was more than he had seen in a decade. “I’m drinking wine out of the coffee cup, and just that divine timing,” he says.He called his AA sponsor, and asked for help to find a private rehab clinic. “At that point I needed to be locked up,” he says. A friend drove him there, and Kavanagh remembers the friend telling staff he thought alcohol had caused him brain damage. “To think that I’d got myself in that state.” Kavanagh thought alcohol would kill him. “I’ve seen it happen to others, and I think it scared me that last time in rehab.”View image in fullscreenPhotograph: David Levene/The GuardianFor whatever reason, rehab worked, and Kavanagh has been sober for three and a half years. He wakes up, “and I pray to a god that I don’t understand, and just say, ‘You drive today.’ I go to meetings, I try to be of service. Anything that takes me out of thinking and negotiating things in my head, I’ve learned, is what helps. Connecting with others.”Kavanagh wrote his book during the first year of sobriety. “I’ve got access to this new life now, but I just have to remember that that’s where it took me last time.” He is proud to call himself an author, and might make some music again at some point. He’d quite like to do a one-man show.Does he still crave approval and recognition? “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t crave approval. I’m not sure about being hugely famous, because I know how fleeting it can be, but there’s definitely something to be said about putting something you’ve done out and getting positive feedback. Or people connecting to me.”Pop Scars by Anthony Kavanagh (Bonnier Books Ltd, £22). To support the Guardian, order your copy atguardianbookshop.com.

The legal team at Lewis Silkin that investigated the allegations relating to Gregg Wallace also substantiated an accusation of highly offensive racist language against John Torode which occurred in 2018.Recent ‘tough period’ is not the real existential threat facing the BBCRead more“This matter has been formally discussed with John Torode by Banijay UK, and whilst we note that John says he does not recall the incident, Lewis Silkin have upheld the very serious complaint. Banijay UK and theBBCare agreed that we will not renew his contract on MasterChef.”A BBC spokesperson said the allegation against Torode “involves an extremely offensive racist term being used in the workplace”, which was “investigated and substantiated” by the independent investigation led by Lewis Silkin.They added: “John Torode denies the allegation. He has stated he has no recollection of the alleged incident and does not believe that it happened. He also says that any racial language is wholly unacceptable in any environment.“The BBC takes this upheld finding extremely seriously. We will not tolerate racist language of any kind and, as we have already said, we told Banijay UK, the makers of MasterChef, that action must be taken. John Torode’s contract on MasterChef will not be renewed.”In a statement on Instagram on Tuesday, Torode said: “Although I haven’t heard from anyone at the BBC or Banijay, I am seeing and reading that I’ve been ‘sacked’ from MasterChef and I repeat that I have no recollection of what I’m accused of. The enquiry could not even state the date or year of when I am meant to have said something wrong.“I’d hoped that I’d have some say in my exit from a show I’ve worked on since its relaunch in 2005, but events in last few seem to have prevented that.”He added: “Personally I have loved every minute working on MasterChef, but it’s time to pass the cutlery to someone else. For whoever takes over, love it as I have.”The report on Wallace, commissioned by Banijay UK, found that 45 out of 83 allegations against him were substantiated, alongside two standalone allegations made against other people.Wallace, 60, was sacked last week from MasterChef before the release of the report, which included one allegation of “unwelcome physical contact” that was upheld. He said he was “deeply sorry for any distress caused” and that he had “never set out to harm or humiliate”.MasterChef was relaunched in 2005 with Torode and Wallace as presenters. The latest development means Torode’s time at MasterChef is in effect over already as the 2025 series has already been shot and delivered to the BBC, though it has not been aired. Torode will not be contracted for any more episodes.His departure creates an even greater problem for the BBC director general, Tim Davie, over the current, unaired series of the show. He was already facing a tough decision over whether or not to air it, as Wallace features prominently throughout.The GuardianrevealedWallace appears as a judge right up until the series finale. It was only then that he stood back from the role amid allegations over his behaviour. Torode features throughout the whole series.Speaking at thelaunch of the BBC’s annual report, Davie said he had not made a decision over the series but he was mindful of the contestants who had worked hard throughout it.“One of my overwhelming concerns is that we’ve got all the amateur chefs that gave their heart and soul to this programme,” he said. “We have to reflect on that, talk to them – and I’m sure Banijay are doing that – consult them, think about the audience, and then make a call. That’s what we’re going through now.”He said there was a future for the show despite the allegations against Wallace and Torode. Production has only recently moved to new studios. “A great programme that’s well loved by audiences is much bigger than individuals,” Davie said.In an interview with BBC News on Tuesday evening, Davie said he saw the situation as an opportunity for the corporation to “reset”.He said he was not directly involved with the matter but had been told about the recommendation not to renew Torode’s contract and was “happy that the team were taking action”.Davie added: “It’s really important that we are taking this seriously. It’s a reset where we make sure that people are living up to the values we expect across the board.”Asked exactly what Torode was alleged to have said, the BBC’s director general replied: “I’m not going to give you the exact term because I think, frankly, it was serious racist term, a serious racist term, which does not get to be acceptable in any way, shape or form.”Explore more on these topicsMasterChefBBCTelevision industrynewsShareReuse this content"

And then I did After Camelot, which was a lot about Jackie and her marriage to [Aristotle] Onassis,” the Greek shipping tycoon, “Camelot” the name given to the Kennedys’ apparently charmed circle, in reference to the legendary court of King Arthur.“I also did Jackie, Janet and Lee, which was about Jackie and her mom [Janet Auchincloss] and her sister [Lee Radziwill]. Two years ago, I did Jackie: Public, Private, Secret, which was Jackie, cradle to grave. When that was successful, I thought, ‘It’s time to tell JFK’s side of the story.’”Evidently, Kennedy books sell. So do books by Taraborrelli, whose subjects have also included Diana Ross, Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra, Cher and Elizabeth Taylor.View image in fullscreenJohn F Kennedy.Photograph: Public domain/JFK LibraryFor JFK, he turned to the vast Kennedy archives but also his own extensive interviews, looked at anew, and new sources including Monroe’s publicist, Patricia Newcomb, now 95, and Janet Des Rosiers Fontaine, once secretary and girlfriend to JFK’s father, Joseph Kennedy, now 100 years old.Readers “know what they’re going to get when they read one of my books”, Taraborrelli said. “It’s not going to be … a blow-by-blow of every moment in JFK’s political history. I wanted to do more of a human portrait, something people can [use to] really sort of understand this man and like him or hate him, at least.”Taraborrelli’s central theme is JFK’s treatment of women.“We’ve always looked at JFK as this unconscionable cheating husband,” he said. “I wanted to maybe not defend him as much as explain him, try to get into his head and tell his side of the story. This book is really a companion to Jackie: Public, Private, Secret. When you read them both, you really get a full picture of that marriage.”It’s a sympathetic picture. Taraborrelli’s JFK is arelentless adultererbut one who came to some realization of his weakness, through the painful consequences of his behavior, through a belatedly deepening connection to his wife, and through the trials of office.Taraborrelli said: “The thing about JFK is that as unconscionable as his actions were, he still had a conscience, which made it even more difficult for him, because if you have no conscience, then you can just be a crappy person and you’re OK with it. It’s when you have a conscience that it causes problems for you internally.”JFK’s behavior has certainly caused problems for his reputation. As Taraborrelli was writing, Maureen Callahan publishedAsk Not: The Kennedys and the Women They Destroyed, a lacerating account,ceding nothingto the trappings of glamor and power.Taraborrelli did not read it: “If it had come out at a different time, I might have. But when books start coming out while I’m working on a book, I don’t even want to know what’s in them, because I don’t want to inadvertently repeat the same material or be in some way influenced.“I also made a decision early on with JFK that I did not want [the book] to be a compendium of all of his affairs … an A-through-Z list of every woman he ever slept with, because these women, many of them have written books of their own, and many of them have been interviewed for books. Their stories have been told.View image in fullscreenJohn and Jackie Kennedy pose with Caroline and John Jr in Hyannis Port, in August 1962.Photograph: Public domain/JFK Library“I wanted to find women that made a difference, like Joan Lundberg actually made a difference in his life.Judith Exnermade a difference, though I don’t believe anything she ever said about anything. She was there, you know.Mary Meyermade a difference. Marilyn Monroe makes a difference, historically if not personally.”Whether JFK had an affair with Monroe is part of a conspiracy-laced legacy fueled by Kennedy’s policies and presidency, hisproximity to organized crime(in part through Exner, also involved with a Chicago mobster), and his assassination, all of it fuel for a thriving publishing industry of labyrinthine what-ifs. Taraborrelli says he has no wish to join it. He deals with the assassination in a few final pages, pointedly ignoring old questions: did killer Lee Harvey Oswald act alone, what did the CIA know.Releasesof government files came and went. Taraborrelli stayed focused on his man.He thinks there was no Monroe affair – chiefly, though Jackie expressed concern, because no evidence exists. But Taraborrelli doessayJFK had a previously unknown affair with Lundberg, a Californian air hostess, in the 1950s, when he was an ambitious senator from Massachusetts. It ended for Lundberg with Kennedy paying for an abortion.Taraborrelli said: “JFK met Joan when he was on the outs with his family. Jackie had a stillbirth in 1956 and JFK did not return from a vacation to be with his wife. It took him a week to get back. And when he got back, everybody in the family, both sides of the family, wanted nothing to do with him. In fact, Jackie’s mom was so upset that she made him sleep in the servants’ quarters over the garage.“And so he went to Los Angeles, and he met [Lundberg], and she didn’t know anything about him, other than that he was a famous senator, but she didn’t know him personally, and she didn’t know anybody in his life. And he was able to open up to her honestly and use her as sort of a pseudo-therapist to try to work out some of his issues. And he was trying to grapple with how could he have done this to his wife?”As Callahanshows, Kennedy men doing unconscionable things to women has never been rare. JFK’s nephew, Robert F Kennedy Jr, is now US health secretary, after extensive coverage of his philandering and itstragic consequences.Of JFK, Taraborrelli said: “At one point, Joan said to him, ‘I think that you’re a good person.’ And he said, ‘No, I’m really not.’ He did not even think he was a good man. He said he felt like he was stuck in himself and he couldn’t figure out a way to get out.”Nor could Kennedy’s sister, Rosemary, who endured developmental difficulties and whose father arranged in 1941 “for brain surgerythat went terribly wrong, turned her into an invalid, and then he institutionalized her and told the family they needed to forget she existed, and they all did, but JFK held this shame that he let this happen to the sister he loved.View image in fullscreenJohn F Kennedy.Photograph: Picasa/Jacques Lowe“In the book, you realize that if he was able to disassociate himself from his own sister, who he loved, then how was he to feel about a baby Jackie had that died, who he didn’t know? It’s like he didn’t have empathy. Jackie realized that, so she found Rosemary, the sister [JFK] had not seen in 15 years, and she encouraged him to go to and reconnect with his sister, because she knew he could not be a fully realized man, holding this dark secret and feeling ashamed.“And so that was another building block. And then when their son Patrick died [living less than two days in August 1963] that was another building block.”As Taraborrelli sees it, such experiences helped bring “Kennedy out of himself” on the brink of his death, “turn[ing] him into a different man, a man with good character … and so in this book, you see JFK take accountability for his mistakes. He says, ‘The way that I was was painful, and by painful, I mean shameful.’“He also takes accountability as a president whenthe Bay of Pigs[the 1961 invasion of Cuba], for instance, is a disaster. It was something he inherited from [President Dwight D] Eisenhower but he didn’t blame the other administration, ‘I have to clean up that guy’s mess,’ all that stuff. JFK went to the American people and said, ‘I’m the president. This is my responsibility. I did this, and I’m sorry.’ And guess what? His approval rating went up to 85%, because people want a president who takes accountability.“But he had to become a man who could take accountability first, and he did. That’s a great story, and I think it’s a really hopeful story to tell, especially in these days when we question what is leadership and what do we expect from our leaders.”JFK: Public, Private, Secret isout nowExplore more on these topicsBooksJohn F KennedyHistory booksPolitics booksUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The show opens next month at@sohoplacewith Lenny Henry in the principal role; later it will be played by Sue Perkins, Ambika Mod and Jonny Donahoe, the comedian who presided over its triumphant runat the Edinburgh fringe in 2014and far beyond.For Driver it marks a return to the venue where she performedWhite Rabbit Red Rabbitfor one night last November. That theatrical experiment required a different actor to perform the play, sight unseen, each time. Driver, who shot to fame in the 1990s films Circle of Friends and Good Will Hunting, is no stranger to the London stage. In 2003 she starred in the West End alongside Matthew Perry in David Mamet’s Sexual Perversity in Chicago.Every Brilliant Thing, written byDuncan Macmillanwith Donahoe, is based around a list created by the narrator to remind his mum, after her first suicide attempt, of everything that’s worth living for. “I have wanted to do a play in London again for the longest time,” said Driver. “I didn’t want to take on a big classical role, walk down a well-trodden path. I wanted to find something that would be new to a lot of audiences, that was both funny and sad and unique in its storytelling – something unusual that you’d talk about on the train home, think about the next day at work. I knew how I wanted it to make me feel, I just didn’t know what it was. Then I read Duncan’s play.”‘I wanted to give people hope’: how Every Brilliant Thing became theatre’s best antidote to depressionRead moreDriver said that “the thought of doing a one-person show is like staring up at an enormous mountain that you’re expected to free solo”, but added that the play’s “clarity, humanity and humour struck me really deeply. I am terrified and excited in equal measure to tell this brilliant, beautiful story and to be in such a great company.”The play’s run has now been extended to 8 November. It will be directed by Jeremy Herrin and Macmillan, marking the show’sWest Enddebut after being performed in more than 80 countries and adapted into a film.Explore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndDuncan MacmillanComedy (Stage)Comedy (Culture)Lenny HenrynewsShareReuse this content"

I think we’re living in a state of deep despair and inequalities. Having an additional space where people can tackle difficult, urgent, important questions in a way that is open, genuinely sincere and respectful, can only be a positive.”Its first exhibition will be Ibrahim Mahama’s long-running, evolving workParliament of Ghosts, which also appeared at the Manchester international festival in 2019 and features discarded objects from Mahama’s west African homeland of Ghana.The Otolith Collective will create a “library-in-residence”, while the east London booksellers Burley Fisher will run Ibraaz’s bookshop, which the Palestine festival of literature will initially curate. There will also be a talks programme.Lazaar says that recently some arts institutions and organisations have been uncomfortable hosting discussions or artists who have tackled weighty issues.Last February, the Barbican was criticised after itbacked out of hosting a lecture seriesthat included a talk about the Holocaust and allegations that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Shortly afterwards, across the cultural landscape, there was outrage after Arts Council England warned that “political statements” could break funding agreements, before U-turning.View image in fullscreenIbrahim Mahama’s Parliament of Ghosts showing at the Whitworth Art Gallery, Manchester in 2019.Photograph: Michael PollardTheKamel Lazaar Foundationis one of many privately run arts institutions in Africa, alongsideFondation Hin Madagascar,32Bisin Tunisia, Fondation Zinsou in Benin and the Zeitz Mocaa in South Africa.Lazaar says not being beholden to public funds means Ibraaz can have more freedom to host challenging works or ideas. “Those spaces have historically made institutions feel a little bit uncomfortable and we want to be able to exist at that edge of discomfort,” said Lazaar. “That’s the only way I believe that institution will be in a position to be consequential in shaping discourse.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It was a synagogue, the residence of Conservative politician Sir Robert Bateson Harvey, the London Galvanic hospital and the German Athenaeum – a cultural club for artists, musicians, and businessmen.Lazaar says she was “uncomfortable” with the space at first. It was grand and symbolised an old world opulence, rooted in British history and wealth – the kind of place where the people Ibraaz is trying to attract wouldn’t have been welcome.But she says she now thinks of Ibraaz opening in the heart of Fitzrovia as a chance to “reclaim the space” and bring in “marginalised” voices.As well as an arts programme, there will be a music offering and a “café-in-residence” led by Tunisian chef Boutheina Ben Salem, which Lazaar says is a key part of “cultural hospitality”.“I genuinely believe that with real cultural hospitality and care you are able to rebuild environments where the most kind of pressing and controversial and difficult, complex, layered issues should and can be debated, but in a civil way.”Explore more on these topicsCultureLondonFreedom of speechGhanaArtnewsShareReuse this content"

As with professional athletes, there are dancers who show remarkable potential at a young age, some of whom make the grade and some of whom fade away.Though she was taken to ballet lessons aged three by her mother, who had herself wanted to dance, Yonezawa insists she was far from a natural ballerina at first.“I loved moving my body to music at nursery school. But ballet begins with putting your feet in some very awkward positions. I was often the slowest in the class to get them right,” recalls Yonezawa, speaking in Tokyo as the NBJ prepares for its first UK tour.View image in fullscreenStudents from the New National Theatre Ballet School take part in a daily class.

After Yonezawa’s parents separated, she moved with her mother from Tokyo to Nagoya, where she began to dance. But it took around a decade before she fell under ballet’s spell.Japan itself is something of a late ballet bloomer. Introduced from Europe in the early 20th century, ballet began to gain traction after the second world war. By the 1970s, Japan was producing exceptional dancers, including Yoko Morishita, who nearly all moved overseas to fulfil their ambitions. It was not until the NBJ’s founding in 1997 in conjunction with the New National Theatre in Tokyo that Japan had a resident ballet company.View image in fullscreenThe theatre during preparations between a matinee and evening performanceView image in fullscreenSpotlights cross as the company perform EtudesI made my way up to the heavens to shoot from the lighting gallery occupied by four follow-spot technicians, each clasping their own massive light cannon.

In 1995, she became the first Japanese ballerina to be a principal dancer at the Royal Ballet. Taking her acclaimed original production of Adolphe Adam’s Giselle to theRoyal Opera Houserepresents something akin to a homecoming for Yoshida, while being the company’s first full overseas tour (it has previously staged guest performances at Washington’s Kennedy Center and Moscow’s Bolshoi).Yonezawa is set to be the lead dancer for a couple of the Covent Garden performances of Giselle, a piece she finds both challenging and absorbing.View image in fullscreenThe National Ballet of Japan perform The Firebird, during a performance of Ballet Coffret, a triple bill showcasing 20th-century masterpiecesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenAyako Ono as the Firebird, and Haruka Yoshida during EtudesI photographed the first show almost entirely from one position in the stalls, in order to get to know the productions and begin to plan how I might shoot the next four performancesDavid LeveneView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenNational Ballet of Japan perform EtudesView image in fullscreenNational Ballet of Japan perform Etudes“The first and second acts are completely different. Not just physically, but in the entire world they portray. Act 1 is the real world, and Act 2 is the afterlife. I go from a living person to something like a ghost, close to what we call ayureiin Japanese,” explains Yonezawa. “My body and inner self transform; Giselle’s love for Albrecht is the only constant. But even that evolves, from infatuation and excitement in Act 1 to something deeper, more eternal in Act 2. That enduring love becomes the theme.”She adds that every dancer interprets Giselle differently and that attempting to imitate other performances is a hiding to nothing.I often end up choosing the same pair of shoes, but I still go through the process each time ... it helps me tune inYui Yonezawa“Beautiful form isn’t enough. The relationship with your partner, your individual interpretation; it’s all essential. The smallest shift in emotion can change the audience’s perception. If you try to plan it too much, it feels fake. This makes it a very difficult work,” says Yonezawa.Although she danced for three years in the US, this will be her first lead role overseas, at a venue where Yonezawa says every ballet dancer dreams of performing. To prepare herself, she will rely on the same routine that has kept her, remarkably, injury-free for decades in an art form infamous for taking a heavy toll on the bodies of its star performers. That preparation was captured by David Levene over three March days in Tokyo as the company staged Ballet Coffret at its home theatre.“I’m certified in Gyrokinesis training [a method of opening up joints and muscles without overtaxing them that borrows from yoga], so I usually do that in the dressing room,” says Yonezawa.View image in fullscreenYonezawa trying on three pairs of ballet shoesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenYonezawa prepares in her dressing room, and eating beetroot powder before a performanceView image in fullscreenYonezawa squeezes through a doorway in the costume for The Vertiginous Thrill of ExactitudeView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenFinal adjustments for Yonezawa, and with the stage manager on his last day after 25 yearsView image in fullscreenYonezawa is exhausted after performing the very demanding production of The Vertiginous Thrill of ExactitudeShe also tries on three pairs of ballet shoes to see which one feels right for her body that day.“I often end up choosing the same pair, but I still go through the process each time,” she recounts with a laugh. “It helps me tune in.”A recent addition to her routine is eating beetroot powder a couple of hours before each performance.

The fact that ballet performances can connect with audiences across national and linguistic borders is one of the aspects of her art that she loves most deeply.“And in something like Act 2 of Giselle, when women in white costumes appear en pointe, it creates a world beyond our human one, without props – just with body,” Yonezawa says. “Expressing such spiritual form through this art shows the beauty of what ballet is.”View image in fullscreenA final curtain call for EtudesView image in fullscreenView image in fullscreenCurtain call during The Firebird, and audience applauseCurtain calls were monumental - advancing and retreating again and again, seemingly never-ending, back and forthDavid LeveneExplore more on these topicsThe Guardian picture essayBalletRoyal Opera HouseDanceJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Do you look back on your teenage years with fondness or horror? Did you have a great, formative love during the above? Did you let him/her go and never even do a cursory online search as to their whereabouts in the intervening decades?Did I just startle you by referring to the intervening decades between 1989 and now? Because that’s what there are. I know. I had to check, too.How great is your tolerance for the depiction of young love on screen now that you are past youth yourself? Will you sit on the sofa wreathed in smiles and yearning or will you put a boot through the telly?How well-disposed do you feel to the idea of a Sally Rooney-esque endeavour aged up to cover those who came of age in or around 1989 and how their lives have played out since? This is important. I’m talking contemplative scenes, wry smiles at memories, melancholic suffusion, mood above action.Have you read and enjoyed the acclaimed novel Mix Tape by Jane Sanderson?Your answers to the above will help determine how much you enjoy Mix Tape, an adaptation by Jo Spain of Sanderson’s novel. The four-part, double-timelined drama tells the story of freelance music journalist Dan O’Toole (Jim Sturgess) and author Alison Connor (Teresa Palmer), who grew up as teenagers in Sheffield and were each other’s first loves. Their younger selves are played (excellently) by newcomer Rory Walton-Smith and Florence Hunt respectively. Their scenes capture all the excitement and novelty, the heart-stopping importance of every minute spent together that teenagers in love conjure for themselves. Dan’s mother (Helen Behan) has some misgivings – she would rather he were playing the field a bit – but his father (Mark O’Halloran) is a romantic and is happy just to give his boy a little life advice along the way, especially as Alison is almost as fond of his racing pigeons as he is.View image in fullscreenExcellent … young Alison (Florence Hunt) and young Daniel (Rory Walton-Smith) in Mix Tape.Photograph: BBC/Subotica/Leanne SullivanDan only wishes that Alison would let him meet her parents. Or even tell him where she lives and let him walk her home. Unfortunately, Alison’s dad is long gone, her mother is an alcoholic and her boyfriend is a deeply unlovely piece of work called Martin (Jonathan Harden), whose malevolent presence suggests nothing but bad things are coming for the family. So it turns out, though the languorous pacing of Mix Tape, which is slightly too pleased with itself, means that it takes too long to get there.Things are even slower in the present as we wait for Dan and Alison’s paths to cross again. When Alison’s new book is released, Dan sends her – hesitantly – a friend request online. She – hesitantly – accepts it. For a long time – a long time – they communicate by sending Spotify links to each other, of songs that accompanied pivotal moments in their lives and relationship. Dan is now married to Katja (Sara Soulié), one of those screen wives who exist merely to irritate. She insists that now (their only child has just departed for university) is the time for them to start travelling together, regardless of the fact that a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Dan to collaborate with a music legend on his memoir is on the horizon. Women, eh!Alison is married to a successful surgeon (one day I want the story of an unsuccessful surgeon – one who’s scraping by, his mortality rates just good enough to keep him in gainful employment but nothing to write home about) and trying to keep him from bouncing their daughter, Stella (Julia Savage), into a termination that she may not want. So neither adult life is perfect. Does this mean they should meet up and see what spark remains from 1989? Is the grass always greener on the path not taken? Why did they break up? Did he find out where she lived, and about her mum and Martin? Should they just hurry up and shag? Is your own life worthless because you do not have an intense, formative teenage romance to look back on that has shaped and haunted you in ways known and unknown ever since?

Jaws 3, which was shot for 3D seemingly just for the scene where a shark is exploded? Or Jaws: The Revenge, in which a shark with a vendetta chases Michael Caine around the Bahamas?

It deserves to be rediscovered and heralded as a classic. However, Hell Is a City was also shot in Manchester – rare for a film – and provides a wonderful snapshot of the city 65 years ago.

Dana A Williams, professor of African American Literature at Howard University, sets out to fill this gap, offering an impeccably researched account of Morrison’s stint at Random House between 1971 and 1983, against the backdrop of the Civil Rightsand the Black Arts movements. Reflecting ideas generated by that convergence, Morrison’s novels – described by the Nobel committee, when they awarded her the prize in literature in 1993, as giving life to an essential aspect of American reality – were driven by an unwavering belief in the possibility of African American empowerment through self-regard. Williams’s interest lies in showing how Morrison’s editorial career was informed by the same invigoratingly insular ethos. Whether writing or editing, her work was aimed at producing “explorations of interior Black life with minimal interest in talking to or being consumed by an imagined white reader”.Morrison saw early on how that kind of insularity could be wielded as both a weapon and a shield. Addressing the Second National Conference of Afro-American Writers at Howard in 1976, she urged the audience to recognise that “the survival of Black publishing, which […] is a sort of way of saying the survival of Black writing, will depend on the same things that the survival of Black anything depends on, which is the energies of Black people – sheer energy, inventiveness and innovation, tenacity, the ability to hang on, and a contempt for those huge, monolithic institutions and agencies which do obstruct us”. These words could well have been repurposed as a mission statement for her editorial career, which, as Williams points out, consisted of “[making] a revolution, one book at a time”. Change was coming in America. Morrison’s contribution would be to work towards change in the overwhelmingly white world of publishing: “I thought it was important for people to be in the streets,” she said during an interview for the documentary Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am, released in 2019. “But that couldn’t last. You needed a record. It would be my job to publish the voices, the books, the ideas of African Americans. And that would last.”Toni at Randomtraces the path that led from Morrison’s Jim Crow childhood to her storied literary career, briefly documenting her early years, during which storytelling was an “ever-present pastime”, as well as her academic life (Howard, followed by graduate studies at Cornell), before moving on to chapter-by-chapter case studies of some of the publications she oversaw during her stint at Random House. At times Williams’s book reads like a catalogue of those works, from The Black Book(a compendium of black life in America) towork by June Jordan, Lucille Clifton and Toni Cade Bambara, as well as autobiographies of Angela Davis, Huey Newton and Muhammad Ali, and Gayl Jones’sCorregidora(which was reissued in 2019). Nevertheless, it is a fascinating catalogue, not least because it is full of thrilling behind-the-scenes insights into what it took to get them published.Morrison chased blurbs and championed her projects with passion, tenacity and a moving sense of urgencyMorrison was keenly aware that success depended on proving that books such as these could sell; demand would have to be so high that, as Williams writes, “even the most recalcitrant salesperson would have no choice but to fall in line”. The first job was making sure the books were excellent. Williams provides a number of examples of Morrison’s exacting standards, including the fact that, while working on a collection of Huey Newton’s essays, she recommended deleting the weak ones and editing the rest, “even those that had been previously published”. But Morrison was also required to navigate “the irony of the need to be appealing to white people while also preserving enough distance from them to maintain Black privacy”, keeping one eye on the bottom line even while the other was on black consciousness. On one memorable occasion, when the poet Barbara Chase-Riboud stonewalled her about doing publicity (loftily describing it as “tap [dancing] for prizes and coverage”), Morrison fired off a flinty letter reminding her thatRandom Housewas “a commercial house historically unenchanted with 500 slim volumes of profound poetry that languish in stock rooms”.Morrison could be blunt when she had to be but, alongside this, Williams paints a picture of her as a fiercely protective editor, chasing blurbs and championing her projects with passion, tenacity and a moving sense of urgency, “scared that the world would fall away before somebody put together a thing that got close to the way we really are”. In addition, Williams highlights her convivial and collaborative approach, which led tothe development of close friendships with a few of her authors including, famously, Angela Davis, who lived with Morrison and her sons for a time while they worked on her autobiography.It is astonishing to consider that at the same time as doing all this Morrison was also busy raising two sons and writing her own novels, frequently leveraging her literary status in service of her editorial campaigns. Williams includes references to a 1978 interview in which Morrison hinted at how exhausting this was: “I want to stop writing around the edges of the day … in the automobile and places like that.”Which makes it even more astonishing to consider how little has changed since she fought this fight. According to Dan Sinykin, writing inLiterary Hubin October 2023: “In 1971, when Morrison became a trade editor, about 95% of the fiction published by the big commercial houses was by white authors. By 2018, that number only dropped to 89%.”In August 2024, Alexandra Alter and Elizabeth Harris pointed out in the New York Times that following the hiring of “a small but influential group” of black female editors in 2020, many had “lost their jobs or quit the business entirely … [leading] some … to question publishers’ commitment to racial inclusion”.In the UK the position is hardly any better. The fight is still necessary, and still exhausting. However, Williams’s book is a timely reminder of the need for an inward-looking response, and of the joy to be discovered along the way.Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is best when it is penetrated by Morrison’s own voice, in the form of excerpts from her correspondence. Here, for example, is Toni attempting to persuade Bill Cosby (with his reputation as yet untarnished) to write an introduction for The Black Book: “Let me just say … I want to publish books about us – black people – that will make some sense – to give joy, to pass on some grandeur to all those black children (born and unborn) who need to get to the horizon with something under their arms besides Dick and Jane and The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire.” At the time she wrote those lines, I was one of those black children, and I am grateful that the books she published did exactly that. The same spirit of gratitude permeates Williams’s scholarly, informative and highly readable book.Toni at Random: The Iconic Writer’s Legendary Editorship by Dana A Williams is published by Amistad (£25).

It’s an experience that clearly informs Leila Mottley’s new novel, The Girls Who Grew Big, in which the struggles of pregnancy and motherhood loom large. Mottley’s work as a doula comes in addition to writing a bestselling debut novel,Nightcrawling, and featuring on Oprah’s Book Club; she was also youth poet laureate of Oakland, California, in 2018. But not much seems beyond the reach of the youngest ever writer to be longlisted for the Booker prize, back in 2022. The pity is that her considerable energy hasn’t translated into a more satisfying second book.The Girls Who Grew Big tells the story of a gang of teenage mothers and the impromptu community they form in the humid disarray and general dysfunction of Padua, a fictional small town in the Florida panhandle. Led by their de facto leader, Simone, the Girls are a scrappy, ostracised handful of outsiders, variously rejected by their families and harshly judged by locals. Down on their luck and often abandoned by the adults in their lives, they resourcefully become a collective, based in the back of Simone’s truck.At 20, Simone is the eldest, the mother of five-year-old twins Lion and Luck. When she finds herself unhappily pregnant again, she turns to the Girls for help. Among them is 17-year-old Emory, whose white family are appalled by her black boyfriend. She comes to the Girls when struggling to breastfeed her baby boy, Kai, and finds practical advice, sisterhood and support. Then new girl Adela washes up in town: a champion swimmer with college ambitions, exiled from her former life by an unplanned pregnancy and sent to stay with her grandmother for nine months. Emory is immediately infatuated, and soon the Girls find their community disrupted.Those are the bones of the book, and there’s clearly something potent here: the raw lives of teenage mothers, the fierce bonds forged in adversity, the alarmingly unequal access to good-quality maternity care in contemporary America. And yet The Girls Who Grew Big ultimately lands awkwardly, emerging as a mawkish paean to motherhood. This is a well-meant novel about decent things – sisterhood and solidarity – but its sentiment is never more sophisticated than this, and the writing too often sinks into the syrupy. Nightcrawling, Mottley’s novel about an impoverished teenage sex worker in Oakland who ends up at the centre of a police corruption case, was a startling debut: miraculously lucid, politically pointed and tenderly wrought. But in The Girls Who Grew Big, when Mottley reaches for gritty realism, she often gives us something that feels gratuitous instead.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

It’s certainly striking, but it also reads like an unnecessary provocation. Simone reasons that her teeth are preferable to her boyfriend’s dirty pocket knife, “crusted in dried brown blood, shed fur from some long-dead animal, and Lord knows how many fishes’ yellowed intestines”, as Mottley seems intent on challenging the reader from the first. Later, calling in a favour, Simone reminds Emory that she “sucked on her nipple just last week to get a clogged duct to flow again”. Birth is messy and women’s bodies are unruly: Mottley insists we confront this. Her prose relishes the blood and milk, straight talk sometimes curdling into something more callow and needlessly graphic.Setting the novel in Florida allows Mottley dramatic licence and she makes the most of it. She has a hurricane hit Padua, and the Girls flee from it in their wildly veering vehicle. A storm fells a tree, which inconveniently closes the local Planned Parenthood clinic. An alligator turns up at Emory’s high school like a bad omen. An orca beaches itself as if summoned by the novel’s own need for symbolism and the Girls duly scramble to save it. Drama is Mottley’s preferred mode, and the set pieces – a cat fight between Adela and Simone; a tense reveal between Adela and her new boyfriend – feel melodramatic rather than real.But the Mottley of Nightcrawling is here too, writing with poetic clarity in fleeting moments. She is excellent at capturing the mysterious quality of this neglected patch of Florida: its close, salty air, its turquoise waters and its white sands. She is believable on passion. When Emory gazes at Adela, she feels “a crazed swirl at the bowl of [her] body”, and she longs “to know everything about her, even when she only gave me fractions”. But too often The Girls Who Grew Big feels overly ambitious, a virtuous rhapsody, determined to say something transcendent about young motherhood but stuck peddling folksy wisdom instead.The Girls Who Grew Big by Leila Mottley is published by Fig Tree (£16.99).

There’s a more culpably hammy performance from Jamie Foxx, who rocks a ginormous, weirdly contoured afro so bizarre that it’s almost worth the price alone. (He is also one of many executive producers on the project.) But Foxx’s tonsorial effort is not enough to counteract the fact that this is a pretty lousy film, only worth it if you like “sneerwatching”.None of the big names mentioned above play the lead here. Instead, the hero is one Nash Cavanaugh (a name that sounds generated by an AI bot), as incarnated by a typically lumpen Scott Eastwood. Cavanaugh is a former soldier who was once drawn into the cult created by Foxx’s Leon Prudhomme, also known by his much cooler cult leader moniker, the Bokushi (“pastor” in Japanese). It turns out Prudhomme was originally bankrolled by De Niro’s Ashburn, a shady government agent who had hoped to create a mercenary army. But the Bokushi has instead created his own private Jonestown, full of other ex-soldiers sold on his self-help preaching about how PTSD need not define them, or something like that. What makes him so charismatic is never well defined, but presumably the veterans must be smitten with his R&B-inflected gospel crooning with a special backup band – a vanity moment that’s pure cringe.Viewers will have to pay close attention to parse out all the different timelines that the diced editing keeps flipping back and forth between. In the film’s present, Cavanaugh is approached by Ashburn to infiltrate the Bokushi’s compound with other secret agents before the FBI messes everything up with their own raid. Cavanaugh is hoping he’ll find his wife Evoli (Nora Arnezeder), who is either still part of the cult and will therefore need deprogramming, or is being held against her will. The murkily lensed climax involves, judging by the sound effects, a lot of rushing water and explosions, because only primal forces of such power could vanquish the Bokushi’s mighty hairdo.Tin Soldier is on Prime Video from 23 July.Explore more on these topicsFilmThrillersAction and adventure filmsJamie FoxxRobert De NiroreviewsShareReuse this content"

In the 43rd year of my earthly course, as I was gazing with great fear and trembling attention at a heavenly vision, I saw a great splendour in which resounded a voice from Heaven saying to me, ‘O fragile human, ashes of ashes, and filth of filth! Say and write what you see and hear.”These are the words of 12th-century polymath Hildegard von Bingen (or Hildegard of Bingen), recalling the divine intervention that set her on the path to becoming one of history’s earliest and most influential composers.Hildegard has inspired reamsof scholarship and writing, films and even perfume, but right now her presence is most keenly felt in music, where her work has transcended the silos of early and classical music to influence experimental and feminist artists. “I felt an instant connection both earthly and unearthly,” the radical neo-medieval musicianLaura Cannellsays of Hildegard’s music. “It was like making a really good friend or falling in love. I can find darkness and light in it; it seems to be the perfect accompaniment to so much of life. My favourite quote from her is: ‘Even in a world that’s being shipwrecked, remain brave and strong.’ This optimism is needed.”In the last year, Hildegard has also inspired recordings by alt-popper Julia Holter, ambient experimentalists Larum, Catalan duo Tarta Relena and jazz duo Noah Preminger and Rob Garcia. Go back a few more years and the list expands to include New York vocalist Daisy Press – who combines Hildegard’s music with Hindustani ragas and performs it at sites from catacombs to Burning Man – as well as new age harpist Arianna Savall, experimental vocalist Megan Mitchell, Korean American sound artist Bora Yoon, and the doom metal musician Lingua Ignota, who was named after Hildegard’s mystical language. The abbess also inspired a 22-minute electric guitar piece by New Zealand underground stalwart Roy Montgomery, while folk-pop singer Devendra Banhart wrote Für Hildegard Von Bingen, which imagined her leaving her abbey behind and working on MTV. Grimes locked herself away like Hildegard for her 2012 album Visions, and in the 1990s even David Lynch produced an album of her music, performed by Jocelyn West (then Jocelyn Montgomery) of Miranda Sex Garden.But Hildegard’s big break didn’t come until almost nine centuries after she was born, with the 1985 recording A Feather on the Breath of God, directed by Christopher Page with soprano Emma Kirkby and Gothic Voices. Not much was expected of the release – “Lovely music, shame no one will buy it,” the sound engineer apparently said – but it sold in enormous numbers, clocked up accolades including a Gramophone award, and was sampled in club tracks by Orbital and the Beloved. It is still being repressed (most recently in 2024), and after that success, Hildegard releases began stacking up.View image in fullscreenWildly fruitful … engraving of Sister Hildegard by W Marshall in Fuller’s Holy State (1648)Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty ImagesThe rediscovery was perhaps inevitable. Although she wasn’t included in many musical histories until relatively recently, and was only fully canonised as a saint in 2012, we actually know a lot about Hildegard’s life. She was born in 1098 to a wealthy family, then taken into the care of a nun at Disibodenberg monastery in Germany’s Rhineland. She had already had visions from age three – neurologist Oliver Sacks suggested they were caused by migraines – but kept them private until appointed an abbess in her 40s. Medieval life expectancy meant these ought to have been her twilight years, but in fact the appointment triggered decades of wildly fruitful output. Her divine visions were transcribed; she wrote works on a raft of subjects; popes, kings and penitents sought her guidance.Her biographer,Fiona Maddocks, wrote that in order to fully get to grips with Hildegard’s output she would have liked to have become specialist in “12th-century Germany, medieval Latin, ecclesiastical history, the history of science and medicine, botany, mineralogy and petrology, zoology and theology, mysticism, music, painting and monastic architecture”. Hildegard is sometimes named the first composer in music history – although earlier names have since emerged – and is claimed as a feminist hero, radical polymath, ecological pioneer and, in some readings, queer icon, for the way she wrote of her love for her female mentors and peers.Her output comprises 77 liturgical, or plainsong, chants, known as her Symphonia, as well as a morality play with music that recounts the temptations of the flesh and the journey of a soul.Maddocks writesthat her music, with mellifluous melodies ornamenting the texts, “comes close to sounding like improvisation, developing organically rather than systematically”. Itfeelsfreeform in structure, soaring like a hawk in flight, tracing graceful patterns in the air and climbing to the heavens.Visionaries do things that stand outside of tradition – so their work has a timeless feelingJulia HolterHildegard’s melodies attracted Julia Holter, who drew on her work for the2024 song Materia. “Her melodic leaps create a singular harmonic world,” Holter says. “I’m always trying to write more melismatically – using more notes per syllable – and a lot of her music feels very melismatic.” Cannell, who has made various recordings drawing on Hildegard’s work, including an album in 2024, agrees: “There is so much movement, even if it’s not necessarily fast paced music. The melodies lift off straight away.”Part of the reason Hildegard resonates with contemporary musicians is that her music predates standardised tunings, so it often has an unfamiliar feel. We also don’t know exactly how it should be performed. Things such as pace, harmony or accompaniment are an open question, left to arrangers and performers to decide.View image in fullscreenJewelled and rich … a 13th-century illumination of Hildegard from the Biblioteca Governativa in Lucca, Tuscany.Photograph: Mondadori Portfolio/Mondadori/Getty ImagesFor all her skill, Hildegard wouldn’t have thought of herself as a composer – that term is ours – and debate rages in some quarters over whether she wrote her music at all. It’s possible the compositions were simply attributed to her as the head of her organisation, like a High Middle Ages version of Damien Hirst. I ask Maddocks about this and she is open minded: “How do we judge, say, a poem by ‘Anon’? Or think of Mozart’s Requiem – one of his most popular works, finished by someone else? Does it matter, or can we accept it on its own terms?”One of Maddocks’ favourite pieces is Columba Aspexit, for its opening line which translates roughly as “The dove flew through the lattice window”. “The titles are always so vivid and the language is so purple, so jewelled and rich,” she says. “Even if its origins are biblical, there’s a great feeling of the [Bible book] Song of Songs, and some very poetic language.”Hildegard’s poetic visions inspired the multisensory opera the artist and musician Nwando Ebizie has been developing since 2019, called Hildegard: Visions. She relates Hildegard’s hallucinations to her own experience of a neurological syndrome called visual snow. “People with visual snow syndrome are known to have breakdowns or feel like the world isn’t real,” Ebizie explains, which is why she became interested in Hildegard’s breakdown. “Her whole body was racked with pain, she couldn’t do anything. Then a clear mission came from God, and in her 40s she had this great flourishing, because she went her own way.” Hildegard’s music wasn’t written in spite of her breakdown but because of it: “It was related to her unique perception, and connection with spirituality.”Holter thinks the visions are what fascinate us today: “People are interested in unique perspectives, with a greater understanding and interest in neurodiversity ... Anytime you have ‘visionaries’ who do things that stand outside of tradition, their work can have a kind of timeless feeling.” For Cannell, too, Hildegard’s breaking of convention makes her a hero. “So often women are curtailed by expectations around what is ‘too much’, or what’s acceptable in society,” she says, but with Hildegard, “we can look back through the centuries and see a woman both prolific and inspirational. She made stuff, and she connected with people.”This article was amended on 15 July 2025 to refer to Hildegard von Bingen as Hildegard at subsequent mentions, rather than Von Bingen.Explore more on these topicsMusicPop and rockClassical musicExperimental musicReligionChristianityGermanyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

They will also ask for proof of insurance and your vehicle logbook (V5C), if you have one.You don’t need an international driving permit in the EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Iceland if you have a photocard licence issued in the UK.However, if you have a paper licence, you will need to update it to a photocard or get an IDP. Go togov.uk/driving-abroadfor details.… and what gear to packSome countries require drivers to carry certain things. For example, in much of Europe, including popular destinations such as France, Italy and Germany, you need a warning triangle. In some countries, including Germany and France, you will need a hi-vis vest, too.Don’t forget to use headlamp beam converter stickers to stop your headlights dazzling other road users. These are compulsory in places such as France. They can be bought easily for a few pounds.If you don’t have these things, an easy option is to pick up a European driving kit from retailers such as Halfords (£32.50 at time of writing) or the RAC (from £25.99).View image in fullscreenSome countries in mainland Europe require drivers to carry a warning triangle and a hi-vis vest.Photograph: Miguel Tamayo/AlamyUse a ‘UK’ stickerYou will need a sticker for your vehicle if your number plate doesn’t include the UK identifier with the union flag.If it has a GB identifier with the union flag, a euro symbol, a national flag of England, Scotland or Wales, or numbers and letters only, you must display a UK sticker clearly on the rear of your vehicle.If you are in Spain, Cyprus or Malta, you must display a UK sticker no matter what is on your number plate.However, you don’t need a UK sticker or identifier to drive in Ireland.Ensure you’re insuredAll UK car insurance policies automatically provide you with third-party cover while in EU countries, plus a few others including Switzerland. This covers your legal liability to others – for example, if you injure someone in an accident or damage their property – but won’t cover damage to your own vehicle.Most people will want to take their comprehensive cover with them, so check with your provider to see what is, and isn’t, included in your policy. The good news is that plenty of insurers automatically include driving elsewhere in Europe with their comprehensive cover. For example, with LV= you are covered for up to 180 days over the policy year, while all of Admiral’s comprehensive insurance, except for its Essential policies, includes 90-day European cover.View image in fullscreenCheck with your provider what is included in your car insurance policy.Photograph: Panther Media GmbH/AlamyBear in mind that with some companies you may only be covered for 30 days over the year.With others, such as Aviva, you only get third-party cover as standard, and if you want comprehensive for driving in Europe, you have to buy a policy add-on.Alternatively, you can buy short-term European car insurance from another provider to cover your trip. You can get this through a price comparison website. “You might find this to be an easier solution than adding cover to your existing policy,” MoneySuperMarket says.Get breakdown coverAgain, check if you are already covered. New cars often come with European roadside assistance, or breakdown cover, while the vehicle is in warranty. It may also be included in a monthly service plan or if you have the car serviced at a main dealer.A number of bank accounts – particularly paid-for ones – include European breakdown cover. Among them are Nationwide’s FlexPlus (which costs £18 a month), Monzo’s Max (from £17 a month) and the Co-operative Bank’s Everyday Extra (£18 a month).Barclays offers customers a “travel pack” add-on, costing £14.50 a month, that includes European breakdown cover and worldwide travel insurance (there is a six-month minimum term).For a big road trip it may be wise to go for something offering a bit more than a budget policyIf you don’t have any European breakdown cover, a few weeks’ worth should not break the bank.A Compare the Market comparison of single-trip policies for a 2019 Volvo V40, based on two weeks in France in August, found the cheapest policy was £31.79 from Cover My Breakdown.However, for a big road trip, unless you have a super-reliable car that has not given you any problems, it may be wise to go for something offering a bit more than a budget policy. For the scenario mentioned, the RAC would charge either £82.30 or £133.74 depending on the level of cover, while the AA wants £100.03, or £85.74 if you are a member.Beware clean air rulesIf you are driving to France, you need to be aware of the country’s low emission zones, and the clean air sticker – called aCrit’Air vignette– that you are required to display if you plan to enter one of a number of urban areas.These stickers are used to identify the vehicle’s emission levels and, in some cases, restrict access in order to improve air quality.“Although France’s National Assemblyvoted [in May this year] to scrap low emission zones(ZFEs), the rules around Crit’Air stickers haven’t changed yet. UK drivers still need the right sticker to enter many French cities,” the RAC spokesperson Rod Dennis says.Fail to comply and you could face a fine of up to €180 (£155).There are six categories in the Crit’Air vignette system, from green for the cleanest vehicles (for example, 100% electric) to dark grey for the dirtiest.View image in fullscreenBe aware of any stickers you may be required to display.Photograph: Elena Dijour/AlamyDrivers need to applyvia the official French government websiteand ensure their sticker is displayed before they enter France – so do not leave this until the last minute. For British vehicles, the sticker costs €4.91 (£4.23) including postage.Le Havre and its port are within a low emissions zone, says Brittany Ferries, while other cities operating zones include Caen, Rouen, Rennes and Nantes. Paris and Lyon have particularly strict rules.The RAC hasa useful webpagewith lots of information on the scheme and which towns and cities need a sticker, and the French government website for the schemehas information and a map.Think tollsWhen planning your trip, don’t forget to factor in the cost of any motorway tolls and consider how you will pay them.It now costs about €125 (£107) in tolls to drive from Calais to Nice on the south coast of France (so roughly double that for a return trip). You can avoid them, but this will almost certainly add time to your journey.ViaMichelin has a useful tool atviamichelin.co.uk/routesthat will calculate the estimated total cost of tolls and fuel for your journey.There are payment services you can sign up to that let you use the automated lanes so you can drive straight through and beat any queues, but unless you are planning a lot of journeys, it’s probably easier to pay as you go by credit card at the booths or machines. (That is, if you have a front seat passenger to lean out of their window to pay)Emovis Tag, for example, sells tags for France, Spain and Portugal, butthere are several upfront and ongoing charges, which may mean it is not cost-effective to use them for a one-off trip. If they do look good value for your break, LeShuttle’s car service isrunning an offeron the tags.The RAC has useful online guides to tolls inFranceandSpain.Explore more on these topicsMotoringMoney hacksConsumer affairsTravel insuranceEurope holidaysInsurancefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Emailfeast@theguardian.comAnna BerrillTue 15 Jul 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 15 Jul 2025 08.11 EDTShareMost stir-fry saucesare sweet, dense and cloying. Any lighter, fresher alternatives?Louis, FalmouthIf Julie Lin, author ofSama Sama: Comfort Food from my Malaysian-Scottish Kitchen, were to hazard a guess, it would be that Louis is buying shop-bought sauces: “They’realwayssweet and dense,” she says. “There’s a phrase we use in Malaysia,agak agak, which means to season until you know that it’s good for you.” And that’s only ever going to come from making it yourself, which for Lin often means her “master wok” sauce. To make a bottle, she combines 75g white sugar, three teaspoons of MSG, and 75ml rice-wine vinegar, and whisks until the sugar dissolves. Stir in 300ml light soy sauce and 100ml dark soy sauce, followed by 50ml sesame oil. Pour that into a sterilised jar or bottle, give it a shake and keep for a month at room temperature. That’s then ready to go, or customise it with, say, chilli or garlic, because one stir-fry sauce is not going to fit all. While the basic master wok number is a good shout for stir-frying noodles, rice or vegetables, however, “if you’re going for a lamb stir-fry, for example, you’ll probably want to add some cumin, garlic and maybe make it more vinegary.”For Justin Tsang, author ofLong Day? Cook This: Easy East Asian Recipes with a Twist, it’s all about balance: “The perfect stir-fry sauce has to be salty, sweet and umami, but it shouldn’t be one more than the other; it should work in harmony.” If your sauce is bordering on too sweet or dense, anything “a bit tart or fruity” will work wonders: “That could be some sort of acid, such as lime juice to finish, or vinegar, or a splash of sharp Worcestershire sauce,” says Tsang, who has also been known to add HP Sauce to the mix. Alternatively, get to know your onions: “Using the finest grater on a box grater, grate a white onion into an almost-pulp, then mix into your sauce, along with a splash of vinegar – that will cut through any sweetness and make it lighter.”Another shortcut to flavour is chicken stock. “People don’t think to add it to stir-fry sauce, but it waters it down and just makes it nice,” Tsang says. If noodles (egg, flat rice, vermicelli) are in play, he’d also whack in a load of finely grated garlic and ginger – “use a microplane to get them really fine” – plus fish, oyster and soy sauces: “But only enough to make you think it’s not going to do anything, because it will still build layers of umami.”If the goal is something lighter and brighter, Lin would knock up a quickbihun goreng, which starts with a base of onion, chilli and garlic. “Add whatever protein you fancy [chicken, pork, prawns, tofu], then tip in some light and dark soy sauce, sugar, vinegar and a bit of chilli oil.” In with some cooked rice noodles, then add any crunchy veg you have to hand: “Green beans or beansprouts, but don’t cook them too long that they lose their crunch, because you want some texture.” If you’re feeling brave, Lin adds, shove everything to one side of the pan, pour a beaten egg into the other side and scramble.” Let everything come together and serve with sambal and maybe a fried egg. Well, two eggs are always better than one.Got a culinary dilemma?

It’s one of those recipes where the ease is almost embarrassing. How can something so delicious be so straightforward? The burgers themselves are a simple food processor job; if you don’t have one, use chicken mince and make sure you really mix in the curry paste and courgette by hand. The accompaniments are also key: the lime-pickled shallots, the abundance of herbs and the creaminess of the mayo all work so well together. Turn up to a barbecue with a tray of these and I guarantee you’ll be dishing out the recipe in no time.Red curry chicken and courgette burgersPrep10 minCook30 minMakes43 shallots, peeled and finely slicedSea salt andblack pepper2 limes500g skinless and boneless chicken thighs1 courgette(about 250g), trimmed and coarsely grated2 tbsp red Thai curry paste4 burger buns4 tsp chilli jam4 tbsp mayonnaise, to serve½ 25g bunch each freshcoriander and mint, leaves pickedPut the sliced shallots in a small bowl and season with a good pinch of sea salt. Squeeze over the juice of one and a half limes, toss and set aside to pickle.Roughly chop the chicken thighs and put them in a food processor with the grated courgette and a third of the lime-dressed shallots. Blitz until the chicken is minced, then add the curry paste, season well and blitz again until smooth. Wet your hands and shape the mixture into four even-sized balls (if you are preparing them in advance, cover and store in the fridge.When you’re ready to cook, light the barbecue or put a griddle pan on a high heat. Smash the burgers either before you put them on the barbecue/griddle, or directly in the pan/on the grill, then cook for about five minutes on each side, until cooked all the way through.Meanwhile, cut the buns in half horizontally and toast for a minute on the cut side only. When the burgers are ready, baste each one with a teaspoon of chilli jam, so they’re sticky and glossy on the outside, then cook for a minute more.Spoon mayonnaise on the cut side of the bottoms of the buns, top with the cooked burgers, then finish with the picked herbs and the remaining lime-dressed shallots. Top with the bun lids and tuck in.Explore more on these topicsFoodBurgersBarbecueMain courseMeatChickenSummer food and drinkrecipesShareReuse this content"
