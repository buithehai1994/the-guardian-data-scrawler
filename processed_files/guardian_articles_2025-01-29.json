She wants to send the message that Britain is open for business. But the reality is that this will be mired in policy discussions for years and years.”TheLondonmayor, Sadiq Khan, reiterated his opposition to expansion and said he would use “whatever means we can” to stop it. “I’m simply not convinced that you can have hundreds of thousands of additional flights at Heathrow every year without a hugely damaging impact on our environment,” he said.Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of the budget airline Ryanair, called Reeves’s announcement a “dead cat” meant to distract from the lack of growth in the economy, which figures released next month are expected to show flatlined in the second half of 2024.Reeves said the government would be “inviting proposals to move forward by the summer”, with the government hoping planning approval could be granted by the end of this parliament in 2029. Heathrow has said the runway could be completed by the mid-2030s at the earliest.O’Leary said: “Talking about a third runway or having a big press conference about something that might or might not get delivered in 2040 gives the impression that she’s doing something about growth, when she knows that runway will not be delivered for 15 or 25 years.”The chancellor pointed to progress in making air travel greener, including by using sustainable fuels, but green campaigners dismissed that argument. Chaitanya Kumar, the head of environmental policy at the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said: “In justifying airport expansion while claiming commitment to net zero, the chancellor has leaned on false solutions – none bigger than the myth of sustainable aviation fuels. The government’s own projections show SAFs will barely cut emissions before 2040, with any gains wiped out by rising flight numbers.”Rosie Downes, the head of campaigns at Friends of the Earth, called Reeves’s growth-first approach “the kind of dangerously shortsighted thinking that has helped cause the climate crisis and left the UK one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world.”In another potential blow to the Heathrow proposals, it will be considered under government rules which are about to be updated to include tougher emissions targets, the Guardian understands.The previous airports national policy statement (ANPS) waspublished in 2018, when targets were less stringent.Siân Berry, the Green MP for Brighton Pavilion and a long-term campaigner against aviation expansion, said that considering a new runway under the updated targets meant the plan was “probably going to unravel when it faces climate reality and the law that we’ve already got in place”.Among Labour MPs, the influential Labour Growth caucus gave enthusiastic backing to Reeves’s speech. Chris Curtis, the Milton Keynes North MP who chairs the group, said businesses should know that Labour MPs would back the chancellor on planning and infrastructure.“This is not only a government who are on a mission for growth, but a movement on the backbenches of the Labour party which is leading the way,” he said.The shadow business secretary, Andrew Griffith, said: “Re-announcing long term investment plans is good but it’s no substitute for action today as businesses and workers are crying out for help. At this rate, new airport capacity will just help the last few remaining businesses leave the country faster.”Heathrow expansion was the most striking of a number of pro-growth policies highlighted by the chancellor as she addressed business leaders and cabinet colleagues at a Siemens factory in Oxfordshire.The government’s plan for kickstarting the stalling economy include a planning and infrastructure bill that would make it harder for major projects to be halted on environmental grounds and new remits for regulators to pursue growth.Separately, the Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, told MPs on Wednesday that he backed the government’s push to make watchdogs more growth-friendly, but said that it must not jeopardise financial stability.“Fundamentally, financial stability is a foundation for growth. So there isn’t a trade-off in the fundamental sense. Of course, we’ve seen the impact that a loss of financial stability can have in the financial crisis,” he said.Additional reporting by Kalyeena MakortoffExplore more on these topicsHeathrow third runwayRachel ReevesHeathrow airportLondonTransportTravel and transportAir transportnewsShareReuse this content"

This will double our capacity immediately.”The US naval base outpost in Guantánamo Bay, in south-eastern Cuba, already has a facility used to house migrants picked up at sea, which is separate from the high-security prison for foreign terrorism suspects established in the aftermath of theSeptember 11attacks byAl-Qaidaon the US.The secretive immigrant detention facility does not appear in public government reports, and details have only recently surfaced,including about alarming conditions.As of February 2024, four people were being held at the facility, the New York Timesreported, citing the department of homeland security.Trump made the initial announcementas he signed the Laken Riley Act, which mandates the detention of undocumented immigrants charged with theft-related crimes. The act is named after a 22-year-old nursing student from Georgia who was murdered in 2023 by an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela.The executive order about Guantanamo itself came a little later on Wednesday afternoon, saying from Trump: “I hereby direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland Security to take all appropriate actions to expand the Migrant Operations Center at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to full capacity to provide additional detention space for high-priority criminal aliens unlawfully present in the United States, and to address attendant immigration enforcement needs identified by the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security.”It added: “This memorandum is issued in order to halt the border invasion, dismantle criminal cartels, and restore national sovereignty.”Trump’s order on Wednesday marks the latest effort by the new administration to fulfill the president’s promised threat to remove millions of people from the country.Since taking office on 20 January, Trump has signed a slew of executive orders aimed at cracking down on immigration, includingdeclaringa “national emergency” paving the way to send US troops to the southern border,suspendingthe nation’s refugee resettlement program, andrevokingtemporary protected status for people fleeing humanitarian crises.According to aPentagon updateon 6 January, 15 prisoners remain at Guantánamo, the smallest number of detainees in the facility’s 22-year history. During final weeks in office, Joe Bidenaccelerated the transfer of Guantánamo inmatesto third countries.Cuba responded to Trump’sannouncementthat he plans to open a detention center for migrants at Guantánamo Bay, with the foreign minister claiming the idea “shows contempt towards the human condition and international law”.Writing on X, the US social media platform owned by Trump backer Elon Musk, Bruno Rodríguez Parrillaslammed“the US government’s decision to imprison migrants at the Guantánamo Naval Base, in an enclave where it created torture centers and indefinite detention”.Also writing on X, Cuba’s president, Miguel Díaz-Canel,called the plan“an act of brutality”.Amnesty InternationalsaidGuantánamo has been a “site of torture, indefinite detention without charge or trial and other unlawful practices”, adding that Trump should be using his authority to close the prison and not repurposing it for offshore immigration detention.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS immigrationDonald TrumpGuantánamo BayUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The bomb killed 29 people and injured 220. The inquiry chair, Alan Turnbull, described the impact as an “incomprehensible loss”.The inquiry was shown photographs of Grimes, her daughter Monaghan and little Maura, who won a “bonnie baby” competition during her short life, as well as ultrasound scan pictures of the unborn twin girls, who had been named Eimear and Evelyn. Mary and her husband had raised 11 children together, building up a large dairy farm. By 1998, Avril and her husband had four children and the twins on the way.In a recording played to the inquiry, Avril Monaghan’s daughter Aoibheann described Maura as a “source of light and joy to our family and everyone around her”, with a “bubbly personality and unmistakable head of curly hair”.“The Omagh bomb stole our mummy from her loved ones, leaving behind a grieving husband and three of her children, aged only five, four and three, as well as the wide Monaghan and Grimes families,” she said.“The loss we as a family have experienced over the last 26 years cannot be measured,” she said, adding that they “only hope that no other family has to suffer as we did”.Fearghal Grimes, Avril’s brother, described his mother, Mary, as a woman with a strong Catholic faith, a strong work ethic and a “deep sense of family values, and she lived these out every day”.“The Omagh bomb robbed us, her family, her husband, friends and neighbours, a chance to pay back the love and affection she had shown to all of [them],” he said.Earlier, siblings of a 16-year-old schoolboy killed in the Omagh bombing told how they had been forced to relocate from the town, such was the pain and grief they still feel over his loss. Claire Hayes, sister of Alan Radford, told how she had lost her “other half”.“There are no words for the immense grief that I feel, how shattered my life had been without him,” she said.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He accepted he once made inappropriate comments about one woman, for which he later apologised. He said in November 2023: “I have always disputed the content of the eight Guardian articles.”A Guardian spokesperson said: “Today, the judge rejected Noel Clarke’s application to strike out our defence. Lawyers for the Guardian told the court there is not one scintilla of evidence that journalists ‘fabricated’ evidence – a very serious claim made to launder into the public domain allegations that couldn’t have been made outside court.”“Our reporting on Noel Clarke in 2021 was based on the accounts of 20 brave women. After we published our first article, more women came forward.“At trial, 32 witnesses are set to testify against Mr Clarke under oath. We look forward to a judge hearing the evidence.”The judge said she would deliver her reasons for rejecting the application at a later date.Explore more on these topicsUK newsnewsShareReuse this content"

Venables, 29, pleaded not guilty to a single charge at Chester magistrates court on Tuesday.The prosecutor Valeriya Tonkinson told the court that Venables was seen driving on the A5480 in the west of the city on 8 January with the bumper sticker attached to her vehicle.Venables is due to face at the same court on 29 May. She was granted unconditional bail ahead of the trial.In 2011 the Manchester United fan Sarah Webb-Lee was told by police to remove an offensive bumper sticker that read: “On the first day God created United then completely fucked up and created City.” After police visited Webb-Lee’s Stockport home, she agreed to have a letter removed.During the 2019 general election campaign, remain supporters were pulled over by police on the M25 and told to remove “Bollocks to Brexit” car stickers. A passenger in the car posted a video on social media of the incident, which happened near Brentwood in Essex.On Christmas Day last month, Hampshire police pulled over the driver of a black BMW, alleged to have been doing 118mph, who had a sticker on the car saying: “My driving scares me too.” The motorist was stopped by police on the M27 between Portsmouth and Southampton at lunchtime, a post from the force on X said.A picture of the vehicle posted on the social networking site showed the yellow sticker, as well as others that read “Misunderstood” and “Too loud?

The incident took place on early Wednesday morning as large numbers of devotees went to bathe in the river, on one of the holiest days of the Hindu gathering.What is the Kumbh Mela?TheKumbh Melais the world’s largest religious gathering, widely seen as the “festival of festivals” in the Hindu religious calendar. This year it is being held in the north Indian city of Prayagraj, where it takes place every 12 years.Its origins lie in ancient Hindu mythology and the legend of demons and gods fighting over a pitcher, or kumbh, of the nectar of immortality, and drops falling on to the earth in four Indian cities.During the 45-day festival, Hindu holy men, known as sadhus, and hundreds of millions of devotees set up camp and take a dip in thetriveni sangam, the sacred confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers in Prayagraj, which they believe will cleanse their sins and free them from the cycle of reincarnation.Smaller versions of the Kumbh Mela take place every three years but the iteration held in Prayagraj is considered to be the biggest and most spiritually significant. This year’s celebration, which is expected to continue until 26 February, is particularly auspicious as it is the Maha, or grand Kumbh Mela, whichtakes places once every 144 years. It marks the 12th Kumbh Mela at Prayagraj and a special celestial alignment of the sun, the moon, Jupiter and Saturn.MapJust how big is the Kumbh Mela?Even in a country as big and populous as India, the scale of the Kumbh Mela is staggering. This time round, the government said it expected 400 million visitors – larger than the population of the US – to turn up over the total 45 days of the Kumbh Mela, which would be a record crowd for the festival. In 2019, a smaller version of the festival in Haridwar attracted 240 million people.Over the course of the festival, a sprawling temporary city of tents, stalls, toilets and elaborate temple facades are constructed along both banks of the Ganges, across a 40 sq km area. Each day, millions gather at thetriveni sangamto take a dip in the water, many having travelled for days to do so.As well as pilgrims, it is mandatory for tens of thousands of sadhus, who are part of monastic sects known as Akharas, to attend the Kumbh Mela and take part in several ritual bathes in the river. It offers pilgrims a rare opportunity to offer devotion to the naga sadhus, the naked, ash-smeared holy men who largely live an isolated life of meditation and prayer in ashrams.Spending for the festival has also increased to record highs this year, with the Uttar Pradesh state government reported to have spent 70bn rupees (£670m) on setting up the site and bringing in new technology to update the ancient festivities.What caused the crowd crush?Wednesday 29 January was considered one of the most auspicious days to take a dip in the holy river waters during the Kumbh Mela and was always expected to draw in huge numbers of pilgrims.According to government estimates, 100 million people were due to take a holy dip in the waters over the course of the day. It is also when the Akharas, the 13 monastic sects of sadhus, take part in theshahisnan, one of the biggest spiritual bathing rituals of the Kumbh Mela, which begins before sunrise.In the build-up, it had appeared the police had already struggled to manage the large numbers of pilgrims who were arriving. Many of the pontoon bridges and walkways were highly congested or shut off by police, leaving pilgrims and sadhus frustrated at the restricted movement around the site.As large numbers arrived on the riverbank late on Tuesday evening, the authorities began to urge pilgrims to take only two dips in the water and then leave the riverside quickly. But by the early hours of Wednesday, millions of pilgrims had continued to squash on to the area around the sangam, many falling asleep on the ground after the holy dip.According to witnesses, in the early hours of Wednesday, the crowd around the riverbank surged in multiple directions and people began to try to push their way out. Many fell over and were trampled, while many of those sleeping on the ground were crushed.1:20People rescued after deadly crowd crush in at India's Kumbh Mela religious festival – video reportWhat has the government response been?In the aftermath, dozens of bodies were seen lying on the ground around the banks of the river, and families sitting outside hospitals gave accounts of relatives who had been injured and killed in the crush. Local officials counting casualties into hospital tents said at least 39 were feared dead while other officials and doctors have given death tolls ranging from 15 to 50. A senior police officer, Vaibhav Krishna, told a news conference that 30 people had died.In a statement, the prime minister, Narendra Modi, offered condolences for the “lives lost”.The incident could have significant political implications for the government. The Kumbh Mela has taken on major political significance under the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP). The state and central BJP government launched a huge national publicity campaign around the Kumbh Mela, which is seen as a politically lucrative symbol of Hindu unity and strength, and posters of Modi and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, adorned every corner of the Kumbh Mela. Modi had earlier praised the “unforgettable crowds” that were attending the festival.Is this the first deadly crush at the Kumbh Mela?The Kumbh Mela has a chequered history when it comes to the safety of pilgrims. In 1954, at the first festival held after independence, nearly 800 people were trampled to death or drowned as they gathered to bathe in the river. There was another crush of people during the 1986 Kumbh Mela, which took 200 lives, and again in 2003, when 39 people died. At the 2013 Kumbh Mela, 42 people were killed in a crowd crush of devotees arriving at a train station, prompting an overhaul of security arrangements.Explore more on these topicsKumbh MelaIndiaHinduismReligionSouth and central AsiaexplainersShareReuse this content"

Yet it is an odd beast, perhaps because it is trying to do so much. It is partly an examination of the importance of the long-form political interview, for which Walden was famous, in a democratic society, and a lament for a bygone age when the argument for it could still be made. It is partly an examination of proximity to power and the cosiness that can develop between people who move in overlapping circles, the boundaries that can be crossed and what happens if you try to re-establish them. It’s about friendship, commonalities, betrayals of many kinds. It’s about 80s politics generally, Thatcherism specifically, the attraction felt for an ideologue and the ramifications when it wanes. It’s about class politics too, as Walden and Thatcher bond over their own-bootstraps upbringings and earned entry into the rarefied worlds of media and politics that their publicly schooled colleagues were effortlessly ushered into.It’s also a little bit about humanising rather than (further) demonising Thatcher, in showing what drove her and what she truly believed in. If she comes to look more admirable in her convictions than in previous portrayals, it is not revisionism at work but rather a measure of how extraordinarily, blatantly and provably venal and corrupt our last few crops of governing politicians have been. Are we in a bad way when Thatcher begins to look like the way and the light? Yes, yes we are.View image in fullscreenClunking (from left) … Emma Sidi as Sue Richardson, Ross Armstrong as John Wakefield, Steve Coogan as Brian Walden and Karan Gill as Vinay Ahmed.Photograph: Channel 4 / Matt FrostBut on with the show itself. In trying to do so much, it does – as you might expect – none of it quite well enough. The friendship, or at least the growing connection and understanding, between Walden and the prime minister and the difficulties and compromises it represents as the personal, political and professional collide is the most subtly worked element. The shading of Thatcher’s iconoclasm into isolation – the loneliness of rising to the top on your own terms – is convincing and (depending on where you stood in the 80s, how well you can put aside memories of the time) almost moving.But elsewhere there are great gobbets of exposition and extensive speechifying on every theme. “We were, still are, the only ones to put the interviewee through their paces for an entire show,” says London WeekendTelevisionproducer David Cox (Tom Mothersdale) as he tries to convince Walden to take over from Peter Jay as presenter of Weekend World. “Because political interviews ought to play a part in ordinary people’s understanding of the political landscape.” Got that? Similarly clunking scenes occur between cabinet members, especially when it becomes time to explain who stands where on Europe and the exchange rate mechanism versus a floating currency. And there is the occasional simply terrible line, such as Cox’s assurance to Walden as he preps for the great showdown: “You’re not a good interviewer, Brian. You’re an exceptional interviewer.” It makes for a herky-jerky dramatic experience, and this is – whatever it is billed as – a drama. The “docuseries” label is presumably demanded because verbatim extracts are performed by Coogan and Walters. But drama it is, and as drama, it fails to catch fire.This may also be due to the fact that Walden v Thatcher is not and never will be Frost v Nixon. It does not have iconic cultural status. Nobody remembers where they were when Walden asked Maggie if she was to blame for Lawson’s resignation. It was not instrumental in her downfall. He was in the right place at the right time, just as the resentful man-babies were gathering to push her off the cliff.Which is not to say Brian and Maggie isn’t interesting or doesn’t give you plenty to think about and chew over later (including the parts of the interview in which Walden criticises her inability to show warmth, which haven’t aged well in a more egalitarian age). But there is a detached, declamatory aspect to it overall that prevents the whole from triumphing.Brian and Maggie is onChannel 4now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSteve CooganHarriet WalterChannel 4Margaret ThatcherreviewsShareReuse this content"

Here’s how to use your kitchen’s most underrated asset to its greatest potentialTim DowlingWed 29 Jan 2025 08.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 08.04 ESTShareAlmost all of us have a freezer of some size, and yet so few of us maximise its potential. If you’re like me, it’s sat there filled with nothing more than a bag of peas, a half full sack of oven chips, a tray of ice cubes and some pre-pandemic fish fingers. But it’s always on, always consuming energy.It doesn’t have to be like this – your freezer is an amazing kitchen tool; the long-stay car park of your fridge. Because the freezer has been around for so long, we forget how versatile it can be. “If the freezer had never been developed and it came out like the air fryer did, people would be like, ‘God, this is amazing!’” says Suzanne Mulholland, the bestselling author and batch-cooking expert better known asThe Batch Lady.Mulholland, whose latest bookThe Batch Lady Rapid Dinnersis published on 13 February, likens her freezer to the advent of streaming. “Years ago you would have to wait for the adverts, and then you’d go running out to make a cup of tea,” she says. “Now we watch whatever programmes we want, we pause it, and we come back to it whenever we want. And that is what your freezer is allowing you to do. It’s allowing you that control where you don’t have to cook from scratch when you need to feed everybody, or when you’re hungry. You can cook when you want to cook, at a time that suits you.”Here, then, are 28 ways to get the most – and the best – from your humble freezer.1.Don’t worry too much about keeping your freezer completely full. The question of whether a full freezer runs more efficiently than an emptier one is endlessly debated, and largely misses the point: it’s barely worth your consideration.One US freezer manufacturer reckonsthat keeping your freezer completely full, as opposed to completely empty, would amount to savings of a couple of dollars a year. One thing is certain: an empty freezer consumes energy to no purpose, so put yours to use.2.Home freezing should be about making life easier. Mulholland deploys her freezer to spend less time in the kitchen, not more. “My background is that I’m a time-management specialist,” she says. “When I got married, had kids and left my lovely job in London, I suddenly thought, ‘This is ridiculous. There must be a much more efficient way to do this, rather than cooking from scratch every night.’”3.Cook double, freeze half. That’s the basic formula for successful batch cooking, according to Mulholland. “It’s very efficient, because you can double a recipe in about five minutes,” she says. “So five minutes extra to make a whole other night’s meal, and you’ve done the same amount of washing up and the same clearing up.”4. Start small. You don’t have to go all-in with a month-long meal plan. “I tell people, do it one night a week,” says Mulholland. “Just double whatever you’re doing that night and put it in the freezer. Because, I tell you, it becomes addictive.”View image in fullscreenFreezer bags are your friend.Photograph: Katelin Kinney/Getty Images5.Freeze your nuts. “Nuts and seeds go rancid very quickly, because they’re full of oil,” says food writer Jane Lovett, author ofThe Get-Ahead Christmas CookandDeliciously Simple. “Keep them in the freezer and they’ll be fine for ever more.” This applies to walnuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds, pecans and pine nuts. “You don’t need to thaw them out – you can use them straight away,” she says.6.Bear in mind that some things don’t freeze well. “Anything with a high water content will generally come out very soggy,” says Mulholland, “like lettuce or fresh tomatoes, as an example. There’s too much water in them, so when they freeze they crystallise, and then they just sort of go into mush when they come out.” However, if your fruit is going into a compote anyway, then mush is fine.7.Never freeze mushrooms. They will go slimy.Food left exposed to cold air will be subject to freezer burn – it won’t affect safety, but it will affect taste8.Get to grips with “open freezing”. In the simplest terms, open freezing is the home cook’s approximation of industrial flash-freezing. Spread whatever you’ve got – berries, chopped veg, individual biscuits, etc – on a tray in a single layer and freeze. That way it freezes faster and doesn’t stick together in clumps. Once everything’s rock hard you can transfer it to a freezer bag or tub, so you can thaw and use as much as you need.9.Freeze safely.According to the Food Standards Agency, chilled perishables can still be frozen until midnight of the “use by” date on the label, but home-cooked foods should be frozen as soon as possible (but not before they have cooled completely). Meat is generally best eaten within two or three months; fruit and veg will keep well for three or four months.10.Before you freeze something, get rid of any air.Foodsurfaces left exposed to cold air will dry out and be subject to freezer burn – it won’t affect safety, but it will affect taste. If there’s a big air gap in your half-full plastic tub of leftover sauce, use a smaller tub.View image in fullscreenUse your loaf … bread from the freezer is easier to digest.Photograph: Qwart/Getty Images/iStockphoto11.Get some freezer bags. They’re inexpensive, sealable, reusable and compact. “We use freezer bags for everything these days,” says Mulholland. “It’s the modern way to batch cook. We freeze everything flat, so it literally looks like books.” Flat bags save space, stay airtight and defrost much quicker. You can even buy compostable ones.12.Invest in a freezer-bag stand. “If you think about it, you’ve got a bag, you’ve got a pot, you’ve got a ladle, and you sort of need another set of hands,” Mulholland says. She uses a handy little two-pronged clip stand that holds your freezer bag open and upright. “They’re a phenomenally good gadget to have.”13.Defrost safely. According to the Food Standards Agency, frozen food – and meat in particular – should only be thawed in the fridge. Freezing doesn’t kill bacteria: it only pauses its growth. The more time meat spends in the “danger zone” between 8C and 63C, when bacteria can multiply rapidly, the greater the risk.14.Better still, learn to cook from frozen. “In my books, I always give a huge list at the beginning,” says Mulholland. “If you never want to defrost a meal and you always forget, here’s a list of everything in this book that will cook from frozen.”15.If in doubt, follow a freezer recipe. According to Mulholland, getting the best from your freezer means using a recipe intended for it. “If you put leftovers into a freezer, they’re not miraculously going to become an amazing meal,” she says. “The recipes that I write are freezer recipes. They are made for the freezer. They’re cooked in a different way.” Many of Mulholland’s recipes involve freezing the raw ingredients of a meal together – meat, veg, spices, everything – so they can be defrosted and dumped into a slow cooker.16.Roast potatoes can also be cooked from frozen. According to Lovett, frozen roast potatoes actually need less time in the oven. “I’m no scientist,” she says, “but I think the reason they cook quicker is because they’ve dried out a bit in the freezer, so they don’t have so much moisture.” To prepare the potatoes for freezing, peel them, cut them into evenly sized chunks and parboil for 15 minutes. Open-freeze them on a tray and when they’re hard, slip the potatoes into a freezer bag.View image in fullscreenRoast potatoes can be cooked from frozen.Photograph: stuartbur/Getty Images/iStockphoto17.Label everything clearly. This is a lot more important than it sounds: whenever you freeze something, write down what it is – and the date it went into the freezer – on the bag or container in indelible ink. “I always think I’m going to remember,” says Lovett. “I really don’t.” UFOs (Unidentified Frozen Objects) rarely escape the freezer, because nobody ever wants to take the risk.Whenever you freeze something, write down what it is: UFOs (Unidentified Frozen Objects) rarely escape the freezer18.If you run out of bags, don’t worry. Line a bowl with cling film, fill with soup, sauce or whatever, and freeze. As soon as it’s solid you can remove the bowl-shaped chunk of soup, wrap it up tight in the cling film and store in your freezer.19.Stock up on pre-chopped frozen veg. Bags of frozen pre-chopped and pre-sliced vegetables can save you a lot of time and effort, and if you’re using it in stews, casseroles or curries, you will notice little difference. “I’m a massive fan of already frozen chopped onions,” says Mulholland. “You buy them from the freezer aisle. You can also get already chopped herbs, things like ginger, garlic, chillies.”20.Save money. Prepared frozen veg is often cheaper than fresh (and often technically fresher, since it was frozen shortly after picking). Frozen broccoli florets, for example, cost about £1.19/kg, while fresh broccoli currently sells for around £2.19/kg, and fresh broccoli trimmed into florets can command as much as £9/kg.21.You can even buy a preprepared soffritto mix of finely diced carrot, celery and onion (sometimes sold as “veg base mix”) as the foundation for countless soups and sauces.22.Freeze breadcrumbs. Producing fresh breadcrumbs requires the purchase of a whole loaf of bread you might otherwise not need. Whiz the whole loaf into crumbs, and then freeze what you don’t use. “They don’t set hard,” says Lovett, “so you can take out as many as you like.”23.Freezing bread also isn’t just convenient – it’s better for you.It has been shownthat freezing bread turns some of its carbohydrates into resistant starch, which resists digestion and lowers your glycemic response (the rise in blood glucose after eating). Toasting bread does this as well; freezing and then toasting bread does it more.24.Freeze grated parmesan. “It’s a labour of love, grating two ounces of parmesan,” says Jane Lovett. “So I buy a great wedge of parmesan, more than I’m going to need.” She grates the cheese in large quantities using a food processor. “You can use it straight from the freezer.”View image in fullscreenFreezer cheese … grated parmesan.Photograph: Iryna Kharkova/Getty Images25.Freeze gravy. “If I’ve got leftover gravy,” says Lovett, “I just freeze it in a little tub or in a yoghurt pot, and I label it lamb, beef, pork, whatever it is. Then the next time I’m making that sort of gravy, I will add it, from frozen, to the gravy I’m making, which makes it even nicer.”26.Freeze fresh herbs. You can preserve the flavour – if not the structure – of chopped fresh herbs by freezing them in ice-cube trays topped up with water, or in freezer bags with a coating of some neutral oil. Alternatively, you can buy most herbs – including thyme, parsley, coriander and rosemary – already chopped and frozen from the supermarket.27.Freeze your egg whites. Like me, you probably use more yolks than whites over the course of a year. Also like me, you may well end up throwing your egg-white surplus away. But you can freeze them instead. After thawing, an egg white can still be whipped into stiff peaks. “The older an egg white is, the better it whips up,” says Lovett. One egg white, she says, is roughly equivalent to 30ml or one fluid ounce, allowing you to separate them into appropriate portions before freezing.28.Don’t buy ready meals when you can make your own. “I don’t want to go and buy a ready-made curry when I know that I can make a homemade curry in 10 minutes and it’s super healthy,” says Mulholland. “It’s a much nicer way to live. You’re managing to fulfil that lovely dream, which is eating really good, nutritious, home-cooked food, but you’re not slaving over a stove. I don’t like cooking – my publishers go nuts that I keep telling people that, but it’s true.”Suzanne Mulholland’s new book, The Batch Lady Rapid Dinners, is published by Ebury on 13 February.

As much for her as anyone listening. A battle for meaning. Music to the ears of insomniacs. Tractor production is up again.In fairness, you could say that none of this matters. You don’t pick a chancellor because she can deliver a decent speech. You pick her for her grasp of detail and understanding of macroeconomics. A serious subject demands a serious politician. Someone who can walk the walk. Even if she struggles with talking the talk.Let’s face it. You’d need to be a masochist to want Kwasi Kwarteng or Jeremy Hunt back. KamiKwasi was … KamiKwasi. Jezza was a nice enough bloke but he knew less about economics than I do. Chosen only because he was the last senior Tory standing. A man who could more or less pass himself off as a chancellor. Until he opened his mouth.Even so, a speech lasting 48 minutes felt like an act of cruelty. A throwback. Surely this could have been done and dusted in half an hour. After all, most of it had already been heavily trailed over the past week or so.Some of it was painful to listen to. Even Rachel could tell she was losing her audience at times. But she had no choice but to carry on as others zoned out. Three times she raised our hopes with the words “and finally”. Only to dash them. Not the beginning of the end. Merely the end of the beginning.This was The One with Rachel Talking About Growth. Just don’t call it a relaunch. Another relaunch, to be more accurate. For the first six months of its time in government,Labourhas struggled to get its message across to an indifferent country, and an overtly hostile media, and has sought to reinvent itself on at least three occasions. At times it has almost sounded apologetic for the measures it has taken rather than proud to take the necessary steps to get the economy and the NHS working again.No. This speech definitely wasn’t a relaunch. It was ground zero. Just pretend that last few months never happened. The speech the chancellor should have given much earlier. Right from the start, Reeves tried to be more upbeat. As though there were notes slotted in to the teleprompter reminding her to smile as she spoke. Less of the ministering angel of death. More the bringer of good news. Just a little awkward that Cheerful Rachel is Shouty Rachel. “Be happy!” she yelled.The opening 25 minutes were almost all vibes. Growth had been flat for a while. Blame the Tories for that. They had had 14 years to work on that and had achieved next to nothing. Her budget had been tricky. But necessary to fix the £22bn hole. She didn’t mention anything about it also having dented business confidence. Why bother? This was her speech. She could say what she wanted. And she was here to be upbeat. In any case, it wasn’t as if the Conservatives had come up with a better plan. They wanted the spending. Just didn’t want to pay for it.A sign started flashing at the back of the room: “Look happy.” There were worries Rachel might revert to her natural gloomy self. After stability, there would be reform. Remove regulations that were holding us back. This could have been the moment to say we would try to rejoin the customs union. The one thing that could kickstart growth almost immediately. Most of the country would love it. Only 30% now think Brexit was a good idea. But Labour dare not rock the boat.The red tape would be excised from planning laws. Bats and newts would get it in the neck. There would be no wildlife safe from a bulldozer. Cats. We had all had enough of cats. Don’t get her started on ferrets. Labour would be the party of the builders not the badgers. Sorry, blockers.You could sense that everyone in the room was beginning to flag. Journalists were beginning to look for a copy of the speech on their phone to see how much more there was of this to come. A lot. The man on the teleprompter was working overtime. Trying to speed the text through to make Reeves go faster. Alerts that she was losing the room.But Rachel is an economist through and through. Not one to be sidetracked. She had started so she would finish. “This is all welcome news,” she said. As if she felt she needed to explain that. Just in case anyone imagined she had inadvertently drifted off topic. Or nodded off.Still no one could ever claim Reeves was less than thorough. Or short of specifics. The last 20 minutes were given over to all the projects she intended to set in motion.

A golden rail link between Oxford and Cambridge, along with several new towns along the way. The green light for the third runway at Heathrow. Just don’t mention our net-zero commitments. Just bank on low-emission aircraft.There was just one catch. Many of these new announcements felt decidedly old. Politicians have been talking about the Oxford to Cambridge line for decades. Likewise the third runway. That’s been on and off for the last 20 years. Who knows if any of this will ever get built? Or whether it will do anything to deliver growth in the current parliament? Or whether the next government will cancel everything, cut taxes and crash the economy? Just for the hell of it.

He’s like a supernatural forceLeila LatifWed 29 Jan 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 17.03 ESTShareThe director Guillermo del Toro once saidIdris Elbahas “a supernatural gravitational force” and compared him to a “Rodin sculpture … [with] all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes”. It is those qualities – being a magnetic TV and movie star and an activist seemingly carrying the burden of the world on his shoulders – that makes him so compelling in Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis.The BBC documentary follows Elba throughout 2024, as he mounts a campaign to try to stop knife crime in the UK. The headlines have long been filled with tragic stories of young lives ended by blades, butin the past decadethe numbers have almost doubled, with four people in the UK dying from stab wounds every week. Elba first got involved in 2019, posting videos online about how more had to be done to stop it. Since then, he has become more informed and more involved. We watch him meet politicians, law enforcement officers, victims, prisoners, youth workers and trauma specialists to figure out a proactive – rather than reactive – approach, and carry out interventions in the lives of those who might one day become perpetrators.What takes this from being a good documentary to a great one is just how much complexity and nuance Elba and director Ben Steele are able to contain within its one-hour running time. It covers everything from the economic toll of recidivism to domestic violence in the home as early indicators, the lack of funding for youth programmes, the importance of mentorship and even how images of knife fights on social media can act as an incentive to carry weapons. The film immediately tackles common misconceptions around knife crime as a problem within black and brown urban communities, when in fact 69% of perpetrators are white and it is spreading fastest in Somerset, Bedfordshire and Sussex. Elba puts this gently to Tayla Pitman, the sister of 16-year-old Harold Pitman, who wasstabbed to deathwhile watching New Year’s Eve fireworks, and she responds: “Exactly, that’s the first thing that came out when Harry was killed was ‘I bet it was a black person’ and it wasn’t – it was another white boy.” But rather than just using her to vocalise a salient point, Elba extends warm empathy to the young woman, hugging her and commending her strength.Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis – trailerWith so many lives ruined, it would be easy to get caught up in the overwhelming statistics of these crimes, but Elba manages to convey just how seismic each loss is. Tayla is not the only person he meets who has been traumatised by knife crime; the charming youth worker Jhemar Jonas’s brother was stabbed to death at 15. Faz Ahmed, who runs a knife amnesty programme, was stabbed nine times on two occasions as a young man. And most harrowingly, Pooja Kanda’s teenage son Ronan had a sword plunged into his heartin a case of mistaken identity. The programme shows us disturbing footage of the event, with Ronan unaware of what is about to happen right up until the sword enters his rib cage from behind. Pooja sits in her son’s untouched bedroom two years on and recalls how each morning she’d rush straight in to his room for a cuddle. She can only say that: “Everyone failed. The police, education systems, the families. All those failures are why my son is not on this side of the bed. Why I’m not able to hug him.”Keir Starmer and Idris Elba launch project to tackle knife crime ‘national crisis’Read moreThe film is filled with heartbreak but is still ultimately an optimistic piece of work. It is packed with tangible solutions and examples of effective ways these crimes could be prevented if only those holding the purse strings would invest in solutions such as hospital interventions, knife amnesties and the scheme in Coventry (the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence, or CIRV) that takes 16-year-old Jayden – who was previously excluded from school and “felt naked” without a knife – and puts him on a path to becoming a football coach. It is made all the more maddening when the legislationElba backed to make it illegal to purchase “zombie knives”, machetes and ninja swords was rejected in May 2024 by the Conservatives. In the aftermath of that news, he seems crushed under the weight of political indifference and can only lament to the camera: “It felt like there was an attachment to swords which may have some traditional, heritage … thing. I just couldn’t understand it.”Still, Elba reminds us this is “a marathon not a sprint” and he will continue to do all he can to stop so many lives being destroyed by knife crime. By the time the programme ends, he has presented compelling arguments and practical solutions, met with King Charles, the prime minister and the home secretary. Despite making huge strides in his activism, he stays humble and says he considers himself simply “an amplification device”. But whether he’s a supernatural force, a Hackney boy done good or an amplifier for a noble cause, Elba is at the forefront of a vital documentary.Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewIdris ElbaKnife crimereviewsShareReuse this content"

How has it gone almost unnoticed?Rebecca NicholsonWed 29 Jan 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 09.57 ESTShareTrust Netflix to make absolutely no fuss whatsoever about Asura, which could be the best drama it has put out in years. The lack of fanfare for the series, quietly released in early January, is genuinely baffling. It comes from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously made the gorgeousThe Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko Housefor the streamer and was nominated for an Oscar for his majestic 2018 filmShoplifters, which also won the Palme d’Or. You would think those credentials might have earned this a bit of a push. Instead, we must rely on word of mouth, so here it is: this is a fantastic television series, and it would be criminal to let it pass you by.‘My father buried his friends in minus-40 Siberia’: director Hirokazu Kore-eda on trauma and childhoodRead moreAsura is an adaptation of a novel by Kuniko Mukôda, which was turned into a popular Japanese TV series in 1979. In Kore-eda’s reimagining, the four Takezawa sisters represent a different vision and version of womanhood and femininity during this period. Takiko (Yû Aoi) is a civil servant, working in a library, who is as buttoned up as her youngest sister Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) – a waitress with a deadbeat boxer for a boyfriend – is flamboyant. They are frequently at each other’s throats in some of the show’s funniest scenes. Oldest sister Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is widowed with an adult son, and arranges flowers for a local restaurant, while Makiko (Machiko Ono) is a housewife, the mother of two teenage children, and the centre of these women’s firm bond.View image in fullscreen‘A remarkable, empathetic drama’ … the Takezawa sisters: Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa), Sakiko (Suzu Hirose), Makiko (Machiko Ono) and Takiko (Yû Aoi).Photograph: NetflixDespite the constant scrapping between Takiko and Sakiko, the sisters are a solid unit throughout. It begins with a phone call from Takiko, urging them all to get together so she can share some important news. They suspect that she may finally be getting married, but the big reveal is even more explosive: she has spotted her elderly father Kôtarô (Jun Kunimura) with another woman, and a small boy, whom she overheard calling their father “papa”. There is proof, in the form of clandestine photographs taken by the private detective she has hired to follow him. How should they handle this revelation, and what does it illuminate about their own lives?There are seven hour-long episodes, and each is as strikingly beautiful as the last. It is stunningly shot, the sort of show where you want to linger on every detail. For non-Japanese speakers, like me, it urges a second watch, to catch those delicate moments you may have missed when reading the subtitles. The sisters express their personalities through their clothing, their homes, the things they eat and how they eat them. And there is a lot of food here, as should be expected from Kore-eda. This is not a series to watch when even remotely peckish. Food is ceremonial, bonding, a plot driver and a focus. There are Fuji apples (for their mother, Fuji), rice cakes, pickled cabbage, endless platters of sushi. Food is savoured and shared. I have never been so desperate to gobble up everything on the screen.View image in fullscreen‘Food is ceremonial, bonding, a plot driver and a focus’ … two of the Takezawa sisters with their mother.Photograph: NetflixAs with food, phones are a focal point, too. The drama kicks off with Takiko’s phone call, summoning her sisters, but as this is set in the late 1970s, the telephone is the instigator of many dramatic moments: one call brings terrible news, another – a wrong number of sorts – sows the seeds of suspicion that form deep roots. The initial call, about their father’s big secret, could have been played for tragedy, but here it is both significant and not: the lightness of the sisters’ discussion about it, which zigzags between shock and amusement, hints at the show’s careful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Its sense of humour is consistent, even in dark moments. It is much more laugh-out-loud than I expected it to be, and as a result, much more touching when the chips are down.All of this is a testament to how much Asura makes us care about the sisters, and how quickly it achieves this. In 1979, the behaviour of men is difficult for the women to confront, let alone question. But they quietly question it, in turn revealing hidden truths about their own moral compasses. There are affairs, difficult relationships, imagined infidelities and real ones. Following the news of their father’s affair and a possible fifth sibling, a letter appears in the newspaper, outlining the family’s predicament, with only a few minor details changed. The sisters suspect that one of them has written it, though its author remains mysterious. The letter builds towards a climactic question, which is really the driving force behind the series: “Is it really happiness for women like us to live without making waves?”The Takezawa sisters make waves, some large, some smaller, each gathering up the turmoil of the moment and letting it crash down, before starting again. Asura is full of heart, full of joy, a remarkable, empathetic drama that deserves far more attention than it has been given so far.Asura is onNetflixnow.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJapanese food and drinkNetflixJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Why weren’t we included in that meeting at work? Why did that stranger cut us off in traffic? Why is that friend still with her boyfriend even though he sucks?Enter: the Let Them theory.Someone cut you off? Let them. Your friend is still with their lame boyfriend? Let them. Every time you are about to start obsessing over someone else’s actions, remember: let them!The concept was recently popularized by motivational speaker and self-help guru Mel Robbins. “I just heard about this thing called the Let Them theory,” she told her millions of followers inan Instagram postin May 2023. “I freaking love it.”The video quickly went viral. Peoplegot“Let Them”tattoos. In December 2024, Robbins released a book, The Let Them Theory. It became a New York Times bestseller.CNNand theNew York Timesinterviewed Robbins. Oprah talked about it onher podcast, saying: “This book is a game-changer. It’s a life-changer.”I’m a hopeless people pleaser. I tried saying ‘no’ for a weekRead moreThere are some important caveats to the theory, according to Robbins. First, she argues, “let them” only works if it is followed by “let me”. In other words, it is not an excuse for inaction. Accepting that we can’t control other people’s actions is a reminder that we are entirely responsible for our own. You are not responsible for someone cutting you off in traffic, but you are responsible for not flipping them off and shouting obscenities out the window.Also, there are certain situations in which you should not, under any circumstances, “let them”. Robbins explained in apodcast episodethat the theory does not apply if someone wants to do something dangerous or if you see someone being discriminated against. In those cases, she says, you must speak up. Second, you must always advocate for yourself and what you need – negotiate a higher salary, for example, or insist on getting the medical care you need. Finally, if someone continually violates your boundaries, you should not “let them” do that, Robbins says.The “let them” concept is not without its critics. People have argued that the theory isstoicism repackaged. Others havecriticizedRobbins for not crediting poet Cassie B Phillips, whose poem Let Them went viral in 2022.(When I emailed Robbins for comment about Phillips’ poem, she responded: “The Let Them Theory has its roots in Buddhism, Stoicism, the Serenity Prayer, the legacy of Dr Martin Luther King Jr (his son gives a quote in the book about it) and therapeutic modalities like Detachment Theory and Radical Acceptance! I believe that’s why sayingLet Them and Let Meis so powerful – it feels familiar to everyone because it is.”)And some think it’s simplytoo obviousand flimsy an idea to sustain an entire book.Graphic with three lines of text that say, in bold, ‘Well Actually’, then ‘Read more on living a good life in a complex world,’ then a pinkish-lavender pill-shaped button with white letters that say ‘More from this section’Robbins herself acknowledges this. As she told the New York Times: “Yeah, it’s a cheap trick –andit works.”Robbins, an author, podcaster and former lawyer, is not a mental health professional. But experts agree that giving up on trying to control the behaviors and actions of others can be hugely beneficial – not only for yourself, but for the people around you as well.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Selene Burley, a licensed therapist in California, says she has shared the theory with many of her clients. “It’s been eye-opening for them,” she says.Burley says it’s been especially helpful for those who struggle with healthy boundaries. “The Let Them mindset simplifies it in a way that feels approachable and empowering,” she says. “It shifts the focus from controlling or fixing others to accepting what’s within your control – your reactions, your focus, your peace.”Is being a cynic bad for you? Here’s what I learnedRead moreBurley adds that she’s used the mantra in her own life, as a reminder to let her children make their own decisions and learn from their mistakes. “Letting them figure things out on their own is hard sometimes, but it’s so good for them and for me,” she says.Like many, I came across the Let Them theory on social media. The idea seemed useful, although I fancied myself pretty good at boundaries already. Live and let live; not my monkeys, not my circus, etc.Then I realized how often I found myself thinking: “Let them.” When two friends butted heads, it took everything in me not to intervene and smooth things over. “Let them,” I thought, every muscle in my body tense with anxiety. After an argument with a loved one, I stomped on the treadmill for an hour, jaw clenched, and mentally fumed: “Let them.”The phrase was not a panacea. It still took time for whatever emotion I was feeling to pass. But saying “let them” prevented me from being reactive. It gave me space to pause and remind myself that my own actions are all I can control. Annoying! But also liberating. When you are not wasting time trying to think about how you can control other people, you have more time to think about other things, such asbooksorpants.Burley says “let them” is a piece of advice she wishes she had heard sooner. “It’s a reminder that it’s OK to step back, let people be who they are, and stop carrying things that aren’t ours to carry.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyMental healthPsychologySocial mediafeaturesShareReuse this content"

The two-hour film, made over the course of six years, also documents prisoners’ longstanding efforts to improve conditions deemed “unconstitutional” by the US justice department in a 2020 report, under constant physical threat from prison management. Despite federal calls for prison reform, Alabama’s prisons currently operate at 200% capacity, the film notes, with only one-third of the required staff. The state’s prisons have the highest rates of murder, drug addiction and death in the country.“This film is a lot to take in. It’s difficult to watch,” said Jarecki to a braced, impassioned crowd, including the families of incarcerated Alabamans, at Tuesday’s premiere. “I hope you feel as emotional about it as we do.”Jarecki and Kaufman began the project inadvertently, when Jarecki visited Montgomery, Alabama, with his family. There, he met a prison chaplain who offered to bring him along to an annual revival and barbecue at Easterling correctional facility – the rare event permitting a camera. The Alabama department of corrections (ADOC) is legally allowed to bar journalists access to state facilities, in effect making the state’s prisons, which house close to 20,000 people, a black box of information.Once inside Easterling, Jarecki was approached by incarcerated people – overwhelmingly black and brown men – asking to speak off camera about the dire state of affairs at the facility. “This ain’t fit for human society,” says one. “They don’t want you to see the slave labor going on inside,” says another. “We’re at a humanitarian crisis level.” Before Jarecki was forced to stop filming, the camera records men calling for help from behind bars, forced to endure sweltering heat and filthy conditions.Soon, inmates began reaching out to the film-makers via contraband cellphones, which they used to document an outrageously brutal and broken and corrupt systemdesigned to exploit human labor. Led by the incarcerated activists Melvin “Bennu Hannibal Ra-Sun” Ray and Robert Earl “Kinetik Justice” Council, the network of sources recorded officer beatings, unsanitary conditions, rampant drug addiction (supplied by officers on the black market) and first-person testimony at great personal risk. Council wasnearly beaten to death by guardsduring the course of production and lost sight in one eye; another source recorded smears of blood trailing from Council’s cell after he was dragged away, unconscious and facedown.The film takes its name from the prescribed reform by Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, to a systemsuedby the justice department in 2020 over “systematic” violence and abuse – “an Alabama solution to an Alabama problem”. As in, sticking to Alabama’s tradition of rejecting federal mandates for civil rights. As the film notes, the state has long required federal interventions for reform, such as forcing Alabama to eliminate slavery during the civil war, endingdebt peonagein the early 20th century, federalizing the national guard todesegregate the state’s schoolsin 1963 and preventingdiscriminatory voting practicesin the 1960s.View image in fullscreenProducer Alex Duran.Photograph: Maya Dehlin Spach/Getty ImagesAccording to inmates and substantiated by cellphone footage, conditions in the state’s prisonshave not improvedsince the justice department ordered the ADOC to reform in 2020. Instead, Ivey ordered the construction ofthreenew prisons, diverting$400min federal Covid-19 relief funds – 20% of the money for the state worst hit by the virus – as well as $100m from the state’s education budget. At the same time, the state’s parole ratesplummetedby 72%. The overwhelming number of parole requests are now denied.While inmates documented prison abuses, The Alabama Solution also investigated the death of Steven Davis, who was killed by officers at the William E Donaldson correctional facility in October 2019. The film-makers follow his mother, Sandy Ray, as she is repeatedly denied information about her son, who was beaten beyond recognition. Eventually, she hears the state’s explanation on the news: Davis threatened officers with a knife, according to the ADOC, necessitating physical force in self-defense. But numerous witnesses told lawyers that Davis only wielded a plastic knife, which he threw away when told to lie on the ground. Four officers beat him anyway; one, Roderick Gadson, beat Davis with a metal baton and stomped on his face, bouncing his head off the concrete floor “like a basketball”, according to one source.After three years of obfuscation and investigation, the state declined to press charges. Itsettleda civil suit by Ray for $250,000, never admitting wrongdoing. Gadson, who faced more than 20 separate lawsuits alleging excessive force, has since been promoted twice. The state paid for his legal bills, as well as those of all other officers. In the past five years, according to the film, Alabama has spent $51m defending officers from misconduct lawsuits.All the while, the state reaps the rewards of forced labor. Incarcerated peopleprovide $450min goods and services to Alabama each year, whether in its 13 prisons or outside them, as inmates are leased to corporations and state projects for what some havecalledmodern-day slave labor. One incarcerated man notes the great irony that though he is repeatedly denied parole because he’s considered a “threat” to citizens, he is still trusted to work in the community, even on the governor’s mansion.“Forced labor is coerced because of these violent conditions” in prisons, said Jarecki at a Q&A following the film’s premiere. Officers “have a huge amount of leverage over these men”. And yet, despite overwhelming odds, Ray and Council helped organize astate-wide prisoners’ strikedemanding better conditions in October 2022. Though the effort received national attention, Ivey deemed their demands “unreasonable”; footage in the film shows how the ADOC ended the strike by starving prisoners en masse.Though focused on Alabama, the film reminds that such exploitation is not just an Alabama problem. “What you see in this film is going on all over the nation,” said producer Alex Duran, who spent 12 years incarcerated in New York. The liberal bastion of California, for example, recentlyrejected a ballot measurethat would have banned forced prison labor, and the statedeployed 1,100 incarcerated firefightersto the frontlines of Los Angeles’s deadly blazes; they werepaidbetween $5.80 and $10.24 daily – less than minimum wage.In a prerecorded message at the premiere, Council and Ray issued a blunt call to action in every state. “You should be demanding access to the inside of these prisons and the people who are being warehoused in your name,” said Ray. “We don’t know what tomorrow might bring. But what we do know about today is that we’re going to give everything that we have in the struggle for freedom.”“The Alabama Solution is a culmination of 50 years of work” from incarcerated activists, Council told the audience directly, as he surprise-called from the Limestone correctional facility. Council now leads a class-action lawsuit against the ADOC which, like the justice department suit, remains in litigation.He thanked viewers “on behalf of the brothers who didn’t make it, who didn’t live to see this, and on behalf of the brothers who participated and contributed to make it happen”.“We’ve gone as far as we can in depicting every aspect of what life is like in here,” he said. “This is where we pass the baton to you.”The Alabama Solution is screening at the Sundance film festival and will be released later this yearExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025Sundance film festivalDocumentary filmsUS prisonsAlabamaFestivalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Not among the VIPs in that Oxfordshire hall but far outside, from a woman in Newcastle.I have told her story before: as the Brexit vote loomed, a London professor warned the geordie heathens that leaving Europe would harm the UK’s economy. Then one of the aforementioned heathens yelled back: “That’s your bloody GDP. Not ours.”Rude, crass? Absolutely. Yet she raised one of the big questions for the Westminster classes, which cuts to the very heart of politics. Jabbing a finger into a navy lapel, it demands: who are you actually helping? The answer sealed the fate of George Osborne and David Cameron, and it will prove as decisive for Reeves and Keir Starmer.No one can be unclear what thisLabourgovernment wants. “Growth, growth, growth,” clapped Reeves this week, as she strode into a meeting of Labour MPs. Even after the Christmas pantos, ministers are staging their own version of Peter Pan: they close their eyes – andbelieve! The prime minister dreams of a “growth lever”; the chancellor wants everyone to “start saying ‘yes’”. And from the stalls cry the humble voters: further and faster!Magic shall happen. The G-word will be slapped across everything that moves – and quite a few things that don’t any more. Whitehall has already stuckout a press releaseclaiming “the need for people to queue at the local council to register the death of a loved one” is “getting in the way of growth”. That’s the real downer about death – it gums up income streams.What ministers want is photos of them wearing hard hats and hi-vis. Here is Angela Rayner, whooping it up in front of a half-built housing estate. There is Ed Miliband, peering intensely at a windfarm. You may recall another politician trying this tactic: George Osborne touring construction sites to distract attention from the misery he was inflicting on the working poor. Even as Labour ministers rejoice in infrastructure projects to come on stream at the earliest by the end of the 2020s, their chancellor is readying another burst of austerity for this April. From next Tuesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility will start laying out how far adrift public finances are from the fiscal rules that Reeves claims are “non-negotiable”. With the economy flatlining since summer, she is preparing to cut social security, as well as civil servants’ jobs.What would our heckler in Newcastle make of this? I think we can guess. What drove so many towards Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn or even Boris Johnson was a failed economic model that boasted of itslow tax, low costs and low regulation. Now that low tax is no longer an option and Britain has broken off its close trading relationship with Europe, the Labour government is stripping out whatever regulation it can.The same ministers who harrumphed about rip-off prices for Oasis tickets now order watchdogs to be “pro-growth”. They oust one chair of the competition regulator to bring in a guy from Amazon – lambasted by Reeves in 2018 as“one of the new monopolies”that “block competitive markets, avoid taxation and impose oppressive control over their employees”. Starmer, Miliband and the five other cabinet members who in 2018 rejected a third runway at Heathrow as a climate disaster have lost their sense of shame. In the name of growth, the governmentsupports car finance companies over consumers, and calls for mortgage lenders to be allowed toload up first-time buyers with more debt, even while financial regulators warn parliament that this will heap upbad loans and fraud.Growth strategy? This is more like a trolley dash, grabbing whatever’s close to hand and might do. Forswearing big tax rises before the election, increasing taxes by £40bn after it; a giant fund for investment in green energy that shrinks before our eyes;“growth everywhere”, which turns into sweeties for London and the south; austerity is over, apart from for all those government departments starved of funds. The same week that Joe Biden warned of anew tech oligarchy, his former students in Downing Street cosied up to the AI sector.A Labour government that promised change is, for now, trying to attract investment – and doing so in the most craven, credulous fashion imaginable. So the chancellor who vowed to stamp on tax loopholes for non-doms now says she is “listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”. The non-dom community! Here is identity politics at its most fraudulent. Whatever next, a Non-Dom History Month? Note that the chancellor hasn’t paid so much attention to those who can’t afford to heat their house this winter.Such politics would once have been labelled trickle-down – except not much actually trickled down at all. As the Foundational Economy Collective of academics and researchers show, of all the growth in take-home pay between 1999 and 2020, the top 10% of households made off with 25%,while the bottom 10% got only 3%. The papers that were full of talk about a cost of living crisis no longer talk about it, but for poor people it hasn’t gone away. Between 2022 and the eve of last summer’s general election, the researchers found, the poorest 10% were spending 95% of any increase in disposable pay on food, rent, energy and transport – the essentials to get by.Whose bloody GDP is it? Rather than offering big companies sweeteners in exchange for photo opportunities, and claiming it’s in aid of growth, Labour ministers should instead focus on protecting households from utility bills and transport and housing costs, which remain high and will not be falling far any time soon.The polling shows that is what voters actually want. Two surveys this week alone show the cost of living near the top of thereasons voters give for being angry at Starmer, just after cutting winter fuel allowance. But I suspect ministers will not listen until next year, by which time the photo ops will not have translated into better polling and Nigel Farage’s troops will be preparing to wipe the floor with Labour in theelections for the Welsh Senedd. Ah well: roll on the next reset.Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Ask someone who knows about these things how to fix the zip on your coat, and they’ll pull a licked lemon of a face. Gravely, a head will be shaken. Very difficult, if not impossible. But why, you demand. It just is, you are told.Early in the last decade, when I had more money than sense, I bought an absurdly expensive coat by mistake. I was at Heathrow’s Terminal 5 flying somewhere to cover a Champions League football match for ITV. Making my way to the gate, which was showing last call, I realised I hadn’t brought a coat. I think it was Basel we were off to, in late autumn. I’d need a coat.I thumped my forehead with the heel of my hand, ran into the Harrods concession, tried on a coat, paid for it and fled. It was made by Dunhill out of some technical fabric and had a detachable inner bit to keep it relevant all year round. Just the job.It was only when I took my seat on the plane that I saw the receipt: more than £600. Even though I was sitting down, I thought I might keel over. Next to me was my colleague, the ex-Arsenal player Lee Dixon. I showed him the receipt. Sometimes, he said, you really are an idiot.I got the coat home, locked it away, and set about forgetting that the whole sorry incident had ever happened. Eventually I started wearing it, and before very long the zip bust. It did that thing when it splays open from the bottom. Humiliating, somehow. It was just the little thingy that had gone, the tiny thing at the bottom that you insert into the zipping thing before zipping it up.I went to a repair shop. “Can you fix this?” I asked. “No,” said the woman. “But it’s only this little thingy,” I pleaded. “You must talk to the maker,” she insisted.I made an appointment – yes, really, an appointment – to consult with Dunhill, whose shop is tucked away on one of London’s most exclusive streets. As I approached the door, as if by magic a man appeared to open it, usher me in, show me to a seat and offer me a drink. Seemed a bit over the top. I suppose this is what it’s like at the dealership if you take your Rolls-Royce in for a service.I’d done a bit of research on zips and discovered that my missing thingy is called the insertion pin. Sounding incredibly Brummie in that environment, I said: “Have you got a spare insertion pin for this, please?” I could see in his eyes this was the daftest question that had ever been asked in this shop.This year, I want to say thank you more. Here’s why you should try it too | Adrian ChilesRead moreHe explained that not only would the whole zip have to be replaced; the whole coat would have to be pulled apart in order to do so. And they couldn’t do that anyway, because mine was from the Links range, which had been discontinued. He said he knew a tailor on Savile Row who might – might! – consider doing it, at a price in the region of 250 quid. Not for the first time with that wretched coat, I worried about collapsing from a seated position. And get this: the Savile Row tailor eventually said he wouldn’t do it for any price.What is it with bloody zips? For the want of a thingy a zipper wouldn’t zip, and for want of a zipper this epically expensive garment was useless.I got a persuasive mate who does business with the original repair shop to beg the woman there to perform the operation after all. And after a week or so, it was done. Rejoice. And then the zip pull on the pocket went. And the only thing I’ve been able to find to replace it with is a cheap keyring with a black plastic fob. I hate zips very much. I’ve lost all faith in them. I’m now phasing them out of my life.Adrian Chiles is a broadcaster, writer and a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsSewingOpinionMen's fashionMen's coats and jacketsCraftcommentShareReuse this content"

It should be Dowlais, theFTSE250 company whose main business carries the grand historic UK manufacturing name of GKN Automotive, buying its US rival, the Detroit-based American Axle & Manufacturing.Instead, the transaction is acash-and-shares offer for Dowlais at £1.16bn, or 85p a share. The terms cannot be described as punchy when you remember that the business was demerged from the FTSE 100 firm Melrose at 120p as recently as 2023.Dowlais was always the smaller sibling in the old GKN, the mainly aerospace company bought by Melrose ina fiercely fought hostile takeover in 2018. But the demerger and independence was supposed to herald a new era of opportunity for a restructured business that has genuine claims to being world-class in its field. It is the world’s largest maker of drive systems – the bit of the vehicle that connects the wheels to the engine – and looked more likely to be predator than prey in any round of consolidation among global car component manufacturers.Instead, the opportunity on the table is to fold itself into a US company that is smaller in terms of revenues, stock market value and number of employees (30,000 plays 20,000). No doubt the industrial logic is sound but this is a reverse takeover in effect – thus the need for half the offer price to be in cash to ensure American Axle’s shareholders emerge with 51% of the combined entity.Dowlais/GKN Automotive’s importance to the UK economy is not what it was, to put it mildly, which is why the deal caused no embarrassment to the chancellor onthe day of her big growth speech. The UK operational base shrank with the rest of the automotive industry over the generations; the last UK plant, at Erdington in Birmingham,was closed on Melrose’s watch in 2021. Annual global revenue is £5bn but this UK-headquartered company has just 37 UK-based staff.The urge to merge also flows from global factors. The stop-start nature of the transition to electric vehicles is causing havoc everywhere, from VW to Nissan. At the end of the supply chain, suppliers are also obliged to seek savings – and Dowlais and American Axle think they can find an annual $300m (£240m) in synergies.But, in another respect, this transaction should be painful for a UK chancellor. Or, at least, it underlines a problem Rachel Reeves has identified herself: the sleepy state of the bottom end of the UK stock market. Outside the FTSE 100 index, and especially around the £1bn-ish level, even quality companies struggle to grab investor attention.In a different world, Dowlais’ well-regarded management would be able to grab the steering wheel themselves and summon support for a bid for American Axle. In reality, there’s not a chance of that happening. Thus another UK company will join the long list of those departing the London stock market (assuming the deal survives the initial 9% drop in the US firm’s stock price).There’s no quick way to revive investor interest in the likes of Dowlais. Cutting stamp duty on shares would help,as this column has arguedrepeatedly, but the rest of the script is about prodding, cajoling and incentivising UK pension funds to pay more attention to their home patch. Efforts in that direction have already taken an age. While we wait, the crisis in the UK stock market gets worse.Explore more on these topicsMergers and acquisitionsNils Pratley on financeStock marketsAutomotive industryGKNMelroseFTSEcommentShareReuse this content"

The right was furious – so were progressivesWed 29 Jan 2025 11.40 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 12.04 ESTShareOne certainty we can rely on in these distressing and turbulent times is that while every right-thinking person is looking with horror towards Donald Trump, many of us also reserve significant side-eye for each other. What is a political opposition without instant, feverish infighting, the pettier the better? I refer you to Selena Gomez’snow-deleted Instagram videoon Monday in which the actor sniffled and wept about Trump’s immigration crackdown. The 32-year-old was instantly trolled by Trump-loving monsters, but there were plenty of sighs and tuts coming at her from Trump haters, too. Gomez had Done the Wrong Protest and would have to pay.The difficulty of course is that Trump’s “flood the zone” approach in his first week of office has made organising a response to him incredibly hard, not just collectively but at the individual level. What is the right reaction to a president who, five minutes into his tenure,launches a crypto coinin his own name, appointsa TV hostto run the US military and attempts to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding – and that’s before you get to his interesting take on the14th amendment?One response – which achieves absolutely nothing but can be hard to resist – is to cave in to the guilty suspicion that, in this bleak new world, all displays of frivolity are wrong. Not just frivolity, but anything that might be deemed trivial, self-serving or irrelevant to the calamity at hand. A similarly queasy vibe took off in the weeks and months after September 11, the so-called death of irony period that was dispatched pretty much overnight when people started tagging the joke phrase “or the terrorists have won” on to the end of any statement announcing a trivial desire.As in 2001, part of the anxiety of this moment isn’t so much the possibility that doing something silly or fun while millions are at risk of deportation is wrong, but that it will look wrong to those keeping score. And there are a lot of scorekeepers out there, the self-appointed hall monitors who pop up on social media to scold and one-up their friends and acquaintances for, as they see it, doing or saying the wrong things about Trump. Over the past week I have seen online skirmishes between Trump haters in which one might call out another for being too “giggly” or self-satisfied or irresponsible in their statements – or, using the strongest language available to people of British origin, accuse someone of “being unhelpful” in their pushback against Trump. The subtext of which is: “I am taking this more seriously than you are.”Of course by criticising people for wrongly criticising others, I’m aware I am merely expanding the ever-increasing circles of leftwing policing so that, eventually, the dog will eat not just its own tail but its own shoulders and head. I’m also being disingenuous about the amusement there is to be had here – in these dark times, there is a certain low-level enjoyment in watching bun fights take off between people one was inclined to hate before Trump took office and with whom one claims no solidarity now. I spent fully an hour last night sharing screen grabs from social media with friends that captured the huffy and frankly hilarious moral one-upmanship of some of these people.Which brings us, in a roundabout way, to Gomez and the problem of celebrity involvement in current affairs. Popularised during the pandemic, this is the phenomenon of famous people making sad faces on social media in what is either a well-meant but misguided effort to put their social capital to good use or else a cynical piece of attention-seeking. In the Gomez video this week, the star ofOnly Murders in the Buildingsniffed and sobbed and covered her face while offering muffled condolences to those getting deported. She said: “I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something.”Selena Gomez laughs off Republican calling to ‘deport’ her over Ice raid videoRead moreAs these things go, it was a good deal less skin crawling thanAriana Grande’s post-election threatto hold “the hand of every person who is feeling the immeasurable heaviness of this outcome today”, a statement that around my way triggered a wave of prim “no thank you!”s. And it seems likely to me that Gomez, who is of Mexican heritage, was acting out feelings she genuinely had. Fair play to her, I say.Anyway, when things kick off between people on the same side, everything always ends in a pissing contest along the lines of: “You see fit to criticise me, but what areyoudoing to help the cause?” To which the aggressor may respond with versions of: “I’m not telling you because I don’t need to boast about it.” Which I take to mean: nothing at all.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

I blame the teachersWed 29 Jan 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 09.09 ESTShareParents, beware! If you send your impressionable young child to school in the US they are at risk of contracting a nasty case of the woke-mind virus. There’s a good chance a teacher will turn your kid trans and, in the middle of maths, whip out surgical equipment to perform gender-affirming surgery. We know this because – despite any evidence to back it up – our esteemed leader,Donald Trump, has said as much.“Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, ‘Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school,’ and your son comes back with a brutal operation,” Trump said at arally last year.No, actually, I can’t imagine that. But due to a recent personal incident I do now understand why the Maga crowd are constantly banging on about kids beingindoctrinated at schooland why there’s been asurge in home schooling. My three-year-old daughter, you see, has been brainwashed by her preschool: a few weeks ago she came home singing “Fly, Eagles fly” at the top of her little lungs, and she hasn’t stopped since. US readers will know exactly what I’m talking about, but for those who need a primer: I live in sports-obsessed Philadelphia, and the Eagles are Philly’s football team. (It’s possible you already know this because the NFL is being heavily marketed in the UK and isgaining popularity. Taylor Swift dating the football star Travis Kelce has also helped the sport get new viewers.)They start them on sports young in Philly. My kid’s preschool has been taking the kids on little parades around the block to support the team. Now we can’t see the Eagles logo without my daughter cheering. Sometimes, I even hear her in bed chanting: “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” (Which at least makes her better at spelling than the mayor of Philly, who recently made headlines bychanting E-L-G-S-E-S.)I don’t care about American football, or sport in general, so it doesn’t bother me who my kid roots for. I think it’s nice she’s bought into the city’s spirit. But I do worry for my wife, who comes from another sports-obsessed town (Boston) and was hoping to raise a Pats fan. It must be hard when your only child supports the wrong team. But then again, you can’t be a sports fan without getting used to crushing disappointment.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyNFLUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

For damaging picture frames, obstructing the road, or justtalkingabout obstructing the road, they have received punishments that we would normally reserve for serious crimes. People trying to draw attention to the government failure to confront the cause of the climate crisis were imprisoned for up to five years.These sentenceshave been condemnedas draconian by Amnesty International, as “a grave erosion of … freedoms” by Liberty, as “a profound injustice” by Global Witness, and as “not acceptable in a democracy” by a special rapporteur for the UN. They represent the terrifying decline of our nation, from a beacon of tolerance with a clear division between politics and policing, towards an oppressive state where that dividing line is becoming harder and harder to discern. Regardless of your politics and what you are standing for, the right of peaceful protest is a vital sign of a healthy democracy and an essential guardrail against authoritarian politicians and reckless companies.I have campaigned inside and outside parliament, and in 2013 I was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest at a proposed fracking site in West Sussex. Police forcefully removed me and my fellow protesters, and I was charged with a public order offence, of which I was later cleared.I took action on that day because I felt I had exhausted all democratic options – and as MP for Brighton Pavilion, I had more options than most. Residents living around the proposed fracking sites felt their concerns had been ignored, andpolls consistently showthat the practice is deeply unpopular with the wider population. Many people protested, and in 2019, the government finally saw sense andimposed a fracking banthat remains in force in England today. This was a clear example of concerned citizens standing up to the vested interests of companies and the misguided actions of the government to bring about change. Protest is part of how democracy works, and it has led to many of the freedoms we enjoy today including a two-day weekend, national parks and votes for women.I was jailed for four years for a non-violent climate protest – this is my prison diaryRead moreThe appeal this week is proof that it is becoming much harder for citizens to make their voices heard – whether it’s about the cost of living, the climate crisis or the state of our polluted rivers. Recent governments have expanded the legal definition of public nuisance to include anything that causes “more than minor” disruption, including making noise. Police have new powers to preemptively stop and search or arrest protesters. In just one month at the end of 2023,police arrested at least 630peaceful protesters.Research showsthat British police arrest environmental protesters at a rate of nearly three times the global average.For many, arrest is just the start of their ordeal: sentences for causing a public nuisance can range up to 10 years in prison. One protester appealing this week has been jailed for five years for taking part in a Zoom call about a planned climate protest. Forty people spent Christmas Day behind bars for voicing their dissent to war and the climate crisis.The scope of the appeal is limited tochallenging the sentences. A decision to reduce these over-harsh punishments would set an important precedent for future cases. However, the underlying problem of the excessive powers granted to police and the courts to arrest and prosecute peaceful protesters, which increased dramatically under the last government, is being happily accommodated by this one, along with tabloid rhetoric to demonise the protesters in civil society.Keir Starmer and his government must know, deep down, that this is wrong. In a past life, the prime minister himself represented climate activists like those in court this week. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, haspreviously saidshe fears that certain measures in the Public Order Act could “erode historic freedoms of peaceful protest”. And yet this government seems perfectly content to continue sleepwalking into many of the practices used by authoritarian states.Caroline Lucas is an environmental activist and former Green MPExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionJust Stop OilCaroline LucasSentencingcommentShareReuse this content"

He knows that it will soon be his turn to be arrested by Stalin’s secret police and is prepared for it.Power in the Soviet Union had been seized by many who were uneducated and coarse, driven by a vindictiveness amplified by the sense that they were merely taking what was rightfully theirs. Shostakovich, along with writers such as Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, Alja Rachmanowa and others left strikingly similar depictions of the upheaval caused by the Stalinist purges: society was divided and riven by fear, anxiety, acts of revenge, lists of inconvenient people, destruction. Brute force prevailed over talent, expertise and education. The winner took all.Slovakia is (for now) a member of the EU, it is (for now) a democratic country and has not (so far) endured a bloody or violent coup. But the atmosphere today feels to me in some ways quite similar to that described in Russia 100 years ago.Since the populist Robert Fico’s return for a fourth term as prime minister in October 2023, Slovakia has pivoted from the west to the east and is drifting away from liberal democracy to what looks like authoritarianism. A long-term critic of the EU and Nato, Fico hasquestioned Russia’s roleas the aggressor in the war in Ukraine, threatening to stop electricity supplies to Kyiv.In December Fico travelled to Moscow for a private meeting with Vladimir Putin,only the third western leaderto do so since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Slovaks have taken to the streets to voice their anger about the country’s future, their support for Ukraine and for Slovakia’s continued membership of the EU and Nato. The most recent protest, drew more than 100,000people, many calling for Fico to resign.But how does one defend democracy if the state’s very representatives are involved in systematically dismantling it? And how could the achievements of the 35 years since theVelvet Revolutionhave been upended so quickly?Slovakia’s artistic and cultural community has always been at the forefront of the pro-democracy cause. That was the case during the Velvet Revolution and in the 1990s protests against prime minister Vladimír Mečiar’s government. Thirty years later, in the massrallies that followed the murderof the investigative journalist Ján Kuciak, it was the voices of Slovakian artists and cultural workers that sounded loudest about the threat to freedom and democratic values. That uprising led to the collapse of Fico’s third government.No wonder, then, that attempts to silence government critics are now targeted on the arts, culture and NGOs. Under the guise of balancing budgets, Fico has brought in sweeping institutional changes and taken a scythe to sources of funding for culture. Those who can’t be sacked or silenced are starved and exhausted out of existence.Tens of thousands in Slovakia protest against PM’s shift towards RussiaRead moreWhile the media, judiciary, police, prosecution and security services – key areas by which democracy stands or falls – have been subjected to similarly radical shake-ups, a look back at the assault on the arts over the past year tells an alarming story.One of Fico’s first and most controversial appointments wasMartina Šimkovičová. The former TV presenter, who lost her job at a private TV station in 2015 foranti-refugee posts on social media, was appointed minister for culture.Šimkovičová, a member of the far-right Slovak National party, set the tone for her new role by stating that “the culture of the Slovak peoplemust be Slovak and no other”. Her head of office, Lukáš Machala, is a man who questionswhether the Earth is really round(this is not a joke).View image in fullscreenSlovakian minister for culture, Martina Šimkovičová, takes the oath in the Slovak parliament, Bratislava, 25 October 2023.Photograph: CTK/AlamyŠimkovičová quickly embarked on a wholesalepurge across the arts. She started by sacking alarge number of culture ministry staff, followed by weekly dismissals of key employees in almost every state-run cultural institution, including the National Library. Hardly a week has gone by without a leading figure in a well-regarded museum, theatre, gallery or conservation agency being fired. Those who have not yet been removed or demoted are dreading their turn, which they know is only a question of time.One of the most egregious examples of the purge is what happened at the Slovak National Gallery (SNG). It underwent an extraordinarily thorough and, by Slovakian standards, successful reconstruction under its director, Alexandra Kusá, who turned it into a modern, acclaimed and popular institution. But in August last year, shortly after the big opening of the refurbished galleries, Kusá was dismissed.This led to apublic protestand theresignations of a number of key SNG staff, not only in solidarity with Kusá but citing untenable working conditions. Alarmed by the situation, two partner museums, in Austria and Germany, have taken the unprecedented step ofwithdrawing from an exhibitionthey had long planned jointly with SNG, because as their letter noted, “the current situation poses a potential risk to the items to be lent, for the protection of which the institutions themselves are responsible”. Kusá has accused accused the culture ministry of launching “an era of bullying and intimidation”.A hundred National Gallery employeesresigneden masse this week and the biggest sponsor stopped its financial support.The blows keep coming. The functioning of the Slovak Arts Fund (modelled on Arts Council England) has been brought to a complete standstill and rendered incapable of allocating and disbursing grants. With other funding schemes paralysed, thousands of artists, professional and amateur alike, from folklore through literature, theatre and the visual arts face uncertainty as to whether they will be able to survive financially. Even works to restore dilapidated historic buildings have been halted after the abolition of arange of culture ministry departments, including the one tasked with the preservation of monuments.The director of the Slovak Literary Centre, the agency responsible for promoting Slovakian literature at home and abroad, has been replaced by a figure who is accused ofties withconspiracy platforms. The head of the national heritage office was dismissed in December. As if this were not enough, the writer Michal Hvorecký and the visual artist Ilona Németh say the culture minister has filedcriminal complaintsagainst them.For a year now, the arts community has implored the government to listen to sense, but to no avail.Two petitionsfor the dismissal of Šimkovičová have appeared in the space of six months, garnering record numbers of signatures.Castles and historical landmarks havehoisted black flagsin protest. At the Slovak National Theatre, another institution whose director was dismissed without notice, actors have taken to reading statements before or after performances.Slovakia’s president, Peter Pellegrini, has ignored pleas from the arts community for a meeting. His continued silence prompted Zdena Studenková, an acclaimed Slovakian actor, toturn downa new year honour.More than 700 psychiatrists and psychologists have signed an open letter to the PM, as have more than2,000 academicsand almost 6,000workers in education. But since Fico’s Moscow visit, such small-scale protests have widened into the mass demonstrations we’ve been seeing.Fico says he has no intention of stepping down. And in the context of other crises plaguing Europe, the dismantling of Slovakian culture may seem insignificant. But a vast machine now appears aimed at unravelling our democracy. Every regional museum closure or curator sacking is a another step in that process.

They tell the audience what the government is doing and they explain why. Both elements were present when Rachel Reeves addressed an audience in Oxfordshire yesterdayon Wednesday, but there was a lot more policy than argument. The chancellor listed many actions to kickstart growth in the economy. There will be a lot of new infrastructure and new transport links – includingexpansion of Heathrowand other airports. The area between Oxford and Cambridge will be developed intoBritain’s Silicon Valley. Ms Reeves pledged more international trade and more state subsidies for green technology.The list was long, the persuasion was cursory. The chancellor’s economic case is that weak productivity growth has been the malaise holding back Britain’s economy. The remedy is a supply-side assault on regulation. The government will ease rules that are deemed to have thwarted crucial developments in the past. It certainly can take too long and cost too much to build in Britain. Thesaga of HS2– approved in 2012, started in 2017, not due for completion until 2033 and likely to cost nearly double the original £37.5bn estimate – is a parable of that dysfunction.If the Treasury can secure investment and accelerate an upgrade of Britain’s infrastructure, future generations will be grateful. Up to a point. As opponents of a third runway at Heathrow point out, the carbon impact of some projects is a cost that needs to be taken more seriously. Wanting to avert climate catastrophe is not selfish nimbyism.This is where Ms Reeves’s political argument needed to be more developed. Her basic premise is uncontroversial: a growing economy creates jobs and generates revenue that can be deployed for good causes – “wealth created and wealth shared” in the chancellor’s phrase. She said her goal would be achieved “when working people are better off”. She envisages “the next generation [having] more opportunities than the last”. Those boilerplate pieties could have been said by any chancellor from any party at any time. What was absent from the speech was any sense of urgency in pursuit of progressive social outcomes as well as positive economic data.When it comes to fiscal discipline as a precondition of economic stability, the chancellor has concrete prescriptions – the bill for sickness-related benefits must come down. But when it comes to the actual experience of people receiving those benefits, there is a blank. Ministers are quick to boast of their courage in taking “tough decisions” while offering flimsy platitudes when asked to explain the purpose of those decisions.There is a balanced debate to be had around the merits of Ms Reeves’s economic argument and what it omits. Supply-side reform may be necessary. But it is not a sufficient condition for growth. Boosting foreign trade is important, but to discuss it without reference to theEuropean single marketis disingenuous. If fiscal responsibility is a goal then it should be achieved by ways other than cutting social spending.But, economics aside, the cumulative effect of those omissions makes the chancellor’s speech sound desperate and shallow. That doesn’t mean the Treasury’s plan is doomed to fail. It might indeed spur growth. But it is presented without a meaningful political argument, without imagination, compassion or moral purpose. Those qualities might not be necessary to boost gross domestic product, but aLabourgovernment is badly diminished without them.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Donors must now press Rwanda to pull back from this warWed 29 Jan 2025 13.34 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 17.13 ESTShareThere are bodies on the streets, hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing and overwhelmed hospitals draining fuel from ambulances to keep respirators running. The rapidly escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – which has seen rocketing sexual violence, theexecution of childrenand the displacement of 400,000 people this year alone – has just exploded with theM23 rebel  group’sseizure ofGoma, in the east.Their advance comes thanks to backingfrom Rwanda, despite the coyness of the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Mr Kagame suggests that M23 is defending the country’s Tutsis, victims of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, against an armed group set up by former genocidal killers. But the threat those fighters pose appears greatly exaggerated: analysts believe the real aim is to seize mineral-rich territory. There is a striking parallel withRussia’s tactics in eastern Ukrainein 2014. On Wednesday, Rwandan troops were seen heading towards Bukavu, another key city, with the M23 fighters.Mr Kagame, in power since 2000, won last year’s election withmore than 99% of the vote. Despite his authoritarian regime’s record of human rights abuses, the west has embraced him as a key partner who stabilises the region. He has turned aid into economic growth andoffered to take asylum seekersoff European hands. He sent troops to battle jihadist militants in Mozambique,a rich source of gas, and Rwanda supplies valuable minerals for smartphones, electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure and other purposes.Campaigners heavily criticised the EU for signinga strategic minerals dealwith the country last year, given that many of those supplies clearly don’t originate in Rwanda. Europe has sidelined human rights concerns. The trade in minerals finances arms purchases, fuelling the fighting.There are concerns that ethnic violence could reignite. Diplomats fear that Rwanda may hope to topple the Burundi government. Some wonder if the DRC may seek help from the United Arab Emirates and Russia. The risk of a regional conflagrationcannot easily be dismissed: conflict in the late 90s and early 2000s claimed millions of lives.Attacks on embassies in Kinshasa this week show that many in the DRC are angered by the role of outsiders. Kenya and Angola have acted as mediators. But East African leaders have failed to prioritise the crisis as it has escalated. The DRC president Félix Tshisekedi’s poor relations with his neighbours and suspicion that they lean to Mr Kagame do not lend themselves to a solution, while Mr Kagame is wary of African Union mediation. He stayed away from talks last week but is keener to come to the table now that facts on the ground have shifted in his favour – while Mr Tshisekedi said he would sit out yesterday’s Wednesday’s virtual crisis summit. Further complicating matters, Mr Tshisekedi is unpopular at home, with strong suspicions that heplans to ditch term limits.This crisis has shown the folly of treating Kigali as a guarantor of regional stability. Germany has sent a welcome signal by suspending aid talks with Rwandan officials. Other European nations and the US should follow suit. Sanctions and travel bans could also be adopted to press for an end to fighting and the creation of humanitarian corridors. Countries are finally calling outRwandaover its role in this disaster. But with so many lives at stake, more than words are required.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

You were loved, you are remembered, you did not deserve it, 27 January). Most western media have been reluctant to call out the horror for what it is. One sentence in her excellent article stands out for me: the killing of children on such a scale was “unnecessary and only permitted because Palestinian life as a whole has been made cheap by the logic of Israel’s absolute right to defend itself by whatever criminal means it likes”.Western governments and media have been shamefully complicit in overlooking these atrocities, taking no significant action to restrain or condemn Israel, maintaining neutrality between those dropping the bombs and the babies underneath them. Even now, Palestinian suffering is underemphasised. The attention given to the fewer than 100 Israeli hostages still held in Gaza is grossly disproportionate to that given to the suffering of the Palestinians, including themore than 9,000 Palestinian detainees, many of them heldwithout trial or charges.Michael FosterChelmsfordSeveral years ago, I attended the funeral of a three-year-old. It was a harrowing experience, and one which I never wish to have to repeat.I have often thought of this little boy and his funeral during the course of the relentless onslaught on the people ofGaza. I have tried to imagine the profound grief and sorrow I witnessed then, multiplied again and again, every day, every night, and affecting so many families, so many mothers, so many fathers. We must never forget that behind all these numbers there are individual children, the loss of whom will have an incalculable impact on the lives of their loved ones, and I am grateful to Nesrine Malik for reminding us of this.Isabella StoneSheffieldIs there a more moving account of the despair of death, destruction and attempts at making things “good” in a war zone, than Seema Jilani’s (To the unknown child: I tried to save your young life in a Gaza hospital. Now your face haunts me, 24 January)? I believe not. And that she would carry the feelings of blame, guilt and incompetence, saying: “When your soul floated up beside me, was the devil there too, recounting my sins?”I think the sins lie with Hamas,Israel, the vested interests of other nations and all who have violence as an option in mind. To all the decision-makers and excusers of war who say: “It is terrible, but…” I say leave out the “but” and let this article touch you. It will be pasted on my wall, as it should be in any president’s and any general’s room, particularly those who target civilians to achieve military “goals”.Wico van MourikGainford, County DurhamSeema Jilani, thank you for being present where I cannot be.

However, the article did not fully address the fact that many internships and work placements are, in essence, “nepo-adjacent” – they are largely secured through industry contacts rather than open competition.Many of my journalism students come from marginalised groups based on race, ethnicity and class. With limited industry connections, they can face significant barriers which result in restricted job opportunities and hinder their social mobility. In response, I’ve worked to level the playing field for them by founding the London Met Journalism Diversity Network. This initiative helps students gain access to opportunities, broadens their professional networks, and improves graduate outcomes.As a result, around 50% of second-year students enrolled in our journalism work placement module now land placements through the network, including organisations previously out of reach, such as the BBC, Sky News, Sky Sports, and Marie Claire and Grazia magazines.These placements take place for just two weeks during the academic year, making paid opportunities less of a necessity. Several students have already landed graduate jobs as a result of these placements. As successful as it is, I look forward to the day when the network no longer needs to exist.Wendy SloaneAssociate professor in journalism, London Metropolitan UniversityHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

Fail to win here and ignominy belonged to them, aChampions Leagueexit at the first hurdle. The longest league table in football history would not lie. And yet Pep Guardiola’s team waited for one all the same, ­sleepwalking towards disaster.When the half-time whistle went, they were second best toClub Bruggeand behind to Raphael Onyedika’s well-taken goal on 45 minutes. It was not just City’s accountants that shifted uncomfortably. Everything was on the line for everybody – Guardiola, the players, the fans. It was sporting pride, reputations, the lot.Dembélé’s hat-trick sends PSG soaring into playoffs and Stuttgart crashing outRead moreRelief was the overriding emotion when City turned up for the second half. On the evidence of this and plenty of other performances since the end of October, a repeat ofthe landmark 2023 triumphis a long way away. There are just too many imperfections about City at present, too many key players below their best. All that mattered, though, was progress into the playoff round.City just seemed to mean it more after half-time. There was greater energy, the home support also roused themselves and once in front, Josko Gvardiol forcing Joel Ordóñez into an own goal, it felt like a done deal.Brugge had refused to fold after Mateo Kovacic’s equaliser and there was the moment when Guardiola lost his cool at the officials to incur a booking. He had argued for an offside against Brugge that did eventually come, although it looked like an incorrect call.Quick GuideChampions League: potential playoffs and last 16 gamesShowThe Champions League's inaugural 'league phase' is now complete, with the top eight sides –Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atlético, Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa– going straight to the last 16. The teams who finished between 9th and 24th have been matched in seeded and unseeded pairs, to be allocated into playoff ties in Friday's draw (11am GMT).To give an example, Celtic (21st) and Manchester City (22nd) will face Real Madrid (11th) or Bayern Munich (12th), with the winners advancing to play either Atlético (seeded fifth) or Leverkusen (6th). So the draw could potentially put Celtic v Real Madrid on one side, and Manchester City v Bayern on the other.The playoffs will take place on 11-12 and 18-19 February, before a further draw on 21 February decides who the playoff winners will face in the last 16. So, if Real Madrid and Bayern Munich advance, they will be drawn to play either Atlético or Leverkusen. Teams from the same country can be paired together at any point.Playoff ties and last-16 opponents(17) Monaco or (18) Brest v (15) PSG or (16) Benfica- Winner will face(1)Liverpoolor(2) Barcelonain last 16(23) Sporting or (24) Brugge v (9) Atalanta or (10) Dortmund- Winner will face(7) Lilleor(8) Aston Villain last 16(21) Celtic or (22) Man City v (11) Real Madrid or (12) Bayern- Winner will face(5) Atléticoor(6) Leverkusenin last 16(19) Feyenoord or (20) Juventus v (13) Milan or (14) PSV- Winner will face(3) Arsenalor(4) Interin last 16(18) Brest or (17) Monaco v (16) Benfica or (15) PSG- Winner will face(2) Barcelonaor(1) Liverpoolin last 16(24) Brugge or Sporting (23) v (10) Dortmund or (9) Atalanta- Winner will face(8) Aston Villaor(7) Lillein last 16(22) Man City or (21) Celtic v (12) Bayern or (11) Real Madrid- Winner will face(6) Leverkusenor(5) Atléticoin last 16(20) Juventus or (19) Feyenoord v (14) PSV or (13) Milan- Winner will face(4) InterorArsenal (3)in last 16Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Guardiola could relax a little bit after the own goal, the home crowd could revert to merely taking it all in and even though Brugge did not allow their heads to drop, it was over when Savinho, who made the difference as a half-time substitute, added the third.City’s reward was dubious – a tie against Real Madrid or Bayern Munich – but that is the price to pay for a flawed campaign. The losses at Sporting and Juventus hurt, ditto the oneat Paris Saint-Germain last Wednesday, but the real killer was surely the three-goal surrender for3-3 at home to Feyenoord.The hard-to-ignore subplot here was the home fans. They were so quiet in the early exchanges, plainly underwhelmed by the pre-match show, and they remained that way throughout the first half. Those that had travelled from Brugge cut through the silence. They were determined to make themselves heard – it was not hard – and they were in dreamland by the interval.View image in fullscreenRaphael Onyedika fires past Ederson to put Club Brugge ahead.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThey were happy at how their team had kept City at arm’s length. But it got even better when they moved forward on the counterattack to set up the unthinkable. It was not a surprise because if City looked laboured, Brugge had advertised their ability to make inroads up the left. Before the breakthrough, the all-action Christos Tzolis had seen a shot blocked by Manuel Ajanki.Guardiola persisted with Matheus Nunes at right-back and he was beaten so easily by Ferran Jutglà; a simple stop-and-go move and a shake of the hips all it took. Brugge had broken initially through their captain, Hans Vanaken, and when Jutglà crossed low, Onyedika applied the first-time finish.Brugge were always going to make things difficult, to be as compact as possible without the ball. But it was clear from the early running that they could ask questions on the counter, Tzolis enjoying plenty of space on the left. There was a moment at the outset when Akanji and Nunes went for the same aerial ball and missed it. When Tzolis hared away to cross, Gvardiol blocked to keep out Chemsdine Talbi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ilkay Gündogan had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside. Erling Haaland headed square to nobody rather than aim at goal. Kevin De Bruyne lashed one high. The tempo was slow, the movements predictable; a lot of side-to-side stuff, few searching passes.Guardiola tweaked his approach for the second half, introducing Savinho for Gündogan – in other words, a bit more pace – and City were soon level. John Stones had missed a gilt-edged header when Kovacic picked up the ball on halfway, dribbled up the middle and kept going. Brugge’s collective sin was to back off. When Kovacic reached the edge of the area, he threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenMateo Kovacic equalises for Manchester City.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAIf that was a soft concession, then worse was to come for Brugge. They had threatened at the other end, continuing to get runners in, not least when Tzolis surged through, ignoring the offside cries and Vanaken was thwarted by Ederson. That was when Guardiola talked his way to the yellow card. Twice more Tzolis went close but City were in front when Savinho played in Gvardiol and his low cross led to Ordóñez’s misfortune.Guardiola was a snapshot in anguish when Haaland was denied by Simon Mignolet and Brandon Mechele cleared Savinho’s rebound off the line. The manager could exhale when Savinho took a touch on his chest following Stones’s diagonal pass to crash his shot inside the near post.PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool812212Barcelona815193Arsenal813194Inter Milan810195Atletico Madrid88186Bayer Leverkusen88167Lille87168Aston Villa87169Atalanta8141510Borussia Dortmund8101511Real Madrid881512Bayern Munich881513AC Milan831514PSV841415PSG851316Benfica841317Monaco801318Brest8-11319Feyenoord8-31320Juventus821221Celtic8-11222Man City841123Sporting811124Club Brugge8-41125Dinamo Zagreb8-71126Stuttgart8-41027Shakhtar Donetsk8-8728Bologna8-5629Red Star Belgrade8-9630Sturm Graz8-9631Sparta Prague8-14432RB Leipzig8-7333Girona8-8334Red Bull Salzburg8-22335Slovan Bratislava8-20036Young Boys8-210Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityClub Bruggematch reportsShareReuse this content"

Morgan Rogers, fresh from completing his hat-trick in stoppage time, was among the Villa players huddled around the phone of the fitness coach Moisés Del Hoyo praying Atalanta would not find a winner in Barcelona and divert Villa’s course. Everyone was jostling for a view. With the final whistle looming here, Unai Emery was busy relaying the latest to Leon Bailey, explaining how Villa would have to settle for a playoff next month if the Serie A side scored.Just as everybody had got to grips with the small print of the permutations, au fait with others’ goal difference, Villa Park released a communal cheer and the players dispersed. Villa had secured a place in the top eight and succeeded where Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Milan and Paris Saint-Germain had failed.Nwaneri’s screamer seals turnaround at Girona as Arsenal ensure spot in last 16Read moreIt is the kind of sentence that will be on the lips of Villa supporters for the next few weeks and one that speaks volumes of the company they are keeping these days. Monchi, the sporting director, did a double-fist pump, general manager Damian Vidagany did similar as he headed down the tunnel.Celtic, meanwhile, digested the reality of facing either Real or Bayern in a fortnight, a two-leg playoff between Brendan Rodgers’s side and the last 16.Celtic stunned Villa after recovering from an early two-goal deficit to level but Ollie Watkins registered his first goal in the competition to nudge Villa in front and then missed a penalty to put the game to bed midway through the second half. Judging by the way Watkins celebrated his strike, he is here to stay. A smirking Watkins coolly jogged along the Holte End before clenching his fist and appearing to tap the crest on his chest, hours after the emergence ofa shock bid from Arsenal. Meanwhile Jhon Durán, an unused substitute, is poised to depart for the Saudi Pro League in a deal worth about £80m.Emery suggested he was powerless to prevent Durán from pursuing a fresh start, despite the obvious attraction of advancing in theChampions League. Fittingly, it was Faithless’s Insomnia which blared over the speakers as Villa’s players finished their warmup. Neither Watkins or Durán are immune to outside interest. Watkins blew kisses towards a hospitality box in the North Stand, giving a glove to a young fan before heading in. Durán, typically, was last down the tunnel, high-fiving the supporters who have loved watching his development. Durán’s preposterous winner against Bayern put them on this path.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins (right) celebrates with Jacob Ramsey after scoring Aston Villa’s third goal in their 4-2 win against Celtic.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAVilla made light of what could have been a destabilising backdrop, quickly getting to work to the point the game felt as good as over inside the opening five minutes. Rogers swept home after a clinical, triangular move down the left flank that caught Alistair Johnston cold. Youri Tielemans slipped Jacob Ramsey in in the channel and Ramsey squared for Rogers, who converted from close range. Emery flung his right first towards the floor of his technical area in celebration.If it was advantage Villa after 152 seconds, then Villa were well in command with barely four minutes gone. An alert Ezri Konsa pounced on Kasper Schmeichel’s pass for Adam Idah and kickstarted an attack. Watkins took things over, locating Rogers to his right. Celtic offered Villa plenty of room and encouraged Rogers to take aim. So he did, blasting a shot that skidded off the studs of Liam Scales and flew into the top corner past Schmeichel.Quick GuideChampions League: potential playoffs and last 16 gamesShowThe Champions League's inaugural 'league phase' is now complete, with the top eight sides –Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atlético, Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa– going straight to the last 16.

There were nervous glances when Idah extended his right leg to hook in Greg Taylor’s cross, diverted into the former Norwich striker’s path via John McGinn, whose attempted clearance backfired. Then Villa cracked, Idah converting from the edge of the six‑yard box to cap a slick move and make a mockery of those who presumed Villa would simply swat aside the Scottish champions. Rodgers punched the air.With the hour looming, though, McGinn took matters into his own hands, shrugging off Arne Engels on halfway to spark an attack. Ramsey streamed towards goal and unselfishly squared for an unmarked Watkins to lash in. A few minutes later Watkins squandered a chance to restore Villa’s two-goal buffer after being fouled inside the box by Auston Trusty. Watkins slipped, ballooning the subsequent penalty into the Holte End to tee up a nervy finale, in which Rogers sealed victory.“I’m just proud of how we’ve performed, Scotland gets a wee bit of stick in English football, but I think you can clearly see we’ve teams that have got courage to play – we’re nowhere near the resource levels of the teams in the Premier League but we can still be competitive,” Rodgers said. “I’ve really enjoyed this format and now we’ll get ready for the next challenge.”PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool812212Barcelona815193Arsenal813194Inter Milan810195Atletico Madrid88186Bayer Leverkusen88167Lille87168Aston Villa87169Atalanta8141510Borussia Dortmund8101511Real Madrid881512Bayern Munich881513AC Milan831514PSV841415PSG851316Benfica841317Monaco801318Brest8-11319Feyenoord8-31320Juventus821221Celtic8-11222Man City841123Sporting811124Club Brugge8-41125Dinamo Zagreb8-71126Stuttgart8-41027Shakhtar Donetsk8-8728Bologna8-5629Red Star Belgrade8-9630Sturm Graz8-9631Sparta Prague8-14432RB Leipzig8-7333Girona8-8334Red Bull Salzburg8-22335Slovan Bratislava8-20036Young Boys8-210Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

With four minutes left in Arsenal’s lastChampions Leaguematch of a hugely impressive first phase, Ethan Nwaneri began his long, slow walk around the pitch at Montilivi. As he went, they waited for him with open arms on the away bench and, in the small main stand, supporters and staff stood and applauded. He was in no hurry; he had given everything and was happy to take it all in.Ultimately, this was a comfortable night forArsenal, and it had always been likely to be. They had earned the right to play virtually risk-free and although Raheem Sterling missed a last-minute penalty, a 2-1 win over Girona completed the job of carrying them directly to the last 16 as expected. Arsenal are third, Arteta talking about having “the privilege of sitting at home” during the playoff round. In the absence of jeopardy or epic, what made it memorable was the 17-year-old who celebrated his first Champions League start with a superb performance and a wonderful winning goal.Manchester City survive Brugge scare to progress as Savinho caps comeback winRead moreAlready the youngest player in Premier League history, he did it as if playing at Donkey Lane, Enfield, not in Europe’s biggest competition – and playing for a side whose candidacy must be taken seriously, chasing a second ever final. The kid who marked this occasion and may well mark many more had not been born that night in 2006 when they played their first. “That’s what we love about him,” Arteta said. “He’s very aggressive and so confident. It was a very important goal.” It was one they had seen before, a signature strike if such a thing can exist so early in a player’s career.Mikel Arteta had noted that qualification was not mathematically assured but the numbers were on Arsenal’s side: the chances of not making it were less than 0.1% and, with Manchester City coming up, the coach made changes. That meant a starting XI without Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz. David Raya was not there either, although the coach was coy about his injury and availability for the weekend. It also meant another glimpse of the grace and confidence in everything Nwaneri does.He was not the only new face. At the other end, Neto’s first appearance in eight months did not go entirely as planned. They had not even been playing two minutes when he slipped and almost gifted the opener to Yáser Asprilla; they had been playing for 28 when he played a part inGironagetting the opener. Juanpe Ramírez’s pass bent into Arnaut Danjuma’s run, and Neto came to meet him – too far and too fast. With the goalkeeper isolated away from his line, Danjuma side-footed beyond him and into the empty net.View image in fullscreenJorginho scores from the spot to make it 1-1.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesBetween those moments Arsenal dominated, Nwaneri and Sterling always moving and Riccardo Calafiori appearing undetected at the most opportune moments. Sterling had flashed past the post and clipped a delivery for the impressive Leandro Trossard to bundle wide before a slightly daft penalty brought them level. Thomas Partey pushed past Arnau Martínez’s outstretched leg and on to the turf and Jorginho scored from the spot.Then, just before half-time, came the moment. Heading in from the right, Nwaneri went across the face of the area, stepped away from opponents, waited for the target to come into range, and then, as if it was no big deal, bent past Pau López and into the net. “It’s very natural for him. The technique in motion is very rare, he is so precise finishing,” Arteta said.The second period began with Trossard, who had already smashed one off the bar, providing chances for Gabriel Magalhães and Calafiori before having an effort of his own blocked. But the third goal would not come and Girona introduced the 38-year-old Cristhian Stuani to an ovation. This was not just a homage to the club’s most historic player and, six minutes later, he thought he had put them level. Instead, there was something cruel about the goal being ruled out, a portrait of how fine the margins have been in their first European season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Four minutes later the teenager was off, a disconsolate figure after receiving a straight red card for denying Johan Bakayoko a clear goalscoring opportunity.Champions League: Leverkusen and Lille in top eight as Atalanta fall shortRead moreNallo’s misfortune was in stark contrast to impressive contributions from his fellow academy graduates James McConnell, Jayden Danns and Tyler Morton. Defeat, however, did not costLiverpooltop spot in the table courtesy of Barcelona’s draw with Atalanta. Slot’s side will face Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest in the last 16.“It’s cruel,” the Liverpool head coach said of Nallo’s swift dismissal. “But making your debut at Champions League level is probably the hardest way. He misinterpreted the situation and that is immediately a problem at this level or in Premier League. It’s a big moment for him to learn from.“A career isn’t always positive, there are also negatives, and he has to fight very hard to make sure he plays a second Champions League game. It is not going to be easy but hopefully he will.”Slot was full of praise for the performance of McConnell and confirmed the young midfielder would not be loaned out this month as a result. Others might. “He impressed me a lot,” said Slot, who admitted PSG are not the reward he will be hoping for having finished top.The former PSV favourite Cody Gakpo and Andy Robertson were the only players retained from the starting lineupagainst Ipswichon Saturday.

Gakpo raised his hands in apology to his former club after scoring.The contest suddenly had liftoff. PSV hit back with an exquisite goal from Bakayoko. Released into the Liverpool area by a deft touch from the striker Ricardo Pepi, the winger put Robertson and Jarell Quansah on their backsides with a dummy and curled an unstoppable finish inside Caoimhín Kelleher’s right-hand post.Liverpool soon regained the lead when Gakpo turned Wataru Endo’s ball into the path of Chiesa, whose low drive was parried into the path of Harvey Elliott by Walter Benítez.

The visitors wanted a foul when Endo was dispossessed by Tygo Land. The referee, Tobias Stieler, was not interested and Veerman released Ismael Saibari inside the box with a perfectly weighted pass. The left winger lashed an unstoppable shot into the roof of Kelleher’s net.PSV profited down their left again to take the lead in the sixth minute of first-half stoppage time. Mauro Júnior broke into the area and played a low cross towards Pepi. The delivery deflected off Bradley, diverting it away from both the striker and Robertson, and sailed inside the far corner.Quick GuideChampions League: potential playoffs and last 16 gamesShowThe Champions League's inaugural 'league phase' is now complete, with the top eight sides –Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atlético, Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa– going straight to the last 16. The teams who finished between 9th and 24th have been matched in seeded and unseeded pairs, to be allocated into playoff ties in Friday's draw (11am GMT).To give an example, Celtic (21st) and Manchester City (22nd) will face Real Madrid (11th) or Bayern Munich (12th), with the winners advancing to play either Atlético (seeded fifth) or Leverkusen (6th). So the draw could potentially put Celtic v Real Madrid on one side, and Manchester City v Bayern on the other.The playoffs will take place on 11-12 and 18-19 February, before a further draw on 21 February decides who the playoff winners will face in the last 16. So, if Real Madrid and Bayern Munich advance, they will be drawn to play either Atlético or Leverkusen. Teams from the same country can be paired together at any point.Playoff ties and last-16 opponents(17) Monaco or (18) Brest v (15) PSG or (16) Benfica- Winner will face(1)Liverpoolor(2) Barcelonain last 16(23) Sporting or (24) Brugge v (9) Atalanta or (10) Dortmund- Winner will face(7) Lilleor(8) Aston Villain last 16(21) Celtic or (22) Man City v (11) Real Madrid or (12) Bayern- Winner will face(5) Atléticoor(6) Leverkusenin last 16(19) Feyenoord or (20) Juventus v (13) Milan or (14) PSV- Winner will face(3) Arsenalor(4) Interin last 16(18) Brest or (17) Monaco v (16) Benfica or (15) PSG- Winner will face(2) Barcelonaor(1) Liverpoolin last 16(24) Brugge or Sporting (23) v (10) Dortmund or (9) Atalanta- Winner will face(8) Aston Villaor(7) Lillein last 16(22) Man City or (21) Celtic v (12) Bayern or (11) Real Madrid- Winner will face(6) Leverkusenor(5) Atléticoin last 16(20) Juventus or (19) Feyenoord v (14) PSV or (13) Milan- Winner will face(4) InterorArsenal (3)in last 16Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Gakpo was given a rousing reception from the PSV fans when he was replaced by Morton early in the second half. With Slot introducing more young talent and PSV content to protect their advantage, the game unsurprisingly failed to maintain the entertainment value of the first half.Morton made a superb block to prevent Pepi adding a fourth from a PSV counterattack and also tested Benítez from distance. Nallo’s quick red card effectively ended Liverpool’s chances of a comeback. Kelleher denied Bakayoko with a fine reaction save in the closing moments as PSV secured their place in the playoffs.

Arsenal targeted the 27-year-old last summer and she was ­reportedly the subject of a bid from the club, who have been heavily linked with her for several months.Last Sunday Chelsea broke the women’s world record to sign the USA defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave for $1.1m (£890,000). Sonia Bompastor’s side lead the WSL table by seven points as they chase a sixth successive title.In the leadup to Thursday’s 11pm deadline, meanwhile, another ­Lioness could be on the move. Chloe Kelly says she has accepted she has no future at Manchester City beyond the end of her contract which expires in June, breaking her silence after weeks of speculation about her future.Quick GuideLiverpool and Arsenal cruise in Women's FA CupShowLiverpoolput five goals past their fellow WSL sideWest HamUnited away from home in the Women's FA Cup and set up a fifth-round tie away to third-tier side Rugby Borough, live on the BBC.Matt Beard's team were truly dominant from the start and eventually coasted to victory after West Ham were reduced to 10 players when Amber Tysiak was sent off for violent conduct. By then, Liverpool were already two goals up and they completed a 5-0 victory thanks to second-half efforts from Grace Fisk, Lucy Parry and the Scotland international midfielder Sam Kerr.Arsenalwere also 5-0 winners, against Championship opposition at home toBristol City, in another of the four fourth-round ties that was rescheduled because of wintry weather earlier in January.The England forward Beth Mead and Swedish striker Stina Blackstenius each scored twice for the hosts, with Frida Maanum also getting on the scoresheet for the record 14-time winners of the Women's FA Cup. They will now host another second-tier side, London City Lionesses, in round five.Evertonwill travel to league leadersChelseaafter claiming a 2-0 victory at home to Tottenham The France forward Kelly Gago scored her first goal for Everton since her January arrival from the French club Nantes, to open the scoring for the hosts, before Heather Payne made the win safe in second-half stoppage time.WSL sideBrightonbooked a trip to face Aston Villa with a 4-1 win at home to Championship sideDurham, with the 18-year-old England youth international striker Michelle Agyemang among the goalscorers for Brighton.Women's FA Cup fifth-round drawWolves v Manchester UnitedChelsea v EvertonPortsmouth v SunderlandManchester City v LeicesterCrystal Palace v NewcastleAston Villa v BrightonRugby Borough v LiverpoolArsenal v London City LionessesWas this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.The winger has been increasingly frozen out at City, making only one start in the WSL this season amid reports linking her with a move away from the club. She accused City of “dictating” who she can and cannot join and said the situation is having an impact on her mental wellbeing.Posting a lengthy statement on Instagram on Wednesday evening, Kelly said: “For a long time I’ve tried to work through profes­sional challenges privately, not commenting publicly, but with my situation increasingly being debated in the public domain, I feel it’s time to be open and transparent.“A key lesson I have learned in my life is that whilst I can’t control someone’s negative behaviour towards me, I can control how long I am prepared to tolerate it.“With my contract expiring in June, I’ve accepted my future is not at this club beyond then. With the Euros fast approaching, this summer is a huge one and I want to be in a position to give it my best shot to represent my country. However, to be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental well­being. The situation has dragged on far too long, it’s disappointing and not right.” Kelly concluded her statement by saying: “Ultimately I just want to be happy again.”City are understood to be open to allowing Kelly to leave the club in this transfer window and an offer is believed to be on the table.Explore more on these topicsChelsea WomenBarcelona WomenManchester City WomenWomen's Super LeagueWomen's footballTransfer windownewsShareReuse this content"

Two days later Rashford said he wanted a “new challenge” and since then he has been in only one match-day squad, for the 2-0 defeat against Newcastle at Old Trafford on 30 December.Amorim and Rashford no longer on speaking terms at Manchester UnitedRead moreThe pair’s relationship has since deteriorated further. Amorim said on Sunday – after his side’s 1-0 victory at Fulham – that he would rathername his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach, Jorge Vital, than Rashford on United’s benchbecause of the 27‑year‑old forward’s application in training. It then emerged that the pair areno longer on speaking terms.With the transfer window closing on Monday, Rashford’s hopes of a move are in the balance. The player’s wish is to join Barcelona on loan but the La Liga club face financial challenges which make a deal unlikely.Given that, Amorim was asked before United’s final Europa League group game against FCSB on Thursdayif there is a way back for Rashford at United should he end up staying at the club. “You can look at our team and imagine the profile of the players. Now imagine a talent like Rashford? Our team should be so much better with Rashford. But he has to change,” the Portuguese said. “If he changes, we are more than welcome to put in a talent like Rashford. And we need it.“We have to set some standards, that’s all. We are waiting for Marcus, if he wants it really, really bad. You try to make it personal but it’s not personal. I have nothing against Marcus. I just have to make the same rules for everybody. For me it’s so simple. It’s always the same answer.“I promised you I would not give anything aboutMarcus Rashford, but I’m giving you a little bit. It’s the same thing. We need goals. We need one-against-one. We need a threat in the final third. What more do you need?”Amorim was asked if he would consider ordering Rashford to train away from the main group. “I already spoke about Marcus,” the 40-year-old manager said. “Anything I give you tomorrow will be a subject. It’s the same thing for every player. There’s some players who don’t play. Casemiro doesn’t play, maybe he’s selected. Rashford is not selected but that is my choice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The pinnacle of Australian cricket is putting on your baggy green and this one is even more special and historic as the first day-night Test at the MCG. The opportunity to showcase women’s Test cricket on the big arena will be really important, not only for the game itself but for the group that gets to run out there on Thursday.It’s always like a carrot dangled in front of us when there’s a Test match to be played because we don’t do it that often. It brings a lot more energy and excitement to the group. The vibe is high at the moment, just around the occasion itself and having all our family and friends coming to watch. Hopefully the public gets right behind us and comes out in droves too.Beth Mooney’s cool head and sheer class runs England ragged | Geoff LemonRead moreI would absolutely love to play more Tests, whether that is in standalone three-Test series or adding more Tests to multi-format series. But I understand we’re bound by the ICC future tours program and the different boards around the world that are willing or unwilling to play women’s Test cricket. If that changes in the next five years, that would be great, but I’m under no illusion to the fact that it’s not a viable revenue option for all the countries to commit to three-Test or five-Test series. Maybe in 10 years that will look slightly differently.The desire to be out there on the MCG no matter what ailments or injuries you’ve got is the same for everyone, including our skipper. It’s unfortunate for Alyssa Healy that she’s been under an injury cloud the last 12 to 18 months, but she’s found a way to make it work when she’s needed to. She’s desperate to get out there in the whites and have an impact on the series, even if that’s just as a batter.It’s going to be a different challenge for me, keeping wicket and batting a bit further down the order than I have in the last few Test matches. I’ve been mixing between keeping and fielding across my career, and I feel confident enough to do either. I’ll have a couple of days in Melbourne to prepare for the pink ball but because I do a lot of keeping in club and franchise cricket, it’s pretty easy to just get back on the horse. But I haven’t kept in a Test before, so I might be in the foetal position after 100 overs behind the stumps.View image in fullscreenAustralia won all three T20s to back up three ODI victories this series.Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPAWhen weretained the Ashes in that first T20there was a sense of, “right, that’s one box ticked”, then we quickly moved on to making sure we won them outright. There has been a lot of chat around the 2023 Ashes and that we let England back into the contest to tie that series. We wanted to make sure we didn’t give them a sniff this time. We’ve responded really well, both on and off the field, to the disappointment of the drawn Ashes series and the T20 World Cup at the end of last year. The whole playing group has gone to another level and we’ve raised the bar of what we can achieve in the white-ball forms. I’ve been pretty happy with my own form. At the start of the T20 leg, I thought it was a good opportunity for me to lay down a marker and take the game on and take England on more.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We certainly don’t want to give them any reason to find confidence for when they come back to our shores. If we can do that by winning the Test match and getting all 16 points, that will go a long way to psychologically burying them. We want to make sure that in the future they’ve still got that hanging over them, where they think, “well, we went over there and couldn’t even get a win”.It has probably been a tough series for England. We’ve managed to find a way to win every game so far, but I can understand the desperation from England to try and get a win and redeem themselves. The scrutiny that they’ve been under from their own fans and followers of the game should be taken as a real positive. When you’re watching an international team, you’re expecting high performance. If a team’s not quite meeting that standard, then questions get asked and rightly so. It’s a great thing that people care about the women’s game that much that they’re willing to have an opinion about what they see and what they think needs to be better.Explore more on these topicsWomen's AshesAustralia women's cricket teamEngland women's cricket teamWomen's cricketCricketAustralia sportcommentShareReuse this content"

Travis Head, promoted to open the innings, silenced the critics of those who wanted Sam Konstas at the top of the order by smashing 57 off 40 balls before Khawaja and Smith took control in an unbeaten 195-run third-wicket stand.Australia were 2-330 and in complete control when rain forced stumps to be called 20 minutes early at 4.40pm.Sri Lanka v Australia: first men’s cricket Test, day one – liveRead moreSmith, who ended unbeaten on 104, became only the fourth Australian to reach 10,000 Test runs when he played a quick single to mid-on in the minutes before the lunch break. For his part, 38-year-old Khawaja (147 not out) fired back at those who had questioned his Test future during a lukewarm home summer and raised his bat for afirst ton since June 2023.Sri Lanka wasted several chances hunting a breakthrough, notably declining to review appeals that would have dismissed Head lbw and Khawaja caught behind.View image in fullscreenKusal Mendis of Sri Lanka drops Usman Khawaja during day one of the First Test match in Galle.Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty ImagesKhawaja was dropped twice behind the stumps either side of lunch, with Smith also put down by Prabath Jayasuriya from his own bowling after the stand-in captain scored the one run he needed for his milestone. Kamindu Mendis later fumbled a tough chance to dismiss Smith in the air at cover.Smith and Khawaja made their hosts pay, to the delight of a healthy Galle crowd comprising more Australian tourists than Sri Lankan locals. Khawaja initially played the steady hand next to Head, who brought up his half-century in 35 balls – the equal sixth-fastest Test 50 by an Australian. But when the No 5 turned opener holed out to long-on, Khawaja took charge.Once derided for his track record against spin, Khawaja rejoiced in flaunting his sweep shot on a slow pitch offering limited bounce. He played Asitha Fernando past fine-leg for four to bring up his 16th Test ton from 135 balls in the second session.View image in fullscreenAustralia’s captain, Steve Smith, celebrates after scoring his 10,000th Test run.Photograph: Ishara S Kodikara/AFP/Getty ImagesIt was Khawaja’s first Test century in 34 attempts, and may well breathe life into a Test career that the 38-year-old insists he has no immediate plans to end.A beautiful six down the ground towards the historic Galle Fort, and three fours from the same Vandersay over were the highlights of Smith’s fastest Test half century, brought up from 57 balls. Sri Lanka stemmed the bleeding after the tea break as Australia went 100 deliveries without a boundary, before Smith sized Vandersay up once again.Smith belted the hot-and-cold leg-spinner for two fours past mid-wicket in three balls before he brought up a 35th Test century by running three from Nishan Peiris.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe SpinFree weekly newsletterSubscribe to our cricket newsletter for our writers' thoughts on the biggest stories and a review of the week’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Jocelyn Ledward KC, for the crown, argued in court filings the sentences were “neither wrong in law nor manifestly excessive”.The case continues.Explore more on these topicsUK criminal justicePhilosophyEnvironmental activismProtestPrisons and probationClimate crisisJust Stop OilnewsShareReuse this content"

For others, the first warning was an urgent text message in the middle of the night.Susan Lee Streets, who signed up for the alert app Nixle, did not get any alerts specific to her west Altadena neighborhood before she and her family left of their own accord at about 10pm after losing power and cellphone reception, she said.Climate triple whammy boosted risk of LA fires, study showsRead more“If we had even been informed that houses and other structures were burning down, we would have known better what was happening,” she said. “We almost went to sleep that night with two kids and a dog and two cats in the house.”Only after 3am did an alert hit her phone.It could take months for the investigation to reveal what went wrong.But an Associated Press review of scanner traffic recordings and data from California’s chief fire agency (Cal Fire), the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the private fire tracking app Watch Duty suggests the hours between midnight and 3.30am appear to have been particularly challenging for first responders inLos Angelescounty.Resources were stretched thin, and hurricane-force winds had grounded air support, limiting authorities’ ability to get a top-down perspective on the flames.Calls reporting burning homes were flooding in as embers blew on to roofs and yards. During one half-hour period, 17 new addresses were relayed to firefighters, even as some crews ran low on fuel.By 12.07am, Cal Fire records show, dozens of neighborhoods had been ordered to evacuate because of the Eaton fire, all of them east of Altadena’s North Lake Avenue. None of the neighborhoods to the west – where 17 confirmed fatalities occurred, as first reported by the Los Angeles Times – had received evacuation warnings or orders, despite house fires being reported there more than an hour earlier.Over the next three hours, fire crews would go from begging for resources on the eastern flank of the blaze to radioing the command center to make sure it knew the fire was spreading west along the foothills near Sunset ridge.Just before 3.30am, evacuation orders expanded significantly, with residents in 12 areas of Altadena and elsewhere told to “leave now”.The process of issuing evacuation notices starts with firefighters or other personnel on the ground recommending action, said Nick Russell, vice-president for operations at Watch Duty, a private fire-tracking app that has become a lifeline for many residents of fire-prone zones. It then moves up the chain of command to sheriffs, who ultimately put out any order.During major emergencies, communications can be hampered by issues such as limited radio connectivity, wind noise or other technical problems. Incident command stations may have trouble synthesizing the large amounts of information they are getting from different agencies, which is critical for understanding the scope of an emergency such as a fire.Possibly another complicating factor is the web of alert systems in the region. In Los Angeles county, residents who sign up for emergency notifications through theAlert LA County websiteare then directed to a list of 57 links to other specific neighborhood or city alert system signups, as well as a general one covering 19 other cities. The city of Los Angeles and the sheriff’s department also have alert systems.It is not clear how the overlapping systems, which use different software programs, work together, or whether officials coordinate.A 2024 hazard mitigation plan directed the city’s emergency management department to assess gaps in alert and warning systems in areas with poor cellphone connectivity and then implement a solution to ensure alerts reach people. But that goal was given a “medium” priority level and a long-term timeline, with completion expected sometime in the next 10 years.Meanwhile the county’s hazard mitigation plan, last updated in 2020, did not include a focus on emergency alerts or public notifications. Instead its high-priority goals had to do with educating people about wind’s impact on wildfire risk and with community wildfire protection.Issues with alert systems have been a common issue in recent years. After-action reports and investigations revealed problems in the 2017 Tubbs fire, which killed 22 people in Santa Rosa; the 2018 Camp fire, which killed 85 people in Paradise; the Woolsey fire, which started the same day and killed three in Malibu; as well as in Colorado’s 2021 Marshall fire, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes outside Denver; and in Hawaii’s 2023 Lahaina fire, which decimated that historic town and killed 102.Tricia Wachtendorf, director of the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware, said alerts have to be specific and clear. Research has shown that for them to be effective, people have to hear, understand, believe, personalize and confirm them before they react.“Just because you send the message at 3am doesn’t mean someone is hearing it,” Wachtendorf said.Jodi and Jeff Moreno first heard that the Eaton fire was blazing near their home on a neighborhood app. But the first official warning only came at about 2.30am, when authorities yelled through a bullhorn to evacuate, they said. The couple grabbed their three daughters, their dog and some important papers, and fled.There were no text alerts until after they were gone.“On the neighborhood apps, some people were going, some people were staying. It was a wide variety of responses. We were navigating it on our own,” Jodi Moreno said. “It’s hard for us to gauge where exactly is that fire, where are the embers blowing.”Desperate for more information, both the Morenos and Streets downloaded the Watch Duty app.Officials at Los Angeles county’s coordinated joint information center declined to comment other than to say that an independent review of evacuations and emergency notifications is planned and the office of emergency management, county fire department and sheriff’s department plan to fully engage with it.Explore more on these topicsCalifornia wildfiresWildfiresLos AngelesCaliforniaWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

Arecent studyalso found that songbirds are inadvertently killing their young by making nests out of contaminated pet fur.There is growing concern about the impact these treatments are having on biodiversity. Imidacloprid and fipronil, for example, are powerful insecticides:one monthly flea treatmentfor a large dog contains enough imidacloprid to kill 25 million bees.Dave Goulson, professor of biology at the University of Sussex, where the songbird study was carried out, said: “Given the scale of environmental contamination it is causing, prophylactic use of flea treatments on family pets cannot continue.“Defra [Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] and the veterinary profession need to take responsibility for development of a sustainable alternative, but an obvious first step is to stop treating animals for fleas if they don’t have fleas.“After all, we don’t treat our children against nits if they don’t have them. Promoting prophylactic, monthly treatment is simply profiteering.”The UK government is drawing up plans for a total ban on imidacloprid in agriculture but not for pet treatments.Fleas can also be prevented by using a flea comb and washing pet bedding regularly.“I’ve felt really pushed, and a bit patronised, by our vets for not subscribing to their monthly programme to receive monthly flea and worm treatment (and vaccines),” said Helen Hedges, a nurse who has two dogs.“I’ve moved to an independent vet who are better and more open to discussing alternative options. Why do I need to apply chemicals to them if they don’t actually have fleas?! I never did this to my childen – I only treated them for nits when they had nits, not monthly to prevent them.“Even this has its downfalls though as vets can’t prescribe flea treatment if they haven’t seen a dog for six months, so the only time my dogs had fleas in the last two years cost nearly £200 for the consultation and treatment for both dogs.”The British Veterinary Association (BVA) is calling for more research into the impact of the pesticides and said vets should use them responsibly.The BVA president, Elizabeth Mullineaux, said: “Parasiticides play an important role in preventing and treating parasites in animals, which if left unaddressed can lead to bigger health and welfare issues in both animals and people.“Rather than blanket use, we strongly encourage vets and owners to take a risk-based approach to prescribing or recommending these medicines, reflecting an animal’s exposure to parasites.“Owners should speak with their vet about their animal’s needs and how to responsibly use and dispose of these medicines to minimise environmental contamination.”Explore more on these topicsVeterinary medicinePollutionPetsHealthAnimalsBiodiversitynewsShareReuse this content"

We had hoped for a sharpness in witnesses’ responses but were exasperated by the lengthy and diffuse answers that were given to us and will be writing to them to seek the clarity that we expected to hear in the evidence session.”The statement came hours after MPs on the public accounts committee (PAC) publisheda scathing reportthat aired their serious doubts about Pritchard’s ability to lead the transformation of the health service that ministers have pledged to drive through.There has been speculation at senior levels of the NHS that Pritchard’s three and a half years in charge may be drawing to a close.One senior source said that relations between NHS England and the department of health and social care were good for several months after Labour took power in July but have become “difficult” and “toxic” since the budget last October. Despite the NHS being handed a £22bn boost over the next two years, it has said the extra money is not enough to power the transformation that Streeting wants.The PAC accused senior figures in both NHS England and the Department ofHealthand Social Care (DHSC) of being “complacent” about the degree of change needed to get the NHS back on its feet and of lacking the fresh ideas needed. Several MPs on the health committee put questions to Pritchard, her deputy, Julian Kelly, and England’s chief nursing officer, Duncan Barton, about a number of its key findings.The health secretary, Wes Streeting, has previously expressed confidence in Pritchard, who is closely involved in the development of the government’s 10-year plan to modernise the NHS. “He still retains full confidence in her,” a senior Whitehall source said.NHS England responded to Moran’s criticism by explaining that the publication on Thursday of the NHS’s latest annual planning guidance – the priorities the DHSC has told it to focus on in 2025-26 – made it difficult for her to give as much detail as she would have liked about plans to overhaul the way the service delivers care.“Tomorrow, as agreed with government, we will be issuing our planning guidance setting out our next steps and targets, meaning we could not share as much information with the committee as we would have liked,” an NHS England spokesperson said.In Wednesday’s appearance, Pritchard also fuelled a growing row over the future of women’s healthcare by admitting that the NHS “doesn’t always have the needs of women at its heart”. Her remark came as the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), which represents doctors specialising in women’s health, urged Streeting not to let NHS England abandon guaranteed funding for the network of women’s health hubs it has set up in recent years.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Timesreported last weekendthat the document would tell the NHS to prioritise improving key treatment waiting time targets over providing better care for certain groups of patients. NHS ambitions in the areas of women’s health and learning disabilities would be relaxed as part of that switch, it said.In her letter on Wednesday to Streeting, the RCOG’s president, Dr Ranee Thakar, told him of doctors’ “deep concern” at the loss of automatic funding for women’s health hubs. Any such move would be “self-defeating”, given their proven success in reducing demand for hospital-based care, and “will result in a deterioration in women’s health”, she added.Jon Sparkes, the chief executive of the charity Mencap, has also voiced his concern about the potential axing of a promise that 75% of people with learning disabilities will receive an annual health check. “Reports suggesting that critical NHS goals, such as ensuring annual health checks for people with a learning disability, are at risk of being scrapped could have deadly consequences,” he said.“Even when resources are tight, addressing waiting times and ensuring people with a learning disability are receiving adequate healthcare should never be pitted against each other.“People with a learning disability are currently dying, on average, up to 23 years earlier than the general population. Scrapping targets for vital interventions like annual health checks – where existing and potential health conditions can be identified and treated early on – will only make this gap wider.”Explore more on these topicsNHSHealthEnglandHealth policyPublic services policynewsShareReuse this content"

Trump’s data protection lawsuit was dismissed, with Judge Karen Steyn ruling “there are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed”.In a witness statement, Trump said he brought the case to prove claims in the Steele dossier, published by the BuzzFeed website in 2017, that he engaged in “perverted sexual acts” in Russia, were false.Many of the claims in the dossier were never substantiated and lawyers for Trump said the report was “egregiously inaccurate” and contained “numerous false, phoney or made-up allegations”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A separate allegation of sexual assault was also made against Perumbalath.The statement from senior clergy, which followed consultations with local clergy, congregations and staff, will put intense pressure on Perumbalath to consider his position.The allegations about Perumbalath come less than three months after the Church of England was thrown into unprecedented crisis after Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, wasforced to resignover a separate abuse scandal.A statement from six senior clergy on Wednesday evening said: “Having listened to clergy, congregations and staff at the diocesan offices and the cathedral, it is with deep regret that the senior leadership of the diocese of Liverpool feel that the position of the Rt Revd Dr John Perumbalath is currently untenable.“We believe that the allegations made by the female bishop need to be fully and properly investigated. We also believe that while these proper investigations are conducted the bishop of Liverpool will need to step aside from all ministry in the diocese of Liverpool.”The statement was issued 24 hours after Channel 4 News revealed that two women had come forward with allegations about Perambalath. One woman accused Perumbalath of kissing her without consent and groping her, and a female bishop accused him of sexual harassment. Both incidents allegedly took place in Essex in 2023.Perumbalath, who became bishop of Liverpool in 2023, said police had investigated the allegations but taken no further action. He added that while he did not believe there had been any wrongdoing, he had “taken seriously the lessons learnt”.Perumbalath said he had complied with an investigation by the national safeguarding team. The allegations had also been investigated by the police, he said, who took no further action.“Whilst I don’t believe I have done anything wrong, I have taken seriously the lessons learnt through this process addressing how my actions can be perceived by others,” he said.The Church ofEnglandsaid a complaint of alleged misconduct had been brought against the bishop in 2023, after Perumbalath formally and legally assumed the role.A spokesperson said the NST had concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring a complaint under the Clergy Discipline Measure (CDM). They also said the complaint had been investigated by police, who took no further action, and that support had been offered to the woman.A second complaint was made shortly after the first complaint, according to the C of E. The spokesperson said the second complainant did not bring a CDM complaint within the one-year deadline. The individual later applied for permission to bring it after the deadline, which was supported by the archbishop of York, but was refused by an independent judge, the deputy president of tribunals.“The information brought by the second complainant was explored and assessed not to be a safeguarding matter but a matter of alleged misconduct. Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing,” the C of E spokesperson said.The archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, Welby’s temporary stand-in, has also faced calls to stand down after allegations emerged that a priest at the centre of a sexual abuse case was twice reappointed under him while he was serving as bishop of Chelmsford.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

Some 7.5% of people aged 16-24 identified as bisexual in 2023, up from 2.8% in 2018. The figure was even higher among women aged 16-24, with 9.2% identifying as bisexual compared with 5.9% of males.Simon Blake, the chief executive of LGBTQ+ charity Stonewall said the data should be “a wake-up call to organisations and governments who are rolling back on their commitments to LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion”.“Lesbian, gay and bisexual people are a growing part of UK society, with more LGB young people than ever before,” he said. “The more than one in 10 of 16-24 year-olds identifying as LGB will be a crucial part of our workplaces, politics and lives. They will have colleagues, friends and families who support them, and they will deserve – and demand – equal rights and opportunities.”Across the population as a whole, an estimated 2.1 million people (3.8%) identified as LGB in 2023, up from 1.2m (2.2%) in 2018; 93.6% of the UK population identified as heterosexual, down from 94.6% in 2018.The data suggests that the proportion of UK adults identifying as LGB varies sharply in different age groups: while one in 10 under-25s say they are LGB, the figure is closer to one in 100 for the over 65s. The data shows that 6.3% of 25-34 year-olds identify as LGB, compared to 2.9% of 35-49 year-olds and 2.4% of 50-64 year-olds.London had the highest proportion of adults identifying as LGB in 2023 (5.2%) followed by south-west England (4.4%), while Northern Ireland had the lowest (2.2%) with the West Midlands the second lowest (2.8%).The ONS data also shows that same-sex marriages, which wereintroduced in 2014 in the UK, have overtaken civil partnerships,available to same-sex couplessince 2005 and toheterosexual couples since 2018, as the most common type of legal partnership for people identifying as gay or lesbian. The proportion of heterosexual people in opposite-sex marriages has fallen from 49.7% in 2018 to 46.2% in 2023.The ONS said the increase in the number of people identifying as LGB could be “attributed to more people being more open to identifying their own sexual orientation as being LGB, together with changing societal attitudes meaning a greater acceptance of different sexual orientations”.Results from the separateBritish Social Attitudes (BSA) survey in 2023“support the view that society is becoming more welcoming towards diversity in sexual identity – a view supported by the recognition of same-sex relationships in law through same-sex marriage and same-sex civil partnership legislation,” the ONS added.In its 40th year of mapping Britain’s cultural and political landscape, the BSA survey found “a near revolution” in the liberalisation of attitudes over the last four decades, including towards same-sex relationships. In 1983 half of respondents said they were “always wrong”, compared with 9% in 2022.Explore more on these topicsLGBTQ+ rightsChildrenYoung peoplenewsShareReuse this content"

Eight of the women in the clips used as evidence against Zou are yet to be identified.Zou was at University College London from 2019 studying for a master’s degree in engineering and then a PhD. He came to Britain in September 2017 and studied first at Queen’s University in Belfast.When he was arrested in London and his electronic devices searched, a document on “Club Drugs and Their Acute Toxic Effects” was found.The prosecutor, Catherine Farrelly KC, said: “To the outside world, he undoubtedly presents as a smart and charming young man. The prosecution says that he is also a persistent sexual predator; a voyeur and a rapist.“The prosecution case at this trial is that he would meet women, he would stupefy them, either with drink or drugs, and, once they were significantly under the influence of drink or drugs, he would rape them. Often, he would record himself doing so.”The jury heard that Zou faced 35 counts on the indictment against him and they would be shown some of the videos, which the crown said showed his guilt.Farrelly said: “Often, he would record himself doing so and you will be shown several recordings during this trial, which the prosecution says are the defendant’s souvenirs of many rapes that he had committed; items that he kept for his own private sexual gratification, so that he could watch, at his leisure, his rapes of these women, who he had rendered often unconscious and totally vulnerable to his will.”In all, Zou faces 11 counts of rape against 10 women, three counts of voyeurism, 12 of possession of an extreme pornographic image, one of false imprisonment and eight of possession of a controlled drug with intent to supply.It took 15 minutes to read all the counts to the jury. Zou was helped to follow proceedings by an interpreter.Farrelly said: “The prosecution bases its case upon videos that police have found on the defendant’s mobile telephone and two cameras belonging to the defendant.”The jury was told it would hear from two women whom detectives had identified. Videos, the prosecutor said, were recovered by police of attacks on nine of the 10 women.Searches of Zou’s home found various drugs alleged to be MDMA, butanediol, ketamine and alprazolam. He claimed he had one of them to use as a skin moisturiser.Farrelly said: “The prosecution case is that these are the exact kinds of drugs that the defendant could covertly use by slipping them into a drink to stupefy his victims so that he could rape them, and this was the reason that he was in possession of them.”Police in London were first contacted in May 2023, by a woman. Farrelly said: “In the call, she explained that she’d been given alcohol and that the male had not let her leave. She said that he had forced her to drink a lot of alcohol and had then raped her.”Later this woman posted on social media naming Zou, and was contacted by another woman “who had said she had had a similar experience”, the jury was told.The jury was told during one video alleged to show an attack, a woman said: “I really don’t want … I beg you, don’t do this …” and Zou replied: “… don’t push me, it’s pointless … The sound insulation here is very good.”The jury was told that Zou’s defence was that one complainant agreed to have sex and “had asked him for money and was angry when he didn’t pay her”.Farrelly said that victim went to Zou’s then south London home for drinks and felt tired. Zou had sex with her and she told police: “I can’t fight back, I have no strength,” and was raped while unconscious, the court heard.Video recovered later of the incident shot by a camera on a bedside table shows the young woman and Zou talking in a Chinese language.Farrelly said the woman’s speech becomes slurred, she complains of feeling unwell and wanting to go home, later telling him not to restrain her, screaming and trying to “get up from the bed on several occasions and the defendant pushes her back down each time”.The trial continues.Explore more on these topicsUK newsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

No other jurisdiction in the world that allows assisted dying has such a requirement, he said.Theterminally ill adults (end of life) billwould allow adults in England and Wales with less than six months to live to end their lives, subject to approval by two doctors and a high court judge.Sumption, who served in the UK’s supreme court until 2018, said: “It is not entirely clear what the judge is supposed to do … Is he there to ensure that the two doctors have done their job and the ducks are all in a row, or is he there to form his own view on these matters, completely independently of all those who have given certificates?“If the latter, one is talking about quite a time-consuming process, involving a lot of additional evidence. It seems to me this is a protection which no other country, so far that I am aware of among those who have authorised assisted dying, have included.”He said a proposal for a special panel of judges to deal with assisted dying applications might “resolve the problem of the shortage of capacity in the high court. It would not, however, resolve the problem of the overengineering of the procedural provisions of this bill.”The clause “infers a protection that is largely illusory and undoubtedly very time-consuming … It involves the intervention of the state in an intensely personal agonising process, which to my mind is inappropriate.”MPs also heard doctors from Australian states which have legalised assisted dying argue that the criterion of six months to live should be increased to 12 months.Dr Cam McLaren, a Melbourne oncologist, said: “I always say to people, we do not know they have six months left to live until they have six weeks left to live. And we as oncologists know, in the matter of one CT scan, we can change a person’s prognosis from 18 months to three months.“All of a sudden they see their life ending and then they begin an [assisted dying] application that takes a month to apply.”Dr Clare Fellingham, the deputy director of medical services at Royal Perth hospital, said the UK had a “golden opportunity to look across every jurisdiction that already has laws in operation, and cherrypick the very best bits of what is working well in those jurisdictions to create the very best, most robust but also most patient-centred legislation you can”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Chelsea Roff, the founder ofEat Breathe Thrive, said at least 60 people with eating disorders had successfully applied for an assisted death in other jurisdictions. People with diseases such as diabetes and HIV/Aids may also be able to circumvent terminal illness criteria by refusing medication or sustenance, she said.Richard Robinson, the chief executive ofHourglass, said there was “an epidemic of abuse against older people at the moment” which was “vastly underplayed”. Older people would be vulnerable to pressure to opt for an assisted death despite the safeguarding provisions in the bill, he said.Sumption said: “I think we must all be conscious of the fact that coercion, even when it is overtly applied, is extraordinarily difficult to detect.”He added: “We have to live with the limitations of what human beings can do.”Explore more on these topicsAssisted dyingEnglandWalesDeath and dyingnewsShareReuse this content"

They argued that the “dynamics in the bar and the camaraderie” would be damaged by the arrival of female members.At least five men were understood to have resigned in protest at the outcome. After the vote, a long stream of mostly white men wearing sober ties and suits, many with umbrellas, a few in claret-coloured trousers or tweed jackets, waistcoats and bow ties, carrying their overcoats over their arms, left the central London Thistle hotel, which hosted the event.Most refused to comment, except for one man who remarked: “We won! No women.”The vote came as several of the capital’s surviving gentlemen’s clubs wrestle with whether they should change their membership rules to admit women after last year’s decision by members of theGarrickClub to abandon its men-only status.The Savile Club was established in 1868 as a meeting place for writers and artists and its current membership of upwards of 1,000 people is said to include journalists, academics, musicians, scriptwriters, television executives, vicars and City workers, who pay about £1,900 in annual subscriptions.Its white stucco Mayfair building has a large ballroom, a snooker room, a library, a dark wood-panelled bar, a marble-columned dining room with a menu by Michelin-starred chef, Michael James.Briefcases, business papers, mobile phones and newspapers are not permitted in the club’s main rooms.Womenare allowed inside as guests, but need to be accompanied by the man who has invited them in.Members arguing in favour of changing the rules to allow women to join said that the club’s no-women policy was making it harder to rent out rooms in the Brooke Street building and was consequently harming club revenues, according to one member who attended.One speaker told the meeting that his son’s employers, Google, had informed him that it was now unacceptable to host meetings at the club.“We have lost, and may continue to lose, friends who will feel they cannot continue at a club that decides to continue not to accept women,” a written summary of arguments in favour of allowing women to join stated.“If we want the best members, why limit ourselves to half the potential candidates when there are so many women, in the arts and elsewhere, who would make excellent Savilians?”Attempting to explain the appeal of a men-only club, one member said he thought men liked the idea of a “man cave, a place where blokes feel that they can go and unwind”.An acrimonious atmosphere had developed in recent weeks over preparations for the emergency general meeting, as some members opposed to women joining threatened to take out a high court injunction to prevent the club from allowing people to register their votes remotely. In the face of this legal threat, club officials last week decided to abandon plans for remote voting.“The older members, many of whom were unable to make it to the meeting in person, tend to be more in favour of women. It’s the younger members who are more opposed to women,” one attender said, asking not to be named because club rules require members not to speak about the organisation. He described the vote as “disappointing”.“The Savile now seems to have an unfair share of young fogeys from the City and political consultancies who enjoy throwing their weight and cash around.”The 141-year-oldFlyfishers’Club, which occupies rooms on the top floor of the Savile building, voted to admit women in October, after several high-profile female anglerscomplainedabout being excluded.The Savile has been contacted for comment.Explore more on these topicsWomenLondonShareReuse this content"

I think that times and attitudes toward the president have changed since then.”“I think people have been impressed not just by the extraordinary second mandate that he has received from the American people, but the dynamism and energy with which he approached not just the campaign but government as well,” he added.“I think that he has won fresh respect. He certainly has from me, and that is going to be the basis of all the work I do as his majesty’s ambassador in the United States.”Asked about reports of concerns in Trump’s team about his appointment, Mandelson said: “I’ve heard nothing from the president or the White House or anyone working for him that suggests that there’s going to be any difficulty about my appointment.”He added: “I’ve been appointed as his majesty the king’s ambassador in the United States.

Government sources stressed that LaCivita was not due to have any role in Trump’s administration.Mandelson is known to have strong connections in China and has held meetings with senior Chinese Communist party figures as recently as 2023.The Guardian revealedthat Global Counsel worked for Shein, the Chinese fashion company, until early last year.

He has previously spoken about his unhappiness with changes togovernment policy on non-doms.Haidar told the Guardian: “The event was a valuable opportunity to learn more about the party’s mission, and I believe they have a good one to ‘make the UK great again’. It’s worth considering them as a strong alternative.”Amersi, who gave almost £500,000 to the Tories between 2019 and 2021, lost a high-profile legal battle with the former Conservative MP Charlotte Leslie in 2023, and the Tory MP David Davis subsequently made astring of serious allegationsagainst him under parliamentary privilege. Amersi has also spoken ofpotentially donating to Labour politicians.Amersi told the Guardian: “The energy in the room was just really electric. It does feel like momentum is behind Reform and the question is what happens to the strands of conservatism, Reform and the Conservative party. People like me, who straddle both, will certainly be pushing for a unified stance …“Mr Farage was impressive as ever and I was particularly impressed by the young chairman, Zia Yusuf, who was dynamic and articulate. Nick Candy, of course, is also an amazing figure to have there. He is a doer.”Topics discussed included Reform’s chances in the local elections and in Wales and Scotland. Donors who attended say they were told that 190,000 people had signed up to beReform UKmembers.The fundraising event was organised by Farage and Candy, the party’s new treasurer, who is also a former Conservative donor.

Factoring in interest and penalties for late payments,HMRCcould be owed as much as £1bn.Although the files are very detailed, it is possible that some elements are missing. But the leaked material is sufficient to raise questions about whether UK tax should have been paid, according to experts.Chelsea FC may also have benefited from the hedge fund investments because one of the companies at the heart of the scheme bankrolled other Abramovich vehicles, some of which financed the London club.The investigation is part of theCyprus Confidentialseries, based on the largest ever leak of financial information from the Mediterranean tax haven, which the Guardian and its reporting partners have been examining since 2022.View image in fullscreenChelsea footballers during a Premier League match in December 2021.Photograph: David Klein/ReutersAt a time when the UK chancellor, Rachel Reeves, is struggling to fund crucial public services, the latest findings are expected to fuel calls to review the Abramovich tax file.The chair of parliament’s cross-party group on responsible tax said HMRC should “thoroughly investigate” the case.Lawyers for Abramovich declined to answer detailed questions, responding only in the broadest terms. They said he had always acted in accordance with professional tax advice. They denied that he was personally responsible for any alleged failure to pay taxes that were due.The hedge fund networkIt was the $13bn deal to sell his Siberian oil and gas business to Russia’s state-owned Gazprom that propelled Abramovich into the ranks of the super-rich in 2005.Much of the money did not stay in Russia. Over two decades, Abramovich acquired luxury homes in London and the south of France, a valuable art collection and a London football club. But he also made investments, using a structure at the centre of which sat one company, BVI-registered Keygrove Holdings Limited.Keygrove was owned first by the Sara Trust, then from 2010 by the HF Trust. Both trusts were based in Cyprus and counted Abramovich as their sole beneficiary until 2022, when he was replaced by his five children.Keygrove, in turn, owned more than a dozen BVI companies, each of which poured hundreds of millions of dollars into investments including hedge funds around the world.These offshore investment companies, the files suggest, did not pay UK corporation tax. But the Cyprus Confidential files raise serious questions about whether they should have.Abramovich’s right-hand manThe list of hedge funds invested in by Abramovich is a roll-call of the top firms on Wall Street and in the City of London, but their names will mean little to the average saver: clients must typically invest a minimum of $100,000 to join these exclusive clubs.They included the world’s largest asset manager, BlackRock; the UK group Brevan Howard, whose founder Alan Howarddonated £1m to the Conservativesbefore the last general election; and Marshall Wace, whose founder Paul Marshall bankrolls Britain’s rightwing GB News and has just acquired the conservative news magazine the Spectator. The funds are not responsible for the tax affairs of their investors and there is no suggestion that the leaks raise questions about their conduct.As the investments grew in value, profits accumulated in the offshore companies.UK law on how corporate profits made by overseas companies should be taxed is complex but guided by a relatively simple concept: who makes the key decisions, and where.If someone in the UK exercises “central management and control”, the company can be considered resident in the UK for tax purposes.If companies want to be taxed offshore,HMRC guidelinesrecommend that strategic decision-making should take place overseas, too.These guidelines, designed to promote the UK as a financial centre for those with money offshore, can lead to set-ups that appear rather artificial. Executives fly out to tax havens such as Jersey or Isle of Man to approve decisions, ensuring that the rules are, technically at least, respected. But those managing the Abramovich structure do not appear to have followed the basic requirements to make such a scheme work legitimately.Directors of the investment companies were employed by offshoots of Abramovich’s family office, Millhouse, based in countries including Austria, Germany and the UK. But the files do not contain evidence that they met offshore to make decisions.The leaked documents and court filings suggest they were controlled by the executive sometimes described as Abramovich’s “right-hand man”: Eugene Shvidler.After the fall of the Soviet Union, Shvidler chaired Sibneft and then Millhouse.Where Abramovich went, his associate followed. When the billionaire bought Chelsea FC in 2003, adopting London as his new home, Shvidler joined him.In a recent UK court case, Shvidler has confirmed that he was a dual US-UK citizen who had lived in the UK since 2004 and became a UK citizen in 2010 under the so-called “golden visa” scheme that granted wealthy people fast-track citizenship.If Shvidler was controlling the investments, he appears to have been doing so from the UK.View image in fullscreenAbramovich with Eugene Shvidler.Photograph: Nick Potts/PACentral management and controlQuestions about whether tax was properly paid also hinge on whether Shvidler wielded what HMRC refers to as the “highest level of control”.Leaked documents and court filings suggest he did.Between 2004 and 2009, Shvidler was handed the authority to make decisions on behalf of the BVI companies, via more than 50 “general power of attorney” documents, renewed annually, the Cyprus files show.Documents filed during a US court case suggest that Shvidler had control of the companies both during this period and after.In 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US markets, brought legal action against a New York financial advisory firm called Concord Management. The SEC complaint says Concord gave investment advice without the required permission, and that it acted for just one client – Abramovich.Concord was run by Michael Matlin, who had studied with Shvidler in Moscow. Founded in 1999, it was active until 2022, helping to select investments that would yield returns for Abramovich.However, SEC filings indicate that Shvidler, who is not named in the case but referred to only as “Person B”, wielded control over the BVI hedge fund investment companies.He was, the filings state, the “point of contact for receiving investment advice from Matlin and Concord and for either deciding or communicating the decision whether to go forward with recommended transactions”.Each month, according to the court papers, Shvidler would receive a shortlist of funds from Matlin. He would then make investment decisions, which would be “signed by the directors of the relevant investing entities as necessary”.In effect, the court filings suggest, the directors simply rubber-stamped his orders.Shvidler seems to have remained the key decision-maker as late as February 2022, approving 10 private fund investments worth more than $100m combined, just days before Vladimir Putin’s tanks rolled into Ukraine.His role, say tax experts, is crucial in assessing any UK tax liability.Hedge fund structure graphicRita de la Feria, professor of tax law at the University of Leeds, said: “Put together, it puts a very strong case that, yes, effective management was done in the UK.”Four other leading tax experts, who asked not to be named, told the Guardian that there were grounds to suspect that the companies should have been taxed in the UK.Paul Monaghan, the chief executive of the Fair Tax Foundation, said Abramovich’s companies should have faced a UK tax liability if their critical decisions were being made in the UK and directors were “effectively rubber-stamping decisions [made] up the chain”.“In which case, further investigation by HMRC would seem to be warranted,” he said.Profits and penaltiesWhile an exact figure is impossible to calculate from the data, the total sums potentially owed are enormous.Analysis of the data suggests that between 2004 and 2018, profits made by the Keygrove structure could be as high as $3.8bn. If this is the case, the amount of any unpaid UK tax could be £536m, according to analysis examined by tax experts.Were HMRC to conclude that Abamovich’s companies had failed to pay this sum, they would also be charged interest on the total avoided, amounting to at least £145m.Companies that fail to pay tax – and do not disclose this voluntarily – are also subject to late payment penalties of up to 70% of the unpaid sum, if the failure is deemed deliberate.Depending on the severity of the case, HMRC could demand between £651m and £1bn, analysis suggests. If a liability is due, some could be time-barred due to the length of time that has passed. However, the Guardian has made conservative estimates regarding corporation tax rates.Joe Powell MP, who chairs a cross-party parliamentary group on anti-corruption and responsible tax, said: “I’d like to see HMRC thoroughly investigate whether corporation tax or any other taxes are owed by Abramovich on these operations.“More widely, I think it’s a good test case for whether HMRC and other regulators have the enforcement capacity that they need to make cases of this nature.”The files indicate that Chelsea FC may have benefited from the profits generated by the hedge fund investments. This is because Keygrove lent money to other companies in Abramovich’s business empire, which in turn lent money to Chelsea’s parent company.Powell also raised questions over the future of the £2bn proceeds from Abramovich’s forced sale of Chelsea FC, which have been sitting in escrow since 2022, supposedly destined to help rebuild Ukraine.“I would like to see more transparency and a clear timeline [in relation to the funds],” said Powell.“That money is five times the UK total humanitarian aid to Ukraine since February 2022 and there’s massive need.”Lawyers for Abramovich said he had always obtained independent expert professional tax and legal advice in respect of his tax affairs and acted in accordance with that advice. They added that Abramovich expected that similar advice was sought at the relevant times by those with responsibility for the day-to-day running of his businesses.View image in fullscreenThe HM Revenue and Customs building in Whitehall, London.Photograph: Andrew Aitchison/In Pictures/Getty ImagesThey said he denied any allegation that he had or ought to have had any knowledge of, was personally responsible for and/or was personally liable for any alleged failure to pay taxes which were lawfully due or for any other purpose.Lawyers for Shvidler have denied him being knowingly or negligently involved in an unlawful scheme to avoid paying tax. They have said that the investments to which we refer were the subject of very careful and detailed tax planning, undertaken and advised on by leading tax advisers.Chelsea FC declined to comment.Additional reporting by Eleanor Rose and Ed SiddonsExplore more on these topicsRoman AbramovichCyprusEuropeHMRCnewsShareReuse this content"

It is simply a rescission of the OMB memo,” Leavitt wrote on X.“Why? To end any confusion created by the court’s injunction. The President’s EO’s on federal funding remain in full force and effect, and will be rigorously implemented.”A federal judge on Wednesday issued a restraining order against the funding freeze proposed in the OMB memo, pointing to Leavitt’s comments and contradictory messages from the White House. That order came after a different judge temporarily blocked the funding freeze on Tuesday.The Rhode Island-based federal judge John McConnell intervened at the behest of Democratic state attorneys general amid the confusion, with the White House saying it had rescinded the memo but was not backing down from a freeze on funding in areas targeted by the recent executive orders. McConnell asked the attorneys general to submit a proposed temporary restraining order for him to sign.Democrats quickly claimed victory for the reversal. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said that “Americans fought back andDonald Trumpbacked off” and called on the president to withdraw his nomination of Russel Vought, an author of Project 2025, to lead the OMB.He said: “Though the Trump administration failed in this tactic, it’s no secret that they will try to find another, and when they do, it will again be Senate Democrats there to call it out, fight back, and defend American families.”Trump put federal funding in his sights shortly after taking office, pausing disbursements under Joe Biden’s signature legislative programs to fight the climate crisis and improve the nation’s infrastructure. But this week’s memorandum went even further, blocking outlays for programs that had stood for years, often with bipartisan support.“Financial assistance should be dedicated to advancing administration priorities, focusing taxpayer dollars to advance a stronger and safer America, eliminating the financial burden of inflation for citizens, unleashing American energy and manufacturing, ending ‘wokeness’ and the weaponization of government, promoting efficiency in government, and Making America Healthy Again,” the acting OMB director, Matthew J Vaeth, wrote in the original memo.He went on to imply that federal money was being spent on “Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies”, which he called “a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve”.The pause was supposed to take effect on Tuesday evening, but before that deadline and the court order blocking it, lawmakers from states across the country reported that websites facilitating federal payments to healthcare and childcare providers were offline.The potential for disruption was far and wide. Seth Magaziner, a Democratic congressman who is the ranking member on the homeland security subcommittee on counter-terrorism, shared a list of dozens of security-related programs that were having their funding frozen, and wrote: “This is a gift to terrorists and our adversaries across the world. Trump needs to stop this madness and resume funding now.”Kendra Davenport, president and CEO of Easterseals, a national organization that provides services to seniors, children and adults with disabilities and veterans, said the possibility that federal grants would be cut off created “a day of heartache, chaos, panic and real fear”.“Everybody wants to make sure every federal dollar is spent wisely. But we need to do it in a way that protects veterans, ageing adults, and more than one in four Americans with a disability,” Davenport said in a statement. “Now that a federal court has put a temporary pause on the grant freeze, let’s do a reset. We can have responsible government spending and support hardworking American families.”Reuters contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The three – a soldier, Agam Berger, and two Israeli civilian hostages, Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses – are due to be handed over on Thursday.Moses, 80, will be the first male civilian hostage to be released under the current ceasefire deal.There was speculation that five Thai citizens held by Hamas could also be released on Thursday.The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club said 110 prisoners would be released in the deal including 30 minors. The list also includes Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent militant and former theatre director who was one ofsix men to tunnel out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel in 2021. All were recaptured within days but the escape helped solidify Zubeidi’s image among Palestinians as a folk hero.The ceasefire exchanges were continuing as Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel to discuss progress towards the second phase of the truce before a planned meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president next week in Washington. Witkoff also briefly visited the so-called Netzarim Corridorin Gaza.According to Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, Witkoff was accompanied by Israel Defense Forces, and visited the corridor with the strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer.A law banning the activities of Unrwa will come into force on Thursday amid warnings that the agency’s closure will affect large numbers of Palestinians relying on its services and aid, including in Gaza.The enforcement of the ban, which would result in the closure of the agency’s headquarters in East Jerusalem, follows a notification to the UN from the Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, this week. “Within 48 hours, the State of Israel will cease its cooperation with Unrwa,” Danon said. “Unrwa must cease its activities and evacuate all its facilities in Jerusalem.”Israel’s insistence that it would close Unrwa came as a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the decision was a “provocation” that would fuel tensions in the region owing to its impact on Palestinian refugees.Unrwa was founded in 1949 to support hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced by the conflict that resulted in Israel’s foundation, and has continued to support refugees over the intervening decades.View image in fullscreenPalestinians in Gaza queue for aid parcels distributed by Unrwa.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt has been the target of Israeli criticism for years, not least the argument by Israeli officials that its existence perpetuates the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.More recently, Israel claimed that a handful of the agency’s Palestinian staff had participated in Hamas’s 7 October attack.On Wednesday, hours before the planned banning of Unrwa, Israeli officials returned to the accusations claiming the agency was full of Hamas operatives. “Unrwa equals Hamas,” said David Mencer, a government spokesperson, a claim unsupported by evidence provided by Israel. “Israel has made public irrefutable evidence Unrwa is riddled with Hamas operatives.”A series of investigations, including one led by the French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some “neutrality related issues” at Unrwa – but emphasised Israel had not provided evidence for its headline allegation.In an address to the UN security council this week, the head of Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, refuted the allegation and warned of the damage of closing the agency.“Unrwa is the largest UN presence in Gaza, with 13,000 personnel and 300 premises. The agency is critical for supporting a shattered population and the ceasefire. And yet, in two days, our operations in the occupied Palestinian territory will be crippled, as legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset takes effect.“At stake is the fate of millions of Palestinians, the ceasefire, and the prospects for a political solution that brings lasting peace and security.View image in fullscreenPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, told the UN security council the fate of millions of Palestinians was at stake if Unrwa was closed.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images“The [Israeli] political attacks on the agency are motivated by the desire to strip Palestinians of their refugee status, thereby unilaterally changing the long-established parameters for a political solution. The objective is to deny Palestine refugees the right to self-determination and erase their history and identity,” he said.Meanwhile, the Egyptian president’s remarks on Trump’s comment were the strongest pushback so far from Egypt or Jordan. Trump said on Saturday that Egypt and Jordan should take in Palestinians from Gaza, which he called a “demolition site” after 15 months of Israeli bombardment that made most of its 2.3 million people homeless.Sisi, speaking at a press conference with the visiting Kenyan president, William Ruto, said Egypt would work with Trump to reach peace between Israel and Palestinians based on a two-state solution.“Regarding what is being said about the displacement of Palestinians, it can never be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian national security,” Sisi said. “The deportation or displacement of the Palestinian people is an injustice in which we cannot participate.”Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited NationsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

OpenAI, the developer ofChatGPT, which DeepSeek has challenged with the launch of its own virtual assistant, pledged this week to accelerate product releases as a result.Who is behind DeepSeek and how did it achieve its AI ‘Sputnik moment’?Read more“If you imagine a competition between two entities and one thinks they’re way ahead, then they can afford to be more prudent and still know that they will stay ahead,” Bengio said. “Whereas if you have a competition between two entities and they think that the other is just at the same level, then they need to accelerate. Then maybe they don’t give as much attention to safety.”Bengio was speaking in a personal capacity before the publication of a wide-ranging report on AI safety.The first fullInternational AI Safety reporthas been compiled by a group of 96 experts including the Nobel prize winnerGeoffrey Hinton. Bengio, a co-winner in 2018 of the Turing award – referred to as the Nobel prize of computing – was commissioned by the UK government to preside over the report, which was announced at theglobal AI safety summit at Bletchley Parkin 2023. Panel members were nominated by 30 countries as well as the EU and UN. The next global AI summit takes place in Paris on 10 and 11 February.The report states that since publication of aninterim studyin May last year, general-purpose AI systems such as chatbots have become more capable in “domains that are relevant for malicious use”, such as the use of automated tools to highlight vulnerabilities in software and IT systems, and giving guidance on the production of biological and chemical weapons.It says new AI models can generate step-by-step technical instructions for creating pathogens and toxins that surpass the capability of experts with PhDs, with OpenAI acknowledging that its advanced o1 model could assist specialists in planning how to produce biological threats.However, the report says it is uncertain whether novices would be able to act on the guidance, and that models can also be used for beneficial purposes such as in medicine.Speaking to the Guardian, Bengio said models had already emerged that could, with the use of a smartphone camera, theoretically guide people through dangerous tasks such as trying to build a bioweapon.“These tools are becoming easier and easier to use by non-experts, because they can decompose a complicated task into smaller steps that everyone can understand, and then they can interactively help you get them right. And that’s very different from using, say, Google search,” he said.The report says AI systems have improved significantly since last year in their ability to spot flaws in software autonomously, without human intervention. This could help hackers plan cyber-attacks.However, the report says carrying out real-world attacks autonomously is beyond AI systems so far because they require “an exceptional level of precision”.Elsewhere in its analysis of the risks posed by AI, the report points to a significant increase in deepfake content, where the technology is used to produce a convincing likeness of a person – whether their image, voice or both. It says deepfakes have been used totrick companiesinto handing over money, tocommit blackmailand to create pornographic images of people. It says gauging the precise level of increase in such behaviour is difficult due to a lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics.There are also risks of malicious use because so-called closed-source models, where the underlying code cannot be modified, can be vulnerable to jailbreaks that circumvent safety guardrails, while open-source models such as Meta’s Llama, which are free to download and can be tweaked by specialists, pose risks of “facilitating malicious or misguided” use by bad actors.In a last-minute addition to the report written by Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist notes the emergence in December – shortly after the report had been finalised – of a new advanced “reasoning” model by OpenAI called o3. Bengio said its ability to make a breakthrough on a key abstract reasoning test was an achievement that many experts, including himself, had thought until recently was out of reach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said researchers had not been able to “fully resolve” those fears.AI can be loosely defined as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.The report, whose full title is the International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, flags AI’s “rapidly growing” impact on the environment through the use of datacentres, and the potential for AI agents to have a “profound” impact on the job market.It says the future of AI is uncertain, with a wide range of outcomes possible in the near future including “very positive and very negative outcomes”. It says societies and governments still have a chance to decide which path the technology takes.“This uncertainty can evoke fatalism and make AI appear as something that happens to us. But it will be the decisions of societies and governments on how to navigate this uncertainty that determine which path we will take,” the report says.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeekChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

Some victims were ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.But soon after the trial began on Wednesday morning, lawyers met in private with the judge, who later announced in court that a deal had been reached.Lawyers are not expected to immediately file documents detailing the agreement.Hawaii governor Josh Green announced the $4 bn settlement about a year after the deadliest US wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023. At the time, he touted the speed of the deal to “avoid protracted and painful lawsuits”.Defendants blamed for the blaze, including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners, had already agreed to the settlement amount.The trial had been planned to determine how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their relatives, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.Kevin Baclig had been expected to testify. His wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them – from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter.“I clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,” he said.A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife’s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.“The loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,” he said. “There are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.”The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims – such as Baclig – who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the “individual plaintiffs”.“The categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,” Lowenthal said.In their trial brief, attorneys representing the class challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over had already done so. Many people held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire’s disruption to life, “distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first”.Further complicating the matter were questions before the state supreme court, which was considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 bn-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4 bn settlement.Explore more on these topicsHawaiiWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

He had presented two non-binding motions to parliament, aimed at boosting security measures and closing all of Germany’s land borders to irregular migration.On Wednesday theparliament narrowly votedin favour of one of them, which Merz described as his “five-point plan” to end irregular migration, with 348 MPs voting in favour of it, 345 against, and 10 abstaining. It proposes turning asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border, in a move that Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens have said contravenes both German and EU law on refugees.The leader of the opposition CDU/CSU conservative alliance, which is leading the polls before the 23 February election, had shifted the debate on migration policy to the right, apparently in response to a knife attack last week in which two people were killed. Police arrested a 28-year-old Afghan man as the main suspect.Outcry followed the attack, in particular after it was revealed that the man who was arrested had been receiving psychiatric treatment and had been due to be deported, but that the measure had been delayed due to apparent bureaucratic obstacles.It was the latest in a string of attacks, the deadliest in Magdeburg last month when anSUV ploughed into a Christmas market, killing six people and injuring 300. A doctor from Saudi Arabia was arrested after that incident.An unusually heated debate preceded the vote. Scholz attacked Merz for “having effectively cancelled the fundamental agreement of our republic in the heat of the moment”, by riding on the expectation that his motions would only stand a chance of success if they were supported by the anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin AfD. Scholz called it an “unforgivable mistake”.He said that by relying on the support of the AfD, “the very same ones who are fighting against our democracy, who despise our unitedEurope, who have continued to poison the climate in our country for years”, Merz had overstepped “boundaries that as a statesman one should not overstep”.Robert Habeck, the deputy chancellor and the Greens’ candidate for chancellor, urged Merz: “Mr Merz, don’t vote with racists. It is not necessary and it is ill-advised.”Merz, however, said that getting his plans over the line with the help of the AfD would be merely “a last resort”. “It might be the case that the AfD enables the necessary majority for a law for the first time,” he said, adding that the thought of “jubilant and smirking AfD MPs”, caused him discomfort.The AfD parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, who was duly pictured laughing with and hugging party members after the result came in, said: “The so-called firewall is nothing other than an anti-democratic cartel agreement.” Merz’s migration plan, she added, had been “copied from us”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not have the chance of becoming law until after the election, but if he became chancellor Merz could be well placed to get it through.According to a poll by Insa, 66% of Germans support Merz’s plans, including 56% of supporters of Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD). But both the CDU/CSU and SPD have lost ground in the polls in recent days, while the AfD gained four percentage points.Among opponents of Merz’s proposals were the leaders of the Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany, who in a joint letter addressed to him warned of the dangers of breaking the long-held taboo of not working with the AfD. “We fear that German democracy will be massively damaged if this political promise is abandoned,” they wrote.The churches expressed their dismay at the “timing and tone” of the debate, warning it was likely to “defame all migrants living in Germany and stir up prejudice”. Neither they added, did it contribute to solving the existing challenges.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeThe far rightMigrationRefugeesOlaf ScholznewsShareReuse this content"

And that led to a number of turtles being beached or very debilitated and just floating in the water,” said Dr Heather Barron, the chief science officer and veterinarian at the center.The staff named the rescued turtles after beverages, and they painted their new names on the back of their shells. Veterinarians are treating them with antibiotics, fluids and intravenous nutrition.View image in fullscreenGreen sea turtles being treated for cold-stunning swim in a tank at Loggerhead Marinelife Center, on Wednesday.Photograph: Cody Jackson/APWhile it snowed as far south as northern Florida, which is extremely rare, the frigid temperatures reached south Florida. That meant cold-stunned turtles were also found along Palm Beach county’s coastline.“It is quite unusual for this to happen in Florida. Sea turtles do migrate, and typically they’re migrating down to Florida for this time of year because of warmer water,” Barron said.By Wednesday morning, Espresso, Pickle Juice and Ginger Beer were basking in the sunshine in the center’s “Party Tank”.The turtles arrived in Juno Beach on Friday from the Marine Science Center in Volusia county, Florida. They all suffered from cold-stunning, which causes sea turtles to lose mobility and become lethargic. Most of the 17 turtles are expected to be released back into the ocean in a few weeks.Last year, turtles from Massachusetts were brought to Florida to rehab while suffering from cold-stunning.Explore more on these topicsFloridanewsShareReuse this content"

Attempts by the Kyiv USAid office to save funding for some of the most important programmes have reportedly been rebuffed in Washington.“They requested a waiver for some of the things they considered critical but didn’t get it,” said a source familiar with discussions over the future of USAid inUkraine. “It’s clear that the new administration wants to destroy what was there before and build something completely new.”View image in fullscreenParatroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division helping USAid in Poland with delivery of goods for potential evacuees from Ukraine in February 2022.Photograph: Sgt Robert Whitlow/US Army/APThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said his government would prioritise the most important USAid-funded programmes and try to cover them with alternative funding solutions.“There are programmes like those for prosthetic limbs, or those on special rehabilitation, which obviously can’t just be ended abruptly. There will be a prioritisation,” said Zelenskyy’s adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview on Wednesday.Military aid and direct budgetary assistance to Ukraine have not so far been affected, but USAid had sent more than $7.6bn (£6.11bn) in humanitarian and development aid since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 and backed a remarkable range of projects across many sectors.Charities reeling from USAid freeze warn of ‘life or death’ effectsRead more“This was the worst-case scenario,” said George Chewning, the executive director ofUS-Ukraine Veterans Bridge, an organisation devoted to fostering links between military veterans in the two countries. He said several partner organisations in Ukraine had suddenly found out their projects would no longer be continued. One,Veteran Hub, said it was closing a telephone hotline that had provided support and counselling to traumatised veterans.“A lot of people thought there might be a thorough review and were prepared to justify their work and their projects but there certainly wasn’t an expectation that the funding would be halted,” said Chewning.For veterans’ organisations, the cuts could not have come at a worse time, said Chewning, as Donald Trump’s desireto negotiate an end to the warcould result in hundreds of thousands of newly demobilised veterans needing to re-integrate into society. “All our partners are now scrambling for additional funding, which was not easy to come by in the first place,” he said.USAid also handled a large number of regional humanitarian aid projects, many of which were left pondering how to fill the newly created gaps, and without any idea what would remain after the three-month review period.“It just impacts our morale … Do we wait for their continuation? Do we redirect these projects to other agencies? We don’t really know what to do,” said Vitalii Lukov, the deputy mayor of the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been reliant on international aid sincebeing severely damagedin the early months of the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

However, raising money in this way during wartime was very difficult, he said, with most citizens preferring to use their money to support the military.“Some [media outlets] will survive but many will not. Already a lot of people are losing their jobs,” said Katerina Sergatskova, a co-founder of the2402 foundation, which provides support and training to Ukrainian journalists. “If places have a cash reserve they may be able to survive for the next three months,” she said, until it became clear which USAid projects would be continued.The “stop work” order meant that projects were abruptly ended with almost no warning. Oleh Velhan was one of thousands of Ukrainians to receive an email earlier this week informing him that his service agreement would be suspended, starting from Wednesday and “until further notice”. Velhan worked for a company that provided services to an organisation working in the healthcare sector.The suspension was in order to “assess the effectiveness of programmes and their compliance with United States foreign policy”, said the email. A few minutes after receiving the message, Velhan found he was locked out of his work email account. “I felt frustrated and angry. All the projects I had been working on are gone.

Syria’s military and security agencies were also dissolved, to be replaced by new security institutions and army.In addition, all armed factions in Syria are to be disbanded and absorbed into the new national army. On its face, the order to dissolve armed factions should include HTS, though it did not name the group, which is the de-facto authority in the country.Sharaa said that the country’s priorities were “filling the power vacuum, preserving civil peace, building state institutions”.View image in fullscreenAn image released by the Syrian official news agency shows Sharaa meeting the UN special envoy to Syria, Geir Pederson, in Damascus, 16 December 2024.Photograph: Sana/APThe transitional government is supposed to hand over power to a new government in March, but it is unclear how the transition will be managed. In an interview with Al Arabiya last month, Sharaa said holding elections could take up to four years, and rewriting the country’s constitution could take three.Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to ensure the post-Assad era is inclusive of all facets of Syrian society, but has delayed the event repeatedly. His meetings have been mostly with individuals, rather than political parties.The dissolution of military factions is sensitive. The presence and role of these factions have become a pressing question, as the country’s interim government – led almost exclusively by HTS appointees – tries to consolidate power.HTS, originally an offshoot of the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, became Syria’s most powerful rebel group by the time it launched the military campaign to topple the Assad regime last year. Under its guidance,a patchwork of opposition factionsacross the country participated in the military operation.In mid-January, the Syrian ministry of defence announced that it would be holding consultations with factions to see how they would form a unified military.Challenges abound, as more radical Islamist rebel factions – many of which make up part of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army – are not as disciplined as HTS’s rank and file and differ with the group’s ideology. The sudden fall of the Assad regime also left weapons caches, tanks and artillery free for the taking across Syria, some of which have fallen into the hands of rebels.View image in fullscreenSharaa, whose nom de guerre was Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, speaks at the Umayyad mosque in Damascus, 8 December 2024.Photograph: Omar Albam/APSharaa and the minister of defence have held near-daily meetings with rebel factions and given their leaders key posts in the interim government, such as making them provincial governors.The question of how to restore the Syrian state’s monopoly on violence is believed to be critical to maintaining the internal stability of the country.Foreign powers are watching to see if Syria maintains its current trajectory towards stability, wary of seeing a repeat of a Libya scenario, where the country was divided up by warring factions and experienced mass lawlessness after the toppling of the longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi.The UN wants to influence a pluralist Syria – but will the country listen?Read moreThe interim government has courted regional powers for support in bolstering its fledgling state and army, seeking foreign funds and legitimacy. The new government’s first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia, and later to Turkey, where the foreign minister was accompanied by the defence minister and director of intelligence.While the transitional government tries to consolidate power internally, it also has been negotiating with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led military force which controls a third of the country. The SDF has asked to maintain a degree of military independence within the new Syrian army, which the government has refused.As negotiations continue, the pace of conflict between the SDF and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army has continued to escalate in northern Syria.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

I agree with him that the states should control abortion,” Kennedy said in response to questions from Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma,where abortion is banned.“I serve at the pleasure of the president. I’m going to implement his policies,” he continued.Kennedy also reassured Republicans in private conversations that he had changed his position on the issue. In December, Josh Hawley, a Republican senator of Missouri,said that Kennedy had told himhe would “reinstate President Trump’s pro-life policies at HHS”.Key to Kennedy’s testimony was the pledge to investigate the safety of mifepristone, one drug in a so-called medication abortion. The drug has been the focus of attacks by anti-abortion campaigners since the fall of Roe v Wade, and is now the most common way to end a pregnancy.The drug has beenextensively investigatedfor safety, and it is found to have fewer adverse outcomesthan acetaminophen(paracetamol), a common over-the-counter pain reliever.Key studiesthat supported a recent supreme court case over mifepristone’s approval in the early 2000s have been retracted.“We need to understand the safety of every drug – mifepristone and every other drug,” Kennedy said, adding that Trump had not yet taken a position on the medication, but that he had made it clear to Kennedy that he “wants me to look at the safety issues”.Democrats produced placards of Kennedy’s past pro-choice statements, including one campaign statement reported by the Hill that read: “Mr Kennedy’s position on abortion is that it is always a woman’s right to choose. He does not support legislation banning abortion.”“I have never seen any major politician flip on that issue quite as quickly as you did when Trump asked you to become HHS secretary,” Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, told Kennedy.Sanders asked, rhetorically: “Tell me why you think people should have confidence in your consistency and in your work when you really made a major U-turn on an issue of that importance?”Maggie Hassan, a Democratic senator of New Hampshire, suggested she and Kennedy actually agreed on the issue of abortion access, citing and referencing his many past comments in support of reproductive rights. As she questioned Kennedy, Hassan’s staff displayed posters that highlighted his previous remarks in support of abortion access.One poster quoted Kennedy saying: “I’m pro-choice … I don’t think the government has any business telling people what they can or cannot do with their body.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The question is: do you stand for that value or not? When was it that you decided to sell out the values you’ve had your whole life in order to be given power by President Trump?”Kennedy reiterated: “Senator, I agree with President Trump that every abortion is a tragedy.”Jessica Glenza and Joanie Greve contributed reportingExplore more on these topicsRobert F Kennedy JrAbortionTrump administrationWomenReproductive rightsGenderUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The TV show ended after nine series and 55 episodes, each one a surprise. So are Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton now winding down? Not a bit, if Stage/Fright is any guide. From its murderous prologue on – hands-down the most memorable mobile phone announcement ever made in a theatre – this live show is as twisty and unpredictable as the best of their episodes on the BBC.‘The show happened by accident’: cult comedy Inside No 9 shuts its doorsRead moreSome of those episodes are recalled here, in a two hours-plus performance that retains the TV series’ anthology spirit. You don’t leave feeling like you’ve seen one play but several. There’s the retread of series four yarn Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, which casts Shearsmith and Pemberton as former end-of-the-pier double act Cheese and Crackers, reuniting for a last feeble hurrah in a draughty church hall. There’s the kidnap scene (ostensibly one of Cheese and Crackers’ sketches) in which a celebrity guest is taken hostage and obliged to improvise their way out of trouble.View image in fullscreenJump scares and laughter … Shearsmith.Photograph: Marc BrennerPrior to those, our hosts give us a spine-chilling spiel about the haunted history of the Wyndham’s theatre, where they tell us an actor once lost her life in a misbegotten production of gothic melodrama Terror in the Asylum. Act two pitches us into a rehearsal for that same play, with Shearsmith as the smooth director, Pemberton as a maniacal surgeon, and Miranda Hennessy as a TikTok star turned leading lady spooked by the curse which haunts her role. There is nice work too from Anna Francolini as a hatchet-faced matron with a detachable eyeball. If that feels like a lot to wrap your head around – well, our hosts have more in store that I’m not allowed to tell you. And in any event, keeping you on edge, a little uncertain of what you’re watching and where it’s going, is all part of the project of this tricksy, one-step-ahead show.Arguably, its portfolio nature comes at the expense of cohesion – although we’re never far from the haunting theme, as lights flicker and the living are forever mistaken for the dead. Lily-livers such as me may spend half the show teetering on the edges of their seats, as Shearsmith and Pemberton deliver jump-scares on stage and, because their Terror in the Asylum production is trendily multimedia, on an upstage screen too. But alongside the thrills, there’s laughter, as Shearsmith performs a patter song about chemistry, Pemberton puns (“My migraines!” / “Your yourgraines?”), and Cheese and Crackers take various 1970s celebrity names in vain. (Good luck anyone under 45 getting those jokes.)It’s a slickly produced spooky wheeze, distinguished by Shearsmith and Pemberton’s clearly personal obsession with the double-act dynamic and old-school entertainment, and with theatres and their ghosts. One gets the impression they’d happily haunt the Wyndham’s stage centuries hence – failing which, the echo of tonight’s gasps and giggles should at least linger for quite some time.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndReece ShearsmithInside No 9Steve PembertonComedy (Culture)Horror (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

While the Utah fest boasts an impressive and impassioned slate of documentaries this year – I haven’t seen a dud yet, and I’ve seen many – the narrative offerings have mostly fizzled on impact. Plenty of beautiful shots and atmospheric vibes, aimless plot and unearned yearning.Which made the premiere of Sorry, Baby, comedian Eva Victor’s feature debut as a writer-director, an especially brisk breath of fresh air on Monday night. Sharply written, smartly structured and well-acted, with a star-making turn from Victor herself, the 93-minute black comedy is not only nimble and consistently funny, but one of the best, most honest renderings of life after sexual assault that I’ve seen.Magic Farm review – Chloë Sevigny can’t lift flat comedy of inept Americans abroadRead moreHonest, in that its interest is just that: life after, not the event itself, which has unfortunately been given gravitational weight in so many otherhandlings of the subject post #MeToo. Sorry, Baby reconfigures the settings of the now de rigueurtrauma plot, which tends to give the Bad Thing annihilating force, wringing suspense and purpose out of the question of what happened to her, or the reveal of very bad men. Trauma astotalizing identity, downward spiral, expected element.Something bad did happen to Agnes (Victor), an English professor at a Bowdoin-esque college in rural New England (filming took place in Ipswich, Massachusetts). Her best friend Lydie (Naomi Ackie) alludes to it in the film’s first of four chapters, titled The Year With the Baby, with the trailed off vagueness of the lived and understood. Agnes’s life has inched forward while Lydie’s has galloped – Agnes lives in the same house as grad school, teaches in the same program, now has His office; Lydie is married and building a family in the city. But it’s one concerned note of many in their reunion, which the two actors perform with irresistible intimacy across believable beats: catching up, physical closeness, the big questions and validations, the interruption of a neighbor (Lucas Hedges) that Agnes may or may not be fucking. Hints of depression, but the predominant tone is joy – the thrill of being with the one person for whom you can drop all facades (and also, a welcome rebuttal to the idea that friendship necessarily wanes post-partnership).That sensibility – lightness shaded by the past, consistent jolts of deadpan humor – helpfully frames the film’s return to the event itself, a few years earlier (I am personally pleased that Sorry, Baby has a solid grasp on its timeline). Back then, Agnes and Lydie were roommates in the same grad program, Lydie the charming slacker to Agnes’s top student, who receives special, talent-affirming attention from their adviser Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi). Teacher and student text and flirt and express mutual admiration; Lydie jokes they should just have sex, Agnes demurs. Victor finds an inventive method to avoid depicting the bad thing while still conveying the time elapsed and the wordless shock after.But it’s thankfully not a mystery, to leak out over time; Agnes tells Lydie in believable specificity what happened – a fully convincing performance of mutating shock from Victor, and of empathy from Ackie – and Lydie confirms, yeah, that is the thing. These are not naive women. They summarily embark on all the necessary decisions – go to the hospital? Go to the police? Report to the department? Agnes proceeds as many do, with a destabilizing mix of denial, doubt and furious certainty, which Victor renders with aching specificity and bristling humor reminiscent of Fleabag (it helps that Victor, a willowy brunette, also resembles Phoebe Waller-Bridge).Victor has a deft and refreshing handle on the absurd situations, unnerving ironies and forced inevitability of moving forward, how sexual assault can shred one’s self-confidence but not destroy you. Agnes is still smart and funny and endearing, able to build a teaching career and new, tentative relationships; she is also haunted by a bad experience inseparable from her career. Sometimes you think about and feel the lure of the abyss; other times, as she says in one especially poignant scene with an acquaintance played by John Carroll Lynch, you don’t think about it at all. Life goes on.Certain elements of Sorry, Baby are dialed up a little too high – an uncaring experience at the doctor’s office exaggeratedly callous in a way we’ve seen before, a jealous and socially awkward work rival (Kelly McCormack) a shade too intense for the film’s rare, delicate naturalism. But without sensationalism or over-statement characteristic of the nascent genre, Victor brilliantly illustrates the experience of aftermath in its mundanity, its small joys, its pain, its strange companionships. In particular, the great tragedy of what he did: to have such disrespect braided into praise of her intelligence, her worth, erodes her faith in it. It may be impossible to fully recover. But she has her best friend, her wit, her stubborn persistence, time. Her life, rendered with such layered complexity that Sorry, Baby should become a breakout of this festival.Sorry, Baby is screening at theSundance film festivaland is seeking distributionExplore more on these topicsSundance 2025Sundance film festivalFestivalsComedy filmsDrama filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

But does he regret blowing it with Dave Grohl? The great producer relives his smashes, parties and 11am vodkasWed 29 Jan 2025 11.07 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 14.43 ESTShareGiven that he is the producer behind some of the most cherished and idiosyncratic British pop of the 1980s, fromElvis Costelloto Dexys Midnight Runners and the Teardrop Explodes, Clive Langer sounds surprisingly bad at predicting what will do well. “I was invited to possibly work with Madonna, around the time of Holiday,” he remembers. “I went to see her at the Music Machine and I just didn’t get it. I still don’t get it.” So he turned her down. And when Dexys laid down Come on Eileen with Langer behind the mixing desk, he didn’t think it would be a hit. “I was completely wrong. I never had the faith.”It duly reached No 1 and became the biggest-selling single of 1982, just one of the many triumphs Langer had with production partner Alan Winstanley. Together they shaped a generation of British pop with David Bowie,Mick Jaggerand Lloyd Cole, plus eight full albums with Madness across five decades.Once the acid kicked in, Julian Cope spent four hours disagreeing about a guitar chordHe also dabbled with his own bands, and is now a frontman at the age of 70 in the Clang Group, whose second album of sharp guitar pop, New Clang, is out next month. It reflects a “compulsion to write songs, express myself and turn it up a bit louder,” Langer says over a cup of tea at his home in Hackney, London.He knows he’s lucky to have done any of it. His Polish father, who was Jewish, fled the Nazis – “They told him, ‘Go right …’ He took a left and never saw his parents or his brother again,” – later making it to the UK and joining the RAF, where he met Langer’s mother. Langer’s childhood in London put him at the centre of “an incredible time for music. I dropped acid aged 13 and saw Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin in a pub called Klooks Kleek. We didn’t have tickets to Janis Joplin at the Albert Hall, but we figured that if six of us tried to run in, four of us would make it – and we did.”View image in fullscreenEight steps beyond … Madness in 1979; Langer made eight albums with the band.Photograph: Virginia Turbett/RedfernsLanger left for art school in Canterbury, where Ian Dury was a teacher. He formed his first band, Deaf School, at Liverpool School of Art in 1974, inspired by Dury’s pre-Blockheads band Kilburn and the High Roads. “We were very theatrical characters. A bit Sparks, a bit Roxy.” After punk arrived, “we lost all momentum”, but they had amassed a range of famous admirers: the likes of Julian Cope, Suggs, Pete Burns and Steve Strange. “Kevin Rowland came into our dressing room in Birmingham before starting Dexys Midnight Runners. Then Big In Japan started from our road crew and included Bill Drummond who formed the KLF,Holly Johnsonwho started Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Ian Broudie who became Lightning Seeds. I joined [as guitarist] and some of the others went on to be in the Teardrop Explodes or Siouxsie and the Banshees.”In Deaf School, Langer had paid close attention to the band’s producers, and remembered their techniques when teenage Deaf School fans North London Invaders asked him to record them just as they changed their name toMadness. “I was very nervous when I went in to their rehearsal room clutching a four-pack of beer,” he admits, “but as soon as I heard My Girl I knew this was very special. From then on every record was a hit. They were ambitious and sort of naughty. The studio petty cash might suddenly disappear and if there was any booze about it would soon be gone.”For the nutty boys’ 1979 debut album, One Step Beyond, Langer teamed up with more experienced engineer Winstanley, soon establishing a way of working where Winstanley handled the technical side while Langer would “rehearse with the bands, sort out the songwriting and arrangements and have an overview. You know, ‘Do we need a trumpet?’”The wonderfully berserk trumpet solo on the Teardrop Explodes’ 1981 smash Reward was recorded when “there was a lot of acid in the band. So once it kicked in Julian [Cope] spent four hours disagreeing about a guitar chord.” The recording of Dexys’ second album Too-Rye-Ay was just as colourful, with the band “wearing all the clothes and doing the moves like it was a gig. I felt as if I was being pinned to the wall of the rehearsal room. It was that powerful.”View image in fullscreenDiving for pearls … from left, Clive Langer, Alan Winstanley and Elvis Costello in 1984.Photograph: Estate Of Keith Morris/RedfernsLanger wrote the music himself for another classic, Shipbuilding, a Falklands-era hit forRobert Wyattlater recorded by Elvis Costello, who wrote the lyrics. “I’d tried to write something beautiful for Robert, but myself and various friends all tried to come up with lyrics for it and they were rubbish,” he says. “I bumped into Elvis at a party and a few days later he had the words.”Langer and Winstanley worked quickly. “Once, we were in the same studio asTrevor Hornand we’d done Elvis’s whole Goodbye Cruel World album in the three weeks Trevor spent on the snare sound for [Frankie Goes To Hollywood’s] Two Tribes.” Simplicity aside, he doesn’t feel they had any particular Midas touch. “Our job was to give record companies hit records and we were just rolling with it. Sometimes you’d be a bit pissed and get talked into it.”Morrissey was another client, and “working with him was brilliant, because he didn’t write his own music, so I could either co-write the songs [includingNovember Spawned a Monster] or shape them. But he would invite guests to the studio then disappear to his room. I’d have to look after them, thinking, ‘Who are these people?’”I got myself into a right pickle – needing vodka in my coffee at 11am just to feel normalLanger’s career zenith was producing Bowie and Jagger’s No 1 single Dancing in the Street and the former’s No 2 classicAbsolute Beginnerson the same day in 1985. “They were good friends, but Bowie ran the show and was always looking after Mick. ‘Everything all right, Mick?’ For Absolute Beginners, Bowie did the vocal in one take. He said, ‘There’s one line I can do better.’ We re-did that and the record was finished. He sounded utterly majestic. We hung out. Skiing. New Year’s Eve. With other people, he was always performing, but sometimes I’d get him for an hour or so and we’d just drink and talk. He was so intelligent, funny, knew what he was doing. After that I thought, ‘Where do I go next?’”In the 90s, Langer and Winstanley mortgaged themselves to the skies turning Hook End Manor, purchased from David Gilmour, into the best equipped studio in Europe. Then, Bush’s 1994 album Sixteen Stone shipped 6m copies in the US. “It was Nirvana lite, but 14-year-old girls absolutely loved them. It paid off all my mortgages.”After later working with Blur, Catatonia and a-ha, and “spending more time together than with our families”, the duo’s last full album production together was Madness’s 2009 The Liberty of Norton Folgate. Langer also joined a reformed Deaf School but drifted further into alcohol, which he candidly confronts in songs on New Clang.“I’d always liked a drink at 6pm to listen and reappraise everything with alcohol in me,” he says. “Bottle of wine by the mixing desk – not too close in case you knock it over and fuck everything up. The problem is it’s progressive, then it kills you. After I stopped working I got myself into a right pickle needing a vodka in my coffee at 11am just to feel normal. So I went to see someone for help.”Now three years sober, Langer is throwing his new energy into the Clang Group. “I don’t sit around thinking about what ifs but there’s a tiny regret that I didn’t do Foo Fighters’ second album,” he admits. “I was flown to the Capitol building in Los Angeles to meet Dave Grohl, but then I suggested that he should play drums on the record instead of the drummer they had then,” he reveals. “I walked out knowing that I’d blown it, but I don’t regret what I said.” This time, however, his instincts were correct: when The Colour and the Shape went double platinum he noticed that the drummer on all but two tracks was Grohl.New Clang is released on 21 February.

Now brutalism, the once-maligned postwar architectural style of chiselled concrete forms, has finally reached Hollywood, in the form of an epic three-and-a-half-hour film that looks set tosweep the Oscars. You would think that architecture fans would be thrilled to have their subject in the limelight for a change. But they are raging.There is nothing more irritating to enthusiasts than when the mainstream tries to portray their niche world and gets it wrong. And The Brutalist gets an awful lot wrong. Just as Gladiator II recentlyvexed classicistswith its inaccurate portrayal of the emperors and its anachronistic scenes of people reading the newspaper and drinking at cafes (neither of which, apparently, existed at the time), so too has director Brady Corbet riled the architecture world by playing fast and loose with his interpretation of brutalism, the Bauhaus, postwar immigration and the basic process of architecture itself.View image in fullscreenInverted ziggurat … Breuer’s Whitney Museum in New York in 1955.Photograph: Authenticated News/Getty ImagesWhile the film world has showered the movie withfive-star reviews– praising its heroic ambition, and drooling at the “authenticity” of shooting with hulking 1950s VistaVision cameras – architecture critics have been up in arms. “The Brutalist gets architecture wrong,” declared the Washington Post. It “perpetuates a colossal cliche,” fumed the Financial Times. Three prominent American architecture critics even got together to record a dedicated podcast, titledWhy the Brutalist Is a Terrible Movie. For almost an hour, they railed against everything from the stereotypical depiction of the architect as a lone male genius to the Bauhaus-inspired graphic design of the credits, as well as (spoiler alert!) the idea that anyone would design a community centre and chapel based on the form of a Nazi concentration camp. At the screening I attended, one leading figure from the 20th-century heritage movement could barely contain their fury during the (very welcome) half-time intermission: “It’s just utter tosh!”The film has aroused this much ire because, for all its claims to be fictional, it is so clearly based on a real historical figure:Marcel Lajos Breuer. Like Corbet’s fictional László Tóth (played by a tortured, quivering Adrien Brody), Breuer was a Hungarian-Jewish architect who trained at the Bauhaus in Germany before emigrating to the US, where he became a prominent proponent of brutalism. He and his contemporaries, including Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, all emigrated in 1937 – crucially, before the second world war, not after, as Corbet has it – and built very successful careers, receiving deanships at major universities, and shaped the following century of modern architecture. None had to queue for free bread. Corbet consulted the architectural historian Jean-Louis Cohen, the leading authority on the period, to try to find the tragic figure that he had in mind, but none came to Cohen’s mind because none existed.Breuer is best known for designing the formerWhitney Museumin New York, which lurches above the street like an inverted ziggurat, and the striking trefoil-shapedUnesco headquartersin Paris. But he first made his name designing curved tubular steel furniture, of a kind practically identical to Tóth’s in the film’s early scenes. “It looks like a tricycle,” the furniture store owner’s wife remarks of the novel bent-steel design in the movie – just asBreuer’s chairswere compared to, and inspired by, bicycle frames at the time.View image in fullscreenBig and brutal … Marcel Breuer’s Abbey Church of the St John’s Benedictine monastery.Photograph: Robert W Kelley/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThe similarities don’t stop there. Indeed, one of Breuer’s lesser-known building projects turns out to be the chief inspiration for the film. In the early 1950s, Breuer was commissioned to design abig brutalist churchon a hill, just like Tóth – only it was in Minnesota, rather than Pennsylvania, and the clients were Benedictine monks, rather than a millionaire psychopath industrialist. The epic project went through similar agonies to those portrayed in the movie, a fraught process that was meticulously documented in a fascinating book,Marcel Breuer and a Committee of Twelve Plan a Church: A Monastic Memoir, written by Fr Hilary Thimmesh, who served as a junior member of the building committee.“Our first concern was the novel architecture,” he writes of Breuer’s uncompromising proposal for an angular concrete box, flanked by an abstract bell tower – complete with a cross-shaped void, just like one in the roof of Tóth’s fictional building. “We needed assurance that it was all right to build this odd structure and call it a Catholic church.”From the very outset of the project, there was suspicion of Breuer who, just like Tóth, had never designed a church, as a Hungarian Jew. “He wasn’t Catholic,” Thimmesh recounts. “His manner was certainly not midwestern.” As in the film’s depiction of a community consultation event, where Tóth shows off a big model of his bulky design to local residents, “biases were noted in the community”, writes Thimmesh, “some against Breuer as a non-Catholic”. Just as the God-fearing people of Pennsylvania in the movie are “worried [the building] is going to ruin the hillside”, and complain that “concrete isn’t very attractive”, so too did the monks of St John fret about the “less than wholehearted support for the plan in the community” and that their Catholic brethren were generally “down on modern architecture”.Corbet has cited Thimmesh’s book as a key precedent, admitting that “narratively, that was one of the biggest inspirations” – before going on to describe the memoir dismissively as “a pretty dry account of the struggles Breuer went through”. The reality clearly wasn’t spicy enough for his melodramatic intentions. Breuer wasn’t a heroin addict, and the monks didn’t rape him in a quarry. Nor did the real life architect really lose his temper much, beyond the occasional politely worded letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He regularly erupts with prima-donna fits of screaming when he doesn’t get his way (giving us ample opportunities to learn the Hungarian for “fuck!”), throwing papers around and storming off in blind rage. As his longsuffering wife Erzsébet puts it at one point: “László worships only at the altar of himself.”By contrast, Breuer was evidently well-versed in navigating the necessary compromises of a building project, as all architects must, while remaining firm in his convictions. At the most heated point during the design of the Minnesota church, when the abbot asked Breuer to sketch out an alternative design, Thimmesh recalls the architect’s measured reaction.“Breuer responded with something close to emotion,” he writes. “To produce another design, he said, would take time and the same intensity he put into this one. The end result would probably be worse confusion. In choosing a building one does not have the luxury of selecting one of several existing things, he said.” The nuances played out in the decade-long development of this landmark building would have made for a much more interesting story than the film’s hackneyed portrayal of the tempestuous architect-client relationship; but such nuance would be lost on Corbet’s two-dimensional characterisation. Instead, he has his architect spouting meaningless platitudes, such as: “Is there a better description of a cube than that of its construction?” To which his wealthy industrialist client unconvincingly replies: “I find our conversations intellectually stimulating.”View image in fullscreenTrefoil triumph … Unesco headquarters, Paris.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesPerhaps the most glaring anachronism is in the film’s bizarre epilogue, set years later at the 1980 Venice Architecture Biennale. Titled Presence of the Past, it was the moment that postmodernism took ascendancy, seeing a colourful parade of architects indulging in cartoonish historical references, embracing wit, humour and knowing pastiche. It was a stage for the new generation’s gleeful dance on the grave of their modernist and brutalist forebears, ushering ina period of buildingslike the pink confection of No 1 Poultry in the City of London, and the green-glass Maya temple of the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall.Not in Corbet’s world. Instead, he portrays the landmark exhibition as a moment when his fictional, now wheelchair-using Tóth enjoys a heroic retrospective. His stripped-back concrete buildings are evaluated afresh, as “machines with no superfluous parts” – a reappraisal of brutalism that didn’t happen, in reality, until at leasttwo or three decades later.The architecture world awaits with bated breath the director’s five-hour marathons, The Postmodernist, The Deconstructivist, and The Parametricist – each to be shot with period-appropriate equipment and based on a brief skim through a coffee-table book.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistArchitectureModernismBauhausfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Posh Girls may have swapped the analysts’ couch for a sofa in the waiting room, but actor-writer pair Harriet Chomley and Sophie Robertson don’t quite manage to wriggle out of the limitations of their show’s rather forced setup.Posh Girls pitches itself as a satire of upper-class girlhood, full of careless flouncing, rounded vowels and ridiculous nicknames. When Alex (Chomley) and Hermione (Robertson) run into each other at their very expensive therapist’s, Alex’s offhand comment that her daddy owns the building gives a sense of scale to their wealth. But this is no eat-the-rich ridicule. Instead, this story of a fractured friendship peels away the fronts these 30-year-olds have put on for each other, revealing the traumatic challenges they have faced and the hole each one’s absence has left in the other’s life.View image in fullscreenRobertson in Posh Girls.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianBest friends at boarding school, they haven’t spoken in more than a decade. Hermione is guarded, recoiling at Alex’s probing questions about what she is doing in therapy. But the dark story that unravels, which illuminates the atrocities of boys and the cruelty of girls, makes Alex’s cluelessness hard to believe. At times it is as if these characters don’t know their own history until they reach it in the script.Despite a few instances of furious overacting, the pair are good fun to watch together. Chomley’s deadpans are particularly entertaining. They quickly fall into leaping through their shared history, with Steve Waddington’s direction shunting them between the waiting room and their private school days, the pace slowed with regular blackouts. These jumps in time fill out the backstories, but the performances don’t shift much between the two. By flitting back and forth in answer to any questions raised, the script leaves very little unsaid.A kind heart is lodged at this play’s centre. It wants to remind you to check in on your friends, to look out for and believe them. Because the world can be harsh, even to posh girls.At theKing’s Head theatre, London, until 2 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatrereviewsShareReuse this content"

Lamar has 17 wins from 57 nominations, and while his Drake-destroying Not Like Us might seem too combative for the Academy, its huge US cultural impact and jawdropping brio means that it is very much the record of the year to many – and Drake is no friend of the Grammys, having often snubbed or criticised them. Fortnight is one of the more muted singles by Swift (14 wins from 58 noms) and might not cut through, though the industry may want to reward her for the record-breaking Eras tour – but the strength of the pure pop here, split between her,Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, Charli xcx and Billie Eilish (the latter another Grammy fave with nine wins from 32 noms) will mean that perhaps none will triumph. Additonally, the Beatles have the slight advantage of being the most universally loved band in history. But Beyoncé has more Grammys than all of them and indeed anyone, and the hoe-down of Texas Hold’Em was such a bold flourish and big hit that it will have Grammy voters – who value craft and chops – admiring Beyoncé’s capacity for making country music her own.Will winBeyoncéShould winKendrick LamarCharli xcx: 360 – videoAlbum of the yearAndré 3000 – New Blue SunBeyoncé – Cowboy CarterSabrina Carpenter – Short N’ SweetCharli xcx – BratJacob Collier – Djesse Vol 4Billie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and SoftChappell Roan– The Rise and Fall of a Midwestern PrincessTaylor Swift – The Tortured Poets DepartmentFor the same reason, I thinkBeyoncéwill triumph in the AOTY category. Particularly since she has never won it, having lost to Swift, Beck, Adele and Harry Styles in previous years – a snub now seen as the great injustice of the Academy, and, to some, evidence of racial bias: “AOTY, I ain’t win / I ain’t stuntin’ ’bout them / Take that shit on the chin / Come back and fuck up the pen,” as Beyoncé sings on album track Sweet Honey Buckin’. Cowboy Carter isn’t the most well-loved of her albums, and yet the boldness of its chaps-clad vision will impress the Academy. Brat is of course only the album title here to pass into the cultural lexicon – and to my mind, its emotional extremity makes it the best here – but electro-pop like this has never done well in this category. More likely to cause an upset is Roan, whose debut was equally sensational but whose blend of power balladry and theatrical pop has a more conventionally Academy-pleasing bent.Will winBeyoncéShould winCharli xcxSong of the yearShaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)Billie Eilish– Birds of a FeatherBruno Marsand Lady Gaga – Die With a SmileTaylor Swift – Fortnight (ft Post Malone)Chappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!Kendrick Lamar – Not Like UsSabrina Carpenter – Please Please PleaseBeyoncé – Texas Hold’EmEnter two big beasts inBruno Marsand Lady Gaga, whose Die With a Smile reached 1bn streams on Spotify faster than any other song in history – and 15-time winner Mars is adored by the Academy, with 24k Magic beating Kendrick Lamar’s masterpiece Damn to AOTY in 2018. But this is a songwriting award, and Die With a Smile’s lyrics are really hackneyed (“our love’s the only war worth fighting for”), particularly when compared with Roan’s tale of suppressed lesbian desire and Carpenter’s hilarious Please Please Please, in which she manages a wildcard lover with more diplomacy than a UN special envoy. Shaboozey’s A Bar Song (Tipsy) might split the vote with Beyoncé’s similarly minded song; Eilish won last year with Barbie ballad What Was I Made For? and Birds of a Feather was an even bigger hit; you can never discount Swift, either. But if we’re looking at lyrics, who wrote and delivered them better than Lamar? Not Like Us – the only song here with a single songwriter – is the diss track by which all others will now be judged.Will winKendrick LamarShould winKendrick LamarBest new artistBenson BooneSabrina CarpenterDoechiiKhruangbinRayeChappell RoanShaboozeyTeddy SwimsHigher stakes here than in recent years: these are all proper mega-streaming pop stars, except Khruangbin (who are still an arena-playing band, though their inclusion here a decade into their career feels a bit random). It’s really which of them feels the most mega of all: Shaboozey had the biggest hit, yet Sabrina Carpenter had more of them. Chappell Roan’s drag-ball fantasias made her a mould-breaking new star, and yet there’s a traditional quality to her songwriting that gives her cross-generational appeal. I think there’s a small chance of an upset from Doechii, the kind of MC the Academy loves – puckish, vital, anti-mumbling – whose widely loved Tiny Desk concert and late night TV appearances were perfectly timed for the December voting period.Will winChappell RoanShould winChappell RoanSabrina Carpenter: Espresso – videoBest pop solo performanceBeyoncé – BodyguardSabrina Carpenter – EspressoCharli xcx – AppleBillie Eilish – Birds of a FeatherChappell Roan – Good Luck, Babe!Given Brat’s success and Apple’s virality, you might expect Charli xcx to walk this in her catwalk-swaggering,spit-slurpingmanner, but this is formidable company. Here’s another category that Beyoncé has never won, though Bodyguard doesn’t have the same pop cultural clout as the rest of these songs, while Eilish’s song is pleasant but not her most distinctive performance. So here’s hoping one of pop’s class of 2024 can net it: Roan’s warbling on Good Luck, Babe! makes it the most showboating vocal, but my own favourite performance is Carpenter on Espresso, purring with disdain and self-aware sensuality, as her languor paradoxically enhances the song’s groove.Will winChappell RoanShould winSabrina CarpenterBest rock performanceThe Beatles – Now and ThenThe Black Keys – Beautiful People (Stay High)Green Day – The American DreamIs Killing MeIdles – Gift HorsePearl Jam – Dark MatterSt Vincent – Broken ManThe Beatles gathering around the piano, conjured by AI, was incredibly poignant – and wish-fulfilment for many members of the Academy. Their maximalist yet gentle song is also one of the best in this crop, filled out with bands in their comfort zone (Green Day, Idles) and some utterly anonymous ballast from theBlack Keys. St Vincent would be a worthy curveball winner, whose Broken Man goes from Nine Inch Nails-ish prowl to fuzz-blues stomp, but the best – and the most purely rocking – is Pearl Jam’s Dark Matter, a funky broadside against demagogues with a hint of I Love Rock’n’Roll to its opening riff.Will winThe BeatlesShould winPearl JamKendrick Lamar: Not Like Us – videoBest rap performanceCardi B – Enough (Miami)Commonand Pete Rock – When the Sun Shines Again (ft Posdnuos)Doechii –Nissan AltimaEminem – HoudiniFutureand Metro Boomin – Like That (ft Kendrick Lamar)GloRilla – Yeah Glo!Kendrick Lamar – Not Like UsLamar surely has this sewn up, and yet his presence on Like That – the track that kicked off the entire Drake imbroglio – increases the chances of a split vote. Zipping up the inside lane could be Doechii, whose Nissan Altima is two minutes of relentless laser-brained mic skill. Compare it with Eminem’s Houdini: also technically brilliant, but lumbering and unfunny. There’s a sop to the old heads with Common and Pete Rock, though their track is boringly cheery – much better are GloRilla and Cardi B, each efficiently dismantling their respective antagonists (the latter’s characterisation of a certain piece of a rival’s anatomy as “regular-degular” will have you spitting out your drink).Will winKendrick LamarShould winKendrick LamarBest country solo performanceBeyoncé – 16 CarriagesJelly Roll – I Am Not OkayKacey Musgraves – The ArchitectShaboozey – A Bar Song (Tipsy)Chris Stapleton – It Takes a WomanIn a pretty strait-laced category that has been won by eitherChris Stapletonor Willie Nelson in six of the last nine years, the traditionalists will be forced to branch out a little this year. Yes, Stapleton is in the mix, but with a song from the same album as last year’s winner White Horse – and more of a soul ballad at that. Musgraves’ song has a handsome, classic feel and will appeal to any pop-averse voters put off by the rest, including Jelly Roll’s glossy pop-rock power ballad. Beyoncé winning a country category would be historic and there will be those egging her on – but Shaboozey will probably triumph here. Not just for the sheer pop cultural dominance of A Bar Song (Tipsy), but because its third-beer buoyancy makes it a wonderful song.Will winShaboozeyShould winShaboozeyExplore more on these topicsGrammysAwards and prizesPop and rockRapHip-hopCountryThe BeatlesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

These “dawn simulation” devices glow with gradually intensifying brightness as your wake-up time approaches, kickstarting your circadian rhythm before you get out of bed. For many users, this results in a happier, healthier start to the day.Not all sunrise alarm clocks are made equal – for instance, only some are bright enough to be medically certified as light-therapy devices forSad(seasonal affective disorder) and other disorders. We’ve indicated the alarm that has this certification in its spec below.I snuggled down with seven of the best-rated wake-up lights from Lumie, Beurer, Philips, Dreamegg, Momcozy and Hatch to find out which would make the most difference to my mornings.

I’ve often felt lousy first thing, after waking up to a minutes-long medley of smartphone alarms.When, at last, I drag myself out of bed, I frequently spend the day reviewing all kinds of gadgets, from Sad lamps to electric heaters. It’s a freelance job I’ve been privileged to do since 2017 – and as we tumbled dimly into 2025, the Filter gave me one of my most quietly life-improving assignments yet: reviewing sunrise alarm clocks.The extent to which these gadgets have improved my mornings has surprised me – although it was greater in some cases than others. Frankly, I’d like other groggy wakers to feel the same benefit, and my reviews are written and ranked with this in mind.

I considered the brightness of each alarm, how close the glow felt to real sunlight, and the audio quality. Above all, I reflected on how lively and refreshed I felt after waking up with each one.Many sunrise alarm clocks also have a sundown function, so I used this where available too. I also tried using each sunrise alarm clock as a reading light, to help me finish the day – as well as start it – smartphone-free.Some sunrise alarm clocks go even further, with additional features such as app operability, multiple alarm profiles and mood lighting. To ensure a thorough review of each sunrise alarm clock, I played around with every possible customisation option and functionality.The best sunrise alarm clocks in 2025View image in fullscreen‘An excellent sunrise alarm clock at a standout price’: the Lumie Sunrise Alarm.Photograph: Pete WiseBest overall sunrise alarm clock:Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100View image in fullscreenI woke up feeling great when I used the medical-grade Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which bathes the room in gradually intensifying, sun-like light for a set period before the alarm goes off.Why we love itThe device is supposed to realistically imitate the lightening shades of a sunrise – and it does so more convincingly than any other sunrise alarm clock I’ve tested. Depending on your chosen light intensity setting, it can get very bright.The Spark 100 also has a sunset feature that graduates through the same red, orange and white light colours used with the sunrise function, but in reverse order. After the sunset cycle, the light can either switch off entirely or remain in a gentle night-light mode, whichever you choose.Besides performing brilliantly as a wake-up light and sunset simulator, the Spark 100 is simply a nicely designed, well-made thing. I appreciated its soft-edged yet robust construction and handy features such as the cable organisation in the base. It’s a pleasure to have on the bedside table.Lumie is the brand that pioneered consumer-grade sunrise alarm clocks in the early 1990s and that pedigree shines through.It’s a shame that …the alarm tone sounds piercing at the higher three of its five volume levels. I found myself settling for a 2/5 – more than loud enough to rouse this particular heavy sleeper.Certification:UK MDR 2002 and EU MDR 2017/745 medical classificationModes:sunrise, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D12cmFeatures:tap to snooze, auto-dimming display, adjustable sunrise/sunset duration, adjustable digital display brightnessBrightness settings:five£76.23 at John Lewis£99 at BootsBest sunrise alarm for late-night reading:Philips SmartSleepView image in fullscreenThis lamp soon felt like part of the furniture on my bedside table. In typical Philips fashion, it’s a good-quality, dependable product, with a middle-of-the-road design that won’t look out of place in many bedrooms.Why we love itSetup is incredibly slick – I was able to set my alarm time, sound and brightness by following the simple prompts on the device’s display, without having to consult the manual. Subsequently tweaking your alarm(s) takes a bit of practice, but you’ll master all the controls you need after a few days.The SmartSleep’s wake-up capabilities are impressive, combining brilliant light with a diverse choice of alarm sounds. It also has FM radio and 3.5mm auxiliary audio input options for the user who has tired of Alpine and gong bath soundscapes. There’s a 5V USB charging outlet at the rear of the lamp, too, which could free up a valuable bedside power socket.I loved using this model as a reading light, as well as a sunrise alarm. Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful, which helped me get to sleep after reading pulpy detective novels late at night. The light can be deactivated with a press.It’s a shame that …it costs such a lot.

I’m not pulling your leg, you might say, it’s all thanks to the Lumie Sunrise Alarm’s “kittens purring” alarm tone, which sits sweetly alongside four other natural sounds, including goats bleating and birdsong.Why we love itIn all seriousness, this is an excellent sunrise alarm clock, and it comes at a standout price. Its sunrise light subtly brightens during the minutes leading up to your chosen alarm time, producing a lovely awakening that really did remind me of natural light.I found it easy enough to set the Sunrise Alarm’s time and alarm, although pressing some of the buttons can be fiddly. Do keep the instruction manual handy, as there are lots of options and buttons to get your head around.It’s a shame that …it lacks a little bedside table appeal.

That’s a rare feature in any sunrise alarm clock – let alone in such a reasonably priced model.Why we love itThe sunrise mode itself is gentle yet effective, and it’s easy to activate the device as a reading light with a simple, groggy tap. I really liked the alarm sounds you get with the WL50 too – which is just as well, as there are only two options.Perhaps that narrow choice of alarm tones sounds a little stingy, but it seems less so when you explore the WL50’s alternative audio options. It doubles up as an FM radio, with space to save up to 30 station presets, which you can listen to throughout the day or use as a livelier alternative to an alarm tone. Bluetooth connectivity and an AUX input expand your listening options further.Curiously, this sunrise alarm clock can be unplugged (when fully charged) and used on the go for up to three hours.

It’s also tough to topple, soft around the edges and weighs just 0.55kg.Why we love itI’m neither a parent nor a baby, but I can certainly hear the soothing quality in the Sunrise Echo’s 30-strong repertoire of wake-up sounds, which includes lullabies alongside the usual nature sounds and meditative drones. The sound quality is impressive, with plenty of mid-range frequencies and a touch of bass. It’s nicely balanced, and not at all jarring.The Sunrise Echo creates a lilting light effect, rather than intensively light-therapising the sleeper as some higher-powered models do. It was easy to set up and customise the alarm using the well-labelled control buttons around the shoulder of the alarm clock. It was a little harder though, through a fug of sleepiness, to adjust the screen and light brightness via their respective dials on the rear of the device. Nonetheless, the Momcozy Sunrise Echo is an excellent, accessible option for users who don’t want a very bright wake-up.It’s a shame that …a few nice-to-have features are absent, including FM radio and multiple alarms.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D8.5cmFeatures:night light (seven colours), sleep aid sounds, digital clock display, adjustable sunrise durationBrightness settings:30£54.99 at Boots£54.99 at AmazonThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A beautifully designed alarm clock’: the Dreamegg Sunrise 1.Photograph: Pete WiseDreamegg Sunrise 1View image in fullscreenBest for:soothing sleep soundsThis compact, great-looking device offers something different, with a selection of 29 ambient sounds that can be used as white noise to help you fall asleep.

Sunrise alarm clocks tend to be far less bright than the average Sad lamp. With that said, the effect of light on our circadian rhythms has been shown to peak around the onset of dawn and early in the morning – so a mellow sunrise alarm may provide disproportionate benefits.If you’ve been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and are looking for a light therapy device, it’s best to ask your GP which product to use and how to get the most benefit. Sunrise alarm clocks that are classified as medical devices (indicated below each product above) are more likely to suit users seeking a therapeutic effect than models with no medical certifications.Why does it benefit us to wake with the sun?Getting up in the dark can feel awful, which makes a lot of sense because our bodies require light to wake up properly.Humans are diurnal, which means we’ve evolved to be more wakeful, energetic and capable of chasing mammoths over vast distances during daytime. When the brain recognises increasing light at dawn, it sends signals around other regions of the brain and to other organs to calibrate bodily processes including temperature regulation, hormone secretion and metabolism. And when darkness falls, the brain prepares us for sleep – a helpful effect that many of us compromise by looking at bright smartphone or laptop screens.These effects, which repeat every 24 hours, are our circadian rhythms. That is derived from the Latin wordscirca(approximately) anddiem(day), meaning around a day.So, the sun is the original and best alarm clock – activating our minds and bodies with light, rather than startling us awake with sound. Think of your sunrise alarm as a plucky stand-in to rely upon during the star’s shorter winter shifts.In the market for some new bed linen?

Seating was banked claustrophobically tight and dizzyingly high.A flame-haired model – in a harlequinned and crinolined, chiffon-sleeved ballgown that took the atelier 1,300 hours to create – took a silent glide across the stage, like the queen in a giant chess game. A guipure lace gown with a hood that was half-balaclava, half-carnival mask was followed by a scalloped and feathered silver gown under an ivory pleat cape secured with a flourish of duck egg chiffon.Behind the clothes, a stream-of-consciousness download of Michele’s thought process ticker-taped along a screen: Emily Dickinson, Umberto Eco, synth pop, Marie Antoinette, Gustav Klimt, botanical art, Beverly Hills.“I am passionate about lists,” Michele said after the show. “About trying to find order. My work is to imagine. My job is like trying to catch the ocean in a glass. So I am always trying to find order.”Unusually, about half of the models were in their 50s, 60s and above. “Time provides grace, and it multiplies beauty,” Michele said.Haute couture, in which dresses are worked on for months, is proof of this, he added. “The seamstresses are like fairies and elves. I’m not good at sewing, although I’m quite good with pins. But I have a passion that can make fashion into something meaningful. I can tell a story.”View image in fullscreenAlessandro Michele says the seamstresses who bring his haute couture creations to life ‘are like fairies and elves’.Photograph: WWD/GettyEven Giorgio Armani made an extra effort to dress up for the Paris haute couture shows, with the 90-year-old designer swapping his trademark navy T-shirt for a double-breasted black velvet tuxedo. He then took a smiling catwalk turn at a show that celebrated 20 years of his couture salon, Armani Privé, and pointed to yet another successful red carpet season for the man who invented modern Hollywood dressing.View image in fullscreenDemi Moore at the Giorgio Armani Privé haute couture show.Photograph: Neil Mockford/GC ImagesDemi Moore, an Oscar frontrunner in the best actress category for her role in The Substance, was guest of honour in the front row, wearing a beaded jacket with sculpted hips and shoulders and black velvet trousers. Moore, who wore a gold Armani gown to pick up a Golden Globe last month, will be top of every designer’s wishlist for next month’s ceremony.Armani still has a maverick spirit. In the lavish stucco and gilt salons of a newly opened Paris HQ, Palazzo Armani, he cut through the fairytale froth which is the default aesthetic setting of haute couture with the sharpest of scissors.Armani’s first love will always be a trouser suit. Sharp shoulders crusted with beading glittered like icicles in the evening light, with softly ballooning trousers caught at the ankle by spike heeled boots. All was hard surfaces and long, lean lines. Silk column evening dresses were worked with embroidery until armour-thick, while Fortuny pleats were wrapped tight and lashed to the body with glittering thread. The models wore their hair coiled into tight chignons, topped with tiny sequined beanies.View image in fullscreenGiorgio Armani takes a turn down the catwalk with a model in one of his couture creations.Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty“Haute couture is where fashion becomes art,” said the designer, describing his references as “the shapes and colours of China, the landscapes of Polynesia … the opulence of India, the linear elegance of Japan and the decorum of northern Africa.”Armani said the 93-piece collection was a wardrobe for “a modern woman who has travelled widely and internalised her experiences”.Explore more on these topicsHaute couture showsParis fashion weekFashion weeksGucciArmaniParisFrancenewsShareReuse this content"

My plan that day was to ride until I reached a village with somewhere I could stay. I needed people because, unlike other bike tourists, I didn’t have a tent. I thought not bringing one would mean I had more adventure – maybe I’d stay in barns, living rooms or school halls. That had worked in Thailand, Malaysia and South Korea. It didn’t work in Turkey.I needed to get to the next town before sunset. I was cycling quickly downhill, probably too fast for a gravel road. I was scooting around a blind corner when a car came screaming around the bend. As soon as I saw it, it was in front of me.The next thing I remember is lying in the middle of the road with the cylinder of my bike handle skewered into my leg, blood everywhere.‘Only 12 other people have completed it’: cycling the 7,600km European DivideRead moreA week before that I had met Bryan, a bike tourist who’d ridden through more than 40 countries and settled in Turkey. I had his number because, like countless bike tourists before me, he’d let me stay the night in his small apartment in Antalya.After I was discharged from hospital – a rural Turkish hospital in a town I didn’t even know the name of – I sat outside in a wheelchair, not knowing what surgery I’d received or the state of my injury. I thought about calling everyone besides Bryan – my partner, Dad, Mum, best friend – but none of them could help. The only local number in my phone was Bryan’s.I don’t remember much about the phone call. I know it wasn’t a simple request to stay a few more nights. I essentially asked Bryan to be my carer for an indefinite period. I had no travel insurance, didn’t know anyone else in Turkey and couldn’t walk. What I do remember is the call was easy. There was no negotiation, just a welcoming: “Sure thing.”Soon, a nurse was helping me into a cab and Bryan’s nextdoor neighbour was carrying me up two flights of stairs like a bride and laying me down on Bryan’s couch. Neither of us exchanged a word.When Bryan arrived, he greeted me like a friend, not a basket-case traveller with a sorry story and no insurance. Despite having a job, a partner, a social life and all the normal life commitments, for the next five days Bryan became my carer. I lay on the couch reading articles about which Disney prince would be the worst to date and Bryan served me food, helped me shower and talked to me about his life. I was entirely dependent on him – someone I’d only spent a day and a half with– but never once did he complain or make it awkward.Eventually my family organised a flight home from Antalya. After I left Turkey, Bryan and I lost contact.The only thing I had to remember him by was the review he left me on the bike touring and hosting website Warmshowers:Nick stayed with me in my small apartment in Antalya for a couple nights in September 2014. Then, uh, ooops, I heard from him again as he unexpectedly returned to Antalya. He was in need of some help, and I was able to help him. It’s times like this – in an unknown city, with no friends, and a problem – that Warmshowers is especially terrific. Nick ended up staying another four or five days. He’s a super guy, open-minded, knowledgable and experienced beyond his years. You can absolutely trust him.I’d long wondered if Bryan remembered me or what happened, so a few weeks ago I wrote to him.“Of course I remember you,” he replied. “I always felt a bit bad that I sent you off on dirt roads and this happened because maybe you weren’t so used to dirt road touring … You never said anything at all to make me feel guilty about that. It’s just a feeling that I had.”He added: “I certainly never thought I did anything special. You should come back to Antalya. I live in a palace compared to where I was living when you were here.”Explore more on these topicsAustralian lifestyleKindness of strangersCycling holidaysTurkey holidaysfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Being able to grow my own food brought me hope and a career changeKathy SlackWed 29 Jan 2025 01.55 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 11.07 ESTShareIn 2012, I had taken to hiding and sobbing in a meeting room at the London advertising agency I worked for. I held a senior position at the company and, if I had been found, it would have been deeply embarrassing. But most days, I woke up feeling as if a lead weight was pressing on my chest; I would spend my commute overwhelmed by an inexplicable feeling of sorrow. Every ringing phone in the office felt like an electric shock. Hiding in the barely used meeting room, hoping for respite had become a regular occurrence.But respite didn’t come. Despite my picture-perfect life – high-flying career, happy home and good health – my mind unravelled. I was signed off work with depression and, initially, spent weeks curled beneath the duvet with the curtains drawn, unable to face life, and consumed by shame. The good fortune of understanding bosses and private health cover meant I had access to drugs, therapy, doctors – whatever I needed. But real healing, hope and even a whole new career eventually came from an unlikely place: a vegetable patch.My ever patient mother first coaxed me into the garden, where I sat among the dilapidated veg beds and put my hands in the soil. I watched the bugs, the weeds and the lettuces that had gone to seed. And there was silence. The constant chatter in my mind was quelled.View image in fullscreenOn a weekend away in 2012, shortly before she was signed off work.Photograph: Courtesy of Kathy SlackOver the course of a few weeks, I returned to the patch, eventually sowing some old lettuce seeds my mum found in a drawer, and marvelling at the alchemy of nature that transformed these lifeless kernels into food. I found a packet of radish seeds too, and within weeks I was picking actual radishes, which gave me the added satisfaction of eating something I’d grown.I became engrossed and, as my recovery progressed, I sowed anything and everything, creating a haphazard and chaotic garden. When you feel as if the world is falling down around you, seeing a seed turn into supper is very comforting. It reminded me to hope.A few months after being signed off work – despite the neighbouring pigs escaping and eating the pumpkins, despite forgetting where I’d planted potatoes, and despite my wandering attention – I had grown an abundant, generous harvest.View image in fullscreenThe vegetable stew made from Slack’s first harvest.Photograph: Kathy SlackThe first meal I cooked with entirely homegrown ingredients felt momentous. It was nothing more than a simple broth with onions, borlotti beans, carrots and cavolo nero, but it felt like a real achievement. As I sweated the onions, I thought about when I had planted them in the patch and how that one job had exhausted me for days. I podded the borlotti beans, remembering how dark and hopeless the world had felt when I sowed them. The carrots were tiny, gnarly and encrusted with mud, but I scrubbed them clean and tumbled them into the broth. An unlabelled tub found in the freezer, which I hoped was a chicken stock I’d made months ago in better times, turned out to be just that. As I added the baby cavolo nero leaves in the final moments of cooking, picking off a snail that had clung on despite washing, I realised that cooking this homegrown food made me feel more connected with nature than I had in years. That connection was grounding; it was my medicine.Although I was still dependent on others for so many things (shopping, organising medical appointments, the daily logistics of normal life), feeding myself using homegrown produce felt galvanising and empowering. Here was a meal made with things that didn’t exist a few weeks ago. I had done that.I took a mug of the steaming stew to the veg beds and clutched it in my hands as I admired the garden. In time, this stew set me off on a new path. I quit my adland job with no idea what I would do next. But, guided by my newfound passion, I went to chef school and got a job picking crops in an organic market garden. I started a blog, sharing recipes inspired by my harvests.In the veg patch, things continue to be ramshackle and tumbledown. I never had ambitions to be totally self-sufficient; as long as I can occasionally turn something I have grown into a meal, I am happy.I still feel the same sense of awe when I see a seed has germinated – and I still make that same stew every year, to remind me what I can achieve, and how far I have come.Rough Patch: How a Year in the Garden Brought Me Back to Life by Kathy Slack is published on 6 February(Robinson, £18.99).

My friend Anna and I are heading for the Cairngorms in a red campervan called Rowan, which we picked up fromBig Sky Campers, just across the Forth from Edinburgh. It’s an appropriate name, for we see the red berries of rowan trees everywhere we go, shining so brightly it’s as though someone’s strung tiny clusters of baubles on the silver-barked branches.At 1,748 square miles, the Cairngorms is the UK’s largest national park, stretching from Perthshire in the south to Moray in the north; mountains rear up just after we pass the riverside village of Dunkeld, armed with pastries fromAran Bakery. When I’ve been up here before, I’ve only skirted the edge of the park, sticking close to the hiking-shop-crammed town of Aviemore and seeing the hills – cloaked in snow at Easter and resplendent in purple heather in summer – from afar.Scotland mapDetermined to get right into the mountains, winter feels like the perfect time for a road trip – with few other tourists and the landscape arguably at its most dramatic. Our journey will take us north along the A9 before heading south from Grantown-on-Spey on what Visit Cairngorms callsthe Snow Roads. A 90-mile route that includes the highest public roads in Britain, the Snow Roads wind south through mountain passes to Blairgowrie, just outside the national park. Our plan is to drive its entirety over a couple of days, then loop back into the park near the village of Blair Atholl.View image in fullscreenDriving south from Braemar.Photograph: All images Anna MooresWith the short days, it feels like we’re chasing a sun that only just makes it above the hills. The light is already fading when we arrive atRSPB Insh Marshesafter a two-hour drive, silhouetting the leafless trees against the cotton-wool sky. The path – we have only enough daylight left for the one-mile track – winds through purple-tinged birch, frost crunching underfoot. Mountains, dusted with snow like icing-sugared cakes, loom in the distance, and honking gaggles of greylag geese stripe the sky in Vs.Our campsite for the night,Dalraddy Holiday Park, was set up onAlvie Estatein the late 1960s by the current laird’s father to cater for skiers. Today, it’s a sprawling but quiet site, handily open all year, with expansive mountain views and more secluded spots hidden among the trees. Rowan has two beds – one in the roof tent and the other on the back seats, which fold down – though we opt for the warmer option of sharing the latter, made extra cosy by the duvets, hot-water bottles and blankets Big Sky Campers provide. We sleep pretty well and wake to the piercing shriek of a tawny owl.The estate works in partnership, its manager Jonny tells me, with other local businesses includinghorse ridingandziplining, which I do at night, whizzing above the silver streak of a river. Many of these are run by people who have decided to diversify after having run ski businesses; the changing climate means snowfall is less reliable.View image in fullscreenCorgarff Castle as seen from The Watchers art installation.Despite the estate being managed it still feels wild, particularly as we climb up above the tree line for a view of the surrounding snow-streaked mountains. We have lunch in a candlelit bothy while red deer eat just outside; afterwards, we head to a hide to watch for red squirrels, though they only tease us with a brief appearance. Scotland’s relaxedOutdoor Access Codemeans that anyone can explore the land here on foot, but access to the bothy and hide is easiest (and most fun) on atour with Jamie, the laird of the estate.If anything, we are too spoiled for choice here in the Cairngorms – particularly when there are only about seven hours of daylight to play with. By the time we’re on the Snow Roads later that day, the only thing we can make out in the darkness is the thick fog that descends with no warning. It is with a sigh of relief that we reach the cosy pods atHowe of Torbeg, tucked on a hillside just outside the Cairngorms’ dark sky park; normally this would be a fantastic spot for stargazing, but tonight the weather is not in our favour.When the weather turns, we use the back of the van to squeeze into more thermals, and warm up on the heated seats after our walksThe next day, we retrace our steps to see the road in all its glory. It’s just 20 miles to Tomintoul, but it takes us a good couple of hours with all the stops to take in the views. “It’s like constant golden hour,” Anna says, our shadows cast long on the ground when we park up at The Watchers, an art installation of four striking cocoon-like seats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Judging from the number of vans we see at Dalraddy and Braemar campsites, there are a fair number of campers made of sturdier stuff than us.) Still, having a van is a real treat. At lunchtime, Rowan really comes into her own: we park beside a narrow burn on the Glenlivet Estate and make tea to accompany our sandwiches, which we enjoy with a mountain view from the back seat. Later, when the weather turns, we use the back of the van to squeeze into more thermals, and warm up on the heated seats after our walks.We head south for our next stop, Ballater, arriving in the dark (again) at theBalmoral Arms; the morning reveals the village’s graceful buildings and independent shops, the wide River Dee rushing nearby. We have just 50 miles left of the Snow Roads from here but allow a whole day to drive it, stopping at Braemar to join a tour with Simon Blackett ofYellow Welly Tours, who takes us to the Linn of Dee (“a linn is a narrow, whooshy gorge,” he tells us, as we watch the frothy coffee-coloured river buffer between steep rocky walls) and to see shaggy coated highland cows.The landscape becomes gentler and greener as we near the end of the Snow Roads, but swinging back up to theOld Manse of Blairfor our final night takes us back into the drama of the national park. We’re greeted with mulled cider and a warm welcome from front-of-house Jason. The next morning we wake to the hills just coming into focus, streaked with heather and soft sunlight.View image in fullscreenJason making a cocktail at the Old Manse of Blair.The trouble with having a campervan is that we feel even more untethered to normality than we usually would on holiday; there’s a feeling we could just keep going and going. Instead, we put off reality for just a little longer, wandering the woodlands around Blair Castle to find red squirrels, before chasing the last of the sun back to Edinburgh.Van hire was provided byBig Sky Campers(from£285for three nights).

I’m getting a little frustratedPamela Stephenson ConnollyWed 29 Jan 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 01.03 ESTShareMy partner has little interest in foreplay and wants to move quickly to the main event. This nearly always consists of standard straight vanilla sex: penetrative, usually missionary. She reaches orgasm very rapidly – nearly always before I’m anywhere close – after which she immediately loses all interest. She does manually bring me to climax, but I don’t feel close to her at that moment. Then she gets on with her day, or goes to sleep.We have been together 10 years and this pattern dates back to early in our relationship. I am increasingly frustrated: while we have sex relatively often and the early stages are pleasurable, I almost never have a really good orgasm. This is having an effect on our relationship more generally. We have talked about it a lot (my partner would say too much), but she can’t seem to see the problem.Among both men and women, there are people who are challenged by the notions of taking time for pleasure or the bonding that can occur through physical closeness after sex. There can be many reasons. Some people are simply not wired for true intimacy. Some have such poor body image that they don’t want to risk being seen. Others have personality types that are not consistent with the ability to achieve a sufficient level of relaxation or allow for fun or sexual creativity. If your partner is very goal-oriented in general, then it is reasonable to imagine her sexual modus operandi would be similar. Perhaps she is anxious – a person with an anxiety disorder is fixated on the future and cannot simply be in the moment to luxuriate in sex; such a person will usually just want to finish and move on as your partner does. Some people even have phobias about touch, or a morbid fear of germs; such people will want to make a sexual session as brief and focused as possible, and will need a high level of control. It would be worth considering your partner’s sexual style in the context of the broader person. Doing so may give you clues as to how to approach her.

He’s also signed actions eliminating DEI and “gender radicalism” from the US military.Trump promised in hisinaugural speechthat these orders would amount to a “complete restoration of America”.Here’s what to know about the executive orders Trump has signed since retaking the White House.Gender-affirming careThe order:Trump signed an order that attempts to end gender transitions for people under 19.What Trump said:“It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,”readsthe order.What it means:The order directs that federally run insurance programs, including Tricare for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care. The order calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.Read moreReshaping the militaryThe order:Trump signed three executive orders on 27 January that would reshape the military: removing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, eliminating “gender radicalism” from the military, and reinstating soldiers who were expelled for refusing Covid-19 vaccines.What Trump said:“To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It’s going to be gone,” Trump said in Florida,according to CBS.What it means:Trump’s order does not yet band transgender soldiers from the military, but directs the Pentagon to create a policy for trans members of the military.Read moreStart a process to “develop an ‘American Iron Dome’”The order:Trump signed an executive order on 27 January that would begin the process of creating a “next-generation” missile defense shield, which the administration is referring to as the American Iron Dome.What Trump said:The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,” theordersaid.What it means:Creating a short-range missile defense system akin to Israel’s Iron Dome would take years to build. The order calls for a plan from defense secretary Pete Hegseth within 60 days.Read moreReview of disaster agency FemaThe order:Trump ordered a review of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), the disaster response agency, and suggested there is “political bias” in the agency. Trump previously criticized the agency’s response to Hurricane Helene.What Trump said:“Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, Fema has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,” theorderstated.What it means:A review council – which includes secretaries of defense and homeland security, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem – will report to Trump within 180 days.Read moreDeclassifying MLK and JFK filesThe order:Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified documents on the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.What Trump said:“The federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,” theordersaid.What it means:Trump made this promise during the election campaign and made a similar pledge in his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from the CIA and FBI to withhold some documents.Read moreRemoving ‘barriers’ to AI innovation and investing in digital financial assetsThe order:During his first week in office, Trump signed anexecutive ordercalling for a review of all Biden policies on AI, to remove policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation”. Asecond ordercalled for a working group to start work on crypto regulations.What Trump said:“We must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas” to maintain the US’s dominant position in AI technology, the order states.What it means:Former PayPal executiveDavid Sackshas been tasked with leading a group to develop an AI action plan. Meanwhile another working group will start work on crypto regulations.Ending birthright citizenshipThe order:On his first day in office, Trump targeted automatic citizenship for US-born children of immigrants in the country illegally.What Trump said:The order specifies that it would limit birthright citizenship if a person’s “mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person’s birth”, or “when that person’s mother’s presence in the United States at the time of said person’s birth was lawful but temporary”.What it means:Birthright citizenship, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil, is protected by the 14th amendment and any attempt to revoke it will likely bring immediate legal challenges. The order wastemporarily blockedon 23 January, with the judge calling it “blatantly unconstitutional”.Read morePut a freeze on refugee admissionsThe order:Trump signed an order suspending the country’s refugee resettlement program starting on 27 January. Refugees maybe only be admitted on a case-by-case basis so long as their entry is in the “national interest”.What Trump said:The ordercited“record levels of migration” to the US and said the country did not have ability to “absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees”.What it means:Advocates say the move put lives in danger and has left families devastated. Thousands of refugees now stranded around the globe.Read moreLeaving the World Health OrganizationThe order:Trumpsigned an order to have the US exit the World Health Organization (WHO).What Trump said:“World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen anymore,” Trump said at the signing. He accused the WHO mishandled the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.What it means:The US will leave the WHO in 12 months’ time and stop all financial contributions to its work. The US is biggest financial backer to theUnited Nationshealth agency.Read moreRenaming the Gulf of MexicoThe order:Trump ordered two name changes: theGulf of Mexicoand Alaska’s Mount Denali.What Trump said:“President Trump is bringing common sense to government and renewing the pillars of American Civilization,” the executive order said in part.What it means:Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the “Gulf of America” and will rechristen Alaska’s Mount Denali as Mount McKinley.It will have no bearing on what names are used internationally.Read moreskip past newsletter promotionSign up toFighting BackFree newsletterBig thinkers on what we can do to protect civil liberties and fundamental freedoms in a Trump presidency.

(Biden rescinded the order.)Key aides to Trump have called for mass government firings.Project 2025made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump’s second term. The rightwing playbook called for civil servants deemed politically unreliable to be fired and replaced by conservatives.Read moreDeclaring a national energy emergency and‘unleash’oil production in AlaskaThe order:Trump declared a national energy emergency as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to “unleash” already booming US energy production that included also rolling back restrictions in drilling in Alaska and undoing a pause on gas exports.What Trump said:The order means “you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem and we do have that kind of emergency,” Trump said. The order also says it is US policy for the country to “fully avail itself of Alaska’s vast lands and resources”.What it means:The declaration would allow his administration to fast-track permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. It is likely that the order, part of a broader effort to roll back climate policy, will face legal challenges.Read moreCreating apolicy recognizing onlytwo gendersThe order:Trump signed an order to remove “gender ideology guidance” from federal government communication, policies and forms. The order makes it official policy that there are “only two genders, male and female”.What Trump said:“Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination,” the order states.What it means:The order reverses a Biden-era executive action on the acceptance of gender identity.Read morePausing the TikTok banThe order:Trumpsigned an executive ordertemporarily delaying the enforcement of a federal ban on TikTok for at least 75 days.What Trump said:“I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn’t have originally,” Trump said at the White House, as he signed executive orders according to theNew York Times.What it means:Trump ordered his attorney general to not enforce the law requiring TikTok’s sale. Trump says the pause allows for time to chart an “appropriate course forward” to protect national security and not abruptly shut down the popular app. In his first term, Trump favored aTikTokban, but has since changed his position due to factors including his own popularity on the app.Read moreRescinding 78 Biden-era executive actionsThe order:Trump ordered78 Biden-era executive actionsto be rescinded, including at least a dozen measures supporting racial equity and combating discrimination against gay and transgender people.What Trump said:“I’ll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous administration,” Trump told a crowd in Washington after his inaugural speech. He also said he would end policy “trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life” and push for a “color blind and merit-based” society.What it means:The orders signal a reversal of Biden-era policy that prioritized implementing diversity measures across the federal government. Trump repealed orders signed by Biden advancing racial equity for underserved communities and the aforementioned order combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.Declaring a national border emergencyThe order:Trump signed an order at the White House declaring anemergency at the southern US border,along with several other immigration-related policies.What Trump said:“All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,” Trump said in his inauguration speech.What it means:The executive action paves the way to send US troops to the southern border and makes good on campaign promises to implement hardline immigration policies. There are limited details about how the administration planned to execute its sprawling set of immigration actions that were all but certain to face legal and logistical challenges.Immigrant communities across the country are bracing for Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest deportation program in American history”, beginning as early as Tuesday morning.Read moreIssuing pardons for January 6 defendantsThe order:Trump issued pardons foroffenders and commutations related to the January 6 attackon the Capitol. He will direct the Department of Justice to dismiss cases currently in progress.What Trump said:“I’m going to be signing on the J6 hostages, pardons, to get them out,” Trump said during his rally speech. “We’ll be signing pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people.” Trump said he has pardoned about 1,500 defendants charged in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and issued six commutations.What it means:Trump made his pledge to issue pardons for those with convictions related to the January 6 Capitol attack a core part of his re-election campaign. On the campaign trail, Trump often featured the national anthem sung by prisoners in a Washington DC jail. There are more than 1,500 people federally charged with associated charges.With Trump back in the White House, justice department investigations into January 6 crimes are expected to cease.Read moreWithdrawing from the Paris climate agreementThe order:Trump issued executive actionwithdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement, along with a letter informing the United Nations of the decision.What Trump said:“I am immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord rip off” Trump said during a rally at the Capital One Arena. In his inaugural speech, Trump said he would use executive action to “end the Green New Deal”.What it means:In 2017, Trump exited the Paris agreement. Upon taking office in 2021, Biden rejoined. Monday’s order makes good on a Trump election promise to withdraw from the 2015 global treaty seeking to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.Exiting the Paris agreement is part of Trump’s broader efforts to roll back climate protections and policy. Trump has described Biden’s efforts to grow the US’s clean energy sector as “the green new scam”.Read moreExplore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS politicsUS immigrationUS Capitol attackUS militaryUS healthcareexplainersShareReuse this content"

Problem is, it can mean very different things to different people ...Zoe WilliamsWed 29 Jan 2025 11.05 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 12.29 ESTShare‘We’re all sick of Britain being in the slow lane … we want to see a revival of those animal spirits so that we can grow the economy and bring investment here,”said Rachel Reeveson her return from Davos last week. Plainly a memo has gone round: in a radio interview this morning, business secretary Jonathan Reynolds claimed Labour’s willingness to take bold decisions “unleashes the animal spirit, the sense of something exciting happening”. When Reeves set out her plan for growth this afternoon, she reprised many of her Davos themes. She’s on a strange crusade against newts and bats, holding wildlife concerns responsible for Britain’s anti-growth mindset; she thinks bringing down net migration and fearlessly growing the economy are compatible and equal priorities; she’s putting a hell of a lot of faith in extra airport runways. But at least this time she wasn’t saying we should be more like Trump.But what does “animal spirits” mean? Does it mean what Reeves thinks it means? Is it a useful concept? And how do we get hold of some of these spirits?The phrase is first found in a 16th-century medical tract (and you should feel free to go back to Bartholomew Traheron if you want to lol at early surgery), but in its economic sense it was coined by John Maynard Keynes in his 1936 key text, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money. “A large proportion of our positive activities depend on spontaneous optimism rather than on a mathematical expectation,” Keynes wrote, elegantly answering the eternal question about economists: if they’re so smart, how come they’re always wrong? Because human psychology, singly and in herds, is much more powerful than maths. Depressions happen when business investment and consumer spending get into a doom loop, and no formula can explain this; it’s simply driven by pessimism. I’m making it sound baggy (“just vibes!”) but it was precisely this quality in Keynes – his willingness to be mystified, his refusal to stop at the hard edge of what reason and groupthink dictated, but rather, to test it against observable realities – that made him such an enduring and original theorist.Rachel Reeves confirms government backing for Heathrow third runwayRead moreTwo American professors, George Akerlof and Robert J Shiller, the first an economics Nobel prize-winner, took up the idea in 2009, when global depression was again at the forefront of everyone’s minds. They dug deeper into optimism, and what conditions might create it: trust in one another, in government, in institutions and in corporations; storytelling, specifically narratives of plenty rather than scarcity; faith in justice; the absence of corruption. Their book, Animal Spirits: How Human Psychology Drives the Economy, and Why it Matters for Global Capitalism, is a really good read for non-economists. Its conclusion was more profound than “mood matters”. It basically called out neoliberalism from inside the house. If people perceive unfairness, mendacity, scarcity, bad faith, it will quell their optimism and economies will suffer. Markets need rules, in other words. Unfettered capitalism seeds its own undoing.This isn’t at all whatRachel Reevesis talking about. Her ideas centre on the removal of regulation. She wants a more permissive planning approach, less environmental claptrap (see runways, bats). But it’s a mixed picture – she also cheered on a proposed £250m magnet factory in Oxfordshire, whose combination of job creation (1,000 skilled posts) and state-endorsed research and development would be exactly what Keynes had in mind for a mood-boost, and Akerlof and Shiller would call great storytelling. Reeves wants to halt the talk of decline, while clinging to the declinist narrative that migrants are the problem. Her theory of growth seems to be basically Beetlejuice (say it three times and it will magically appear). And her call to action is that we all just cheer the hell up.To be honest, the speech did cheer me up a little bit.

I feel like I am doing a lot for my $45 per hour. I am caring for a woman in the throes of labour. Her eyes are glassy, her vocalisations frantic. She is in transition, a time in labour you can feel terrified and out of control. I hold her and ground her with my well-practised voice, refined from more than 10 years of experience.I set up a baby Resuscitaire in case it is needed. I document heart rates and clean up body fluids while also educating a student working with me. We write down vital signs and draw up drugs ready to administer. Do you know that midwives can initiate dosages of morphine, antibiotics and other drugs without having to bother a doctor?My $45 per hour also means that I get to see a life emerge. I get to see the dark hair of this new person before anyone else. I get to gasp. Crow. Delight. Whoop. Blink back tears as I hold a new life. I pass her to the mother, my second midwife passes me a warm towel to rub this baby into life.It’s your birthday! Take your first breath little one.But suddenly, things aren’t running as smoothly. There is more blood than I’d like to see. But that’s OK. If this was someone you loved, I’d know how to keep them safe.‘I felt guilty’: women reveal harrowing details to groundbreaking NSW birth trauma inquiryRead moreFor $45 per hour, I can put a cannula in so we can give life-saving medications. I can hang fluids, I can birth the placenta and I can reassure the woman as to what I need to do to stop the bleeding. Luckily I am not alone in this. I’ve pressed the buzzer, called for my midwifery and medical colleagues to come help. But for those critical first minutes, it is me, a woman in a highly gendered profession, underpaid and undervalued. Will there be enough colleagues available to answer my buzzer if the NSW government continues to make nurses and midwives thelowest paid of our profession in the country? Do you worry about the impact this will have on mothers and their babies?I do a lot for $45 per hour, and I don’t feel the NSW government appreciates that. I worry that it has an old-fashioned view of our profession – or maybe of women and their needs. Do you know midwives and nurses have a highly pressured, clinically skilled role? We assess, triage, cannulate, suture, medicate and resuscitate, and all while providing the soothing, reassuring care that many of us were drawn to the profession to do.And what about at 4am? I am now paid $51 – that extra 15% is meant to compensate for the physical health consequences and psychological impact of compulsory night shifts. I don’t get to nap or relax. We have less staff on at night. For my extra $6 per hour, I am one of the most senior midwives managing a heart-stopping (for me – breath-stopping for the baby) shoulder dystocia in the middle of the night. It takes a long time for the doctors to arrive to my emergency buzzer, but luckily I have the skills to internally rotate the baby’s shoulders that were stuck like cement for five long minutes. The smell of my cold sweat stays with me all night. It stinks of the fear and panic I feel, wondering if I’ll ever free this baby, if the resuscitation we do together after would be enough. It stinks of my exhaustion from being awake with my own kids all day, before having to work all night. Fifteen percent isn’t enough. Male-dominant industries compensate their night-shift workers with not just a better increase in pay but extra benefits and compensation, so why not us?NSW health minister apologises to women failed by maternity care after birth trauma inquiryRead moreIf you saw me give the first breaths to your grey lifeless baby, bringing forth that yearned-for sound of a cry, would you pay more attention to what we are asking for? Fairer pay and better conditions. We are not interested in claims from the state government that it is offering “more” than previous governments. Don’t tell us you can’taffordto. Prioritise us. Value us.I am ashamed to admit that I worked on the last strike day. But as a single mother of three, I desperately needed the overtime money of a double shift. It meant I was on shift from 7am till 10pm. I don’t think the women who came in to have a baby deserved a tired midwife. As the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) argues,midwives are on 2007 wagespaying 2025 prices, and with clinical skills and the responsibilities that are vastly different to what they were when these wages were first negotiated.I am asking the NSW government to have empathy and compassion but also common sense. Supporting women to have safe and healthy pregnancies, births and postnatal experiences has got to be a core priority. Maybe the old adage of “you can judge a society by how it treats its most vulnerable” could guide you. Birthing women are strong, courageous and incredible. But they are vulnerable too. And they deserve appropriately paid midwives with safe ratios and work conditions.Oceane Campbell is a midwife and author living in NSW.

She relies on the pharmacy inside an East Jerusalem clinic run by the UN’s agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, for a monthly supply of blood pressure and kidney medications, as well as insulin.“Where am I supposed to get my medicine? This would cost me 400 [Israeli shekels – £90] a month otherwise. We can’t afford that; we are refugees,” she said.Then there are the blood tests she needs every three months, which would otherwise cost her another 150 shekels (£30), or her regular treatment at an eye hospital that was covered by Unrwa that would otherwise prove costly.Across Gaza, East Jerusalem and theWest Bank, a disaster looms for Unrwa with a ban imposed by Israel’s parliament due to come into force at the end of this month.“Are you sure that Unrwa will close?” Jahaleen asked, slapping her hands against her thighs in distress. “I really don’t know what to do – only God can help us if they close this clinic.”View image in fullscreenAn Unrwa worker locks the gate of clinic in Shuafat refugee camp in East Jerusalem.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianWhen the Israeli parliament passed the bill to ban Unrwa last October, Fathi Saleh, the director of services for the Shuafat refugee camp on the outskirts of Jerusalem, arrived at his office to find hundreds of terrified people demanding to know what could happen if the agency was forced to close.“Cutting the services we provide is like cutting the oxygen supply to people here,” he said. “It will devastate people.”Saleh is a child of the camp, whose office sits on the site of a municipal cafeteria for children, where he supervises the same schools, medical services and sanitation workers that he has used his entire life. Even so, what will happen on 1 February when he arrives at his office deep within the camp remains a mystery.The ban could mean no dial tone when he picks up the landline, a red seal of wax on the door blocking entry to his office or, worse, the presence of Israeli security forces who regularly raid the camp. All the Unrwa staff know is that it will not be them who decides their fate.“Anything is possible,” he said. When people show up at his office with questions, he reassures them that Unrwa will continue to provide the same health services, schooling and rubbish collection to the estimated 30,000 refugees – both registered and unregistered – who live in Shuafat “until we are no longer able to do so”.The Shuafat refugee camp is home to tens of thousands of people crammed into a 2 sq km cluster of squat tower blocks, a web of electricity cables strung between them, all hemmed in by high concrete barriers, a watchtower and a checkpoint. The prospect that Unrwa trucks may be blocked from removing the rubbish piled daily on to the row of skips in the camp’s streets makes Saleh fearful.Israel insists it is going ahead with Unrwa ban – what it may mean for PalestiniansRead more“This camp generates 20-25 tonnes of rubbish every day; imagine the catastrophe that will occur if we can’t remove that, just from this camp. Within days that is 100 tonnes of rubbish that would be on the streets here. What will happen?” he asked.The 7 October 2023 attacks, where Hamas militants broke out of the besiegedGazaStrip, killed 1,139 people and took 250 more hostage, changed Israel’s relationship with Unrwa overnight. Israeli officials had long complained about the organisation, founded in 1949 to aid Palestinian refugees by providing a range of services such as education, making it unique among UN agencies. But in the months after 7 October 2023, the Israelis accused Unrwa staff of having links to Hamas, and of involvement in the attack.View image in fullscreenSigns at the clinic, one reading ‘no weapons are authorised within these premises’.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianAn investigation into 19 Unrwa staff members conducted by the UN’s official oversight body led to the sacking in August of nine employees who “may have been involved in the armed attacks of 7 October 2023”,according toFarhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for the UN secretary general. Unrwa has more than 30,000 staff.The UN’s efforts were seen as insufficient by Israel, where Unrwa’s offices in East Jerusalem were set ablaze amid protests outside. The ban on Unrwa was regarded as a triumph among Israel’s increasingly hardline right wing, as it stipulates a complete cut to any communication between Israeli institutions and the UN agency, now designated a terrorist organisation.Earlier this week, the Israeli government ordered Unrwa to vacate its offices by 30 January, while one rightwing deputy mayor, Aryeh King, called for protests outside that day, adding “the countdown continues, three more days until Unrwa is expelled from Jerusalem”.The Unrwa commissioner general, Philippe Lazzarini,toldthe UN security council earlier this week that the closure would affect 70,000 patients and more than 1,000 students in East Jerusalem alone.The Shuafat camp is the only Unrwa-run camp officially on Israeli territory, meaning that should the UN agency be forced to close there, the Jerusalem municipality would be under pressure to assume some of its roles. Saleh said the municipality had not informed him of any potential handover plans.If this ban comes into force it will be a sad day for the UN charterSuad Shwefi, 67, who chatted as she shopped for vegetables in the street in Shuafat, said her family had “no information whatsoever about what will happen” to her 13 grandchildren’s education – they are all halfway through the school year in Unrwa schools that are, crucially, a short walk away.Udi Shaham Maymon, a spokesperson for the Jerusalem municipality, said they were working to provide alternatives. He emphasised it was for East Jerusalem residents, who have long complained the municipality neglects their needs, to opt in.Contingency plans are ready to absorb 650 students into other schools in Jerusalem “in case Unrwa does close”, he said, adding that it would be simple to expand rubbish collection services to include the camp. The municipality could offer access to some family care centres, he added.But elsewhere the risk of chaos looms large, particularly in the West Bank, where more than 45,000 students are in Unrwa schools, hundreds of thousands flock to Unrwa’s 43 primary care centres and the UN agency provides basic services such as rubbish collection in 19 Palestinian refugee camps. These camps are not administered by the ruling and impoverished Palestinian Authority, meaning they could be totally without services.View image in fullscreenThe Shuafat camp is the only Unrwa-run camp officially on Israeli territory.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianIn Gaza, Unrwa has also long been the largest aid organisation, coordinating the distribution of relief to more than 2 million people, requiring some level of Israeli cooperation to operate in the besieged territory.Nurses and an administrator at Unrwa’s clinic in Shuafat said Israeli forces at the checkpoints that dot their route to work from the West Bank town of Ramallah were quick to make their hostility clear. Soldiers who used to wave their cars marked with the Unrwa logo through the checkpoint without even looking at their UN-issued identity cards, now single them out for extra checks and hassle.“We used to proudly show our Unrwa identity cards at checkpoints, because it was respected. Now we hide them,” said one administrator, Adel Karim. “If we show the soldiers there our Unrwa cards, they tell us that they don’t recognise it and we have to show them our Palestinian identity cards.”A nurse, Abu Omar, said: “On 1 February we will come to work; there is no other option. As long as the door to the clinic is open, we will come and perform our duties. If they come to kick us out of the clinic, we won’t leave voluntarily.” He smiled as he leaned back on a desk, bemused by the overwhelming situation. “Most of us have worked here for 10 or even 15 years – where are we supposed to go?”Saleh said he felt the ban was an attack that went beyond the day-to-day services that Unrwa provides. “If this ban comes into force it will be a sad day for the UN charter,” he said. “This is an attack on theUnited Nations.”Explore more on these topicsWest BankPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsIsraelGazaAidMiddle East and north AfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

This means that many people could lose their current jobs,” says the report.The report adds that many economists believe job losses could be offset by the creation of new jobs or demand from sectors not touched by automation.Everything you wanted to know about AI – but were afraid to askRead moreAccording to the International Monetary Fund, about60% of jobs in advanced economiessuch as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. The Tony Blair Institute has said AI could displace up to 3m private-sector jobs in the UK, though the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands because growth in the technology will create new roles in an AI-transformed economy.“These disruptions could be particularly severe if autonomous AI agents become capable of completing longer sequences of tasks without human supervision,” the report says.It adds thatsome expertshavepointed to scenarioswhere work is “largely” eliminated. In 2o23, Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, told the former UK prime minister Rishi Sunak thatAI could ultimately replace all human jobs. However, the report says such views are controversial and there is “considerable uncertainty” over how AI might affect labour markets.2.The environmentThe report describes AI’s impact on the environment as a “moderate but rapidly growing contributor” as datacentres – the central nervous systems of AI models – consume electricity to train and operate the technology.Datacentres and data transmission account for about 1% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, says the report, with AI constituting up to 28% of datacentre energy consumption.It adds that models are using more energy as they become more advanced and warned that a “significant portion” of global model training relies on high-carbon energy sources such as coal or natural gas. Use of renewable energy by AI firms and improvements in efficiency have not kept pace with rising demand for energy, says the report, which also points to tech firms admitting that AI development isharming their ability to meet environmental targets.The report also warns that water consumption by AI, used for cooling equipment in datacentres, could pose a “substantial threat to the environment and the human right to water”. However, the report adds that there is a shortage of data about the environmental impact of AI.3.Loss of controlAn all-powerful AI system evading human control is the central concern of experts who fear the technology could extinguish humanity. The report acknowledges those fears but says opinion varies “greatly”.“Some consider it implausible, some consider it likely to occur, and some see it as a modest-likelihood risk that warrants attention due to its high severity,” it says.Bengio told the Guardian that AI agents, which carry out tasks autonomously, are still being developed and so far are unable to carry out the long-term planning necessary for those systems to eradicate jobs wholesale – or evade safety guidelines. “If an AI cannot plan over a long horizon, it’s hardly going to be able to escape our control,” he said4.BioweaponsThe report states that new models can create step-by-step guides to creating pathogens and toxins that surpass PhD-level expertise. However, it cautions that there is uncertainty over whether they can be used by novices.There is evidence of advancement since an interim safety report last year, the experts say, with OpenAI producing a model that could “meaningfully assist experts in the operational planning of reproducing known biological threats”.5.CybersecurityA fast-growing threat from AI in terms of cyber-espionage is autonomous bots being able to find vulnerabilities in open-source software, the term for code that is free to download and adapt. However, relative shortcomings in AI agents mean the technology is not able to plan and carry out attacks autonomously.6.DeepfakesThe report lists an array of known examples of AI deepfakes being used maliciously, including tricking companies into handing over money and creating pornographic images of people. However, the report says there is not enough data to fully measure the amount of deepfake incidents.“Reluctance to report may be contributing to these challenges in understanding the full impact of AI-generated content intended to harm individuals,” the report says. For example, institutions often hesitate to disclose their struggles with AI-powered fraud. Similarly, individuals attacked with AI-generated compromising material about themselves may stay silent out of embarrassment and to avoid further harm.”The report also warns that there are “fundamental challenges” to tackling deepfake content, such as the ability to remove digital watermarks that flag AI-generated content.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)CyberwarDeepfakeComputingJob lossesWork & careersEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

Without it, her mother’s care would cost about $10,000 a month.On Tuesday, when the system for processingMedicaidpayments to all 50 US states shut down unexpectedly, Pitzer’s anxiety erupted into full-blown fear.It seems the shutdown was related to the government-wide freeze on $3tn in grants and loans, which was paused by a federal judge until 3 February.Medicaid systems were restored at the end of Tuesday, but the chaos and confusion could continue.There is increasing pressure from conservative lawmakers and theTrump administrationto cut back the budget for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to more than 70 million Americans, or 20% of the population, experts say.Medicaid payment portals down after Trump’s federal funding freezeRead more“The potential disruptions to the finances of healthcare providers and patient care would be enormous,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice-president for health policy at the non-profit KFF.Nearly half of births are covered by Medicaid, and the program is the primary payer of nursing home care. The funding freeze also seemed to affect programs like Head Start and federally qualified health centers.“Finding a secure facility with dementia care for my mother once she needed round-the-clock nursing help was incredibly difficult, even after she qualified for Medicaid,” said Andrea Pitzer, 56, an author in Falls Church, Virginia.“There are no other options for her. To play politics by threatening to withhold, even temporarily, care for some of the poorest and most vulnerable among us – the elderly and disabled – is beyond cruel.”The system shutdown happened at the state level, but such uncertainty can quickly spread throughout the health system and beyond.“If the federal government were to freeze funding in Medicaid, states would be left holding the bag, and federal payments for Medicaid are the biggest source of federal revenue for states,” Levitt said.“Any freeze in Medicaid funding would send ripple effects throughout the healthcare system, with hospitals, nursing homes, clinics, physicians all of a sudden seeing big holes in their budgets and potentially threatening their ability to provide care.”States rely on the steady flow of federal grant money to issue payments to providers, and they use the federal infrastructure to process those payments, said Lindsay F Wiley, professor at the UCLA School of Law.“State agencies rely on federal grants for at least half of their Medicaid budgets – sometimes much more,” Wiley said.Joan Alker, research professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University, noted that “even a short disruption in the flow of federal funding could cause huge cashflow problems for states”.Disruptions like these, even temporary ones, can upset operations and create questions about the future of Medicaid funding.“There was a great deal of chaos today, of panic, and it’s very scary to think that if this allegedly was a mistake, that that level of incompetence exists, that the largest source of health insurance that the federal government supports would see this kind of thing happen,” Alker said.If the freeze wasn’t accidental – if it was purposeful – that would “absolutely not” be legal, she said. “This is mandatory spending.”The memo freezing government grants and loans said the order “should not be construed to impact” Medicare or social security benefits, but there were no stated exemptions for Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as Chip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Some of them also infringe on freedom of expression by requiring organizations to pledge support for the Trump administration’s ideological priorities, she said.“Judges will intervene, but court battles could last years,” Wiley said. “In the meantime, even short-term delays in federal funding will put lives at risk.”Explore more on these topicsMedicaidUS healthcareTrump administrationRepublicansUS politicsanalysisShareReuse this content"

The surprising truth about brain rotIs screen use really sapping our ability to focus and lowering our IQs? The scientists who have actually analysed the data give their verdictAmy FlemingWed 29 Jan 2025 00.00 ESTShareAndrew Przybylski, a professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University, is a busy man. It’s only midday and already he has attended meetings on “Skype, Teams, in person and now FaceTime audio”. He appears to be switching seamlessly between these platforms, showing no signs of mental impairment. “The erosion of my brain is a function of time and small children,” he says. “I do not believe there’s a force in technology that is more deleterious than the beauty of life.”‘Brain rot’: Oxford word of the year 2024 reflects ‘trivial’ use of social mediaRead morePrzybylski should know: he studies technology’s effects on cognition and wellbeing. And yet a steady stream of books, podcasts, articles and studies would have you think that digital life is lobotomising us all to the extent that, in December, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was “brain rot” (technically two words, but we won’t quibble) – a metaphor for trivial or unchallenging online material and the effect of scrolling through it. All this has sown widespread fears that the online world that we – and our children – have little choice but to inhabit isaltering the structures of our brains, sapping our ability tofocusor remember things, and lowering our IQs. Which is a disaster because another thing that can significantly impair cognitive function isworry.It may come as some relief to hear, then, that for every alarmist headline there are plenty of neuroscientists, psychologists and philosophers who believe this moral panic is unfounded. “Since 2017, there has been a constant drumbeat of: ‘Screens and tech and social media are a different universe that is bad for you and bad for your kid,’” says Przybylski. “And two things happen. The first is low-quality research that confirms our biases about technology. It gets immediate press because it’s consistent with our existing biases. It’s really easy to publish low-quality research that kind of shows a correlation, and then exaggerate it, because it’ll get attention and it’ll get funding.”No one is denying that dangers lurk online, but that doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to come to harm. “Living is risky, leaving the house is risky, crossing the street is risky,” says Przybylski. “These are all things that we have to help young people learn to do – to size up risks and act anyway. The internet is risky.”It seems like common sense that mental health has gone down as tech use has gone up. But it just isn’t scientificThere has also been, he says, “a real push in opinion pieces and popular-press books that are sloppy scientifically but stated so confidently. The ideas in these books are not peer-reviewed.” The published studies they cite tend to have small samples and no control groups, and to be based on associations rather than proving cause. “People will say: ‘The iPhone was invented in 2007 and Instagram became popular in 2012 and, oh my God, look, tech use has gone up at the same time mental health has gone down!’ It seems like common sense – that’s why you have this kind of consensus. But it just isn’t scientific.”In 2023, Przybylski and his colleagues looked at data from almost 12,000 children in the US aged between nine and 12and foundno impact from screen time on functional connectivity (“how different parts of the brain kind of talk to each other”, he explains), as measured with fMRI scans while the children completed tasks. They also found no negative impact on the children’s self-reported wellbeing. “If you publish a study like we do, where we cross our Ts, we dot our Is, we state our hypotheses before we see the data, we share the data and the code, those types of studies don’t show the negative effects that we expect to see.”View image in fullscreen‘Young people with access to phones say they’re happier across a wide range of metrics of wellbeing.’Photograph: Steven Robinson Pictures/Getty ImagesAnd of course no one talks about the positive effects of tech, such as finding connection and community. “If we zoom out, we find that if young people have access to phones that can connect with the internet, if they have high-speed internet at home, their wellbeing is higher. They say they’re happier across a wide range of metrics of wellbeing.“When the Lancet commission on self-harm does an evidence review, when the National Academy of Sciences in the US does an evidence review, when academic researchers do their meta scientific research, these things don’t come out in line with this tech panic,” he says. “That’s because this tech panic is not based on evidence. It’s based on vibes.”The “study”that spearheaded this cascade of concern in 2005, and is still quoted in the press today, claimed that using email lowered IQ more than cannabis. But Shane O’Mara, a professor of experimental brain research at Trinity College Dublin, smelled a rat when he couldn’t find the original paper. It turns out there never was one – it was just a press release. That finding was the result of one day’s consultancy that a psychologist did for Hewlett Packard. Hewould later statethat the exaggerated presentation of this work became the bane of his life.Alongside a survey on email usage, the psychologist conducted a one-day lab experiment in which eight subjects were shown to have reduced problem-solving abilities when email alerts appeared on their screens and their phones were ringing. He later wrote: “This is a temporary distraction effect – not a permanent loss of IQ. The equivalences with smoking pot and losing sleep were made by others, against my counsel.”The studies findingchanges to brain structuresound particularly alarming, even if they are looking specifically at people with “problematic internet use”, as opposed to the general population. The trouble with these studies, says O’Mara, “is that they can’t determine cause and effect. It may be that you go on the internet [excessively] because you’ve got this thing there already. We simply don’t know, because nobody has done the kind of cause-and-effect studies that you need, because they’re too big and too difficult.”Besides, brain structures change throughout life. Grey matter has been observed to decrease during pregnancy, for instance, and start regrowing after, along with other brain changes. “The brain is remarkably plastic,” agrees O’Mara.He also thinks we’re being deeply ahistorical when we berate ourselves for scrolling cute animal reels, celebrity regimes or cup-winning goals on social media. “Humans have always been distractible. We’ve always sought solace in the evanescent. If you look at the history of media in the UK, just as a simple example, back in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, how many millions of tabloids were sold every day? Staggering numbers, because people indulged in that stuff. This is something people have always done, and we’re being a bit moralistic about it.” Has the internet age led to greater numbers of plane crashes or patients dying on operating tables? “The answer is no: we’re much better at all of those things.”We’ve always had to watch out for our “attentional bottleneck”, he says. “For as long as I’ve been reading and researching in psychology, we’ve always taught our students: ‘Don’t do two things at once. You can’t.’” Multitasking and its associated dilution of efficacy were not invented by the internet. As Przybylski alluded to, having children is a classic route to task-juggling, with constant interruptions leading to intelligent adults not being able to string a sentence together. Similarly, if you use your smartphone while driving, of course you’ll increase the likelihood that you’ll crash.Be smart about how you use your devices. Manage the devices – don’t let them manage youWhat about the terrifying proclamations thattech is on the rise while IQ is in decline? I call Franck Ramus, the head of the cognitive development and pathology team at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Mercifully, he says it’s not yet clear if IQ is truly going down. Scores rose globally during the 20th century but growth started slowing towards the turn of the millennium. This plateau effect had long been expected, as we neared the limits of the human brain. “Height has been increasing over decades, but we’re never going to reach three metres, are we? So there are limits to human physiology, including brain size.”Any small IQ decreases that do seem to have been detected, Ramus says, aren’t considered conclusive at this point – the studies would need further replication. “There’s ameta-analysisof all the data until 2013, and the score seems to be progressing at least until 2010 or so. At the same time, it is true that some studies have documented a slight decrease in some countries. For example, there is a widely discussed Norwegian study that found a slight decrease in the last two decades. But there are also a greater number of studies that continue to observe increases.”View image in fullscreen‘Some apps and games may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence and other cognitive abilities.’Photograph: Alina Rudya/Bell Collective/Getty ImagesAs for screen exposure, he says, what do we even mean by that? “It could be anything. The screen is just a medium but what matters is content. So when you talk about screen, you might as well talk about paper. Paper is another medium, and anything can be written on paper.”This brings us neatly to Plato, who wrote about brain rot in relation to the invention of writing, says Tony Chemero, a professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Cincinnati, whose 2021paperin Nature Human Behaviour asserted: “Technology may change cognition without necessarily harming it.” “This worry that people are having, Plato had as well, 2,500 years ago or so, writing about how the written word will make people stupid because their memories will be worse and they’ll be worse at telling stories.”Chemero does not love smartphones or AI – and laments the hassle the latter has created for professors like him having to find new ways to check their students aren’t handing in ChatGPT-generated work. “But the one thing that they don’t do is make us stupid,” he says. “Over the history of hominids, many of our biggest challenges have involved adapting to new kinds of environments – and that’s being smart. This is just a new environment we’re in.” So while he can still remember the phone numbers of high-school classmates, younger people’s brains are simply freed up for other activities. “What we really want from technology is to do the things that are difficult and boring, such as lots of complex calculation, rote memorisation: humans just aren’t very good at that without technology.”The relevant question, he says, is whatismemory in this situation, when we’re outsourcing some of it to tech? “Is it something that your brain does or is it an ability that you have? If [technology helps you] remember more things while your brain does something different, I don’t think that your memory is worse. It’s just different. What really matters is what we are able to do.” After all, the secret to human success has always hinged on our use of tools. “Being smart is being able to do lots of stuff. And I don’t think our phones are making us less able to do many things.”View image in fullscreen‘Go out for a walk. Get up and get moving. We just need to develop new ways of interacting with these media.’Photograph: Stanislaw Pytel/Getty ImagesGary Small, the chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, hasstudiedpotential harms and benefits of digital technology use. He too steers clear of studies based on mere associations. “To my knowledge,” he says, “there’s no compelling evidence that using digital technology or using devices is going to cause permanent brain damage.”In terms of the negatives, he believes that certain platforms and content can be addictive. “It could be porn, shopping, gambling. This technology heightens human behaviour, puts it on steroids, accelerates all these issues.” He mentions a study two years ago for which he and colleagues sent a group of 13-year-olds off to nature camp, and assessed their emotional intelligence (reading emotions on faces) and social intelligence (describing a social interaction) before and after. “And we found that five days away from screen time led to significant improvements in both, and we had a control group on that.” This showed, he says, that the negative effects of phone use are temporary, and go away when we put our phones away.And there are positives. “In our work, in our social lives, screens keep us connected. We can be much more efficient. We can get information much more rapidly. I can collaborate with people across the globe.” While the fatigue you can get from not taking breaks is real – “you can get physical symptoms, headache, neck pain, shoulder pain, mental fatigue, no question about it” – using the internet can be stimulating brain exercise in itself. “The study we did, for me at least, was cause for some optimism.” His team taught older people to search the internet while they were in an fMRI scanner and found that their neural activity increased.The study also states: “Certain computer programs and video games may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence and other cognitive abilities. Some apps and digital tools offer mental health interventions providing self-management, monitoring, skills training and other interventions that may improve mood and behaviour.”So rather than hampering your cognitive (and possibly even parenting) abilities by fretting about brain rot, he says, “be smart about how you use your devices. Manage the devices – don’t let them manage you. I try to practise what I preach” – namely, by taking regular breaks and choosing appropriate modes of communication. “So many times I see these long email threads trying to deal with complex, nuanced issues. Best response is: ‘Call me or let’s meet.’”Przybylski, meanwhile, doesn’t shield his young children from smartphones or games consoles. “It’s perfectly OK to have some time dedicated to leisure, and why not some screen activities,” he says. Content quality is a consideration, and, “like every activity, it should be only a reasonable amount of time. I think many of the negative effects that are attributed to screen exposure are not intrinsic to screen exposure. They just reflect the fact that time can be lost for other activities that would have positive effects.”Likewise, O’Mara isn’t worried about spending most of his working day using a computer. “We just need to develop new ways of thinking about how we interact with these media. Go out for a walk. Get up and get moving. That’s very, very good for you, if you want to relieve a feeling of incipient anxiety caused by these things.” It’s all about balance and avoiding the temptation to multitask too much. O’Mara suggests making time for reading a book uninterrupted, or leaving your phone in another room while you’re watching TV. “Be intentional about your media choices,” he says.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingInternetNeuroscienceMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Just as we will not tolerate it in the continent of Europe, we cannot tolerate it wherever in the world it happens. We have to be clear about that,” Lammy said.Lammy’s comments mark a break from a much moresupportive British policy towards Rwandapursued by previous Labour and Conservative governments – as well as by influential figures such as Tony Blair.Kagame has long beenfeted at international symposiums, with his domestic policies being largely ignored due to the role he played in ending the Rwandan genocide and tackling disease.This week, however, Rwandan-backedM23 rebels seized the city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, in the latest escalation of a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced more than 1 million since its recent resurgence.2:17Several embassies attacked in DRC as Rwanda-backed M23 rebels advance – videoThe DRC government, UN officials and countries including the US have accused Rwanda of fuelling the conflict by deploying thousands of its own troops and heavy weapons on Congolese soil in support of the rebel group.A change in UK policy is conditional on how Rwanda responds to the international calls to pull back from Goma, but it appears likely UK-Rwandan bilateral relations will not easily recover.Kagame became an inadvertent poster child of the Conservative party when he agreed in 2022 to a British request to send asylum seekers to Rwanda. To protect the agreement from legal challenge , the UK was required to turn a blind eye to Rwanda’s human rights record and designate it as a safe destination for asylum seekers. Boris Johnson called Rwanda “one of the safest countries in the world”.Freedom of information requests showed that at the time the Home Office assured MPs that Rwanda was safe, the Foreign Office was making contingency plans in the event of a war between Rwanda and the DRC.Kagame has for years claimed Rwandan troops did not interfere in the internal affairs of its far larger neighbour or support operations being mounted by the M23 rebels group. This required him to deny successive reports by UN groups of experts showing the linkage between the M23 and Kigali.Lammy this week told MPs: “We know that M23 rebels could not have taken Goma without material support from Rwanda defence forces.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

According to the Rwandan mining authority, Rwanda’s mineral export revenues in 2022 increased to a record $1.1bn. The Congolese finance minister, Nicolas Kazadi, told an FT conference that wealth was obviously coming from the DRC.One reason the M23 is so active in North Kivu lies underground, with its rich deposits of minerals- coltan, cassiterite and tungsten.Bintou Keita, the head of the UN mission in the DRC, told the security council in September “The criminal laundering of the DRC’s natural resources smuggled out of the country is strengthening armed groups.”The capture of Goma will make it easier to transport these valuable minerals over the border to Rwanda.At the security council this week, the Congolese minister of foreign affairs, Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, said: “What the DRC is going through is not a conflict like others. It is a deliberate and methodical aggression against a sovereign state, a flagrant violation of the founding principles of this organization and an intolerable attack against international peace and security.”Explore more on these topicsRwandaDemocratic Republic of the CongoAfricaForeign policyAidnewsShareReuse this content"

The threatened duties are separate from the broad review of US tariffs, trade deals and other trade policy ordered by Trump when he took office last week.“So this is a separate tariff to create action from Mexico and action from Canada,” Lutnick said of the 25% duty threat. “And as far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff.”Lutnick repeatedly called for a restoration of “reciprocity” on trade with other countries, which is in line with Trump’s vow to erect a universal tariff of 10% on all US imports. He also said he wanted to improve US access to Canada’s largely closed dairy market.“My way of thinking, and I discussed this with the president, is country by country, macro,” Lutnick told the US Senate confirmation hearing when asked his preference for how Trump should impose tariffs.“We are treated horribly by the global trading environment. They all have higher tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and subsidies,” Lutnick said. “They treat us poorly. We need to be treated better. We need to be treated with respect, and we can use tariffs to create reciprocity, fairness and respect.”Lutnick’s comments echoed those made by Trump, who last week said the European Union was “very, very bad to us” and called tariffs “the only way … you’re going to get fairness”.Following the US financial market reaction to the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s powerful, low-cost generative AI model, members of the Senate commerce, science and transportation committee repeatedly asked Lutnick how he would maintain US AI leadership.Lutnick said DeepSeek had misappropriated US technology to create a “dirt cheap” AI model and vowed to impose new restrictions on Beijing’s technology access.“They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,” Lutnick said ofChina. “It’s got to end, and I’m going to be rigorous in our pursuit of restrictions and enforcing those restrictions to keep us in the lead, because we must stay in the lead.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS SenateUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

It is his administration’s latest attack on women’s rights.Mariano Cúneo Libarona, the justice minister, said the government will “eliminate the figure of femicide from the Argentine penal code” adding that feminism was a “distortion of the concept of equality”.“This administration defends equality before the law enshrined in our national constitution. No life is worth more than another,” Cúneo Libarona said.Femicide – the murder by a man of a woman in thecontext of gender violence– was added to the penal code as an aggravating factor of homicides in 2012, and is punishable with life imprisonment.The announcement came shortly after Mileidecried the concept of femicideat the World Economic Forum in Davos, and said that “equality before the law already exists in the west. Everything else is just seeking privileges.”“We’ve reached the point that in many supposedly civilised countries, if a woman is killed, it is called femicide. And this carries more serious punishment than if you kill a man simply based on the sex of the victim – legally making a woman’s life be worth more than that of a man,” he said.According to areportby the Argentina’s observatory of femicides of the ombudsman of the nation, 295 femicides were recorded between 1 January and 31 December last year.Mariela Belski, Amnesty Argentina’s executive director, said it was “deeply concerning” that violence against women is not “being understood” by the state. Although globally there are more homicides of men than women, the home is the most dangerous place for women and girls, she said.Sixty per cent of womenare killed by their partners or family members, compared with 12% of men.“Removing femicide as a legal category would pose a greater danger to women and girls,” Belski said.Argentina has a recent history of strong feminist mobilisation. In 2015, a wave of marches against femicidesparked similar protestsin Peru, Uruguay, Italy and Germany, while the country’s Green Wave movement was instrumental insecuring safe abortion rightsin 2020. Argentina was also the first Latin American country to implement a parliamentary quota system for women in 1991.But with that progress has come a push-back – a sentiment that Milei successfullytapped intoduring his campaigning. “I won’t apologise for having a penis,”he said in 2022.Argentina’s far-right president poised to shut down anti-gender violence agencyRead moreSince taking power, Milei has eliminated the ministry of women anddissolvedthe undersecretariat for protection against gender violence. He has cut back programmes providing support for victims of gender violence, and at Davos attacked the “bloody and murderous abortion agenda”. In November, Argentina was theonly countryto vote against a UN general assembly resolution to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.“It is more of the same misogyny that this government promised in its electoral campaign and that deepens day by day,” said Soledad Deza, a prominent lawyer and president of the feminist organisation Mujeres x Mujeres.As it ramps up its “cultural battle” against “wokeism”, Milei’s government is also now working to repeal legislation includinglabour quotas for sexual minorities, gender parity in electoral lists and non-binary identity documents. The administration also aims to overturn Micaela’s Law, which establishes mandatory training in gender issues for public employees.“The Micaela Law was created because Micaela’s femicide, like so many others, could have been avoided if the people involved in the days, months and years before had made decisions with a gender perspective,” said Nestor García, the father of Micaela García, whosedeath led to the law’s creation. “This is a very dangerous issue … to promote these policies against the gender perspective, which are in my opinion in breach of the constitution of our country.”Milei’s decision also comes as Donald Trump – who has called his Argentine counterpart his “favourite president” – has begun his own crusade against gender and diversity policies. In the past week, Trump has saiddiversity, equality and inclusion initiativeswere “dangerous, demeaning and immoral” and revoked orders aimed atpreventing discriminationbased on gender identity or sexual orientation.Explore more on these topicsArgentinaFemicideJavier MileiAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Both Google and Apple have been approached for comment.After the Chinese chatbot was released last week close to $1tn (£804m) was wiped off the leading US tech stock index. The UK government said on Tuesday it was up to citizens if they wanted to use the app, with officials in London monitoring any national security threat to data from the new AI platform and saying they would not hesitate to take action if threats emerged.OpenAI ‘reviewing’ allegations that its AI models were used to make DeepSeekRead moreThe Italian regulator for the protection of personal data, known as the Garante, said it wanted to know what personal data is collected, from which sources, for what purposes, on what legal basis and whether it is stored inChina. It gave DeepSeek and its affiliated companies 20 days to respond to its questions.“Our office will launch an in-depth investigation to see if GDPR rules [European Union data protection regulations] are being respected,” said the head of the Italian data regulator, Pasquale Stanzione, according to the Italian ANSA news agency.A spokesperson for the Irish Data Protection Commission in Dublin, meanwhile, told the Guardian it had also “written to DeepSeek requesting information on the data processing conducted in relation to data subjects in Ireland”.DeepSeek became the most downloaded free app in the Apple app store in the US and the UK after it emerged it could achieve comparable performance to competitors such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.The Chinese app’sprivacy policystates personal information it collects from users is held “on secure servers located in the People’s Republic of China”.

Her husband reportedly told police his wife had been trying to photograph a location from the 2015 Chinese film Cities in Love and had not noticed the approaching train.The deployment of security guards is in response to complaints that groups of visitors are clogging up the narrow street when they stand to take photographs of the area, which was also a location in Love Letter, a 1995 Japanese film that was also a hit in China and South Korea.‘Everyone has the same dream’: Mount Fuji grapples with rise in tourismRead moreThe latest crackdown on shoddy behaviour by visitors coincided with figures showing that a record 36.7 million people visited Japan last year, with the government aiming to increase the figure to 60 million by the end of the decade.“This road is lined with houses and has heavy traffic,” a city official told the Mainichi Shimbun. “Tourists standing on the street or walking side by side often make it impossible for vehicles to pass. The impact on residents has been significant, and this fiscal year has been particularly severe.”“People are even entering private property without permission to take photos,” Hidetoshi Itagaki, an 80-year-old local resident, told the Kyodo news agency.Otaru’s popularity has soared beyond pre-pandemic levels. Almost 98,000 foreign tourists spent at least a night in the city in the six months from April last year, the highest number since records were first kept in 1997. The actual number is believed to be even higher, as many tourists stay in nearby Sapporo, the biggest city in Hokkaido, the Mainichi said.Wish you weren’t here! How tourists are ruining the world’s greatest destinationsRead moreOfficials have been encouraging visitors to visit Japan’s regions to take the strain off “must-see” locations such asKyoto, the country’s ancient capital, and the megalopolises of Tokyo and Osaka.But the surge in visitors is putting a strain on infrastructure and causing resentment among locals. In Otaru, the problem has come to a head in recent months, despite the introduction last year of multilingual signs asking visitors to respect their surroundings and local residents.A weak yen and an increase in international flights to Japan have fuelled the surge in inbound tourism, with South Koreans comprising the single biggest group, followed by people from China and Taiwan.The influx has proved a boon for hotels and shops as tourists spent a record ¥8tn yen ($50.8bn) last year, according to government data. Japan’s seven majorconvenience storechains said their combined sales had reached a record high in 2024, thanks in part to prodigious consumption of snacks and drinks by foreign tourists.Butovertourismhas also led to a rise in complaints about overcrowding, littering, drinking on the street and other nuisance behaviour.Last year a Chilean Instagram influencer was forced to apologise after filming herselfdoing pullupson a sacredtoriishrine gate in Hokkaido, while a video of a man who appeared to be a foreign touristkickingone of Nara’s famed deer prompted outrage on social media.In another high-profile incident, an American man was arrested for using his fingernails to scratch letters representing his family members’ names into atoriiat Meiji Jingu shrine in Tokyo.Authorities have introduced fees and capped visitor numbers onMount Fujianderected a screento prevent people from congregating at a spot popular for taking photos of the mountain. This week the Japan Tourism Agency released 22 pictograms encouraging visitors to be better behaved. They include signs urging them to travel light to avoid heavy luggage blocking access to trains and buses, and to refrain from queue jumping.Explore more on these topicsJapanAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

The operator of Incheon international airport announced that more than 2.1 million passengers – averaging 214,000 a day – were expected to use the airport to travel overseas from 24 January to 2 February.“This is projected to be the highest average daily passenger count during the lunar new year holiday since the airport opened (in 2001),” the operator said in a statement.The festivities even extended to space, with Chinese astronauts Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze sending New Year’s Eve greetings from the Tiangong space station on Tuesday.View image in fullscreenShenzhou-19 astronauts Cai Xuzhe, Song Lingdong and Wang Haoze sent their Spring festival greetings from China’s Tiangong space station.Photograph: Xinhua/REX/ShutterstockIn a video released by the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA), the trio could be seen dressed in blue jumpsuits with traditional red cloud patterns, holding two pieces of paper-cutting featuring the Chinese character “fu”, for good luck.“In the new year, may all your dreams come true,” Wang said, forming a heart shape above her head.Additional reporting by Amy Hawkins.

But they noted that genetic diversity loss occurred even when no disturbances were reported, suggesting a “background level of genetic diversity loss across species”.“We think that this represents the more general biodiversity crisis that the planet is facing, and broader effects of ecological disruptions [such as] climate change,” Grueber said.However, she highlighted several instances in which tailored conservation strategies have improved genetic diversity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

He had presented two non-binding motions to parliament, aimed at boosting security measures and closing all of Germany’s land borders to irregular migration.On Wednesday theparliament narrowly votedin favour of one of them, which Merz described as his “five-point plan” to end irregular migration, with 348 MPs voting in favour of it, 345 against, and 10 abstaining. It proposes turning asylum seekers and other migrants back at the border, in a move that Scholz’s Social Democrats and the Greens have said contravenes both German and EU law on refugees.The leader of the opposition CDU/CSU conservative alliance, which is leading the polls before the 23 February election, had shifted the debate on migration policy to the right, apparently in response to a knife attack last week in which two people were killed. Police arrested a 28-year-old Afghan man as the main suspect.Outcry followed the attack, in particular after it was revealed that the man who was arrested had been receiving psychiatric treatment and had been due to be deported, but that the measure had been delayed due to apparent bureaucratic obstacles.It was the latest in a string of attacks, the deadliest in Magdeburg last month when anSUV ploughed into a Christmas market, killing six people and injuring 300. A doctor from Saudi Arabia was arrested after that incident.An unusually heated debate preceded the vote. Scholz attacked Merz for “having effectively cancelled the fundamental agreement of our republic in the heat of the moment”, by riding on the expectation that his motions would only stand a chance of success if they were supported by the anti-immigrant, pro-Kremlin AfD. Scholz called it an “unforgivable mistake”.He said that by relying on the support of the AfD, “the very same ones who are fighting against our democracy, who despise our unitedEurope, who have continued to poison the climate in our country for years”, Merz had overstepped “boundaries that as a statesman one should not overstep”.Robert Habeck, the deputy chancellor and the Greens’ candidate for chancellor, urged Merz: “Mr Merz, don’t vote with racists. It is not necessary and it is ill-advised.”Merz, however, said that getting his plans over the line with the help of the AfD would be merely “a last resort”. “It might be the case that the AfD enables the necessary majority for a law for the first time,” he said, adding that the thought of “jubilant and smirking AfD MPs”, caused him discomfort.The AfD parliamentary leader and chancellor candidate, Alice Weidel, who was duly pictured laughing with and hugging party members after the result came in, said: “The so-called firewall is nothing other than an anti-democratic cartel agreement.” Merz’s migration plan, she added, had been “copied from us”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It does not have the chance of becoming law until after the election, but if he became chancellor Merz could be well placed to get it through.According to a poll by Insa, 66% of Germans support Merz’s plans, including 56% of supporters of Scholz’s Social Democratic party (SPD). But both the CDU/CSU and SPD have lost ground in the polls in recent days, while the AfD gained four percentage points.Among opponents of Merz’s proposals were the leaders of the Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany, who in a joint letter addressed to him warned of the dangers of breaking the long-held taboo of not working with the AfD. “We fear that German democracy will be massively damaged if this political promise is abandoned,” they wrote.The churches expressed their dismay at the “timing and tone” of the debate, warning it was likely to “defame all migrants living in Germany and stir up prejudice”. Neither they added, did it contribute to solving the existing challenges.Explore more on these topicsGermanyAlternative für Deutschland (AfD)EuropeThe far rightMigrationRefugeesOlaf ScholznewsShareReuse this content"

Attempts by the Kyiv USAid office to save funding for some of the most important programmes have reportedly been rebuffed in Washington.“They requested a waiver for some of the things they considered critical but didn’t get it,” said a source familiar with discussions over the future of USAid inUkraine. “It’s clear that the new administration wants to destroy what was there before and build something completely new.”View image in fullscreenParatroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division helping USAid in Poland with delivery of goods for potential evacuees from Ukraine in February 2022.Photograph: Sgt Robert Whitlow/US Army/APThe Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said his government would prioritise the most important USAid-funded programmes and try to cover them with alternative funding solutions.“There are programmes like those for prosthetic limbs, or those on special rehabilitation, which obviously can’t just be ended abruptly. There will be a prioritisation,” said Zelenskyy’s adviser Mykhailo Podolyak in an interview on Wednesday.Military aid and direct budgetary assistance to Ukraine have not so far been affected, but USAid had sent more than $7.6bn (£6.11bn) in humanitarian and development aid since the start of the full-scale invasion in February 2022 and backed a remarkable range of projects across many sectors.Charities reeling from USAid freeze warn of ‘life or death’ effectsRead more“This was the worst-case scenario,” said George Chewning, the executive director ofUS-Ukraine Veterans Bridge, an organisation devoted to fostering links between military veterans in the two countries. He said several partner organisations in Ukraine had suddenly found out their projects would no longer be continued. One,Veteran Hub, said it was closing a telephone hotline that had provided support and counselling to traumatised veterans.“A lot of people thought there might be a thorough review and were prepared to justify their work and their projects but there certainly wasn’t an expectation that the funding would be halted,” said Chewning.For veterans’ organisations, the cuts could not have come at a worse time, said Chewning, as Donald Trump’s desireto negotiate an end to the warcould result in hundreds of thousands of newly demobilised veterans needing to re-integrate into society. “All our partners are now scrambling for additional funding, which was not easy to come by in the first place,” he said.USAid also handled a large number of regional humanitarian aid projects, many of which were left pondering how to fill the newly created gaps, and without any idea what would remain after the three-month review period.“It just impacts our morale … Do we wait for their continuation? Do we redirect these projects to other agencies? We don’t really know what to do,” said Vitalii Lukov, the deputy mayor of the southern city of Mykolaiv, which has been reliant on international aid sincebeing severely damagedin the early months of the war.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines EuropeFree newsletterA digest of the morning's main headlines from the Europe edition emailed direct to you every week dayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The city has been reliant on international aid since the early months of the war.Photograph: Serhii Ovcharyshyn/NikVesti.com/Global Images Ukraine/Getty ImagesThe US development agency was also a supporter of many of Ukraine’s independent media outlets.Bohdan Lohvynenko, the founder of theUkraïner online news portal, said more than 80% of the site’s funding came from the US, and the outlet was now in serious trouble. “There is no viable advertising market for war reporting, leaving us with community support or a paywall model,” he said. However, raising money in this way during wartime was very difficult, he said, with most citizens preferring to use their money to support the military.“Some [media outlets] will survive but many will not. Already a lot of people are losing their jobs,” said Katerina Sergatskova, a co-founder of the2402 foundation, which provides support and training to Ukrainian journalists. “If places have a cash reserve they may be able to survive for the next three months,” she said, until it became clear which USAid projects would be continued.The “stop work” order meant that projects were abruptly ended with almost no warning. Oleh Velhan was one of thousands of Ukrainians to receive an email earlier this week informing him that his service agreement would be suspended, starting from Wednesday and “until further notice”. Velhan worked for a company that provided services to an organisation working in the healthcare sector.The suspension was in order to “assess the effectiveness of programmes and their compliance with United States foreign policy”, said the email. A few minutes after receiving the message, Velhan found he was locked out of his work email account. “I felt frustrated and angry. All the projects I had been working on are gone. I’ve been notified that the contract might be renewed … but the uncertainty is killing me,” he said.Explore more on these topicsUkraineUSAidTrump administrationAidHumanitarian responseEuropeUS foreign policynewsShareReuse this content"

When they found the spot where the drone was being controlled, a man whose bloodstream contained 0.69 parts alcohol for every 1,000 parts blood admitted to flying it.Under Swedish law, anything above 0.2 parts alcohol in 1,000 parts blood is punishable; 1.0 is a serious offence. Drink-driving laws are strict in Sweden compared with other parts ofEurope. In the UK, the limit is 0.8; in Spain, France and Belgium it is 0.5. In Romania and Hungary it is 0.The man later claimed he did not fly the drone under the influence and blamed a friend who was not present when police arrived. He was fined 32,000 SEK (£2,341) to be paid across 80 days in daily fines of 400 SEK (£29).It is understood to be the first case in Sweden in which a person has been prosecuted and convicted of drunkenness while flying a drone.“I have not seen a case like this before,” Jenny Holden Nyström, prosecuting, told the broadcaster SVT. “I am satisfied with the verdict.”Karin Hellmont, the district court president, said it applied the same punishment scale as it would for drink-driving to the drone case. “It is an aircraft. Even though it is flown by itself, it is controlled by someone down on the ground and can fall from a high height and injure someone,” she said.Explore more on these topicsSwedenDrones (non-military)EuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Trump repeats false claim that US sends condoms to GazaClaim was first made in press conference, prompting Fox host to say condoms were also being used to bomb IsraelRobert MackeyWed 29 Jan 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 17.12 ESTShareSpeaking at the White House on Wednesday, Donald Trumpboastedthat his administration had “stopped $50m being sent to Gaza to buy condoms for Hamas”, doubling down on a claim first made by his press secretary which appears to be contradicted by the facts.As the Guardian reported on Tuesday,a comprehensive reportissued in September by the US Agency for International Development (USAid), not a penny of the $60.8m in contraceptive and condom shipments funded by the US in the past year went toGaza. In fact, the accounting shows, there were no condoms sent to any part of theMiddle East, and just one small shipment, $45,680 in oral and injectable contraceptives, was sent to the region, all of it distributed to the government of Jordan.The claim was first made by White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, as she tried to justifyTrump’s sweeping order to freeze federal funding by citing what she called important new research from Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” (or Doge), a special group that Trump has created, and the office of management and budget (OMB).USDA inspector general escorted out of office after defying Trump orderRead more“Doge and OMB also found that there was about to be 50m taxpayer dollars that went out the door to fund condoms inGaza,” Leavitt claimed. “That is a preposterous waste of taxpayer money. So that’s what this pause is focused on: being good stewards of tax dollars.”While Leavitt did not offer any evidence to support this claim, and did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the Guardian, the idea that the United States government planned to spend $50m to send condoms to Gaza quickly went viral, with an assistfrom Muskhimself.The Fox pundit Jesse Watters evenclaimedthat the condoms were being used by Hamas militants as balloons to float explosives into Israel.A review of the available evidence, however, suggests that the claim is almost certainly not true.For the financial year 2023, the most recent for which data is available, only about $7m worth of condoms were distributed globally by USAid, and the vast majority of family-planning funds, 89%, were spent on programs in Africa.No USAid funding for family planning was budgeted for Gaza.In a thread on Musk’s social-media platform X, state department spokesperson Tammy Brucecited, as “Example 1” of “unjustified and non-emergency spending” that had been blocked: “Condoms. Prevented $102 million in unjustified funding to a contractor in Gaza, including money for contraception.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Syria’s military and security agencies were also dissolved, to be replaced by new security institutions and army.In addition, all armed factions in Syria are to be disbanded and absorbed into the new national army. On its face, the order to dissolve armed factions should include HTS, though it did not name the group, which is the de-facto authority in the country.Sharaa said that the country’s priorities were “filling the power vacuum, preserving civil peace, building state institutions”.View image in fullscreenAn image released by the Syrian official news agency shows Sharaa meeting the UN special envoy to Syria, Geir Pederson, in Damascus, 16 December 2024.Photograph: Sana/APThe transitional government is supposed to hand over power to a new government in March, but it is unclear how the transition will be managed. In an interview with Al Arabiya last month, Sharaa said holding elections could take up to four years, and rewriting the country’s constitution could take three.Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to ensure the post-Assad era is inclusive of all facets of Syrian society, but has delayed the event repeatedly. His meetings have been mostly with individuals, rather than political parties.The dissolution of military factions is sensitive. The presence and role of these factions have become a pressing question, as the country’s interim government – led almost exclusively by HTS appointees – tries to consolidate power.HTS, originally an offshoot of the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, became Syria’s most powerful rebel group by the time it launched the military campaign to topple the Assad regime last year. Under its guidance,a patchwork of opposition factionsacross the country participated in the military operation.In mid-January, the Syrian ministry of defence announced that it would be holding consultations with factions to see how they would form a unified military.Challenges abound, as more radical Islamist rebel factions – many of which make up part of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army – are not as disciplined as HTS’s rank and file and differ with the group’s ideology. The sudden fall of the Assad regime also left weapons caches, tanks and artillery free for the taking across Syria, some of which have fallen into the hands of rebels.View image in fullscreenSharaa, whose nom de guerre was Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, speaks at the Umayyad mosque in Damascus, 8 December 2024.Photograph: Omar Albam/APSharaa and the minister of defence have held near-daily meetings with rebel factions and given their leaders key posts in the interim government, such as making them provincial governors.The question of how to restore the Syrian state’s monopoly on violence is believed to be critical to maintaining the internal stability of the country.Foreign powers are watching to see if Syria maintains its current trajectory towards stability, wary of seeing a repeat of a Libya scenario, where the country was divided up by warring factions and experienced mass lawlessness after the toppling of the longtime dictator Muammar Qaddafi.The UN wants to influence a pluralist Syria – but will the country listen?Read moreThe interim government has courted regional powers for support in bolstering its fledgling state and army, seeking foreign funds and legitimacy. The new government’s first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia, and later to Turkey, where the foreign minister was accompanied by the defence minister and director of intelligence.While the transitional government tries to consolidate power internally, it also has been negotiating with the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led military force which controls a third of the country. The SDF has asked to maintain a degree of military independence within the new Syrian army, which the government has refused.As negotiations continue, the pace of conflict between the SDF and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army has continued to escalate in northern Syria.Explore more on these topicsSyriaMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

The three – a soldier, Agam Berger, and two Israeli civilian hostages, Arbel Yehoud and Gadi Moses – are due to be handed over on Thursday.Moses, 80, will be the first male civilian hostage to be released under the current ceasefire deal.There was speculation that five Thai citizens held by Hamas could also be released on Thursday.The Palestinian Prisoners’ Club said 110 prisoners would be released in the deal including 30 minors. The list also includes Zakaria Zubeidi, a prominent militant and former theatre director who was one ofsix men to tunnel out of a maximum-security prison in northern Israel in 2021. All were recaptured within days but the escape helped solidify Zubeidi’s image among Palestinians as a folk hero.The ceasefire exchanges were continuing as Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was in Israel to discuss progress towards the second phase of the truce before a planned meeting between the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the US president next week in Washington. Witkoff also briefly visited the so-called Netzarim Corridorin Gaza.According to Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, Witkoff was accompanied by Israel Defense Forces, and visited the corridor with the strategic affairs minister, Ron Dermer.A law banning the activities of Unrwa will come into force on Thursday amid warnings that the agency’s closure will affect large numbers of Palestinians relying on its services and aid, including in Gaza.The enforcement of the ban, which would result in the closure of the agency’s headquarters in East Jerusalem, follows a notification to the UN from the Israeli ambassador, Danny Danon, this week. “Within 48 hours, the State of Israel will cease its cooperation with Unrwa,” Danon said. “Unrwa must cease its activities and evacuate all its facilities in Jerusalem.”Israel’s insistence that it would close Unrwa came as a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, said the decision was a “provocation” that would fuel tensions in the region owing to its impact on Palestinian refugees.Unrwa was founded in 1949 to support hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees displaced by the conflict that resulted in Israel’s foundation, and has continued to support refugees over the intervening decades.View image in fullscreenPalestinians in Gaza queue for aid parcels distributed by Unrwa.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesIt has been the target of Israeli criticism for years, not least the argument by Israeli officials that its existence perpetuates the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.More recently, Israel claimed that a handful of the agency’s Palestinian staff had participated in Hamas’s 7 October attack.On Wednesday, hours before the planned banning of Unrwa, Israeli officials returned to the accusations claiming the agency was full of Hamas operatives. “Unrwa equals Hamas,” said David Mencer, a government spokesperson, a claim unsupported by evidence provided by Israel. “Israel has made public irrefutable evidence Unrwa is riddled with Hamas operatives.”A series of investigations, including one led by the French former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some “neutrality related issues” at Unrwa – but emphasised Israel had not provided evidence for its headline allegation.In an address to the UN security council this week, the head of Unrwa, Philippe Lazzarini, refuted the allegation and warned of the damage of closing the agency.“Unrwa is the largest UN presence in Gaza, with 13,000 personnel and 300 premises. The agency is critical for supporting a shattered population and the ceasefire. And yet, in two days, our operations in the occupied Palestinian territory will be crippled, as legislation passed by the Israeli Knesset takes effect.“At stake is the fate of millions of Palestinians, the ceasefire, and the prospects for a political solution that brings lasting peace and security.View image in fullscreenPhilippe Lazzarini, the head of Unrwa, told the UN security council the fate of millions of Palestinians was at stake if Unrwa was closed.Photograph: Yuki Iwamura/AFP/Getty Images“The [Israeli] political attacks on the agency are motivated by the desire to strip Palestinians of their refugee status, thereby unilaterally changing the long-established parameters for a political solution. The objective is to deny Palestine refugees the right to self-determination and erase their history and identity,” he said.Meanwhile, the Egyptian president’s remarks on Trump’s comment were the strongest pushback so far from Egypt or Jordan. Trump said on Saturday that Egypt and Jordan should take in Palestinians from Gaza, which he called a “demolition site” after 15 months of Israeli bombardment that made most of its 2.3 million people homeless.Sisi, speaking at a press conference with the visiting Kenyan president, William Ruto, said Egypt would work with Trump to reach peace between Israel and Palestinians based on a two-state solution.“Regarding what is being said about the displacement of Palestinians, it can never be tolerated or allowed because of its impact on Egyptian national security,” Sisi said. “The deportation or displacement of the Palestinian people is an injustice in which we cannot participate.”Explore more on these topicsGazaUnited NationsWest BankPalestinian territoriesIsraelMiddle East and north AfricaAidnewsShareReuse this content"

But the idea of “cleaning out” Gaza is not welcomed by the Palestinians who live there – or the countries that Trump has in mind as their new home. And if they were to be forced to leave after Gaza was devastated by the Israeli military, it would appear to be a clear case of ethnic cleansing.In recent weeks, the ceasefire in Gaza has been seen as one positive outcome from Trump’s arrival in the White House. But his intervention has served as a reminder of the serious risk that the first phase will be followed not by further steps towards lasting peace, but by a renewed Israeli assault with the approval of Washington. Yesterday,Trump invited Netanyahuto be the first world leader to visit the White House since his inauguration.Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s senior international reporterPeter Beaumont, is about why Trump’s comments have alarmed many in the Middle East and what they might tell us about what comes next. Here are the headlines.Five big storiesKumbh Mela festival|Dozens of people are feared to have diedin crowd crushes at India’s Kumbh Mela festival, local officials have said, as vast crowds went to bathe at one of the holiest sites of the Hindu gathering. People were crushed in the early hours of Wednesday as tens of millions flocked to immerse themselves in the sacred confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers.UK economy| Rachel Reeves is unveiling plansto create “Europe’s Silicon Valley” between Oxford and Cambridgeas she stakes the government’s success on kickstarting economic growth.

The home secretary is expected to reject a report saying that authorities should adopt an “ideologically agnostic” approach in favour of focusing on Islamist and far-right violence.Tax| Roman Abramovich, the billionaire Russian oligarch,may owe British tax authorities as much as £1bn, according to analysis of documents that suggests his companies failed to pay tax on profits made through an elaborate offshore investment scheme.Technology| US tech stockstentatively recovered on Tuesdayafter the emergence of the Chinese DeepSeek app wiped $1tn (£800bn) in value from the leading US tech index.

Hundreds of thousands of people made the journey back to the north of the territory on Monday afterIsraelopened military checkpoints as part of the ceasefire deal.That mass movement of people is all the more extraordinary when so many buildings in the north lie in ruins. As one resident, 50-year-old Osama, told the Associated Press: “Whether the ceasefire succeeds or not, we will never leaveGazaCity and the north again.”That kind of flat refusal of the idea is one of the reasons that Trump’s comments have alarmed so many people. But it is not the only one.Does Trump’s proposal amount to ethnic cleansing?In a word, yes. The United Nations defines ethnic cleansing as the deliberate policy of clearing out civilians from their lands “by use of force or intimidation”. If the residents of Gaza voluntarily left the territory without any threat of violence, that would not amount to ethnic cleansing. But the context of the assault on Gaza, and the fact that most people want to rebuild their lives there, is a long way from that scenario.“It would clearly be ethnic cleansing,” Peter Beaumont said. “And it is entirely cynical to present it as a humanitarian solution when so many of the levers that could change the circumstances of civilians in Gaza are in Israel’s hands.”Crucial to understanding why the idea is so horrifying for many Palestinians is the history of what they call the Nakba, or catastrophe, when Israeli forces expelled up to 750,000 people – the exact figures are disputed – from Arab towns and villages in the newly created state of Israel in 1948. The war since the 7 October attacks is viewed by many Palestinians as a new Nakba.But that is not the only precedent that they will have in mind. “The history for decades has been that when Palestinian populations have been moved since 1948, they don’t get to come back,” Peter said. By the end of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, for example, hundreds of thousands had been displaced from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, mostly to Jordan.Egypt and Jordan have rejected Trump’s idea that they could take in Palestinians forced to leave Gaza. “Public opinion tends to be much more pro-Palestinian rights than either King Abdullah’s regime in Jordan or that of Sisi in Egypt,” Peter said. “So it is politically hugely problematic for them.”Who in Israel sharesTrump’s view?The idea that Palestinians should be “transferred” to other countries, or into the Gaza Strip from Israel, has “floated around in Israel for decades” across the political spectrum, Peter said. But in the current crisis, the idea that Palestinians should be forced out of Gaza has been coupled with proposals for new Israeli settlements in Gaza. “That combination has definitely emanated from the far right.”It has been pushed by Itamar Ben-Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich, the ultra-nationalist members of Benjamin Netanyahu’s government whose votes are crucial to its survival: in October, both spoke at an event supporting the idea. Smotrich said that “without settlements, there is no security”.Some advocates of moving Palestinians out of Gaza have explicitly called on Trump to support their cause. Eugene Kontorovich, head of the international law department at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative Israeli thinktank,wrote after Trump won the electionthat the Biden administration was guilty of “keeping [Palestinians in Gaza] trapped in Gaza” and that “now Trump can flip the script”.He also criticised sanctions against “Jews living in Judea and Samaria”, a reference to settlers and would-be settlers in Gaza and the West Bank. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded those sanctions. During his first term, the US reversed decades of policy and said that it did not consider settlements illegal under international law.Who are the voices influencing Trump on Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank?Many people in Trump’s orbit appear to be sympathetic to the views of Ben-Gvir and Smotrich. Last year, Jared Kushner – Trump’s son-in-law and former senior foreign policy adviser – said Israel should “move the people out [of Gaza] and then clean it up”, in part because “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable”.Trump’s pick to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, Elise Stefanik, ​​said recentlythat she agreed with Ben-Gvir and Smotrich that Israel has “a biblical right to the entire West Bank”.And his pick as ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee,told CNN in 2017: “There is no such thing as a West Bank. It’s Judea and Samaria. There’s no such thing as a settlement. They’re communities, they’re neighbourhoods, they’re cities. There’s no such thing as an occupation.”What does all this mean for the prospects oflasting peace?It is foolhardy to make predictions about what happens next in the Middle East – but the far right’s refusal to back down suggests they believe that Trump will support their cause as the first phase of the ceasefire ends. Inthis opinion piece, Ben Reiff of +972 magazine notes that sources present in discussions between Smotrich and Netanyahu expect the fighting to resume. Trump has said he is “not confident” that the ceasefire will hold.“Perhaps the war carries on in some low-level way,” Peter said. “When you look at Syria, where Israel now has an open-ended occupation in the buffer zone, or Lebanon, where there has been backsliding on an Israeli withdrawal – the notion that we should expect Netanyahu to bring the war to a complete end seems unrealistic.”The consequences of an emboldened far right would not be limited to Gaza. Last week, a new Israeli crackdown began in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank, causing hundreds to flee. The Palestinian health ministry said at least 10 people had been killed; Israel said it had killed eight militants. The Israel Defense Forces presented the operation as an attempt to prevent militants regrouping and attacking Israeli civilians; NGOs and the UN accused Israel of using indiscriminate and disproportionate force.Meanwhile, as Bethan McKernan and Sufian Tahareport in this piece, at least six Palestinian villages in the West Bank have been targeted by violent settler attacks.Some have viewed the increase in activity in the West Bank as part of the price exacted by the far right for not bringing down the government over the ceasefire deal. “The big bet from Ben-Gvir and Smotrich is to make a lot of noise about a lot of issues – but it’s the US allowing Israel to annex the West Bank that they really want,” Peter said. “The question is: if Netanyahu survives all of his legal travails and wins re-election, how far will he go to keep the far right on side?”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

His statements about Gaza and the idea of a deal with Saudi Arabia are not consistent, but perhaps this is someone who echoes pieces of the ideas of whoever he’s been talking to. It doesn’t look like a game of three-dimensional chess. It just looks like two entirely contradictory ambitions.”What else we’ve been readingView image in fullscreenAn aerial view of pilgrims waiting to bathe at the 2019 edition of the Kumbh Mela festival.Photograph: Information & Public Relation Department Uttar Pradesh Handout/EPAAfter the terrible news that dozens are feared dead in crowd crushes at India’sKumbh Melafestival,Michael Safi’s piecefrom the 2019 edition gives a sense of how unimaginably vast an event it is.

Earlier, officials on the ground said 39 bodies had been brought to a hospital morgue.According to accounts by devotees, several crowd crushes occurred at about 1am after large numbers of people congregated on the banks where the Yamuna and Ganges river meet in order to take a holy bath in the waters. As the crowd surged in different directions, people began to push their way out and some tried to jump over barriers. Many fell down the river bank in the panic and families who had been sleeping on the ground nearby were trampled.A number of bodies were seen lying around the banks of the river. Shoes and clothes could be seen strewn on the ground, and there were scenes of desperation at nearby makeshift tent hospitals where the dead and injured were initially brought.Narayan Singh Lodhi, 50, from Madhya Pradesh, said his sister-in-law Hukam Bhai Lodhi died in the crush after she became separated from her family as they went down to bathe. She had three children, including a daughter who was with her at the festival.Lodhi said the trouble began when the crowds of bathers going in opposite directions began to collide. “I saw people falling to the ground and shouting, and people started treading on each other,” he said.“I tried to rescue as many people as possible but I could only get hold of my wife and another woman. I dragged them out. I saw around 20 bodies who were clearly dead on the floor who had been crushed and others were lying there injured crying out for help.”View image in fullscreenSecurity personnel try to control the crowds of pilgrims near the site of a crowd crush at the Kumbh Mela festival in Prayagraj.Photograph: Niharika Kulkarni/AFP/Getty ImagesMore than 400 million people – the biggest crowd in the event’s history – were expected to attend this year’s Kumbh Mela festivities, held over 45 days in Prayagraj, in Uttar Pradesh. A record 100 million people had been expected to attend the festival on Wednesday alone, to take part in a particularly auspicious bathing day.The Kumbh Mela has been promoted heavily by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, whose face was visible on posters across the event, and he had earlier praised the “extraordinary” and “unforgettable” crowds that were attending. In the aftermath of Wednesday’s crush, Modi called the incident “extremely sad”.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, did not acknowledge any fatalities at the festival and said the incident had been triggered when some devotees tried to cross over barricades set up by police.MapSeveral relatives of victims placed the blame with police, accusing them of failing to properly control the crowds and causing bottlenecks of devotees in certain areas as some main routes and pontoon bridges across the river were blocked for ordinary pilgrims.Lodhi was among those who said the deaths were a failure by the authorities. “It’s police who are responsible for this disaster,” he said. “We had planned to take a dip in the river around 4am but they came over earlier and tried to make everyone get in the water quickly and go. It was their fault that everyone went down to the river at once and then they didn’t properly control the crowds. Now people have lost their lives.”On Tuesday, as numbers attending the festival swelled beyond the authorities’ expectations, announcements broadcast over loudspeakers urged new arrivals to get in the water quickly, dip twice and then leave the site immediately, calling it a sin to do a third dip.View image in fullscreenKumbh Mela officials on Tuesday urged people to bathe quickly and then leave amid concerns of congestion on Wednesday.Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianKumbh Mela: what is the Hindu ‘festival of festivals’?Read moreAs the sun rose on Wednesday morning, there were frantic scenes at the missing persons booths, where those caught in the crush tried to find missing relatives.

Trump’s data protection lawsuit was dismissed, with Judge Karen Steyn ruling “there are no compelling reasons to allow the claim to proceed”.In a witness statement, Trump said he brought the case to prove claims in the Steele dossier, published by the BuzzFeed website in 2017, that he engaged in “perverted sexual acts” in Russia, were false.Many of the claims in the dossier were never substantiated and lawyers for Trump said the report was “egregiously inaccurate” and contained “numerous false, phoney or made-up allegations”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

A separate allegation of sexual assault was also made against Perumbalath.The statement from senior clergy, which followed consultations with local clergy, congregations and staff, will put intense pressure on Perumbalath to consider his position.The allegations about Perumbalath come less than three months after the Church of England was thrown into unprecedented crisis after Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, wasforced to resignover a separate abuse scandal.A statement from six senior clergy on Wednesday evening said: “Having listened to clergy, congregations and staff at the diocesan offices and the cathedral, it is with deep regret that the senior leadership of the diocese of Liverpool feel that the position of the Rt Revd Dr John Perumbalath is currently untenable.“We believe that the allegations made by the female bishop need to be fully and properly investigated. We also believe that while these proper investigations are conducted the bishop of Liverpool will need to step aside from all ministry in the diocese of Liverpool.”The statement was issued 24 hours after Channel 4 News revealed that two women had come forward with allegations about Perambalath. One woman accused Perumbalath of kissing her without consent and groping her, and a female bishop accused him of sexual harassment. Both incidents allegedly took place in Essex in 2023.Perumbalath, who became bishop of Liverpool in 2023, said police had investigated the allegations but taken no further action. He added that while he did not believe there had been any wrongdoing, he had “taken seriously the lessons learnt”.Perumbalath said he had complied with an investigation by the national safeguarding team. The allegations had also been investigated by the police, he said, who took no further action.“Whilst I don’t believe I have done anything wrong, I have taken seriously the lessons learnt through this process addressing how my actions can be perceived by others,” he said.The Church ofEnglandsaid a complaint of alleged misconduct had been brought against the bishop in 2023, after Perumbalath formally and legally assumed the role.A spokesperson said the NST had concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring a complaint under the Clergy Discipline Measure (CDM). They also said the complaint had been investigated by police, who took no further action, and that support had been offered to the woman.A second complaint was made shortly after the first complaint, according to the C of E. The spokesperson said the second complainant did not bring a CDM complaint within the one-year deadline. The individual later applied for permission to bring it after the deadline, which was supported by the archbishop of York, but was refused by an independent judge, the deputy president of tribunals.“The information brought by the second complainant was explored and assessed not to be a safeguarding matter but a matter of alleged misconduct. Pastoral support has been provided throughout for the second complainant and is ongoing,” the C of E spokesperson said.The archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, Welby’s temporary stand-in, has also faced calls to stand down after allegations emerged that a priest at the centre of a sexual abuse case was twice reappointed under him while he was serving as bishop of Chelmsford.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolChristianityReligionnewsShareReuse this content"

It also instructs the Department of Justice to investigate pro-Hamas graffiti and intimidation, including incidents on college campuses.The order appears to target students and other activists who engaged in pro-Palestinian demonstrations following the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent Israeli war in Gaza.Republicans have been threatening for months to punish colleges that allow pro-Palestinian protests. In October of last year, top Republicans warned that they wouldpull billions of dollarsof federal funding from several of the most prestigious universities in the US, and strip them of official accreditation, to punish them for “allowing” the protests.Last week, Trump proposed to “just clean out” the whole Gaza strip of Palestinians by moving them to other countries. His comments sparked immediate condemnation and accusations that he was essentially calling for ethnic cleansing.During his campaign for president, Trump vowed to deport “pro-Hamas” students who are here on visas. On his first day in office, he signed anexecutive orderthat said: “The US must ensure that admitted aliens and aliens otherwise already present in the US do not bear hostile attitudes toward its citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationDonald TrumpAntisemitismIsrael-Gaza warUS politicsPalestinian territoriesnewsShareReuse this content"

Some victims were ready to take the witness stand, while others submitted pre-recorded testimony, describing pain made all the more fresh by the recent destruction in Los Angeles.But soon after the trial began on Wednesday morning, lawyers met in private with the judge, who later announced in court that a deal had been reached.Lawyers are not expected to immediately file documents detailing the agreement.Hawaii governor Josh Green announced the $4 bn settlement about a year after the deadliest US wildfire in a century devastated Lahaina in 2023. At the time, he touted the speed of the deal to “avoid protracted and painful lawsuits”.Defendants blamed for the blaze, including the state, power utility Hawaiian Electric and large landowners, had already agreed to the settlement amount.The trial had been planned to determine how much money various groups of plaintiffs might receive, including some who filed individual lawsuits after losing their relatives, homes or businesses, and other victims covered by class-action lawsuits, including tourists who simply had to cancel trips to Maui following the inferno.Kevin Baclig had been expected to testify. His wife, father-in-law, mother-in-law and brother-in-law were among the 102 people known to have died.Baclig said in a declaration that if called to testify he would describe how for three agonizing days he searched for them – from hotel to hotel, shelter to shelter.“I clung to the fragile hope that maybe they had made it off the island, that they were safe,” he said.A month and a half went by and the grim reality set in. He went to the Philippines to gather DNA samples from his wife’s close relatives there. The samples matched remains found in the fire. He eventually carried urns holding their remains back to the Philippines.“The loss has left me in profound, unrelenting pain,” he said. “There are no words to describe the emptiness I feel or the weight I carry every day.”The class action includes some people who lost homes and businesses, but also tourists whose trips were delayed or canceled. Only a nominal portion of the settlement should go toward that group, said Jacob Lowenthal, one of the attorneys representing victims – such as Baclig – who have filed their own lawsuits, known as the “individual plaintiffs”.“The categories of losses that the class is claiming are just grossly insignificant compared to our losses,” Lowenthal said.In their trial brief, attorneys representing the class challenged the idea that everyone who has a claim worth suing over had already done so. Many people held off hiring attorneys, the brief said, because of the fire’s disruption to life, “distrust in heavy attorney advertising, and a desire to see how the process plays out first”.Further complicating the matter were questions before the state supreme court, which was considering whether insurers can separately sue the defendants for reimbursement for the $2 bn-plus they have paid out as a result of the fire, or whether their share must come from the $4 bn settlement.Explore more on these topicsHawaiiWildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

The benchmark interest rate now sits at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.Red line chart that has risen and from a flat baseline and is holding steadyJerome Powell, the Fed chair, declined to provide “any response or comment whatsoever” on the president’s public demands for lower rates. “The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have, focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals,” he said in a press conference on Wednesday.While the Fed has beencutting rates since the fall, its latest decision amounts to the first time it has not reduced them since September.The Fed uses interest rates to balance price increases and stability in the labor market. During the pandemic, interest rates were at near-zero levels, making it cheaper for Americans to borrow money for payments such as mortgages, car loans and other types of debt.But a host of economic influences – supply chain issues, federal stimulus and high consumer spending, for example – drove inflation up to 9.1%, its highest level in a generation, in the summer of 2022.Since then, the Fed has been in a long fight to tamp down price increases. Interest rates sat at approximately 5.3% for a year and a half – the highest interest rates in over a decade – before the Fed started its cutting campaign in September.Even though inflation has gone down since that time, it has remained stubbornly above the Fed’s target rate of 2%. In December, inflation was at 2.9%, a slight uptick compared with November. Meanwhile, the jobs market showed an unexpected surge of growth last month, with more than 250,000 jobs added to the economy. The unemployment rate has remained at relatively low levels, about 4%.Fed fears Trump policies could hinder effort to cut US inflation, minutes showRead moreThe start of Trump’s second term has cast a shadow of uncertainty over the US economy, particularly as the White Housepreparesto levy tariffs over Mexico and Canada, two key trading partners of the US. Trump said that the two countries could be subject to a 25% tariff as soon as 1 February. Trump has alsothreateneda 10% tariff on China, and said he was weighing a levy on imports from the European Union.While Trump has pledged to “rapidly” bring down consumer prices, economists have warned that his tariff plans could increase consumer prices in the US, as companies hit with tariffs often pass on the impact to their customers.On Wednesday, Powell said Fed policymakers would be “watching carefully” as theTrump administrationfleshed out new policies, to gauge their impact on the economy. This was “no different” to how the central bank has handled other new administrations, he added.Though the Fed has historically maintained bipartisan separation from the White House, Trump has claimed he understands interest rates better than the central bank’s officials, potentially teeing up conflict between him and the central bank.“I think I know interest rates much better than they do, and I think I know it certainly much better than the one who’s primarily in charge of making the decision,” Trumptoldreporters last week.Powell, has taken pains to remain politically neutral when questioned about potential hostility from the White House. When asked in November whether he would resign if Trump asked him to, Powellreplied witha blunt “no” and said that Trump demoting Fed officials from their governorships was not “permitted under the law”.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveTrump administrationDonald TrumpUS unemployment and employment dataUS economyUS politicsJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Wall Street had expected $3.11 a share from revenue of $68.9bn.Shares in the company, worth a total of $3.28tn, are up roughly 8% over the past 12 months as it has poured capital investment into AI and plans $80bn on new AI spending this year.Metahas made similar commitments; US tech giants are rushing to gain an edge over their competitors in the AI race.What is DeepSeek and why did US tech stocks fall?Read more“We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer ofMicrosoft. “Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13bn, up 175% year-over-year.”Amy Hood, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, said revenue from its data cloud business was $40.9bn, up 21% year-over-year. “We remain committed to balancing operational discipline with continued investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure,” Hood said.The company’s earnings report comes in the shadow of a sell-off in AI-exposed companies on Monday when a Chinese company,DeepSeek, said its AI model had achieved similar results to those of US companies at a fraction of the cost. Chipmaker Nvidia lost some $600bn in market capitalization, though it recovered part of that value in the ensuing days of trading.The implications of DeepSeek’s apparent AI cost breakthrough – it claims to have spent mere millions training its model – raises questions over the past year’s $5tn AI-related run-up in the overall market value of the tech giants known as the “magnificent seven” on Wall Street: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Tesla. The gains accounted for much of the S&P 500’s roughly 70% advance over that period, which has slowed as concerns that returns on AI-capital spending, estimated at more than $200bn over the past year with more scheduled for this year, are still elusive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He called Microsoft “the undisputed AI leader on the software side” and “a stable bet” for investors looking to cash in on AI.Microsoft and AI partner OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to DeepSeek, according toBloomberg. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, toldFox Newsthat it was “possible” that DeepSeek had stolen intellectual property from the United States.In an earnings call after the company results were released, Nadella said DeepSeek had shown “real innovations” and what was taking place was no different in optimization and improvements to AI than in regular computing.“For a hyperscaler like us, this is all good news,” he told investors.The Microsoft CEO was also asked about the Stargate Project, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank that did not include Microsoft, OpenAI’s top investor, announced by Trump last week. He pushed back on a suggestion that Microsoft would now be taking a backseat: “We remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI.”The day before, OpenAI’s Sam Altman hadposted a picturewith Nadella, suggesting the alliance between his company and Microsoft was still strong. Altman wrote that the “next phase” of the partnership was “gonna be much better than anyone is ready for”.Explore more on these topicsTechnologyMicrosoftQuarterly resultsComputingnewsShareReuse this content"

The threatened duties are separate from the broad review of US tariffs, trade deals and other trade policy ordered by Trump when he took office last week.“So this is a separate tariff to create action from Mexico and action from Canada,” Lutnick said of the 25% duty threat. “And as far as I know, they are acting swiftly, and if they execute it, there will be no tariff.”Lutnick repeatedly called for a restoration of “reciprocity” on trade with other countries, which is in line with Trump’s vow to erect a universal tariff of 10% on all US imports. He also said he wanted to improve US access to Canada’s largely closed dairy market.“My way of thinking, and I discussed this with the president, is country by country, macro,” Lutnick told the US Senate confirmation hearing when asked his preference for how Trump should impose tariffs.“We are treated horribly by the global trading environment. They all have higher tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers and subsidies,” Lutnick said. “They treat us poorly. We need to be treated better. We need to be treated with respect, and we can use tariffs to create reciprocity, fairness and respect.”Lutnick’s comments echoed those made by Trump, who last week said the European Union was “very, very bad to us” and called tariffs “the only way … you’re going to get fairness”.Following the US financial market reaction to the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek’s powerful, low-cost generative AI model, members of the Senate commerce, science and transportation committee repeatedly asked Lutnick how he would maintain US AI leadership.Lutnick said DeepSeek had misappropriated US technology to create a “dirt cheap” AI model and vowed to impose new restrictions on Beijing’s technology access.“They stole things. They broke in. They’ve taken our IP,” Lutnick said ofChina. “It’s got to end, and I’m going to be rigorous in our pursuit of restrictions and enforcing those restrictions to keep us in the lead, because we must stay in the lead.”Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS SenateUS politicsCanadaMexicoChinaAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

The company also said it would end a program that helped it carry more products from Black- and minority-owned businesses, among other changes.Twin CitiesPridethanked supporters on Instagram, saying in a post that donations would help fund initiatives like Rainbow Wardrobe, which provides a space for people to try on clothing that fits with their gender identity, and its artist-in-residence program.“Every dollar donated goes directly back into helping us create inclusive spaces, support local artists and provide resources that make a difference year-round,” the organizationsaid. “Thank you for standing with us.”Trump signs executive order to curtail gender transition for people under 19Read moreDays earlier, Twin Cities Pride had said that organizers were “deeply disappointed in [Target’s] announcement” and that the company would not have a presence at this year’s festival or parade. Target, which is based in Minneapolis, has been a sponsor of the Pride parade for 18 years.While the organization knew that dropping Target as a sponsor would affect its finances, “what is more important is that we send the message that companies need to do the right thing”, Andi Otto, executive director of Twin Cities Pride,toldthe Minneapolis Star Tribune.In amemoto employees on Friday, Target said that it was transitioning into the “next chapter of our strategy”.“As a retailer that serves millions of consumers every day, we understand the importance of staying in step with the evolving external landscape, now and in the future,” the memo said. Target did not respond to a request for comment.Though Target joined a growing list of companies that said they were dropping their DEI policies, including Meta, Walmart, Amazon and McDonald’s, the company’s announcement has garnered backlash online that other companies have not received.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines USFree newsletterGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Former government ethics officials and presidential experts said the venture amounted to a “shameful” conflict, as Trump had pledged to transform the US into the crypto capital of the world.Trump Media has struggled to build a social network that comes anywhere close to that created by Facebook and Instagram, owned by Meta Platforms; or X, owned by Elon Musk. But its status as a “meme stock” has helped it raise tens of millions since it went public on the stock market last year.The firm, which is majority-owned by Trump, plans to roll out “multiple investment vehicles” under its Truth.Fi brand this year, according to Wednesday’s announcement.“Truth.Fi is a natural expansion of the Truth Social movement,” claimed Devin Nunes, CEO of Trump Media. “We began by creating a free-speech social media platform, added an ultra-fast TV streaming service, and now we’re moving into investment products and decentralized finance.“Developing American First investment vehicles is another step toward our goal of creating a robust ecosystem through which American patriots can protect themselves from the ever-present threat of cancellation, censorship, debanking, and privacy violations committed by big tech and woke corporations.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpCryptocurrenciesnewsShareReuse this content"

Demand for ad space was robust this year, said Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, with ad space selling out in November and a waitlist for marketers ready to take the space of anyone who pulled out.The high demand seems to have pushed prices to a record, with a few ad spots reportedly selling for $8m-plus for 30 seconds. Fox declined to comment on the specific price tag for 30 seconds, which can vary depending on placement and other factors. But in an earnings call in November, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said ad space had sold out at “record pricing.” Last year, a 30-second spot went for around a reported $7m.The Super Bowl is a hot ticket for advertisers in the US because it is one of the few live television events that can still consistently draw in huge audiences. Last year, an estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned into the game in the US, according to Nielsen. The relationship between the Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift has helped increase interest in the game among non-sports fans.Evans said the mix of ad categories for the most part includes the usual suspects: drinks, snacks and tech companies. There will be an increased focus on AI, he said, and slightly more pharmaceutical companies advertising this year.One category that looks to be down is movie trailers and streaming services. Another traditionally big category for the Super Bowl, car companies, are mainly sitting it out after a tough year in the sector, with only Jeep and Ram having announced an appearance.The California wildfires in January made the lead up to the game less predictable than usual. State Farm insurance pulled out of its planned advertising to focus on the fires. And some other advertisers faced production delays. But Evans said accommodations were made wherever possible.“These are unique circumstances ... So we’re being as accommodating as possible to try to make sure that everybody can get done what they need to get done,” he said. “But more importantly, you know, don’t put themselves or anybody else in harm’s way because of it.”Advertisers are expected to begin releasing their ads in the days before the game. One of the first ads to debut was for Budweiser – which won’t air nationally but will air in some regional markets – featuring a Clydesdale foal that helps make a beer delivery. Another Anheuser-Busch brand, Michelob Ultra, also released its ad, which showsWillem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara as pickleball hustlers.Teasers have abounded this year, including one from Hellmann’s that hints at a reunion between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s characters in When Harry Met Sally, an Uber Eats teaser starring Charli XCX and Martha Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt touting Meta’s Smart Glasses.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLAdvertisingUS television industryTelevision industryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Fail to win here and ignominy belonged to them, aChampions Leagueexit at the first hurdle. The longest league table in football history would not lie. And yet Pep Guardiola’s team waited for one all the same, ­sleepwalking towards disaster.When the half-time whistle went, they were second best toClub Bruggeand behind to Raphael Onyedika’s well-taken goal on 45 minutes. It was not just City’s accountants that shifted uncomfortably. Everything was on the line for everybody – Guardiola, the players, the fans. It was sporting pride, reputations, the lot.Dembélé’s hat-trick sends PSG soaring into playoffs and Stuttgart crashing outRead moreRelief was the overriding emotion when City turned up for the second half. On the evidence of this and plenty of other performances since the end of October, a repeat ofthe landmark 2023 triumphis a long way away. There are just too many imperfections about City at present, too many key players below their best. All that mattered, though, was progress into the playoff round.City just seemed to mean it more after half-time. There was greater energy, the home support also roused themselves and once in front, Josko Gvardiol forcing Joel Ordóñez into an own goal, it felt like a done deal.Brugge had refused to fold after Mateo Kovacic’s equaliser and there was the moment when Guardiola lost his cool at the officials to incur a booking. He had argued for an offside against Brugge that did eventually come, although it looked like an incorrect call.Quick GuideChampions League: potential playoffs and last 16 gamesShowThe Champions League's inaugural 'league phase' is now complete, with the top eight sides –Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atlético, Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa– going straight to the last 16. The teams who finished between 9th and 24th have been matched in seeded and unseeded pairs, to be allocated into playoff ties in Friday's draw (11am GMT).To give an example, Celtic (21st) and Manchester City (22nd) will face Real Madrid (11th) or Bayern Munich (12th), with the winners advancing to play either Atlético (seeded fifth) or Leverkusen (6th). So the draw could potentially put Celtic v Real Madrid on one side, and Manchester City v Bayern on the other.The playoffs will take place on 11-12 and 18-19 February, before a further draw on 21 February decides who the playoff winners will face in the last 16. So, if Real Madrid and Bayern Munich advance, they will be drawn to play either Atlético or Leverkusen. Teams from the same country can be paired together at any point.Playoff ties and last-16 opponents(17) Monaco or (18) Brest v (15) PSG or (16) Benfica- Winner will face(1)Liverpoolor(2) Barcelonain last 16(23) Sporting or (24) Brugge v (9) Atalanta or (10) Dortmund- Winner will face(7) Lilleor(8) Aston Villain last 16(21) Celtic or (22) Man City v (11) Real Madrid or (12) Bayern- Winner will face(5) Atléticoor(6) Leverkusenin last 16(19) Feyenoord or (20) Juventus v (13) Milan or (14) PSV- Winner will face(3) Arsenalor(4) Interin last 16(18) Brest or (17) Monaco v (16) Benfica or (15) PSG- Winner will face(2) Barcelonaor(1) Liverpoolin last 16(24) Brugge or Sporting (23) v (10) Dortmund or (9) Atalanta- Winner will face(8) Aston Villaor(7) Lillein last 16(22) Man City or (21) Celtic v (12) Bayern or (11) Real Madrid- Winner will face(6) Leverkusenor(5) Atléticoin last 16(20) Juventus or (19) Feyenoord v (14) PSV or (13) Milan- Winner will face(4) InterorArsenal (3)in last 16Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Guardiola could relax a little bit after the own goal, the home crowd could revert to merely taking it all in and even though Brugge did not allow their heads to drop, it was over when Savinho, who made the difference as a half-time substitute, added the third.City’s reward was dubious – a tie against Real Madrid or Bayern Munich – but that is the price to pay for a flawed campaign. The losses at Sporting and Juventus hurt, ditto the oneat Paris Saint-Germain last Wednesday, but the real killer was surely the three-goal surrender for3-3 at home to Feyenoord.The hard-to-ignore subplot here was the home fans. They were so quiet in the early exchanges, plainly underwhelmed by the pre-match show, and they remained that way throughout the first half. Those that had travelled from Brugge cut through the silence. They were determined to make themselves heard – it was not hard – and they were in dreamland by the interval.View image in fullscreenRaphael Onyedika fires past Ederson to put Club Brugge ahead.Photograph: Martin Rickett/PAThey were happy at how their team had kept City at arm’s length. But it got even better when they moved forward on the counterattack to set up the unthinkable. It was not a surprise because if City looked laboured, Brugge had advertised their ability to make inroads up the left. Before the breakthrough, the all-action Christos Tzolis had seen a shot blocked by Manuel Ajanki.Guardiola persisted with Matheus Nunes at right-back and he was beaten so easily by Ferran Jutglà; a simple stop-and-go move and a shake of the hips all it took. Brugge had broken initially through their captain, Hans Vanaken, and when Jutglà crossed low, Onyedika applied the first-time finish.Brugge were always going to make things difficult, to be as compact as possible without the ball. But it was clear from the early running that they could ask questions on the counter, Tzolis enjoying plenty of space on the left. There was a moment at the outset when Akanji and Nunes went for the same aerial ball and missed it. When Tzolis hared away to cross, Gvardiol blocked to keep out Chemsdine Talbi.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Ilkay Gündogan had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside. Erling Haaland headed square to nobody rather than aim at goal. Kevin De Bruyne lashed one high. The tempo was slow, the movements predictable; a lot of side-to-side stuff, few searching passes.Guardiola tweaked his approach for the second half, introducing Savinho for Gündogan – in other words, a bit more pace – and City were soon level. John Stones had missed a gilt-edged header when Kovacic picked up the ball on halfway, dribbled up the middle and kept going. Brugge’s collective sin was to back off. When Kovacic reached the edge of the area, he threaded a low shot into the bottom corner.View image in fullscreenMateo Kovacic equalises for Manchester City.Photograph: Adam Vaughan/EPAIf that was a soft concession, then worse was to come for Brugge. They had threatened at the other end, continuing to get runners in, not least when Tzolis surged through, ignoring the offside cries and Vanaken was thwarted by Ederson. That was when Guardiola talked his way to the yellow card. Twice more Tzolis went close but City were in front when Savinho played in Gvardiol and his low cross led to Ordóñez’s misfortune.Guardiola was a snapshot in anguish when Haaland was denied by Simon Mignolet and Brandon Mechele cleared Savinho’s rebound off the line. The manager could exhale when Savinho took a touch on his chest following Stones’s diagonal pass to crash his shot inside the near post.PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool812212Barcelona815193Arsenal813194Inter Milan810195Atletico Madrid88186Bayer Leverkusen88167Lille87168Aston Villa87169Atalanta8141510Borussia Dortmund8101511Real Madrid881512Bayern Munich881513AC Milan831514PSV841415PSG851316Benfica841317Monaco801318Brest8-11319Feyenoord8-31320Juventus821221Celtic8-11222Man City841123Sporting811124Club Brugge8-41125Dinamo Zagreb8-71126Stuttgart8-41027Shakhtar Donetsk8-8728Bologna8-5629Red Star Belgrade8-9630Sturm Graz8-9631Sparta Prague8-14432RB Leipzig8-7333Girona8-8334Red Bull Salzburg8-22335Slovan Bratislava8-20036Young Boys8-210Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueManchester CityClub Bruggematch reportsShareReuse this content"

They remain formidable teamsDoug FarrarWed 29 Jan 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 10.18 ESTShareThis year’s Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles will be the second time the teams have faced each other for the championship in three seasons:the Chiefs came out on top, 38-35,in Super Bowl LVII at the end of the 2022 season.This season’s Chiefs and Eagles show how much one franchise can change over time, while another can roll with the “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” philosophy. The Eagles have been all about the differences, while the Chiefs, quite understandably given their success, have been more about stability.Here’s how the two teams stack up, then and now. Where are they better, and where are they worse?View image in fullscreenNick Sirianni has some trusted assistants on staff.Photograph: Matt Slocum/APCoachingEagles:Back in the 2022 season, Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni had Shane Steichen as his offensive coordinator, and Jonathan Gannon running the defense. That worked well enough that Sirianni had to deal with some serious brain-drain. The Indianapolis Colts hired Steichen to be their head coach after the season, and the Arizona Cardinals gave Gannon the same opportunity.Last season was a bit of a struggle with OC Brian Johnson and DC Sean Desai, but after the Eagles plummeted as quickly as Monty Python’s dead parrot in the second half of the campaign, general manager Howie Roseman made two very astute hires with Kellen Moore in charge of the offense, and Vic Fangio controlling the defense. Moore has done a good job, led as he is by running back Saquon Barkley and an offensive line coached brilliantly by Jeff Stoutland. But, as is the case for the Chiefs, the Eagles are defined by their defense as much as anything else. Fangio, whose systems have taken over the league in recent years, turned that defense around quickly and decisively.Verdict: Better thanSuper BowlLVII.The refs didn’t steal a Super Bowl trip from the Bills. The Chiefs’ excellence didRead moreChiefs:Things are pretty much the same for head coach Andy Reid here. He still has Matt Nagy as his offensive coordinator, Steve Spagnuolo as his defensive coordinator, and the legendary Dave Toub in charge of special teams. Where things have improved is that Nagy has learned to do more with less from a personnel perspective, as the focus over the last few years from general manager Brett Veach has been building a defense that is now young, nasty, and out to dominate. It’s really Spagnuolo’s elevation as one of the greatest defensive minds of his – or any – era that gives this group a serious bump.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.View image in fullscreenJalen Hurts had one of his best games of the season in the NFC championship game.Photograph: Laurence Kesterson/UPI/REX/ShutterstockQuarterbacksEagles:Back in the 2022 season when Steichen was running the Eagles’ offense, Jalen Hurts was the perfect pointman to balance the run and pass game both as a pure thrower of the ball, and as a true running threat at any time. Hurts was a borderline MVP candidate, but over the last two seasons, his development has been delayed by his own failings.He’s a tremendous athlete and a good pure quarterback, but there were far too many instances this season in which he was late to pull the trigger on throws he should have made. Moore has directed Hurts to be a “safe” quarterback who is better off taking a sack or throwing the ball away than making risky throws. When you have a dominant run game and an outstanding defense you can win that way, but it doesn’t leave much margin for error.Verdict: Worse than Super Bowl LVII.Chiefs:2021 was Patrick Mahomes’ last season with Tyreek Hill before the explosive receiver was traded to the Miami Dolphins. Mahomes hasn’t had that kind of threat since, but in the 2022 season, he still managed to throw for a career-high 5,955 yards, and the same 48 touchdown passes he had amassed the year before (including the playoffs). Travis Kelce was Mahomes’ primary target then as he is now, and the Chiefs did the best they could with an amalgam of second-tier targets behind him. And that’s pretty much the way things are now. Kelce is three years older, and the attrition of the game shows up in his lack of downfield speed, but he and Mahomes still have chemistry that rivals any in pro football history.The difference is that Kansas City’s passing game is much more horizontal than it was in 2022. In that season, Mahomes completed 31 of 70 passes of 20 or more air yards for 985 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 110.1, This season, he’s completed just 13 of 51 deep passes for 465 yards, four touchdowns, four interceptions, a passer rating of 58.5, and the NFL’s worst deep completion percentage of 25.5% among qualified quarterbacks.Verdict: Worse than Super Bowl LVII.View image in fullscreenXavier Worthy has given the Chiefs a much needed injection of speed.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APOffenseEagles:Philosophically, the Eagles aren’t that different offensively than they were in the 2022 season. The offensive coordinators call the plays, but from a conceptual standpoint, Sirianni calls the shots. The Eagles were, and are, a team led by 11 personnel (one running back, one tight end, and three receivers), with about a 30% sprinkling in 12 personnel, which takes one receiver off the field in favor of a second tight end. Sirianni likes a lot of no-huddle, a lot of shotgun, and a considerable number of run-pass options. He’s not a fan of pre-snap motion, but he’s bent to that a bit because Kellen likes it; the Eagles have risen from 31st to 23rd in pre-snap motion since 2022.The obvious difference is the acquisition of Barkley, which has turned the Eagles from a team equally dependent on the run and the pass, with Hurts as the bridge, to a team that thinks about the run game first, and fills things in with the aerial game. The Eagles have by far the NFL’s most rushing attempts this season with 659 (the Baltimore Ravens rank second with 584), and under Stoutland’s mentorship, there isn’t a blocking scheme Philly can’t use to dominate opposing defenses. Hurts’ regression is real, but Barkley makes this offense better as a pure force multiplier.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.Chiefs:Kansas City’s reliance on multiple tight ends sets may surprise people who think of the Chiefs’ offense as one that loves to spread things out in the passing game, but we’ve already discussed the horizontal nature of that. Then and now, in the pass and run games, the Chiefs will put two and three tight ends on the field as much, or more than, any other team. Kansas City ran two or three tight ends on 38% of their snaps in 2022, and they were top-four in success rate when they did. They’ve done so 45% of the time in the 2024 season, and they’re still top 10 in success rate. Rookie receiver Xavier Worthy, who set the all-time 40-yard dash at the scouting combine with a 4.21-second run, is coming on as a major part of the passing game. That development has added a downfield threat to the passing game, and not a moment too soon. The Chiefs don’t lead with their run game, but they’re highly effective with pre-snap motion and all kinds of misdirection. Kareem Hunt, who is in his second stint with the team, is the leader of that run game, though the specter of Mahomes as a rusher always has defenses on edge.From a blocking perspective, the Chiefs may have the NFL’s best interior line with guards Joe Thuney and Trey Smith, and center Creed Humphrey. But the tackle positions are a problem to the point where Thuney has had to kick out from his left guard position to sub in at tackle. That could be a serious issue against the Eagles’ array of pass-rushers, and Jawaan Taylor at right tackle doesn’t offer much more protection.Verdict: Worse than Super Bowl LVII.View image in fullscreenZack Baun has been transformed into an All-Pro since he joined the Eagles.Photograph: Derik Hamilton/APDefenseEagles:Fangio is generally thought of as the game’s master of Quarters or Cover-4 coverage, in which four defensive backs (usually two cornerbacks and two safeties) each patrol a quarter of the field, hence the name. But Fangio is more malleable than that. When he was the Denver Broncos’ head coach from 2019-2021, and he had personnel better-suited to man coverage, he adjusted accordingly. Now, Fangio calls more Cover-1 and Cover-3 than Cover-4, though the Eagles’ rate of Cover-6 (Cover-2 to one side of the field, Cover-4 to the other) leads the NFL at 16.6%.Fangio doesn’t blitz a lot, and the Eagles generally run four-man fronts with nickel defenses behind them. Gannon was more a fan of five-man base fronts, where five defensive lineman clogged as many gaps as possible. Fangio is multiple in both his fronts and coverages with all kinds of little subtleties, from stunts and overload fronts to disguised coverages that morph from pre- to post-snap. Fangio will generally counter run plays with light boxes, and while many of his acolytes have issues stopping the run with lighter boxes, it’s not been an issue for the Eagles this season.Like Spagnuolo, the Chiefs’ defensive coordinator, Fangio is a master at matching schemes to personnel, and he’s brilliant at bringing the most out of his players, whether they’re first-round picks like Jalen Carter and Quinyon Mitchell, or supposed role players like former New Orleans Saints rotational linebacker and special teams player Zack Baun, who Fangio saw as a potentially outstanding pass-rusher and off-ball linebacker. Baun responded with an All-Pro season.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.Chiefs:2022 was the season the Chiefs decided to get younger and better on defense, and thatcalculated strategy has paid dividends. Veach and Spagnuolo work in close concert to staff a roster that has become as press-heavy and opportunistic as any in the league. The blitz is even more of a Spagnuolo staple now than it was in 2022 – then, the Chiefs blitzed on 24% of their snaps. This season, that’s risen to 30%.Spagnuolo does not present a defined coverage type. This season, the Chiefs have played at least 16.7% of their snaps in each of four concepts: Cover-1, Cover-2, Cover-3, and Cover-4. Spagnuolo dialed up a bit more two-high safety stuff (Cover-2 and Cover-4) in the 2022 season, but he really wants to blur the picture for opposing quarterbacks with all kinds of different pressure and coverage concepts. As much as pre-snap motion is a major part of Kansas City’s offense, Spags believes in it just as much. His ability to do so many different things with so many young players is a testament to his coaching brilliance, but it’s also about the attributes the Chiefs require at every defensive position.At last year’s Super Bowl, Spagnuolo told me that his Chiefs defense that season was the smartest he’d ever had in his coaching career, which goes back to 1981. This year’s is just as good.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.View image in fullscreenHarrison Butker is one of the most reliable kickers in the league.Photograph: Charlie Riedel/APSpecial teamsEagles:A former linebacker at Oregon and (for a brief minute) with the Miami Dolphins, Eagles special teams coordinator Michael Clay took that position before the 2021 season. In 2023, Philly ranked first overall in Special Teams DVOA,dropping to 14thin 2024. Jake Elliott was the kicker in 2022 as he is now, and his 2022 season was far splashier. Then, he had a field goal percentage of 87.0% compared to 2024’s 77.8%, and in 2022, he led the NFL in extra points made (51) and attempted (53). There has been an upgrade in the punting department. In 2022, Arryn Siposs averaged 38.6 net yards per punt. This season, Braden Mann has averaged 41.9. The Eagles have the same punt return average (9.2 yards per return) as they had in 2022; the 2024 kick return average of 26.5 yards per return is better than 2022’s 22.1 with Kenneth Gainwell, Will Shipley, and Isaiah Rogers as the primary instigators.Verdict: Worse than Super Bowl LVII.Chiefs:Toub was Reid’s special teams coordinator in Philadelphia from 2001-2003. From there, he went to the Chicago Bears, where he coached All-Pro kicker Robbie Gould, and Hall of Fame return man Devin Hester. Toub and Reid reunited with the Chiefs in 2013, and Reid added the assistant head coach title to Toub’s resume in 2018. Toub extracted kicker Harrison Butker from the Carolina Panthers’ practice squad in 2017, and Butker has been the team’s kicker ever since. 2022 was Butker’s worst season, as he was dealing with injuries and had a span of five straight games in which he missed either a field goal or extra point, the longest streak of his career.Butker’s politics are …interesting, but he’s been a bastion of consistency when healthy. After signing a four-year, $25.6m extension in the 2024 offseason, Butker suffered a knee injury in November, and the Chiefs cycled through three different kickers (including safety Justin Reid) while Butker recovered. Only Justin Tucker of the Baltimore Ravens hasa higher career field goal percentagethan Butker’s 88.62%. Punter Tommy Townsend, now with the Houston Texans, was a First-Team All-Pro in 2022. He’s since been replaced by Matt Araiza. Mecole Hardman has been Kansas City’s steadfast return man, but in 2024, rookie Nikko Remigio has shown some flashes.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.OverallEagles:Barkley and Fangio, along with Roseman’s brilliant acquisition strategies, make the Eagles more formidable than they were in the 2022 campaign, regardless of which Hurts shows up. If the good Hurts is on the field, this is the NFL’s toughest team to beat.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.Chiefs:Spagnuolo’s defense is better than the last time it faced the Eagles in the Super Bowl, and while the offense isn’t what it was – especially in the deep passing game – Reid’s Bill Belichick-like adherence to every player doing his job perfectly to win close games is the secret sauce.Verdict: Better than Super Bowl LVII.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlPhiladelphia EaglesKansas City ChiefsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Bronny had looked like he had been coming into some form: he played 15 minutes for the Lakers just four days after he dropped a career-high 31 points for the South Bay Lakers of the G League.Is Bryce James good enough to follow his father and brother into the NBA?Read more“Maybe put him in a tough spot, flying out yesterday, nationally televised game and all that stuff,” Lakers coach JJ Redick said. “He didn’t play well. But he’s been playing great in the stay-ready games and he’s been playing great in the G. I have confidence but obviously didn’t provide that at a high level.”His father and teammate knows Bronny still has plenty to learn in the NBA. “He was able to get behind the defense on one and find Jaxson [Hayes] for a dunk. That was good,”LeBron Jamessaid. “Obviously missed his shots. It’s just about him just getting more and more comfortable. It’s his first extensive minutes with us. We had that first game where it was just a moment, and it was a great moment, but tonight was his first opportunity to be with the big guys, the big club. He’s going to continue to use that to get better and better, just like the first time he played with the G League.”LeBron and Bronny madeNBAhistory on 22 October when they became the first father and son to play together, during the Lakers’ season-opening win over Minnesota. Bronny then scored his first NBA basket for the Lakers in Cleveland on 30 October at the arena where he watched his father as a child.Bronny had not played more than six minutes in any of his first 12 games and had scored four points all season. “Just bringing energy. My coaches are telling me to come in and play smart, play my game and play for my teammates,” he said. “Just trying to do the right thing as a rookie is my main priority.”LeBron and the Lakers have already said Bronny will spend ample time this season with their G League affiliate as he works on his game. “Just reps is the biggest thing for me,” Bronny said.LeBron had 31 points, nine assists and eight rebounds, though father and son did share one other distinction against the 76ers: Adem Bona blocked them both.The Lakers had been 16-2 this season against teams with losing records and seemed poised to build on the win column playing a 76ers team without injured stars Joel Embiid and Paul George. Maxey carried the scoring load with 43 points and the Lakers were hampered when Anthony Davis left in the first half with an abdominal muscle strain.“I mean, when our best player goes out, it’s always challenging,” LeBron said. “When AD goes down, when any one of our guys go down throughout the course of the game, it’s just tough.”Without Davis, it was a rough game for the Lakers, who had a four-game winning streak snapped. “Three in four nights, back-to-back, I’m not sure where our collective brains were at,” Redick said.Explore more on these topicsLos Angeles LakersLeBron JamesNBABasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

Two days later Rashford said he wanted a “new challenge” and since then he has been in only one match-day squad, for the 2-0 defeat against Newcastle at Old Trafford on 30 December.Amorim and Rashford no longer on speaking terms at Manchester UnitedRead moreThe pair’s relationship has since deteriorated further. Amorim said on Sunday – after his side’s 1-0 victory at Fulham – that he would rathername his 63-year-old goalkeeper coach, Jorge Vital, than Rashford on United’s benchbecause of the 27‑year‑old forward’s application in training. It then emerged that the pair areno longer on speaking terms.With the transfer window closing on Monday, Rashford’s hopes of a move are in the balance. The player’s wish is to join Barcelona on loan but the La Liga club face financial challenges which make a deal unlikely.Given that, Amorim was asked before United’s final Europa League group game against FCSB on Thursdayif there is a way back for Rashford at United should he end up staying at the club. “You can look at our team and imagine the profile of the players. Now imagine a talent like Rashford? Our team should be so much better with Rashford. But he has to change,” the Portuguese said. “If he changes, we are more than welcome to put in a talent like Rashford. And we need it.“We have to set some standards, that’s all. We are waiting for Marcus, if he wants it really, really bad. You try to make it personal but it’s not personal. I have nothing against Marcus. I just have to make the same rules for everybody. For me it’s so simple. It’s always the same answer.“I promised you I would not give anything aboutMarcus Rashford, but I’m giving you a little bit. It’s the same thing. We need goals. We need one-against-one. We need a threat in the final third. What more do you need?”Amorim was asked if he would consider ordering Rashford to train away from the main group. “I already spoke about Marcus,” the 40-year-old manager said. “Anything I give you tomorrow will be a subject. It’s the same thing for every player. There’s some players who don’t play. Casemiro doesn’t play, maybe he’s selected. Rashford is not selected but that is my choice.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Which major 2025 election is being fought over by several presidents, a vice-president, a prince, a lord, and a politician from Zimbabwe? And, for good measure, could be won for the first time by someone from Britain?The answer can be found in Lausanne, where the seven candidates hoping to become the next president of theInternational Olympic Committee(IOC) have gathered to make their one and only direct pitch – via a 15-minute PowerPoint presentation – for the biggest job in global sport.Inside the race for the biggest job in sport – can Sebastian Coe win the IOC presidency? | Sean IngleRead moreIt is also a position that carries significant diplomatic sway. When the current president, Thomas Bach, was elected in 2013, one of the first calls he received was from Vladimir Putin. The IOC was also instrumental in the brief rapprochement between North and South Korea in 2018, when President Trump and Kim Jong-un were trading insults.But those running – includingLord Sebastian Coe, the former double Olympic champion who brought the 2012 Games to London – face an election so secretive and strange it would make a Vatican cardinal wince. Under IOC rules, for instance, they are banned from holding debates, criticising each other’s policies, or even receiving public endorsements.However, on Thursday that process gets even more weird as the candidates will make their case to the eclectic electorate of just over 100 IOC members who will decide their fate, including European and Asian royalty and business, sporting and political leaders.“The presentations will be given in camera and will not be broadcast or webcast on the internet,” the IOC guidelines state bluntly. “Each candidate will have 15 minutes to give their presentation. At the end of their time slot, the microphone will be switched off automatically. There will be no Q&A sessions.”The rules are designed to make it a fair fight between the candidates before the election in Greece on 20 March. But they also send an unfortunate message: no transparency please, we’re the IOC.View image in fullscreenIf you become IOC president, you don’t just hand out medals.

I would prefer that we would present and the whole world would see.”Lausanne will also be important for another reason: it gives candidates the chance to press the palms of voters and get a sense of their thinking.However, the secrecy of the process makes it especially difficult to predict the outcome. Journalists, after all, cannot just bump into the Emir of Qatar or Princess Anne to ask who they will vote for. Nor can most candidates.View image in fullscreenJuan Antonio Samaranch Jr is a candidate for the presidency.

To British eyes, he is part of the establishment, having been a Conservative MP, now a lord and the head of the British Olympic Association. But in IOC terms, he is an outsider, having fallen out with Bach over World Athletics’ decision toban Russiafor state-sponsored doping.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe RecapFree weekly newsletterThe best of our sports journalism from the past seven days and a heads-up on the weekend’s actionEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The 68-year-old is also calling for clear policies to protect women’s sport and to get more young people active, arguing that “sport is the most potent social worker in our communities”.That will play well with many members, but not the Bach loyalists who are likely to gravitate towards Kirsty Coventry, the Zimbabwean sports minister who hopes to be the first woman to get the job and David Lappartient, the French president of cycling’s world body, the UCI.They both have their chances, although most analysts believe they are behind Coe and Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, the well-regarded IOC vice-president whose father ran the organisation between 1980 and 2001. He is seen as the frontrunner. The two other candidates, Morinari Watanabe, the Japanese president of international gymnastics, and Johan Eliasch, the British-Swedish president of the International Ski and Snowboard Federation, are regarded as major outsiders.View image in fullscreenZimbabwe’s Kirsty Coventry is the only female candidate.Photograph: Denis Balibouse/ReutersCoe will hope that his extensive political and commercial nous will also be an advantage given the next IOC president will have a brimming in-tray. It includes dealing with Donald Trump before the LA Olympics and handling the fallout in the anti-doping world over the23 Chinese swimmerswho were cleared after failing tests.Elsewhere there will also be pressure to bring Russia in from the sporting cold, as well as the need to renegotiate television and sponsorship deals totalling billions of dollars. In short, whoever gets the job will have to be a diplomat and dealmaker, chief executive and cheerleader, sometimes on the same day.But as his 15 minutes approaches, Coe knows he has form for delivering when it matters. In 2005, say, London was regarded as being behind Paris and Madrid in the running for the 2012 Games until the presentations were made and they pushed ahead. In Lausanne on Thursday, Coe will hope to repeat a familiar trick.Explore more on these topicsInternational Olympic CommitteeSebastian CoeSport politicsOlympic GamesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Demand for ad space was robust this year, said Mark Evans, executive vice president of ad sales for Fox Sports, with ad space selling out in November and a waitlist for marketers ready to take the space of anyone who pulled out.The high demand seems to have pushed prices to a record, with a few ad spots reportedly selling for $8m-plus for 30 seconds. Fox declined to comment on the specific price tag for 30 seconds, which can vary depending on placement and other factors. But in an earnings call in November, CEO Lachlan Murdoch said ad space had sold out at “record pricing.” Last year, a 30-second spot went for around a reported $7m.The Super Bowl is a hot ticket for advertisers in the US because it is one of the few live television events that can still consistently draw in huge audiences. Last year, an estimated 123.7 million viewers tuned into the game in the US, according to Nielsen. The relationship between the Kansas City Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift has helped increase interest in the game among non-sports fans.Evans said the mix of ad categories for the most part includes the usual suspects: drinks, snacks and tech companies. There will be an increased focus on AI, he said, and slightly more pharmaceutical companies advertising this year.One category that looks to be down is movie trailers and streaming services. Another traditionally big category for the Super Bowl, car companies, are mainly sitting it out after a tough year in the sector, with only Jeep and Ram having announced an appearance.The California wildfires in January made the lead up to the game less predictable than usual. State Farm insurance pulled out of its planned advertising to focus on the fires. And some other advertisers faced production delays. But Evans said accommodations were made wherever possible.“These are unique circumstances ... So we’re being as accommodating as possible to try to make sure that everybody can get done what they need to get done,” he said. “But more importantly, you know, don’t put themselves or anybody else in harm’s way because of it.”Advertisers are expected to begin releasing their ads in the days before the game. One of the first ads to debut was for Budweiser – which won’t air nationally but will air in some regional markets – featuring a Clydesdale foal that helps make a beer delivery. Another Anheuser-Busch brand, Michelob Ultra, also released its ad, which showsWillem Dafoe and Catherine O’Hara as pickleball hustlers.Teasers have abounded this year, including one from Hellmann’s that hints at a reunion between Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal’s characters in When Harry Met Sally, an Uber Eats teaser starring Charli XCX and Martha Stewart, and Chris Hemsworth and Chris Pratt touting Meta’s Smart Glasses.Explore more on these topicsSuper BowlNFLAdvertisingUS television industryTelevision industryUS sportsShareReuse this content"

Our six team identities resonate with that modern complexity but are visually rooted in the bold American sports landscape.”From opening day, the Boston Banshees and the New York Exiles will represent the east coast, the Bay Breakers the west, the Chicago Tempest and Twin Cities Gemini the upper midwest and Denver Onyx the mountain west.Announcing a joint branding project withMATTA, a sports-focused London firm, WER said it would offer a “high-energy, risk-taking, intense” product, “full of inspiring, fearless women athletes and fierce action that will take place on the pitch throughout the season”.This, the league said, would help it “redefine the perception of rugby in the US, challenging norms and ideals, and creating space for women to discover new role models and showcase their unique strengths”, all ahead of a women’s World Cup on US soil in 2033, two years after the men’s event.Maher is certainly a role model for American rugby fans, new and old: a social media force before she helped the US Eagleswin Olympic sevens bronzein Paris in July, her profile exploded after it via aSports Illustrated swimwear shootand asecond-place finishon ABC’s Dancing with the Stars.She is now chasing a place at this year’s 15-a-side World Cup, to be held in England in August. WER is also a 15-a-side competition, based on the amateur Women’s Premier League but aiming to fund advances in resources and performance.Maher may never play WER but last summer, Aversanotoldthe Guardian the star’s message was “resonating” throughout the US sports landscape “because regardless of who you are in women’s rugby, it’s about body inclusion. You’re strong, we want you to be as strong as possible. You’re fast, we want you to be as fast as possible. Be the most you can be.”Maher herself hasspokenof the need for more role models in women’s rugby, in the US and around the world, saying: “People call me the superstar of rugby but that’s not enough for the sport.

The multiple connections of each team identity is important because it is emblematic of the variety of people who love rugby.”In terms of team colors, the Bay Area Breakers will wear “Sunset Purple” and “Pacific and Deep Sea Blue”; the Boston Banshees will appear in appropriately spooky “Moonlight White, Ghostly Gray, Blood-Moon Red and Midnight”; Chicago will wear “Lightning Yellow and Tempest Gray”; the Denver Onyx will don the black and pink of, well, onyx, as mined in the Colorado hills; the New York Exiles will sport “Night Navy, Liberty and Shadow Teal, and Torch Orange”; and the Twin Cities Gemini will run out in “Deep Venom and Serpent Green, along with Ice Blue”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In November, Deb Henretta, a WER investor, told the Guardian: “I think this is the time for women’s sports … look atthe WNBA. Look at what Caitlin Clark has been able to do for Indiana Fever.

Morgan Rogers, fresh from completing his hat-trick in stoppage time, was among the Villa players huddled around the phone of the fitness coach Moisés Del Hoyo praying Atalanta would not find a winner in Barcelona and divert Villa’s course. Everyone was jostling for a view. With the final whistle looming here, Unai Emery was busy relaying the latest to Leon Bailey, explaining how Villa would have to settle for a playoff next month if the Serie A side scored.Just as everybody had got to grips with the small print of the permutations, au fait with others’ goal difference, Villa Park released a communal cheer and the players dispersed. Villa had secured a place in the top eight and succeeded where Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Milan and Paris Saint-Germain had failed.Nwaneri’s screamer seals turnaround at Girona as Arsenal ensure spot in last 16Read moreIt is the kind of sentence that will be on the lips of Villa supporters for the next few weeks and one that speaks volumes of the company they are keeping these days. Monchi, the sporting director, did a double-fist pump, general manager Damian Vidagany did similar as he headed down the tunnel.Celtic, meanwhile, digested the reality of facing either Real or Bayern in a fortnight, a two-leg playoff between Brendan Rodgers’s side and the last 16.Celtic stunned Villa after recovering from an early two-goal deficit to level but Ollie Watkins registered his first goal in the competition to nudge Villa in front and then missed a penalty to put the game to bed midway through the second half. Judging by the way Watkins celebrated his strike, he is here to stay. A smirking Watkins coolly jogged along the Holte End before clenching his fist and appearing to tap the crest on his chest, hours after the emergence ofa shock bid from Arsenal. Meanwhile Jhon Durán, an unused substitute, is poised to depart for the Saudi Pro League in a deal worth about £80m.Emery suggested he was powerless to prevent Durán from pursuing a fresh start, despite the obvious attraction of advancing in theChampions League. Fittingly, it was Faithless’s Insomnia which blared over the speakers as Villa’s players finished their warmup. Neither Watkins or Durán are immune to outside interest. Watkins blew kisses towards a hospitality box in the North Stand, giving a glove to a young fan before heading in. Durán, typically, was last down the tunnel, high-fiving the supporters who have loved watching his development. Durán’s preposterous winner against Bayern put them on this path.View image in fullscreenOllie Watkins (right) celebrates with Jacob Ramsey after scoring Aston Villa’s third goal in their 4-2 win against Celtic.Photograph: Tim Keeton/EPAVilla made light of what could have been a destabilising backdrop, quickly getting to work to the point the game felt as good as over inside the opening five minutes. Rogers swept home after a clinical, triangular move down the left flank that caught Alistair Johnston cold. Youri Tielemans slipped Jacob Ramsey in in the channel and Ramsey squared for Rogers, who converted from close range. Emery flung his right first towards the floor of his technical area in celebration.If it was advantage Villa after 152 seconds, then Villa were well in command with barely four minutes gone. An alert Ezri Konsa pounced on Kasper Schmeichel’s pass for Adam Idah and kickstarted an attack. Watkins took things over, locating Rogers to his right. Celtic offered Villa plenty of room and encouraged Rogers to take aim. So he did, blasting a shot that skidded off the studs of Liam Scales and flew into the top corner past Schmeichel.Quick GuideChampions League: potential playoffs and last 16 gamesShowThe Champions League's inaugural 'league phase' is now complete, with the top eight sides –Liverpool, Barcelona, Arsenal, Inter, Atlético, Leverkusen, Lille and Aston Villa– going straight to the last 16. The teams who finished between 9th and 24th have been matched in seeded and unseeded pairs, to be allocated into playoff ties in Friday's draw (11am GMT).To give an example, Celtic (21st) and Manchester City (22nd) will face Real Madrid (11th) or Bayern Munich (12th), with the winners advancing to play either Atlético (seeded fifth) or Leverkusen (6th). So the draw could potentially put Celtic v Real Madrid on one side, and Manchester City v Bayern on the other.The playoffs will take place on 11-12 and 18-19 February, before a further draw on 21 February decides who the playoff winners will face in the last 16. So, if Real Madrid and Bayern Munich advance, they will be drawn to play either Atlético or Leverkusen.

Boubacar Kamara, a makeshift centre-back amid Villa’s injury crisis, twice averted danger but Celtic had nothing to lose and would not relent.

There were nervous glances when Idah extended his right leg to hook in Greg Taylor’s cross, diverted into the former Norwich striker’s path via John McGinn, whose attempted clearance backfired. Then Villa cracked, Idah converting from the edge of the six‑yard box to cap a slick move and make a mockery of those who presumed Villa would simply swat aside the Scottish champions. Rodgers punched the air.With the hour looming, though, McGinn took matters into his own hands, shrugging off Arne Engels on halfway to spark an attack. Ramsey streamed towards goal and unselfishly squared for an unmarked Watkins to lash in. A few minutes later Watkins squandered a chance to restore Villa’s two-goal buffer after being fouled inside the box by Auston Trusty. Watkins slipped, ballooning the subsequent penalty into the Holte End to tee up a nervy finale, in which Rogers sealed victory.“I’m just proud of how we’ve performed, Scotland gets a wee bit of stick in English football, but I think you can clearly see we’ve teams that have got courage to play – we’re nowhere near the resource levels of the teams in the Premier League but we can still be competitive,” Rodgers said. “I’ve really enjoyed this format and now we’ll get ready for the next challenge.”PosTeamPGDPts1Liverpool812212Barcelona815193Arsenal813194Inter Milan810195Atletico Madrid88186Bayer Leverkusen88167Lille87168Aston Villa87169Atalanta8141510Borussia Dortmund8101511Real Madrid881512Bayern Munich881513AC Milan831514PSV841415PSG851316Benfica841317Monaco801318Brest8-11319Feyenoord8-31320Juventus821221Celtic8-11222Man City841123Sporting811124Club Brugge8-41125Dinamo Zagreb8-71126Stuttgart8-41027Shakhtar Donetsk8-8728Bologna8-5629Red Star Belgrade8-9630Sturm Graz8-9631Sparta Prague8-14432RB Leipzig8-7333Girona8-8334Red Bull Salzburg8-22335Slovan Bratislava8-20036Young Boys8-210Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAston VillaCelticmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It will take Amara Nallo much longer to recover.The 18-year-old defender was handed his Liverpool debut in the 83rd minute atPSV Eindhoven, one of several young faces to appear in the group finale as Slot returned to the Netherlands with an eye on a more important date with Bournemouth on Saturday. Four minutes later the teenager was off, a disconsolate figure after receiving a straight red card for denying Johan Bakayoko a clear goalscoring opportunity.Champions League: Leverkusen and Lille in top eight as Atalanta fall shortRead moreNallo’s misfortune was in stark contrast to impressive contributions from his fellow academy graduates James McConnell, Jayden Danns and Tyler Morton. Defeat, however, did not costLiverpooltop spot in the table courtesy of Barcelona’s draw with Atalanta. Slot’s side will face Paris Saint-Germain, Benfica, Monaco or Brest in the last 16.“It’s cruel,” the Liverpool head coach said of Nallo’s swift dismissal. “But making your debut at Champions League level is probably the hardest way. He misinterpreted the situation and that is immediately a problem at this level or in Premier League. It’s a big moment for him to learn from.“A career isn’t always positive, there are also negatives, and he has to fight very hard to make sure he plays a second Champions League game. It is not going to be easy but hopefully he will.”Slot was full of praise for the performance of McConnell and confirmed the young midfielder would not be loaned out this month as a result. Others might. “He impressed me a lot,” said Slot, who admitted PSG are not the reward he will be hoping for having finished top.The former PSV favourite Cody Gakpo and Andy Robertson were the only players retained from the starting lineupagainst Ipswichon Saturday. It is testament to the work being done from academy to senior level at Liverpool that Slot’s makeshift team were still recognisable in style.Danns and McConnell both impressed in a rollercoaster first half although it was an old head in the centre of defence who influenced the visitors’ assured start. Robertson took Virgil van Dijk’s position and captain’s armband for the night.

Gakpo raised his hands in apology to his former club after scoring.The contest suddenly had liftoff. PSV hit back with an exquisite goal from Bakayoko. Released into the Liverpool area by a deft touch from the striker Ricardo Pepi, the winger put Robertson and Jarell Quansah on their backsides with a dummy and curled an unstoppable finish inside Caoimhín Kelleher’s right-hand post.Liverpool soon regained the lead when Gakpo turned Wataru Endo’s ball into the path of Chiesa, whose low drive was parried into the path of Harvey Elliott by Walter Benítez.

With four minutes left in Arsenal’s lastChampions Leaguematch of a hugely impressive first phase, Ethan Nwaneri began his long, slow walk around the pitch at Montilivi. As he went, they waited for him with open arms on the away bench and, in the small main stand, supporters and staff stood and applauded. He was in no hurry; he had given everything and was happy to take it all in.Ultimately, this was a comfortable night forArsenal, and it had always been likely to be. They had earned the right to play virtually risk-free and although Raheem Sterling missed a last-minute penalty, a 2-1 win over Girona completed the job of carrying them directly to the last 16 as expected. Arsenal are third, Arteta talking about having “the privilege of sitting at home” during the playoff round. In the absence of jeopardy or epic, what made it memorable was the 17-year-old who celebrated his first Champions League start with a superb performance and a wonderful winning goal.Manchester City survive Brugge scare to progress as Savinho caps comeback winRead moreAlready the youngest player in Premier League history, he did it as if playing at Donkey Lane, Enfield, not in Europe’s biggest competition – and playing for a side whose candidacy must be taken seriously, chasing a second ever final. The kid who marked this occasion and may well mark many more had not been born that night in 2006 when they played their first. “That’s what we love about him,” Arteta said. “He’s very aggressive and so confident. It was a very important goal.” It was one they had seen before, a signature strike if such a thing can exist so early in a player’s career.Mikel Arteta had noted that qualification was not mathematically assured but the numbers were on Arsenal’s side: the chances of not making it were less than 0.1% and, with Manchester City coming up, the coach made changes. That meant a starting XI without Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz. David Raya was not there either, although the coach was coy about his injury and availability for the weekend. It also meant another glimpse of the grace and confidence in everything Nwaneri does.He was not the only new face. At the other end, Neto’s first appearance in eight months did not go entirely as planned. They had not even been playing two minutes when he slipped and almost gifted the opener to Yáser Asprilla; they had been playing for 28 when he played a part inGironagetting the opener. Juanpe Ramírez’s pass bent into Arnaut Danjuma’s run, and Neto came to meet him – too far and too fast. With the goalkeeper isolated away from his line, Danjuma side-footed beyond him and into the empty net.View image in fullscreenJorginho scores from the spot to make it 1-1.Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC/Getty ImagesBetween those moments Arsenal dominated, Nwaneri and Sterling always moving and Riccardo Calafiori appearing undetected at the most opportune moments. Sterling had flashed past the post and clipped a delivery for the impressive Leandro Trossard to bundle wide before a slightly daft penalty brought them level. Thomas Partey pushed past Arnau Martínez’s outstretched leg and on to the turf and Jorginho scored from the spot.Then, just before half-time, came the moment. Heading in from the right, Nwaneri went across the face of the area, stepped away from opponents, waited for the target to come into range, and then, as if it was no big deal, bent past Pau López and into the net. “It’s very natural for him. The technique in motion is very rare, he is so precise finishing,” Arteta said.The second period began with Trossard, who had already smashed one off the bar, providing chances for Gabriel Magalhães and Calafiori before having an effort of his own blocked. But the third goal would not come and Girona introduced the 38-year-old Cristhian Stuani to an ovation. This was not just a homage to the club’s most historic player and, six minutes later, he thought he had put them level. Instead, there was something cruel about the goal being ruled out, a portrait of how fine the margins have been in their first European season.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The Saudi Pro League club Al-Nassr had previously agreed a deal to sign the Bayer Leverkusen striker Victor Boniface but it seems they have opted for the 21-year-old Villa player instead.Football Daily | Lewis-Skelly and an FA decision so obvious it wasn’t worth waking up forRead moreArsenal are thought to have made their approach for England international Watkins last week but Villa have no desire to sell him. It remains to be seen whetherArsenalreturn with a second bid but Villa will be very reluctant to sell both Durán and ­Watkins in this window.After victory over Celtic on Wednesday, Unai Emery strongly hinted at Durán’s departure. “I don’t know exactly until everything is done if Jhon Durán is leaving but if he is leaving it is good news for us because it means they are paying good money,” he said. “Because we have developed one young player in two years to get this offer. It is not only for the club, it is the club, the players and team, those circumstances can be positive. If he is leaving it is because he prefers to do another way in his career. If he is leaving, of course, it is because he wants to.”By contrast, Emery is determined to keep Watkins. “I don’t want [to sell]. It is good news to have offers from other clubs. We want to keep our sporting objective through the players we have in the squad,” he said.“Every player can be in the market if it is good for the player and the club. To get this deal we are going to be demanding. Watkins is our striker.”The Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has not hidden his desire to strengthen his attack after injuries to Gabriel Jesus and Bukayo Saka. “Ideally we need some help,” Arteta said last week. “We were short already and now we are even shorter. The team still copes with that.”Watkins has scored 10 Premier League goals for Villa this season, including the equaliser in their recent2-2 draw at Arsenalat the Emirates Stadium.The 29-year-old, who signed from Brentford five years ago, was a boyhood Gunners fan. “That’s the dream, to play for Arsenal one day,” Watkins said in 2020. He also scored inlast season’s 2-0 winat the Emirates which was Arsenal’s only defeat in the run-in and one many felt cost them the title. Watkins, who has remained as Emery’s first-choice striker despite Durán’s prolific form this season, has three years left on his contract.Villa are angered at the timing of the Arsenal bid emerging, with a second Champions League game derailed by transfer noise surrounding one of their prized assets.

Arsenal targeted the 27-year-old last summer and she was ­reportedly the subject of a bid from the club, who have been heavily linked with her for several months.Last Sunday Chelsea broke the women’s world record to sign the USA defender Naomi Girma from San Diego Wave for $1.1m (£890,000). Sonia Bompastor’s side lead the WSL table by seven points as they chase a sixth successive title.In the leadup to Thursday’s 11pm deadline, meanwhile, another ­Lioness could be on the move.

With the Euros fast approaching, this summer is a huge one and I want to be in a position to give it my best shot to represent my country. However, to be dictated whom I can and can’t join with only four months left of the football season is having a huge impact on not only my career but my mental well­being.

Perhaps the new-look Champions League really does serve the big guns as intended: the illusion of serious jeopardy had been vivid before the sprawling final match-day kicked off but PSG, having given the neutrals their fun, swiftly made a mockery of it in Stuttgart. Just as they had indestroying Manchester City, they looked a side whose sparkling attack could yet make a push for the latter stages. It was a performance that scorned suggestions they would fail at the 36-team format’s first hurdle.Ousmane Dembélé’s exceptional hat-trick would have felt all the sweeter to the forward given he was booed throughout this game, presumably for his Borussia Dortmund connections. More pertinently, it was a reminder PSG have retained plenty of proven quality despite the departures of their superstar names. Bradley Barcola, who set the ball rolling beforeStuttgartcould gather breath, was unplayable and offered a blistering vision of the new generation’s capabilities.Manchester City survive Brugge scare to progress as Savinho caps comeback winRead moreBoth players were helped by a desperately open Stuttgart, whose approach bordered on naivety. A draw would have sent both teams through and, though nobody would ever dare utter the sentiment, perhaps a measured, agreeable affair could have satisfied everyone. But if the home side would have settled for abiscotto, all they ended up with was a soggy mush. They needed to tighten up for a while after falling behind so early but instead they were exposed repeatedly and left devoid of hope well before half-time.Maybe things would have panned out differently if a remarkable 17th-minute sequence had fallen their way. Stuttgart had teemed forward after Barcola, stooping bravely at the far post, converted a needlessly conceded corner that had been helped on by Désiré Doué. The equaliser they needed seemed to be on at that point but they faced a formidable obstacle in the form of Gianluigi Donnarumma. When Chris Führich was found open on the right of the area after a flowing break, it seemed a case of waiting for the net to ripple. Instead Donnarumma, athletic and imposing in equal measure, produced a stunning one-handed stop to his right and PSG sprang forward immediately.Barcola, who had the freedom of the left flank throughout, was initially judged offside after perfectly teeing up Dembélé for a tap-in. But PSG had, for neither the first time nor the last, simply been too sharp; VAR showed the goal to be good and, from the verge of a sticky spot seconds previously, Luis Enrique’s players were virtually through.View image in fullscreenBradley Barcola puts PSG ahead against Stuttgart.Photograph: Christian Kaspar-Bartke/Uefa/Getty ImagesThis was the moment when Stuttgart might have been advised to slow things down until the break. They still had time to solve things against opponents who did not appear watertight. But they continued to leave gaping holes and, while they might have been buoyed when Fabian Bredlow made a quite staggering save on his line from Doué, it was a matter of time before the next wound was applied. Dembélé’s sleight of foot wrought a shooting chance that, cracked through Bredlow’s hands, ensured the game was over after 35 minutes.“One thing is clear this evening: Stuttgart is the winner,” a huge banner unfurled before the start by the home fans had read. In a way they were correct: simply being at this level after almost a decade and a half away, and 19 months since negotiating a Bundesliga relegation playoff, is evidence of how far this marvellously supported institution has bounced back. The same faithful tried to cajole a second-half comeback but, after the expected flurry, they were silenced once again.Dembélé’s final goal was brilliantly taken and created, the 27-year-old scooping a shot into the top corner after Achraf Hakimi had received his backheel and offered a return pass.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nonetheless there were a few minutes before the hour mark when other scores in the table’s vast movable feast would have sent Stuttgart through. That shimmer of excitement faded quickly; Führich did nudge in a consolation via the toe of Willian Pacho but the home team’s manager, Sebastian Hoeness, was left to curse how the numbers had fallen.“Somebody told me 10 points would be enough [to progress] with 99% probability,” he said after seeing them finish on that tally. “So in the end the AI wasn’t right, even 11 points wasn’t enough [for Dinamo Zagreb].”PSG’s real-world intelligence proved more than adequate. “Since the beginning of the season we’ve had high ambition but we’re one of the youngest teams in the competition,” Luis Enrique said. The addition of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia should help them later. For now, they can embrace their second chance.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueStuttgartParis Saint-Germainmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

City rallied after the break and secured a 22nd-placed finish in the league stage to qualify for the next round thanks to goals from Mateo Kovacic and substitute Savinho either side of an own goal from Joel Ordóñez.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’m so pragmatic. They have more experience than us and Madrid have been back in the last games and Bayern have had an incredible season with Vinnie [Kompany]. If you had to play tomorrow it would be difficult, but in two weeks I don’t know the position we will be in. The players in the locker room said Bayern or Real – it’s OK, we will be fit and see what happens.”Guardiola was without a number of injured players for the win over Brugge but hopes Rúben Dias, Nathan Aké, Oscar Bobb and Jérémy Doku may return in time for the playoffs, while new signings Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis will be available after being ineligible to feature on Wednesday. “I don’t know if they [Bayern and Real] are happy to play against us but it is what it is,” Guardiola said. “Both of them right now are better than us … we will be better than we are right now because new players will come back, and the new signings.”The evening started badly at the Etihad Stadium after an inferno gutted one of the merchandise huts outside the ground, forcing the cancellation of the unveiling of the club’s new signings. “When I saw the fire before the game, I thought at half-time journalists had their headline already,” Guardiola said. “We were out, when you play with nothing to lose we go through and go forward. The first half was so academic but we missed the spark. Savinho helped us like all season when he played there – he changed the game.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityChampions LeaguePep GuardiolanewsShareReuse this content"

Sweeney insisted last week that it was his intention to stay in the role until at least 2027 and he refused to apologise for accepting the £358,000 bonus that has sparked the grassroots revolution.Beaumont and Sweeney are taking part in a “roadshow” before the SGM, visiting clubs across the country in an effort to unify the game which has been so obviously fractured in recent months. The rebellion was sparked after it emerged in November that Sweeney was paid £1.1m, ­including a £358,000 long-term incentive plan bonus, while five other executive directors shared close to £1m amid 42 redundancies and the RFU’s record loss to reserves of £42m.When calling for the SGM, the rebels cited a number of reasons including the “negative reaction across stakeholders throughout the game” to the pay scandal, “significant concerns around good governance and effective checks and balances, the attempts of the RFU president Rob Udwin to brush off negative coverage as “media spinning” and “clickbait” and losses of around £130m over the past two World Cup cycles.They also reference the “tackle height debacle”, the demises of Worcester, Wasps, London Irish and Jersey Reds, a failure to deal with promotion and relegation and the “wasted money spent on sacking England coaching staff”. Beaumont’s letter seeks to counter a number of those points, going through them one by one.Beaumont writes: “It is clear that many within the game want change. I agree with this wholeheartedly. The RFU and its governance structure needs to continue to modernise to meet the needs of its members, ­players, parents and all those involved in the game now and in the future. ­However, a personalised attack on one indi­vidual [the CEO] is not the way to achieve that change.”The letter adds: “Rugby is a broad church, and we don’t always agree on how best to grow and manage the sport, and sometimes we lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of those in the game only want what is best. On behalf of the board, I ask you to vote against the proposed resolution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Supporters had gathered in the area for a pre-match entertainment show which included on-stage interviews with the club’s January signings Omar Marmoush, Vitor Reis and Abdukodir Khusanov.Manchester City v Club Brugge: Champions League – liveRead moreWhen the fire broke out, the show had already begun with the women’s players Rebecca Knaak and Aemu Oyama on stage. The event was suspended as flames took hold of the nearby kiosk. Stewards moved fans away before fire services arrived at the scene, with the remainder of the pre-match show cancelled.The area was evacuated quickly by stewards and security staff and a fire engine arrived within minutes. The fire soon appeared to be brought under control. It was announced at 6.22pm that the stadium was open and fans could enter but three entrance gates inside the cordoned-off area close to the scene were still closed.According to local reports, the team used a different entrance to access the stadium with the West Stand reception closed. The game, which City won 3-1 and progressed to the Champions League knockout stages, kicked off at 8pm GMT as scheduled.View image in fullscreenFire services tackle the blaze in a self-contained merchandise stand outside the Etihad Stadium.Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt/AMA/Getty ImagesIn a club statement the club said: “Manchester City FC can confirm that there has been a fire in one of the outside merchandise kiosks, located near the entrance to the Colin Bell West Stand. Emergency services are present at the scene and the fire has now been extinguished.“The safety of all attending the match tonight is our top priority, and as such all events planned for West Stand reception have been cancelled, including the welcome event for new players, and the first team arrival.”In a later update the club added: “All entrances are open, and fans can move around the Etihad Stadium as per usual. Thank you for your cooperation. We can confirm that tonight’s match will kick off at 8pm as originally planned.”It is not thought that anybody sustained serious injuries in the incident. A statement from GreaterManchesterfire and rescue service read: “Just before 6pm this evening, two fire engines were called to reports of a building fire involving an outbuilding on the car park of the football ground on Rowsley Street, Manchester.“Crews arrived quickly at the scene. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus used two hose reels to extinguish the fire, they are currently dampening down any hotspots and making the area safe. Firefighters have been in attendance for around 20 minutes and are still at the scene.”Explore more on these topicsManchester CityChampions LeagueManchesternewsShareReuse this content"

I blame the teachersWed 29 Jan 2025 06.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 09.09 ESTShareParents, beware! If you send your impressionable young child to school in the US they are at risk of contracting a nasty case of the woke-mind virus. There’s a good chance a teacher will turn your kid trans and, in the middle of maths, whip out surgical equipment to perform gender-affirming surgery. We know this because – despite any evidence to back it up – our esteemed leader,Donald Trump, has said as much.“Can you imagine you’re a parent and your son leaves the house and you say, ‘Jimmy, I love you so much. Go have a good day in school,’ and your son comes back with a brutal operation,” Trump said at arally last year.No, actually, I can’t imagine that. But due to a recent personal incident I do now understand why the Maga crowd are constantly banging on about kids beingindoctrinated at schooland why there’s been asurge in home schooling. My three-year-old daughter, you see, has been brainwashed by her preschool: a few weeks ago she came home singing “Fly, Eagles fly” at the top of her little lungs, and she hasn’t stopped since. US readers will know exactly what I’m talking about, but for those who need a primer: I live in sports-obsessed Philadelphia, and the Eagles are Philly’s football team. (It’s possible you already know this because the NFL is being heavily marketed in the UK and isgaining popularity. Taylor Swift dating the football star Travis Kelce has also helped the sport get new viewers.)They start them on sports young in Philly. My kid’s preschool has been taking the kids on little parades around the block to support the team. Now we can’t see the Eagles logo without my daughter cheering. Sometimes, I even hear her in bed chanting: “E-A-G-L-E-S, Eagles!” (Which at least makes her better at spelling than the mayor of Philly, who recently made headlines bychanting E-L-G-S-E-S.)I don’t care about American football, or sport in general, so it doesn’t bother me who my kid roots for. I think it’s nice she’s bought into the city’s spirit. But I do worry for my wife, who comes from another sports-obsessed town (Boston) and was hoping to raise a Pats fan. It must be hard when your only child supports the wrong team. But then again, you can’t be a sports fan without getting used to crushing disappointment.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsParents and parentingOpinionFamilyNFLUS sportscommentShareReuse this content"

But the surging Cavaliers have the Eastern Conference’s best record and appear to be bona fide contendersLee EscobedoWed 29 Jan 2025 04.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 04.02 ESTShareThe poet Hanif Abdurraqib opensThere’s Always This Year– his 2024 volume on the Cleveland Cavaliers, basketball and Ohio – with a meditation on the shared pain of Cavs fans before the arrival of LeBron James, and the unfettered joy he delivered with the 2016 NBA championship:You are putting your hand into my open palm, and I am resting my one free hand atop yours, and I would like to commiserate here and now, about our enemies.The enemies Abdurraqib speaks of are all who refuse to share in Cavs fans’ lament: a lifetime steeped in winless pain. The 2016 chip broughtsalvation, a religious nomenclature Abdurraqib uses throughout his memoir on the Cavs. When LeBron departed for Los Angeles in 2018, it felt like Cleveland had been cast back to the beginning of a parable. This season, they own the best record in theNBAand are back in championship contention. This iteration doesn’t have the best overall player of all time, LeBron, as their heliocentric savior. Instead, they have a talented, cohesive team of two-way players and, entering Wednesday night’s game at Miami, a 37-9 record. As they return to the class of true contenders, it begs a more vital question: can they really win it all?For Cavs fans, losing has been a central part of the experience. Founded in 1970, the organization has been around for 54 years with the lone championship to their credit. It took 46 years to get there. So what now? For one, the pressure to finally win the first one is extinguished, thanks to LeBron fulfilling his prodigal son destiny. This year’s Cavs are a young roster with an average age of 26.9 years, suggesting a four- to five-year window to win another. They’ve already generated strong playoff experience, too, having reached the postseason the past two years with a conference semi-finals appearance in 2024. This makes it all the more impressive that they could potentially win 70 games while playing two traditional bigs in the frontcourt and an undersized backcourt, which is antithetical to where the NBA is trending. Abdurraqib defines his fandom as having “spent enough time aligned with both religion and sports to know there is no gospel richer than the gospel of suffering”; this religious verbiage conjures images ofThe Decision, pale faces burning James jerseys in 2010, “We Are All Witnesses” white-washed off walls, Cavs owner Dan Gilbert’s letter, Anthony Bennett’s squander, Kyrie Irving’s exodus, followed by LeBron’s (again). Only Egypt has seen more plagues.This season, the Cavs have become a juggernaut in East, running out to the best record and top offensive rating (121.3) while second in net rating (9.1). In the age of advanced analytics, they lead in categories like assist-to-turnover ratio (2.22), effective field-goal percentage (58.7) and true shooting perfcentage (61.6). The offense has been torrid from jump, led by the backcourt of Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garand, the frontcourt of Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, and the tutelage of first-year head coach Kenny Atkinson. Unlike the championship that was won squarely on the back of LeBron’s greatness, this Cavs team is just that: a team. They’re one of the finest exemplars of the modern pace-and-space era, currently fifth in three-point attempts per game (41) and second in makes (16.3), good for a league-best 39.8% from the perimeter. They rarely go five-out – what’s become a staple of present-day basketball – relying on a 10-man rotation with an arsenal of three-and-D players like Max Strus, Dean Wade, Isaac Okoro, Georges Niang and NBA sixth man of the year candidate Caris LeVert.How did this particular Cavs team form? After LeBron’s post-championship departure in 2018, the Cavs missed the playoffs four years in a row. However, they didn’t let a decade-long “rebuild” gestate. They drafted to compete sooner rather than later. In 2019, they used the fifth overall pick on Garland, targeting him as their point guard of the future, just as they’d previously done with Kyrie Irving in 2011. Then they selected Mobley with the third pick in 2021. And. Here. We. Go.It’s a new day in Ohio. While this roster is stacked with four potential All-Stars, there is no obviously MVP candidate, much less a LeBron, in the starting lineup. Mitchell is the closest thing to it. Acquired for a king’s ransomfrom the Utah Jazzin 2022, the current All-Star starter isn’t even having his best season. Here’s where the critics have a point. Every team that has won a championship in the modern era, including the Cavs in 2016, has had a generational superstar on their roster. Cavs supporters will counter that this team mirrors the 2004 Detroit Pistons, a group of All-Star level players playing team basketball, with a different weapon capable of going off from game to game.View image in fullscreenDonovan Mitchell throws down a dunk during a December game against the Brooklyn Nets.Photograph: Luke Hales/Getty ImagesThere’s also an argument this team better resembles the 2014-15 Atlanta Hawks. In 2015, the Hawks had four All-Stars (Al Horford, Paul Millsap, Jeff Teague and Kyle Korver) and won their first division title since 1994. Their franchise-best 60–22 record secured the East’s top seed and home-court advantage, culminating in their first conference finals appearance of the two-conference era. Ironically, once they ran into the LeBron-led Cavs, they were smacked with a sweep, showing the importance of having a superstar to rely on deep into the playoffs. Which raises the question again: without a superstar, can Cleveland really win it all? The answer is yes, with an asterisk. To do so, Mobley must grow into the superstar he can become.While Mitchell is Cleveland’s best offensive player, Mobley has the highest ceiling. Behind Mitchell as their first option, the Cavs have seemed not to be able to get over the playoff hump on the back of their star shooting guard. In Mobley, the fourth-year power forward has two-way All-NBA potential. The league’s Defensive Player of the Month for December, he played a key role in the Cavaliers achieving the East’s top defensive rating (106.2) and the NBA’s best point differential (+15.1) during that stretch. But his evolving offense should scare the league for what’s to come.Mobley is averaging career-highs in points (18.3), EFG% (.616), OBPM (2.7), WS48 (.194) and most importantly for his evolution, shooting 41.3% from three. His new-found shooting has opened up his game, which will only expand with more volume. He has mastered the dribble hand-off, using his explosive first step and athleticism to seamlessly switch between efficiently driving to the rim or pulling up for a three. The Cavaliers thrive in these situations, scoring at the second-highest rate in the NBA on handoffs. They also rank fourth in both effective field goal percentage and points per possession, making this action a cornerstone of their offensive success.Mobley becoming the best offensive player on the Cavs is the key to this season not being a one-trick pony like the 2015 Hawks, who never returned to the conference finals as a group. Mobley has all the tools and work ethic to take his offensive game to the next level. He is already averaging career-high isolation attempts (13.7 FREQ%) and PPP (.89), showing a willingness to put the offense on his back and being amazing when he does. The Cavs will need him to continue on this path, especially as he plays more minutes at center, surrounded by shooters and off-ball cutters. If the Cavs want to be more than regular-season contenders, Mobley needs to evolve into the team’s first option on offense. It shifts them from over-relying on an under-sized backcourt to a 6ft 11in demon with a tight handle, pull-up three-point shot and playmaking chops in the short roll, all the qualities of the modern star. This season, Mobley has showcased his ability to initiate offense, grab defensive rebounds, push the ball up the court with his left hand, and finish plays with emphatic dunks – sequences that underscore his rare combination of speed, skill, and aggression.In his first season as head coach, Atkinson made good on the organization’s directive to center Mobley in the offense. The Cavs often run their offense through Mobley instead of shoving him in the corner as previous coach Bernie Bickerstaff did. Atkinson is not just unleashing Mobley offensively. He’s ensuring it happens with the team that drafted him, ensuring long-term, sustainable winning: a mantra few teams actualize. It helps Atkinson has built-in chemistry with LeVert and Allen, as the trio was the feel-good Brooklyn Nets team before the 2019 free agency period broke them apart. This season feels like a benediction to back-to-back LeBron eras.Fortune has favored them with an easy path through the season’s early stretch. Yet we all know the true crucible waits in May … and possibly beyond. But as Cavs fans learned in 2016, miraclescanhappen. Even Abdurraqib, in his quiet confessional, reveals himself as a dreamer at heart: “I’m not especially easy to fool, but I am a romantic, which I suppose means at the right hour, I’m everybody’s fool.” Perhaps the Cavaliers’ quiet revolution is not about returning to glory, but proving that the gospel of suffering can yield something sweeter: a team forged in faith, rising not on the back of a savior but as one body, bound by the romance of belief.Explore more on these topicsCleveland CavaliersNBABasketballUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

I was able to find where I wanted to go,” Griner said in the video. “Honestly, what led me to that decision ultimately was the team, the players. Also my family. I’m thrilled for this chapter.”Plum reportedly heads to Sparks and Loyd to Aces in WNBA blockbuster tradeRead moreWNBA free agents can’t sign contracts until 1 February.The 6ft 9in Griner had spent her entire career with Phoenix since getting drafted No 1 in 2013. Now 34, she decided this offseason to test free agency for the first time. Griner is signing for only one year because a new collective bargaining agreement featuring potentially massive salary increases is expected to take effect in 2026.Griner missed the 2022 season when she was detained for nearly 10 months in Russia after authorities said a search of her luggage revealed vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. She was freed in a prisoner swap when the United States released notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout.Griner averaged 17.8 points, 6.6 rebounds and 1.5 blocks this past season with Phoenix. She’s third on the WNBA’s career blocks list, 65 behind leader Margo Dydek.Griner said going through free agency posed some challenges.“It was a hard decision since you’re leaving what you know. What I’ve known for my whole career,” she said. “There’s an exciting factor of like, OK, this is a rebrand now. I get to show them something different.”Griner becomes the most prominent free-agent signing in Atlanta’s history, and she joins a talented squad led by Rhyne Howard and Allisha Gray. The Dream made a coaching change this offseason, bringing in Karl Smesko from Florida Gulf Coast. Griner, Howard and Gray are playing in the new 3-on-3 league Unrivaled this offseason.The Dream went 15-25 last season and made the playoffs for the second straight year. They were eliminated in the first round by eventual WNBA champion New York.Griner, a 10-time All-Star, also had discussions with Dallas and Las Vegas.It has been an offseason of change for Phoenix, who earlier Tuesday were finalizing a deal to acquire Alyssa Thomas from theConnecticut Sun, according to an AP source.The Sun also will send Ty Harris to Phoenix, while Connecticut will receive Natasha Cloud, Rebecca Allen and the No 12 pick in this year’s draft, according to the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about the deal.Thomas has played her entire career with Connecticut and helped the franchise reach the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022. Thomas was an unrestricted free agent before she was designated as the team’s franchise player earlier this month, meaning the only way she could sign with another team was via trade.View image in fullscreenAlyssa Thomas has played her entire career with Connecticut and helped the franchise reach the WNBA finals in 2019 and 2022.Photograph: Emilee Chinn/Getty ImagesSince the deal is a sign-and-trade, it can’t become official until 1 February. ESPN firstreportedthe trade.Thomas’ fiancee, DeWanna Bonner, is a free agent and could also go to Phoenix, where she spent the first 10 years of her WNBA career.The 32-year-old Thomaswon an Olympic gold medalwith the United States this past summer and averaged 10.6 points, 7.9 assists and 8.4 rebounds last season. She’s the WNBA’s career leader in triple-doubles with 15, four of which came in the postseason.Thomas, an MVP runner-up in 2023, had been vocal about the Sun’s lack of a practice facility and the franchise’s failure to keep pace with other teams. Phoenix opened a new practice facility this past year.Cloud signed as a free agent with Phoenix last year and now will be back on the east coast after spending the early part of her career in Washington. Allen played for Connecticut in 2023 before getting traded to Phoenix last year.Phoenix are undergoing a transition this offseason with All-Star center Brittney Griner exploring free agency. And it’s not clear whether veteran Diana Taurasi will play again or retire.This was the second major trade in the WNBA this week. A three-way deal reached Sunday between Las Vegas, Seattle and Los Angeleswill send Kelsey Plum to the Sparks, Jewell Loyd to the Aces and the No 2 pick in the draft to the Storm.Explore more on these topicsBrittney GrinerWNBAConnecticut SunUS sportsBasketballShareReuse this content"

OpenAI, the developer ofChatGPT, which DeepSeek has challenged with the launch of its own virtual assistant, pledged this week to accelerate product releases as a result.Who is behind DeepSeek and how did it achieve its AI ‘Sputnik moment’?Read more“If you imagine a competition between two entities and one thinks they’re way ahead, then they can afford to be more prudent and still know that they will stay ahead,” Bengio said. “Whereas if you have a competition between two entities and they think that the other is just at the same level, then they need to accelerate. Then maybe they don’t give as much attention to safety.”Bengio was speaking in a personal capacity before the publication of a wide-ranging report on AI safety.The first fullInternational AI Safety reporthas been compiled by a group of 96 experts including the Nobel prize winnerGeoffrey Hinton. Bengio, a co-winner in 2018 of the Turing award – referred to as the Nobel prize of computing – was commissioned by the UK government to preside over the report, which was announced at theglobal AI safety summit at Bletchley Parkin 2023. Panel members were nominated by 30 countries as well as the EU and UN. The next global AI summit takes place in Paris on 10 and 11 February.The report states that since publication of aninterim studyin May last year, general-purpose AI systems such as chatbots have become more capable in “domains that are relevant for malicious use”, such as the use of automated tools to highlight vulnerabilities in software and IT systems, and giving guidance on the production of biological and chemical weapons.It says new AI models can generate step-by-step technical instructions for creating pathogens and toxins that surpass the capability of experts with PhDs, with OpenAI acknowledging that its advanced o1 model could assist specialists in planning how to produce biological threats.However, the report says it is uncertain whether novices would be able to act on the guidance, and that models can also be used for beneficial purposes such as in medicine.Speaking to the Guardian, Bengio said models had already emerged that could, with the use of a smartphone camera, theoretically guide people through dangerous tasks such as trying to build a bioweapon.“These tools are becoming easier and easier to use by non-experts, because they can decompose a complicated task into smaller steps that everyone can understand, and then they can interactively help you get them right. And that’s very different from using, say, Google search,” he said.The report says AI systems have improved significantly since last year in their ability to spot flaws in software autonomously, without human intervention. This could help hackers plan cyber-attacks.However, the report says carrying out real-world attacks autonomously is beyond AI systems so far because they require “an exceptional level of precision”.Elsewhere in its analysis of the risks posed by AI, the report points to a significant increase in deepfake content, where the technology is used to produce a convincing likeness of a person – whether their image, voice or both. It says deepfakes have been used totrick companiesinto handing over money, tocommit blackmailand to create pornographic images of people. It says gauging the precise level of increase in such behaviour is difficult due to a lack of comprehensive and reliable statistics.There are also risks of malicious use because so-called closed-source models, where the underlying code cannot be modified, can be vulnerable to jailbreaks that circumvent safety guardrails, while open-source models such as Meta’s Llama, which are free to download and can be tweaked by specialists, pose risks of “facilitating malicious or misguided” use by bad actors.In a last-minute addition to the report written by Bengio, the Canadian computer scientist notes the emergence in December – shortly after the report had been finalised – of a new advanced “reasoning” model by OpenAI called o3. Bengio said its ability to make a breakthrough on a key abstract reasoning test was an achievement that many experts, including himself, had thought until recently was out of reach.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

It said researchers had not been able to “fully resolve” those fears.AI can be loosely defined as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.The report, whose full title is the International Scientific Report on the Safety of Advanced AI, flags AI’s “rapidly growing” impact on the environment through the use of datacentres, and the potential for AI agents to have a “profound” impact on the job market.It says the future of AI is uncertain, with a wide range of outcomes possible in the near future including “very positive and very negative outcomes”. It says societies and governments still have a chance to decide which path the technology takes.“This uncertainty can evoke fatalism and make AI appear as something that happens to us. But it will be the decisions of societies and governments on how to navigate this uncertainty that determine which path we will take,” the report says.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)DeepSeekChatGPTnewsShareReuse this content"

This means that many people could lose their current jobs,” says the report.The report adds that many economists believe job losses could be offset by the creation of new jobs or demand from sectors not touched by automation.Everything you wanted to know about AI – but were afraid to askRead moreAccording to the International Monetary Fund, about60% of jobs in advanced economiessuch as the US and UK are exposed to AI and half of these jobs may be negatively affected. The Tony Blair Institute has said AI could displace up to 3m private-sector jobs in the UK, though the ultimate rise in unemployment will be in the low hundreds of thousands because growth in the technology will create new roles in an AI-transformed economy.“These disruptions could be particularly severe if autonomous AI agents become capable of completing longer sequences of tasks without human supervision,” the report says.It adds thatsome expertshavepointed to scenarioswhere work is “largely” eliminated. In 2o23, Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, told the former UK prime minister Rishi Sunak thatAI could ultimately replace all human jobs. However, the report says such views are controversial and there is “considerable uncertainty” over how AI might affect labour markets.2.The environmentThe report describes AI’s impact on the environment as a “moderate but rapidly growing contributor” as datacentres – the central nervous systems of AI models – consume electricity to train and operate the technology.Datacentres and data transmission account for about 1% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, says the report, with AI constituting up to 28% of datacentre energy consumption.It adds that models are using more energy as they become more advanced and warned that a “significant portion” of global model training relies on high-carbon energy sources such as coal or natural gas. Use of renewable energy by AI firms and improvements in efficiency have not kept pace with rising demand for energy, says the report, which also points to tech firms admitting that AI development isharming their ability to meet environmental targets.The report also warns that water consumption by AI, used for cooling equipment in datacentres, could pose a “substantial threat to the environment and the human right to water”. However, the report adds that there is a shortage of data about the environmental impact of AI.3.Loss of controlAn all-powerful AI system evading human control is the central concern of experts who fear the technology could extinguish humanity. The report acknowledges those fears but says opinion varies “greatly”.“Some consider it implausible, some consider it likely to occur, and some see it as a modest-likelihood risk that warrants attention due to its high severity,” it says.Bengio told the Guardian that AI agents, which carry out tasks autonomously, are still being developed and so far are unable to carry out the long-term planning necessary for those systems to eradicate jobs wholesale – or evade safety guidelines. “If an AI cannot plan over a long horizon, it’s hardly going to be able to escape our control,” he said4.BioweaponsThe report states that new models can create step-by-step guides to creating pathogens and toxins that surpass PhD-level expertise. However, it cautions that there is uncertainty over whether they can be used by novices.There is evidence of advancement since an interim safety report last year, the experts say, with OpenAI producing a model that could “meaningfully assist experts in the operational planning of reproducing known biological threats”.5.CybersecurityA fast-growing threat from AI in terms of cyber-espionage is autonomous bots being able to find vulnerabilities in open-source software, the term for code that is free to download and adapt. However, relative shortcomings in AI agents mean the technology is not able to plan and carry out attacks autonomously.6.DeepfakesThe report lists an array of known examples of AI deepfakes being used maliciously, including tricking companies into handing over money and creating pornographic images of people. However, the report says there is not enough data to fully measure the amount of deepfake incidents.“Reluctance to report may be contributing to these challenges in understanding the full impact of AI-generated content intended to harm individuals,” the report says. For example, institutions often hesitate to disclose their struggles with AI-powered fraud. Similarly, individuals attacked with AI-generated compromising material about themselves may stay silent out of embarrassment and to avoid further harm.”The report also warns that there are “fundamental challenges” to tackling deepfake content, such as the ability to remove digital watermarks that flag AI-generated content.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)CyberwarDeepfakeComputingJob lossesWork & careersEnergynewsShareReuse this content"

The impact came from its claim that the model underpinning its AI was trained with a fraction of the cost and hardware used by rivals such as OpenAI and Google.Sam Altman, the chief executive of OpenAI, initially said that he was impressed with DeepSeek and that it was “legitimately invigoratingto have a new competitor”.However, on WednesdayOpenAIsaid that it had seen some evidence of “distillation” from Chinese companies, referring to a development technique that boosts the performance of smaller models by using larger, more advanced ones to achieve similar results on specific tasks.A spokesperson for OpenAI said: “We know that groups in [China] are actively working to use methods, including what’s known as distillation, to try to replicate advanced US AI models.“We are aware of and reviewing indications that DeepSeek may have inappropriately distilled our models, and will share information as we know more. We take aggressive, proactive countermeasures to protect our technology and will continue working closely with the US government to protect the most capable models being built here.”OpenAI, which has itself been accused ofusing data without permissionor a licence from publishers and the creative industry to train its own models, has already blocked unnamed entities from attempting to distill its models.View image in fullscreenThe launch of DeepSeek was a ‘wake-up call’ for Silicon Valley, Donald Trump said earlier this week.Photograph: Lionel Bonaventure/AFP/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, David Sacks, Donald Trump’s AI and crypto tsar, told Fox News that he thought it was “possible” that intellectual property theft had occurred.“There’s substantial evidence that what DeepSeek did here is they distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” he said. “I think one of the things you’re going to see over the next few months is our leading AI companies taking steps to try and prevent distillation.

A major tech CEO lambasts a Black civil rights leader’s calls for diversifying the tech workforce. Technologists rage against the “PC police”.No, this isn’t Silicon Valley in the age of Maga. It’s the tech industry of the 1990s, when observers first raised concerns about the rightwing bend of Silicon Valley and the potential for “technofascism”. Despite the industry’s (often undeserved) reputation for liberalism, its reactionary foundations were baked in almost from the beginning. As Silicon Valley enters a second Trump administration, the gendered roots of its original reactionary movement offer insight into today’s rightward turn.At the height of the dotcom mania in the 1990s, many critics warned of a creeping reactionary fervor. “Forget digital utopia,” wrote the longtime technology journalist Michael Malone, “we could be headed for techno-fascism.” Elsewhere, the writer Paulina Borsook called the valley’s worship of male power “a little reminiscent of the early celebrants of Eurofascism from the 1930s”.Their voices were largely drowned out by the techno-enthusiasts of the time, but Malone and Borsook were pointing to a vision of Silicon Valley built around a reverence for unlimited male power – and a major pushback when that power was challenged. At the root of this reactionary thinking was a writer and public intellectual named George Gilder. Gilder was one of Silicon Valley’s most vocal evangelists, as well as a popular “futurist” who forecasted coming technological trends. In 1996, he started an investment newsletter that became so popular that it generated rushes on stocks from his readers, in a process that became known as the “Gilder effect”.Gilder was also a longtime social conservative who brought his politics to Silicon Valley. He had first made his name in the 1970s as an anti-feminist provocateur and a mentee of the conservative stalwart William F Buckley. At a time when women were entering the workforce in unprecedented numbers, he wrote books that argued that traditional gender roles needed to be restored, and he blamed social issues such as poverty on the breakdown of the nuclear family. (He also blamed federal welfare programs, especially those that funded single mothers, claiming they turned men into “cuckolds of the state”). In 1974, the National Organization for Women named him “Male Chauvinist Pig of the Year”; Gilder wore it as a badge of pride.View image in fullscreenGeorge Gilder during a 1981 interview in Boston.Photograph: Santi Visalli/Getty ImagesAt the turn of the 1980s, Gilder celebrated the links between capitalism, entrepreneurship and the nuclear family. He claimed that entrepreneurs were the most moral and benevolent people in society, because they put products into the world without a guarantee of return – and then reinvested the profit back into the economy.For Gilder, entrepreneurship was also a route to rejecting the welfare state and restoring the male breadwinner role in society. He insisted that men were biologically and socially more suited to entrepreneurship than women, and that a societal emphasis on entrepreneurship could thus help restore the traditional nuclear family structure with its rigid gender breakdown. Drawing on religious language (Gilder himself was a devout Christian), he wrote that entrepreneurs are the humans who “know the rules of the world and the laws of God”.Gilder was far from the first person to celebrate the cultural figure of the entrepreneur, nor was he the first to link it with masculinity. As the scholar Michael Kimmel has shown, the ideal of the “self-made man” has been central to American conceptions of masculinity for almost 200 years. The ideal has also always been linked to the “male breadwinner” role in the nuclear family. More recently, in the 20th century, the economist Joseph Schumpeter had developed a theory of capitalism based around entrepreneurs (although he also had a far more pessimistic vision of capitalism, believing it would collapse over time).View image in fullscreenSanta Clara, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley, in 1978.Photograph: Mirrorpix/Getty ImagesBut at a time when American industrialism was in decline, Gilder helped revitalize a fervor for entrepreneurship and a belief in the moral power of entrepreneurs over industrial workers and company men. Increasingly, Gilder claimed that entrepreneurs were better suited to lead the country into the future than the “experts” found in academia or government.Gilder’s 1981 book Wealth and Povertybecame known as the Bible of the Reagan administration, and Reagan began incorporating praise of entrepreneurship into his own speeches. (“If I didn’t know better,” Reagan once stated, “I would be tempted to say that ‘entrepreneur’ is another word for ‘America’.”) Throughout the decade, Reagan used the mythology of entrepreneurship to justify trickle-down economics and cuts to federal welfare programs.As Gilder became swept up in his own ideas about entrepreneurship, he turned his attention to Silicon Valley. The bourgeoning hi-tech industry, he began claiming, was the purest expression of entrepreneurship in the world. It’s not surprising that Gilder would be drawn to the tech industry in Santa Clara county,California. The state had its own powerful mythologies of masculinity and power. It was the end of the vast frontier, the end of manifest destiny. And it was the place of the former gold rush, where (white) men had struck it rich in the 19th century. It was also, counterintuitively, the birthplace of much of the modern conservative movement, including Reagan’s political career.Turning entrepreneurs into starsGilder was publishing his ideas at a time when IPOs were creating instant wealth for startup founders at unprecedented speeds. The new riches added to Silicon Valley’s allure and seemed to underscore the draw of entrepreneurship in the world of high tech. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, other media outlets took up Gilder’s framing: tech entrepreneurs offered a hopeful way forward for the American economy, for masculinity, and for human progress writ large.How the roots of the ‘PayPal mafia’ extend to apartheid South AfricaRead moreTime magazinedrew directly on Gilder’s vision of entrepreneurship to promote the then up-and-coming businessmanSteve Jobs. The 1982 cover story called Jobs one of “America’s risk takers” who were not only striking it rich, but also “leading the US into the industries of the 21st century”. The article quoted Gilder, citing his claim that “the potentialities of invention and enterprise are now greater than ever before in human history”. Stories like this one did multiple duty for readers: they helped justify the rapidly growing wealth of a new class of tech businessmen; they inspired a new generation of readers to follow the same path; and they reinforced a cultural image of what entrepreneurs looked like (largely young, white men).This type of coverage accelerated as Silicon Valley entrepreneurs began turning from hardware to software. As the tech journalist Dave Kaplan wrote at the time, software “needed neither factory to build nor natural resources to mine – just [the] brain matter” of the entrepreneur behind the company.Tech culture increasingly gave the star treatment to young entrepreneurs whose success boiled down to a few thousand lines of computer code. Indeed, Gilder argued that software was the purest expression of entrepreneurial genius – an informational world of the mind, free from the material constraints of time and space.In the mid-1990s, the media discovered a young, newly rich entrepreneur named Marc Andreessen, who had recently made millions in the IPO of his company Netscape. As an undergraduate at the University of Illinois, Andreessen was on a team that built a new, user-friendly browser for the young world wide web. They called it Mosaic, and it consisted of merely 9,000 lines of code (compared to the approximately 8m lines required to run Windows computers at the time). In 1994, Andreessen moved to Silicon Valley and launched a commercial version of the browser called Netscape Navigator. In 1995, Netscape went public, earning the 24-year-old Andreessen $58m overnight.View image in fullscreenMarc Andreessen in San Jose, California, in 1998.Photograph: Bromberger Hoover Photography/Getty ImagesWhen he was just 24, the media embraced Andreessen as a fully formed genius, as someone genuinely deserving of his newfound wealth, and as a leader of America’s future. Andreessen graced the cover of a 1996 Time magazine issue, declaring an era of “Golden Geeks”. The article promised that the new era of Silicon Valley would “reward the people capitalism is supposed to reward – dynamic entrepreneurs, not rapacious monopolists or financial card-sharks”. Dipping into the mythology of Hollywood to make its case, the article claimed that the newly wealthy entrepreneurs represented “a Frank Capra movie, not [the movie] Wall Street”.Entrepreneurs could often translate this coverage into direct financial gain. In an industry increasingly built around ideas, hype was everything. As the Oracle CEO, Larry Ellison, said at the time: “There’s no place like Silicon Valley, where your talents can be magnified, and the projection of that magnification is cash.” The worshipful treatment of entrepreneurs thus directly brought them more power, and it continued to inspire young men to follow the same path.Fighting political correctnessThe entrepreneurial hype of the 90s rarely mentioned gender or overt rightwing politics. But the reactionary elements of the entrepreneurial ideal became visible whenever the growing power of tech entrepreneurs was challenged.In this way, Silicon Valley was part of a broader trend of fighting against “political correctness” – that is, a focus on inclusion and avoiding offense to people who had traditionally been marginalized. Throughout the decade, Silicon Valley not only became a leading space for a war on the “PC police”, but entrepreneurs also came to represent some of the biggest anti-PC culture warriors. It was often the most enthusiastically pro-entrepreneurial voices who were also the biggest anti-diversity fighters.This dual impulse was evident in the magazine Upside,a tech business publication founded in 1989 by two young conservatives who were friends of Gilder’s. They quickly gained a small but influential list of subscribers, including the legendary venture capitalist Arthur Rock, the Intel co-founder Robert Noyce, and the conservative luminary William F Buckley. From the beginning, the editorial team was both a champion for entrepreneurship and a set of “bullish contrarians” against anyone they felt threatened their specific vision of business.In one infamous case, the magazine published a 1990 cover story that in bold letters asked: “Has Silicon Valley gone pussy?” The article itself, titled “The pussification of Silicon Valley”, claimed that the hi-tech industry was falling victim to feminization and political correctness. The writers claimed they weren’t opposed to women and minorities in business, but theywereopposed to a kind of “new-age male” who was “sensitive and concerned, a whiner”.The authors also reveled in the discomfort and outrage their use of the word “pussy” had generated among the women on their own staff, and they bragged that their female assistant editor threatened to lead a walkout of female employees over the story. The solution to the problem, they claimed, was the reassertion of an older, glorified “anti-pussy” approach to business – one that prioritized masculine traits like fighting, risk-taking, and being “blunt” and “tough”. (One of the driving forces behind the cover story was Michael Malone, the journalist who later warned of rising “technofascism” in the Valley. By the turn of the century, Malone acknowledged his own previous role in fueling this “fascism” and expressed regret about the “pussy” piece.)View image in fullscreenTechnicians assemble electronic equipment at Cypress Semiconductor in California.Photograph: Jim Sugar/Getty ImagesEntrepreneurs also directly took on the mantle of the culture wars. None more so than TJ Rodgers, the CEO of a firm called Cypress Semiconductor. Rodgers has largely been erased from Silicon Valley’s memory, but in the 1980s and 1990s, he was one of its biggest celebrities. His company was a highly successful microchip manufacturer, but its success was inseparable from his own rising star. As Upsidedescribed it, Cypress’s “most famous product” was “the outspoken TJ himself”. Rodgers had quickly learned the art of garnering business media attention. In 1988, he staged a press event in which he gave out about $300,000 in gold coins to his employees. In 1990, when the Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev, visited northern California, Rodgers ran a full-page ad in a local news outlet inviting him to the Cypress campus to show him the wonders of capitalism.Throughout the 1990s, the outspoken businessman generated highly visible media spectacles based around his rejection of political correctness and demands for increased diversity in Silicon Valley. In 1996, a nun named Sister Doris Gormley sent a form letter to the CEO of a Silicon Valley company. She informed the CEO that she was a shareholder and that she would withhold her vote for the company’s board because it included no gender or racial diversity. Rodgers wrote a letter in response, which he broadcast to other shareholders and reprinted in media publications. In the letter, he told the nun she “ought to get down from your moral high horse” and claimed: “Your views seem more accurately described as ‘politically correct’ than ‘Christian’.”He also stirred up controversy in 1999 when the civil rights activist and politician Jesse Jackson came to Silicon Valley, hoping to help increase Black and Hispanic participation in the hi-tech workforce. Jackson’s non-profit organization planned to buy $100,000 worth of stock in 50 hi-tech corporations, which would give Jackson access to annual shareholder meetings. In response, Rodgers went on a local media tour calling Jackson an opportunist and rejecting the need for diversity in tech. On local TV, Rodgers described Jackson as “a seagull that flies in, craps on everything and flies out”.‘The reign of terror is over’: my weird weekend partying with the triumphant tech rightRead moreCollectively, these efforts successfully generated controversy and attention. They showed that, in a world increasingly based on individual personalities and the ability to grab (mostly white, male) investors’ attention, politically incorrect showmanship could be good for business. One of Upside’seditors correctly predicted that the “pussy” article was “the one that’s going to make us famous”. Intel’s Andy Grove called Rodgers a “master manipulator of the press”.The efforts also helped stave off perceived threats to the growing power of male entrepreneurs. Upsidereaders lauded the magazine for its coverage of “pussification”, calling it one of the best articles they had read in years and thanking the editorial team for crossing the line of good taste. And in response to his stunts, Rodgers received hundreds of letters of support, including from the chairs of Hewlett-Packard and Advanced Micro Devices, two of Silicon Valley’s most powerful firms at the time. Dozens of investors likewise committed to increasing their holdings of Cypress stock as a direct result of his actions.This rising “technofascism”, as critics of the time had called it, was temporarily staved off by the dotcom stock market crash of 2000. George Gilder’s reputation was badly damaged after he failed to predict the crash. And much of the hype around digital tech was temporarily tempered after hundreds of startups went bust. But a younger generation of aspiring tech hopefuls had already come to the valley, seeking fame, riches, and power.Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and others had absorbed the lessons of the 90s. At the start of the new millennium, they were ready to put their stamp on the future, guided by reactionary dreams of the past.View image in fullscreenMark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk were among attendees at Donald Trump’s second inauguration.Photograph: Abaca/Rex/ShutterstockThe Silicon Valley titans of 2025 are following the same blueprint. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Meta was ending its DEI programs and changing its platform policies to allow more discriminatory and harassing posts. On Joe Rogan’s podcast, Zuckerberg made his motivations clear: he claimed that corporate culture had moved away from “masculine energy” and needed to reinstate it after getting “neutered”. Elon Musk has reshaped Twitter into X, a platform in large part operating as a response to claims of a “woke mind virus”– the newest iteration of “political correctness”. And Marc Andreessen himself, the “boy genius” of the 1990s, has increasingly drawn inspiration from the Italian futurists, a movement of fascist artists in the early 20th century who glorified technology while seeking to “demolish” feminism.But the history of the valley suggests this isn’t a blip or an anomaly. It’s a crescendo of forces central to the tech industry, and the current wave of rightwing tech titans are building on Silicon Valley’s foundations.Becca Lewis is a postdoctoral research fellow at Stanford University, where she also received her PhD in communication.

The NAO did not name the systems for fear of helping attackers choose targets.It assessed data held by the Cabinet Office and said the challenge of cyber-resilience in central government applied to a range of organisations, including, for example, HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions.The warning comes after two recent cyber-attacks that included one on the British Library by a criminal ransomware gang in 2023, which continues to limit its functions and is costingwell over the gang’s £600,000 demand to fix.In May 2024, itemergedthat suspected Chinese hackers had gained access to part of the armed forces payment network. In the following month, an attack on two south-east London NHS foundation trusts led to the postponement of 10,000 outpatient appointments and 1,700 operations.UK underestimates threat of cyber-attacks from hostile states and gangs, says security chiefRead moreThe NAO said senior civil servants had failed to grasp the importance of resilience to cyber-attack, with inadequate investment and staffing, and that the government was on course to fail in its aim to have “significantly hardened” its defence posture by 2025.The assessment by the spending watchdog is the latest of several into UK resilience after the Covid-19 pandemic, with previous topics including flooding and extreme weather.Last month, GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre warned of “a widening gap” between increasingly complex threats and the UK’s capability to defend critical national infrastructure.It said ransomware attacks continued to pose the most immediate and disruptive threat, with China, Russia, Iran and North Korea named as key adversaries. Groups such as the Chinese state-sponsored threat actor Volt Typhoon, the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn and the Islamic StateHackingDivision are all believed to pose a threat.Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative MP and chair of the House of Commons public accounts committee, said: “Despite the rapidly evolving cyber-threat, government’s response has not kept pace.“Poor coordination across government, a persistent shortage of cyber-skills and a dependence on outdated legacy IT systems are continuing to leave our public services exposed. Today’s NAO report must serve as a stark wake-up call to government to get on top of this most pernicious threat.”A government spokesperson conceded that cyber-defences had been neglected by successive administrations, but said repairs had been under way since July with “new legislation to give us powers to protect critical national infrastructure from cyber-attacks, delivering 30 new regional cyber-skills projects to strengthen the country’s digital workforce, and merging digital teams into one central government digital service led by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

To avoid serious incidents, build resilience and protect the value-for-money of its operations, government must catch up with the acute cyber-threat it faces.“The government will continue to find it difficult to catch up until it successfully addresses the longstanding shortage of cyber-skills; strengthens accountability for cyber-risk; and better manages the risks posed by legacy IT.”One in three cybersecurity roles in government were vacant or filled by temporary staff in 2023-24. Relatively low salaries in public sector roles and arduous civil service recruitment procedures were partly to blame, the NAO said.Explore more on these topicsCybercrimeHackingData and computer securityCivil servicenewsShareReuse this content"

Wall Street had expected $3.11 a share from revenue of $68.9bn.Shares in the company, worth a total of $3.28tn, are up roughly 8% over the past 12 months as it has poured capital investment into AI and plans $80bn on new AI spending this year.Metahas made similar commitments; US tech giants are rushing to gain an edge over their competitors in the AI race.What is DeepSeek and why did US tech stocks fall?Read more“We are innovating across our tech stack and helping customers unlock the full ROI of AI to capture the massive opportunity ahead,” said Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer ofMicrosoft. “Already, our AI business has surpassed an annual revenue run rate of $13bn, up 175% year-over-year.”Amy Hood, executive vice-president and chief financial officer at Microsoft, said revenue from its data cloud business was $40.9bn, up 21% year-over-year. “We remain committed to balancing operational discipline with continued investments in our cloud and AI infrastructure,” Hood said.The company’s earnings report comes in the shadow of a sell-off in AI-exposed companies on Monday when a Chinese company,DeepSeek, said its AI model had achieved similar results to those of US companies at a fraction of the cost. Chipmaker Nvidia lost some $600bn in market capitalization, though it recovered part of that value in the ensuing days of trading.The implications of DeepSeek’s apparent AI cost breakthrough – it claims to have spent mere millions training its model – raises questions over the past year’s $5tn AI-related run-up in the overall market value of the tech giants known as the “magnificent seven” on Wall Street: Meta, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Tesla. The gains accounted for much of the S&P 500’s roughly 70% advance over that period, which has slowed as concerns that returns on AI-capital spending, estimated at more than $200bn over the past year with more scheduled for this year, are still elusive.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He called Microsoft “the undisputed AI leader on the software side” and “a stable bet” for investors looking to cash in on AI.Microsoft and AI partner OpenAI are investigating whether data output from OpenAI’s technology was obtained in an unauthorized manner by a group linked to DeepSeek, according toBloomberg. David Sacks, the White House’s AI and crypto czar, toldFox Newsthat it was “possible” that DeepSeek had stolen intellectual property from the United States.In an earnings call after the company results were released, Nadella said DeepSeek had shown “real innovations” and what was taking place was no different in optimization and improvements to AI than in regular computing.“For a hyperscaler like us, this is all good news,” he told investors.The Microsoft CEO was also asked about the Stargate Project, a joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank that did not include Microsoft, OpenAI’s top investor, announced by Trump last week. He pushed back on a suggestion that Microsoft would now be taking a backseat: “We remain very happy with the partnership with OpenAI.”The day before, OpenAI’s Sam Altman hadposted a picturewith Nadella, suggesting the alliance between his company and Microsoft was still strong.

These “dawn simulation” devices glow with gradually intensifying brightness as your wake-up time approaches, kickstarting your circadian rhythm before you get out of bed. For many users, this results in a happier, healthier start to the day.Not all sunrise alarm clocks are made equal – for instance, only some are bright enough to be medically certified as light-therapy devices forSad(seasonal affective disorder) and other disorders. We’ve indicated the alarm that has this certification in its spec below.I snuggled down with seven of the best-rated wake-up lights from Lumie, Beurer, Philips, Dreamegg, Momcozy and Hatch to find out which would make the most difference to my mornings.

I’ve often felt lousy first thing, after waking up to a minutes-long medley of smartphone alarms.When, at last, I drag myself out of bed, I frequently spend the day reviewing all kinds of gadgets, from Sad lamps to electric heaters. It’s a freelance job I’ve been privileged to do since 2017 – and as we tumbled dimly into 2025, the Filter gave me one of my most quietly life-improving assignments yet: reviewing sunrise alarm clocks.The extent to which these gadgets have improved my mornings has surprised me – although it was greater in some cases than others. Frankly, I’d like other groggy wakers to feel the same benefit, and my reviews are written and ranked with this in mind.

I considered the brightness of each alarm, how close the glow felt to real sunlight, and the audio quality. Above all, I reflected on how lively and refreshed I felt after waking up with each one.Many sunrise alarm clocks also have a sundown function, so I used this where available too. I also tried using each sunrise alarm clock as a reading light, to help me finish the day – as well as start it – smartphone-free.Some sunrise alarm clocks go even further, with additional features such as app operability, multiple alarm profiles and mood lighting. To ensure a thorough review of each sunrise alarm clock, I played around with every possible customisation option and functionality.The best sunrise alarm clocks in 2025View image in fullscreen‘An excellent sunrise alarm clock at a standout price’: the Lumie Sunrise Alarm.Photograph: Pete WiseBest overall sunrise alarm clock:Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100View image in fullscreenI woke up feeling great when I used the medical-grade Lumie Bodyclock Spark 100, which bathes the room in gradually intensifying, sun-like light for a set period before the alarm goes off.Why we love itThe device is supposed to realistically imitate the lightening shades of a sunrise – and it does so more convincingly than any other sunrise alarm clock I’ve tested. Depending on your chosen light intensity setting, it can get very bright.The Spark 100 also has a sunset feature that graduates through the same red, orange and white light colours used with the sunrise function, but in reverse order. After the sunset cycle, the light can either switch off entirely or remain in a gentle night-light mode, whichever you choose.Besides performing brilliantly as a wake-up light and sunset simulator, the Spark 100 is simply a nicely designed, well-made thing. I appreciated its soft-edged yet robust construction and handy features such as the cable organisation in the base. It’s a pleasure to have on the bedside table.Lumie is the brand that pioneered consumer-grade sunrise alarm clocks in the early 1990s and that pedigree shines through.It’s a shame that …the alarm tone sounds piercing at the higher three of its five volume levels.

In typical Philips fashion, it’s a good-quality, dependable product, with a middle-of-the-road design that won’t look out of place in many bedrooms.Why we love itSetup is incredibly slick – I was able to set my alarm time, sound and brightness by following the simple prompts on the device’s display, without having to consult the manual. Subsequently tweaking your alarm(s) takes a bit of practice, but you’ll master all the controls you need after a few days.The SmartSleep’s wake-up capabilities are impressive, combining brilliant light with a diverse choice of alarm sounds. It also has FM radio and 3.5mm auxiliary audio input options for the user who has tired of Alpine and gong bath soundscapes. There’s a 5V USB charging outlet at the rear of the lamp, too, which could free up a valuable bedside power socket.I loved using this model as a reading light, as well as a sunrise alarm. Even when a bright setting is selected, the light seems relatively mellow and restful, which helped me get to sleep after reading pulpy detective novels late at night. The light can be deactivated with a press.It’s a shame that …it costs such a lot. The SmartSleep has a hefty price to match its impressive performance.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sleep mode with sunset simulation, bedside lightFootprint:W22 x D12cmFeatures:FM radio, AUX audio input, “RelaxBreathe” breathing exercises, adjustable sunrise duration, snooze, up to two wake-up profiles (with separate alarms)Brightness settings:25£157.99 at Philips£157.99 at AmazonBest sunrise alarm clock for a gentle awakening:Lumie Sunrise AlarmView image in fullscreenImagine telling one of your ancestors that you were awoken this morning by your lamp, which was purring at you. I’m not pulling your leg, you might say, it’s all thanks to the Lumie Sunrise Alarm’s “kittens purring” alarm tone, which sits sweetly alongside four other natural sounds, including goats bleating and birdsong.Why we love itIn all seriousness, this is an excellent sunrise alarm clock, and it comes at a standout price. Its sunrise light subtly brightens during the minutes leading up to your chosen alarm time, producing a lovely awakening that really did remind me of natural light.I found it easy enough to set the Sunrise Alarm’s time and alarm, although pressing some of the buttons can be fiddly. Do keep the instruction manual handy, as there are lots of options and buttons to get your head around.It’s a shame that …it lacks a little bedside table appeal. But having said that, this sunrise alarm clock has incredible performance for the price.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, sunset, bedside lightFootprint:W17 x D9cmFeatures:mood lighting (six colours)Brightness settings:10£49.99 at Boots£36.80 at AmazonBest sunrise alarm clock for couples:Beurer Wake-up Light WL50View image in fullscreenThanks to its capability to save two alarms for different times (each with its own sound and light settings), the Beurer WL50 is a great choice for couples who get up at different times. That’s a rare feature in any sunrise alarm clock – let alone in such a reasonably priced model.Why we love itThe sunrise mode itself is gentle yet effective, and it’s easy to activate the device as a reading light with a simple, groggy tap. I really liked the alarm sounds you get with the WL50 too – which is just as well, as there are only two options.Perhaps that narrow choice of alarm tones sounds a little stingy, but it seems less so when you explore the WL50’s alternative audio options. It doubles up as an FM radio, with space to save up to 30 station presets, which you can listen to throughout the day or use as a livelier alternative to an alarm tone. Bluetooth connectivity and an AUX input expand your listening options further.Curiously, this sunrise alarm clock can be unplugged (when fully charged) and used on the go for up to three hours. It’s hard to imagine a situation wherein this would be useful, but I appreciate the gesture.It’s a shame that …the sound quality isn’t great (but it’s good enough for the half-awake).skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe FilterFree weekly newsletterGet the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s also tough to topple, soft around the edges and weighs just 0.55kg.Why we love itI’m neither a parent nor a baby, but I can certainly hear the soothing quality in the Sunrise Echo’s 30-strong repertoire of wake-up sounds, which includes lullabies alongside the usual nature sounds and meditative drones. The sound quality is impressive, with plenty of mid-range frequencies and a touch of bass. It’s nicely balanced, and not at all jarring.The Sunrise Echo creates a lilting light effect, rather than intensively light-therapising the sleeper as some higher-powered models do. It was easy to set up and customise the alarm using the well-labelled control buttons around the shoulder of the alarm clock. It was a little harder though, through a fug of sleepiness, to adjust the screen and light brightness via their respective dials on the rear of the device. Nonetheless, the Momcozy Sunrise Echo is an excellent, accessible option for users who don’t want a very bright wake-up.It’s a shame that …a few nice-to-have features are absent, including FM radio and multiple alarms.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, bedside lightFootprint:W19 x D8.5cmFeatures:night light (seven colours), sleep aid sounds, digital clock display, adjustable sunrise durationBrightness settings:30£54.99 at Boots£54.99 at AmazonThe best of the restView image in fullscreen‘A beautifully designed alarm clock’: the Dreamegg Sunrise 1.Photograph: Pete WiseDreamegg Sunrise 1View image in fullscreenBest for:soothing sleep soundsThis compact, great-looking device offers something different, with a selection of 29 ambient sounds that can be used as white noise to help you fall asleep. There are also five options for rousing you in the morning, including birdsong, a campfire crackling and, my favourite, waves breaking on a shore. For me, perhaps the only issue with this approach was that the sounds did a better job of putting me to sleep than they did of waking me up.The Sunrise 1 is a beautifully designed alarm clock, with a softly textured front and foolproof dimmer controls on either side to adjust the light level and digital display brightness. Reluctant risers will be pleased to note there’s a prominent snooze button at the top of the device – though, personally, I’ve rarely felt the need to use this feature while testing sunrise alarm clocks.It didn’t make the final cut because …its light is a little too dim for my taste.Certification:noneModes:sunrise alarm, white noise/sleep sounds, bedside lightFootprint:W15 x D7.3cmFeatures:sleep sound timer, nine light colours, five wake-up soundsBrightness settings:adjustable£89.99 at Dreamegg£89.99 at AmazonHatch Restore 2View image in fullscreenBest for:customisation and smartphone connectivityIn some respects, this premium sunrise alarm clock has an edge over its competitors. It’s a chic, simple device, with a nicely textured front (similar to that of the Dreamegg Sunrise 1) and two unmissable buttons to activate sleep sounds or wake-up mode.While the Restore 2 has a pleasant, moderately bright light in a nice range of colours, its sound library is the real standout here. Some of the options – all of which are configurable with theHatch Sleepsmartphone app – are beautifully textured and more lifelike than anything I heard from competing products.The same Hatch Sleep app gives you access to additional audio content such as relaxing meditations and inspirational moments – but only if you’re willing to shell out £4.99 a month for aHatch+subscription.

Sunrise alarm clocks tend to be far less bright than the average Sad lamp. With that said, the effect of light on our circadian rhythms has been shown to peak around the onset of dawn and early in the morning – so a mellow sunrise alarm may provide disproportionate benefits.If you’ve been diagnosed with seasonal affective disorder and are looking for a light therapy device, it’s best to ask your GP which product to use and how to get the most benefit. Sunrise alarm clocks that are classified as medical devices (indicated below each product above) are more likely to suit users seeking a therapeutic effect than models with no medical certifications.Why does it benefit us to wake with the sun?Getting up in the dark can feel awful, which makes a lot of sense because our bodies require light to wake up properly.Humans are diurnal, which means we’ve evolved to be more wakeful, energetic and capable of chasing mammoths over vast distances during daytime. When the brain recognises increasing light at dawn, it sends signals around other regions of the brain and to other organs to calibrate bodily processes including temperature regulation, hormone secretion and metabolism. And when darkness falls, the brain prepares us for sleep – a helpful effect that many of us compromise by looking at bright smartphone or laptop screens.These effects, which repeat every 24 hours, are our circadian rhythms. That is derived from the Latin wordscirca(approximately) anddiem(day), meaning around a day.So, the sun is the original and best alarm clock – activating our minds and bodies with light, rather than startling us awake with sound. Think of your sunrise alarm as a plucky stand-in to rely upon during the star’s shorter winter shifts.In the market for some new bed linen?

The surprising truth about brain rotIs screen use really sapping our ability to focus and lowering our IQs? The scientists who have actually analysed the data give their verdictAmy FlemingWed 29 Jan 2025 00.00 ESTShareAndrew Przybylski, a professor of human behaviour and technology at Oxford University, is a busy man. It’s only midday and already he has attended meetings on “Skype, Teams, in person and now FaceTime audio”. He appears to be switching seamlessly between these platforms, showing no signs of mental impairment. “The erosion of my brain is a function of time and small children,” he says. “I do not believe there’s a force in technology that is more deleterious than the beauty of life.”‘Brain rot’: Oxford word of the year 2024 reflects ‘trivial’ use of social mediaRead morePrzybylski should know: he studies technology’s effects on cognition and wellbeing. And yet a steady stream of books, podcasts, articles and studies would have you think that digital life is lobotomising us all to the extent that, in December, Oxford University Press announced that its word of the year was “brain rot” (technically two words, but we won’t quibble) – a metaphor for trivial or unchallenging online material and the effect of scrolling through it. All this has sown widespread fears that the online world that we – and our children – have little choice but to inhabit isaltering the structures of our brains, sapping our ability tofocusor remember things, and lowering our IQs. Which is a disaster because another thing that can significantly impair cognitive function isworry.It may come as some relief to hear, then, that for every alarmist headline there are plenty of neuroscientists, psychologists and philosophers who believe this moral panic is unfounded. “Since 2017, there has been a constant drumbeat of: ‘Screens and tech and social media are a different universe that is bad for you and bad for your kid,’” says Przybylski. “And two things happen. The first is low-quality research that confirms our biases about technology. It gets immediate press because it’s consistent with our existing biases. It’s really easy to publish low-quality research that kind of shows a correlation, and then exaggerate it, because it’ll get attention and it’ll get funding.”No one is denying that dangers lurk online, but that doesn’t mean you’re guaranteed to come to harm. “Living is risky, leaving the house is risky, crossing the street is risky,” says Przybylski. “These are all things that we have to help young people learn to do – to size up risks and act anyway. The internet is risky.”It seems like common sense that mental health has gone down as tech use has gone up. But it just isn’t scientificThere has also been, he says, “a real push in opinion pieces and popular-press books that are sloppy scientifically but stated so confidently. The ideas in these books are not peer-reviewed.” The published studies they cite tend to have small samples and no control groups, and to be based on associations rather than proving cause. “People will say: ‘The iPhone was invented in 2007 and Instagram became popular in 2012 and, oh my God, look, tech use has gone up at the same time mental health has gone down!’ It seems like common sense – that’s why you have this kind of consensus. But it just isn’t scientific.”In 2023, Przybylski and his colleagues looked at data from almost 12,000 children in the US aged between nine and 12and foundno impact from screen time on functional connectivity (“how different parts of the brain kind of talk to each other”, he explains), as measured with fMRI scans while the children completed tasks. They also found no negative impact on the children’s self-reported wellbeing. “If you publish a study like we do, where we cross our Ts, we dot our Is, we state our hypotheses before we see the data, we share the data and the code, those types of studies don’t show the negative effects that we expect to see.”View image in fullscreen‘Young people with access to phones say they’re happier across a wide range of metrics of wellbeing.’Photograph: Steven Robinson Pictures/Getty ImagesAnd of course no one talks about the positive effects of tech, such as finding connection and community. “If we zoom out, we find that if young people have access to phones that can connect with the internet, if they have high-speed internet at home, their wellbeing is higher. They say they’re happier across a wide range of metrics of wellbeing.“When the Lancet commission on self-harm does an evidence review, when the National Academy of Sciences in the US does an evidence review, when academic researchers do their meta scientific research, these things don’t come out in line with this tech panic,” he says. “That’s because this tech panic is not based on evidence. It’s based on vibes.”The “study”that spearheaded this cascade of concern in 2005, and is still quoted in the press today, claimed that using email lowered IQ more than cannabis. But Shane O’Mara, a professor of experimental brain research at Trinity College Dublin, smelled a rat when he couldn’t find the original paper. It turns out there never was one – it was just a press release. That finding was the result of one day’s consultancy that a psychologist did for Hewlett Packard. Hewould later statethat the exaggerated presentation of this work became the bane of his life.Alongside a survey on email usage, the psychologist conducted a one-day lab experiment in which eight subjects were shown to have reduced problem-solving abilities when email alerts appeared on their screens and their phones were ringing. He later wrote: “This is a temporary distraction effect – not a permanent loss of IQ. The equivalences with smoking pot and losing sleep were made by others, against my counsel.”The studies findingchanges to brain structuresound particularly alarming, even if they are looking specifically at people with “problematic internet use”, as opposed to the general population. The trouble with these studies, says O’Mara, “is that they can’t determine cause and effect. It may be that you go on the internet [excessively] because you’ve got this thing there already. We simply don’t know, because nobody has done the kind of cause-and-effect studies that you need, because they’re too big and too difficult.”Besides, brain structures change throughout life. Grey matter has been observed to decrease during pregnancy, for instance, and start regrowing after, along with other brain changes. “The brain is remarkably plastic,” agrees O’Mara.He also thinks we’re being deeply ahistorical when we berate ourselves for scrolling cute animal reels, celebrity regimes or cup-winning goals on social media. “Humans have always been distractible. We’ve always sought solace in the evanescent. If you look at the history of media in the UK, just as a simple example, back in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, how many millions of tabloids were sold every day? Staggering numbers, because people indulged in that stuff. This is something people have always done, and we’re being a bit moralistic about it.” Has the internet age led to greater numbers of plane crashes or patients dying on operating tables? “The answer is no: we’re much better at all of those things.”We’ve always had to watch out for our “attentional bottleneck”, he says. “For as long as I’ve been reading and researching in psychology, we’ve always taught our students: ‘Don’t do two things at once. You can’t.’” Multitasking and its associated dilution of efficacy were not invented by the internet. As Przybylski alluded to, having children is a classic route to task-juggling, with constant interruptions leading to intelligent adults not being able to string a sentence together. Similarly, if you use your smartphone while driving, of course you’ll increase the likelihood that you’ll crash.Be smart about how you use your devices. Manage the devices – don’t let them manage youWhat about the terrifying proclamations thattech is on the rise while IQ is in decline? I call Franck Ramus, the head of the cognitive development and pathology team at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris. Mercifully, he says it’s not yet clear if IQ is truly going down. Scores rose globally during the 20th century but growth started slowing towards the turn of the millennium. This plateau effect had long been expected, as we neared the limits of the human brain. “Height has been increasing over decades, but we’re never going to reach three metres, are we? So there are limits to human physiology, including brain size.”Any small IQ decreases that do seem to have been detected, Ramus says, aren’t considered conclusive at this point – the studies would need further replication. “There’s ameta-analysisof all the data until 2013, and the score seems to be progressing at least until 2010 or so. At the same time, it is true that some studies have documented a slight decrease in some countries. For example, there is a widely discussed Norwegian study that found a slight decrease in the last two decades. But there are also a greater number of studies that continue to observe increases.”View image in fullscreen‘Some apps and games may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence and other cognitive abilities.’Photograph: Alina Rudya/Bell Collective/Getty ImagesAs for screen exposure, he says, what do we even mean by that? “It could be anything. The screen is just a medium but what matters is content. So when you talk about screen, you might as well talk about paper. Paper is another medium, and anything can be written on paper.”This brings us neatly to Plato, who wrote about brain rot in relation to the invention of writing, says Tony Chemero, a professor of philosophy and psychology at the University of Cincinnati, whose 2021paperin Nature Human Behaviour asserted: “Technology may change cognition without necessarily harming it.” “This worry that people are having, Plato had as well, 2,500 years ago or so, writing about how the written word will make people stupid because their memories will be worse and they’ll be worse at telling stories.”Chemero does not love smartphones or AI – and laments the hassle the latter has created for professors like him having to find new ways to check their students aren’t handing in ChatGPT-generated work. “But the one thing that they don’t do is make us stupid,” he says. “Over the history of hominids, many of our biggest challenges have involved adapting to new kinds of environments – and that’s being smart. This is just a new environment we’re in.” So while he can still remember the phone numbers of high-school classmates, younger people’s brains are simply freed up for other activities. “What we really want from technology is to do the things that are difficult and boring, such as lots of complex calculation, rote memorisation: humans just aren’t very good at that without technology.”The relevant question, he says, is whatismemory in this situation, when we’re outsourcing some of it to tech? “Is it something that your brain does or is it an ability that you have? If [technology helps you] remember more things while your brain does something different, I don’t think that your memory is worse. It’s just different. What really matters is what we are able to do.” After all, the secret to human success has always hinged on our use of tools. “Being smart is being able to do lots of stuff. And I don’t think our phones are making us less able to do many things.”View image in fullscreen‘Go out for a walk. Get up and get moving. We just need to develop new ways of interacting with these media.’Photograph: Stanislaw Pytel/Getty ImagesGary Small, the chair of psychiatry at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, hasstudiedpotential harms and benefits of digital technology use. He too steers clear of studies based on mere associations. “To my knowledge,” he says, “there’s no compelling evidence that using digital technology or using devices is going to cause permanent brain damage.”In terms of the negatives, he believes that certain platforms and content can be addictive. “It could be porn, shopping, gambling. This technology heightens human behaviour, puts it on steroids, accelerates all these issues.” He mentions a study two years ago for which he and colleagues sent a group of 13-year-olds off to nature camp, and assessed their emotional intelligence (reading emotions on faces) and social intelligence (describing a social interaction) before and after. “And we found that five days away from screen time led to significant improvements in both, and we had a control group on that.” This showed, he says, that the negative effects of phone use are temporary, and go away when we put our phones away.And there are positives. “In our work, in our social lives, screens keep us connected. We can be much more efficient. We can get information much more rapidly. I can collaborate with people across the globe.” While the fatigue you can get from not taking breaks is real – “you can get physical symptoms, headache, neck pain, shoulder pain, mental fatigue, no question about it” – using the internet can be stimulating brain exercise in itself. “The study we did, for me at least, was cause for some optimism.” His team taught older people to search the internet while they were in an fMRI scanner and found that their neural activity increased.The study also states: “Certain computer programs and video games may improve memory, multitasking skills, fluid intelligence and other cognitive abilities. Some apps and digital tools offer mental health interventions providing self-management, monitoring, skills training and other interventions that may improve mood and behaviour.”So rather than hampering your cognitive (and possibly even parenting) abilities by fretting about brain rot, he says, “be smart about how you use your devices. Manage the devices – don’t let them manage you. I try to practise what I preach” – namely, by taking regular breaks and choosing appropriate modes of communication. “So many times I see these long email threads trying to deal with complex, nuanced issues. Best response is: ‘Call me or let’s meet.’”Przybylski, meanwhile, doesn’t shield his young children from smartphones or games consoles. “It’s perfectly OK to have some time dedicated to leisure, and why not some screen activities,” he says. Content quality is a consideration, and, “like every activity, it should be only a reasonable amount of time. I think many of the negative effects that are attributed to screen exposure are not intrinsic to screen exposure. They just reflect the fact that time can be lost for other activities that would have positive effects.”Likewise, O’Mara isn’t worried about spending most of his working day using a computer. “We just need to develop new ways of thinking about how we interact with these media. Go out for a walk. Get up and get moving. That’s very, very good for you, if you want to relieve a feeling of incipient anxiety caused by these things.” It’s all about balance and avoiding the temptation to multitask too much. O’Mara suggests making time for reading a book uninterrupted, or leaving your phone in another room while you’re watching TV. “Be intentional about your media choices,” he says.Explore more on these topicsHealth & wellbeingInternetNeuroscienceMental healthfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But please don’t do thatWed 29 Jan 2025 14.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 14.19 ESTShareWhy don’t you just leave? It’s always an incendiary question.When you ask it of people in bad romances or miserable careers, they can be forgiven for ghosting. The word “just” is the poison. As if leaving were simple. It is never simple. The reasons to stay in a job or a relationship – children, money, comfort, love – can be every bit as compelling as the reasons to hit the road.The same is true in California. The annualwildfiresmoved fast this year, and they were relentless. In less than a week, the fires razed more than 12,300 buildings in and around Los Angeles. Twenty-five people were killed. Smoke and toxins choke the air. More than80,000 evacueesare still shut out of their neighborhoods. The fires have only just stopped raging.If you’re an out-of-towner, studying the cyclical droughts and fires and surveying images of charred neighborhoods, it’s tempting to urge Californians to get the hell out.I’m a climate scientist and my house in LA burned down. My work has never been more real | Benjamin HamlingtonRead moreHold off. Hold the hell off. This is an extremely fragile time in California. When people lose their homes, whether in fire or evacuation, they also lose clothes, family photos, a world of creature comforts and often, most heartbreakingly, pets.In demanding that people leave their homes, we may be asking them to leave the most important thing of all: their communities and their loved ones. Is an actuary-calculated measure of safety from wildfires worth giving up intimacy and proximity to the people who make life worth living?David Graeber and David Wengrow put this calculus succinctly in The Dawn of Everything. “There is the security of knowing one has a statistically smaller chance of getting shot with an arrow,” they wrote. “And then there’s the security of knowing that there are people who will care deeply if one is.”Practically speaking, people who experience disruptionsaftera disaster deteriorate the fastest, saysKarestan Koenen, an expert in trauma atHarvard, who investigated the psychological effects of the 2018 Paradise fire in California. “To prevent long-term mental health consequences is to address people’s basic needs for a safe place to live, for food, for work,” says Koenen.And yet, the response to the California fires from some quarters has come dangerously close to impatience, even to I-told-you-so. “The biggest thing to note about these fires in LA” said one Oregon climate expert, “is that none of this is surprising.”No doubt this kind of observation is well-intended. But it’s not the time, and it never will be. Unsurprising tragedies – an addict’s overdose, a cancer patient’s death – are still tragedies.I lived in New York City on 9/11. As the two enormous holes were smoking, the air suffused with asbestos and death, people from out of town kept telling me the attacks were predictable to anyone who had followed developments in the Middle East. They said I should leave.These people too were well-intentioned. And maybe they were right. But the bodies hadn’t even been counted. We New Yorkers hadn’t yet been able to confer witheach otherabout the city’s present dangers and possible futures. We hadn’t grieved, we hadn’t taken inventories of our needs and our values, we hadn’t even started to plan.I’ve covered deadly wildfires for seven years. It doesn’t have to be this way | Dani AnguianoRead moreEventually, in public and private discussions among ourselves, New Yorkers, together, found clarity and confidence in our personal decision-making about whether to stay or leave. Some picked up stakes. Some stayed and took heavy precautions. Some kept calm and carried on. Some played it by ear.I’d like to say, as I empty my pockets and submit my bag to security goons outside every comedy show and piano recital, that I never regretted my decision. But I rethought it constantly. Now, 24 years later, I still do.Angelenos must be afforded the same agency, autonomy and space to make – and rethink – and qualify – and act on their own choices. All of us, no matter where we live during the climate crisis, deserve that.“Hundreds of millions of Americans are about to have a collision with planetary reality,” wrote the climate futurist Alex Steffen recently. Steffen, who teachesa course on climate and personal ruggedization, emphasizes that there is no one-size-fits-all response to that reality. Instead he urges participants to “become native to now”, “develop a healthy relationship to discontinuity” and “move from climate isolation to community”.Isolation – now that’s something weshouldall leave, along with know-it-all-ism and solitary bunker-building. As fires and floods increasingly define our world, we don’t need advice or loaded questions. We need solidarity, imagination and mutual respect.Virginia Heffernan is an American journalist and cultural criticExplore more on these topicsLos AngelesOpinionCalifornia wildfiresClimate crisisClimate scienceCaliforniaSeptember 11 2001commentShareReuse this content"

The right was furious – so were progressivesWed 29 Jan 2025 11.40 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 12.04 ESTShareOne certainty we can rely on in these distressing and turbulent times is that while every right-thinking person is looking with horror towards Donald Trump, many of us also reserve significant side-eye for each other. What is a political opposition without instant, feverish infighting, the pettier the better? I refer you to Selena Gomez’snow-deleted Instagram videoon Monday in which the actor sniffled and wept about Trump’s immigration crackdown. The 32-year-old was instantly trolled by Trump-loving monsters, but there were plenty of sighs and tuts coming at her from Trump haters, too. Gomez had Done the Wrong Protest and would have to pay.The difficulty of course is that Trump’s “flood the zone” approach in his first week of office has made organising a response to him incredibly hard, not just collectively but at the individual level. What is the right reaction to a president who, five minutes into his tenure,launches a crypto coinin his own name, appointsa TV hostto run the US military and attempts to freeze billions of dollars in federal funding – and that’s before you get to his interesting take on the14th amendment?One response – which achieves absolutely nothing but can be hard to resist – is to cave in to the guilty suspicion that, in this bleak new world, all displays of frivolity are wrong. Not just frivolity, but anything that might be deemed trivial, self-serving or irrelevant to the calamity at hand. A similarly queasy vibe took off in the weeks and months after September 11, the so-called death of irony period that was dispatched pretty much overnight when people started tagging the joke phrase “or the terrorists have won” on to the end of any statement announcing a trivial desire.As in 2001, part of the anxiety of this moment isn’t so much the possibility that doing something silly or fun while millions are at risk of deportation is wrong, but that it will look wrong to those keeping score. And there are a lot of scorekeepers out there, the self-appointed hall monitors who pop up on social media to scold and one-up their friends and acquaintances for, as they see it, doing or saying the wrong things about Trump. Over the past week I have seen online skirmishes between Trump haters in which one might call out another for being too “giggly” or self-satisfied or irresponsible in their statements – or, using the strongest language available to people of British origin, accuse someone of “being unhelpful” in their pushback against Trump. The subtext of which is: “I am taking this more seriously than you are.”Of course by criticising people for wrongly criticising others, I’m aware I am merely expanding the ever-increasing circles of leftwing policing so that, eventually, the dog will eat not just its own tail but its own shoulders and head. I’m also being disingenuous about the amusement there is to be had here – in these dark times, there is a certain low-level enjoyment in watching bun fights take off between people one was inclined to hate before Trump took office and with whom one claims no solidarity now. I spent fully an hour last night sharing screen grabs from social media with friends that captured the huffy and frankly hilarious moral one-upmanship of some of these people.Which brings us, in a roundabout way, to Gomez and the problem of celebrity involvement in current affairs. Popularised during the pandemic, this is the phenomenon of famous people making sad faces on social media in what is either a well-meant but misguided effort to put their social capital to good use or else a cynical piece of attention-seeking. In the Gomez video this week, the star ofOnly Murders in the Buildingsniffed and sobbed and covered her face while offering muffled condolences to those getting deported. She said: “I’m so sorry, I wish I could do something.”Selena Gomez laughs off Republican calling to ‘deport’ her over Ice raid videoRead moreAs these things go, it was a good deal less skin crawling thanAriana Grande’s post-election threatto hold “the hand of every person who is feeling the immeasurable heaviness of this outcome today”, a statement that around my way triggered a wave of prim “no thank you!”s. And it seems likely to me that Gomez, who is of Mexican heritage, was acting out feelings she genuinely had. Fair play to her, I say.Anyway, when things kick off between people on the same side, everything always ends in a pissing contest along the lines of: “You see fit to criticise me, but what areyoudoing to help the cause?” To which the aggressor may respond with versions of: “I’m not telling you because I don’t need to boast about it.” Which I take to mean: nothing at all.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

And it could get far worseWed 29 Jan 2025 10.30 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 13.02 ESTShareThree days after Donald Trump withdrew the United Statesfrom the World Health Organization, a Long Island farmbegan euthanizing 100,000 ducksdue to an outbreak of bird flu. It marked the latest spread of a virus that has alsokilled more than 100 millionchickens and turkeys nationwide. Though fewer than 70 Americanshave contracted the illnessso far, scientists have warned that this strain may be just“one mutation away”from achieving the capacity for rapid transmission.Whether or not those predictions go the way of Chicken Little’s, bird flu has already proved a disaster for humans and animals alike. Frominfected petstoegg prices soaringby 37%, Americans have abundant cause for concern and complaint. Amid the pathogenic unpredictability, another fact remains clear: the main culprit here is factory farming.By cramming animals into facilities so crowded they oftencan’t even sit down, industrial agriculture has assembled the perfect laboratory for novel viruses. That’s why stopping bird flu in its tracks, and preventing untold future pandemics, depends on regulating factory farming now.Over the past couple of decades, corporate agriculture has finally begun facing scrutiny for its cruel and unusual treatment of animals. At the Obama era’s idealistic outset, documentaries such asFood, Inc, and books like Jonathan Safran Foer’sEating Animalsdid much to expose the outrages being committed by the now-infamous conglomeratesMonsantoandTyson Foods. Chickensbred to grow so fastthey can’t walk, pigslocked in cratestoo small to turn around in, dairy cows thatnever step outdoorsor graze – these are the daily living conditions forthe 1.7 billion animalscurrently trapped on US factory farms.The journalist Eric Schlosser, one of Food, Inc’s primary interviewees,has also reportedon this industry’s human toll. Thanks toReagan-era deregulation, meatpacking plants eliminated unionized positions and replaced them with undocumented immigrants toiling for half the pay, despite their job carrying the risk of toxic fume exposure, antibiotic-resistantEcoli, and loss of limbs. Because these largely uninsured farm workersface termination and even deportationfor seeking medical care, they have little incentive to self-reportillnesses like bird flu, fostering ideal conditions for a virus to spread undetected.But no amount of scandal seems to stall factory farming, which hasgrown by 6%since 2017. The explanation is the typical one for Washington: lobbyists. Big agriculturedonated nearly $200mduring the 2024 campaign, mostly to Republicans. Agribusiness also spentmore than half a billion dollarsto influence the farm bill that doles out the industry’s lucrative subsidies. In his first term, Trump killednew USDA regulationsburnishing animal welfare standards, including for the chickens currently ravaged by bird flu. Though Joe Bidenreinstated those rules, he slowballed new restrictions byinsisting on further “evaluation”.Still, a few brave politicians have waged a rather lonely crusade against factory farming, with arguably none more devoted to the cause than now retiredrepresentative Earl Blumenauer, a Democrat from Oregon. The progressive environmentalist spent 28 years in Congress advocating for animal welfare and family farms. As co-chair of the Animal Protection caucus, hegathered bipartisan supportfor legislation that cracked down on animal fighting, wild animal trading, and cruel horse training techniqueslike soring. But his passion project wasthe Food and Farm Act, which would have reined in funding for factory farms. Naturally, itnever left committee.There are some signs, albeit with significant caveats, that the Trump administration could stumble into progress on this issue. The presumptive health and human services secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr may be the strongest critic of big food to join the cabinet in half a century. He hasambitiously pledgedto “reverse 80 years of farm policy”, although much of that decision-making belongs to the secretary of agriculture. Still, he coulduse his authorityover the FDA to ramp up agricultural inspections, investigatethe pollution of drinking waterby manure, and haltthe dangerous overuse of antibioticson factory farms. But Kennedy’srepeated endorsementof raw milk, one ofbird flu’s primary vectors, doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. For that reason – andsome others– whether he will be confirmed remains an open question.The mantle for raising the alarm falls, then, to the adviser Trump heeds most reliably: the headlines. But right now, the outcry from corporate media has sounded muffled at best. During the 2024 presidential debates, moderators didn’t ask asinglequestionabout the previous pandemic or this incipient one. While the New York Times has published a smattering of articles about bird flu, calling out the link between industrial farming and our current public health emergency has been mostly consigned toletters to the editorand a fewstrayop-eds. In contrast, non-profit outlets likeSentientandCivil Eatshave dedicated their entire newsrooms to covering industrial agriculture. If cable news and papers of record follow their lead, the consumer-in-chief’s attention or aggravation just might be piqued.It might also inspire some deja vu. In October of 2020, Trumplamented: “You turn on CNN, that’s all they cover. ‘Covid, Covid, Pandemic, Covid, Covid.’”Should Trump choose to wait and see on factory farming, the chances are increasing by the day that such a chant returns – and once again, his hopes for a soaring legacy will be for the bird.Katrina vanden Heuvel is editor and publisher of the Nation, she is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and has contributed to the Washington Post, New York Times, and Los Angeles TimesExplore more on these topicsUS politicsOpinionBird fluDonald TrumpFarmingAgricultureRobert F Kennedy JrTrump administrationcommentShareReuse this content"

I feel like I am doing a lot for my $45 per hour. I am caring for a woman in the throes of labour. Her eyes are glassy, her vocalisations frantic. She is in transition, a time in labour you can feel terrified and out of control. I hold her and ground her with my well-practised voice, refined from more than 10 years of experience.I set up a baby Resuscitaire in case it is needed. I document heart rates and clean up body fluids while also educating a student working with me. We write down vital signs and draw up drugs ready to administer. Do you know that midwives can initiate dosages of morphine, antibiotics and other drugs without having to bother a doctor?My $45 per hour also means that I get to see a life emerge. I get to see the dark hair of this new person before anyone else. I get to gasp. Crow. Delight. Whoop. Blink back tears as I hold a new life. I pass her to the mother, my second midwife passes me a warm towel to rub this baby into life.It’s your birthday! Take your first breath little one.But suddenly, things aren’t running as smoothly. There is more blood than I’d like to see. But that’s OK. If this was someone you loved, I’d know how to keep them safe.‘I felt guilty’: women reveal harrowing details to groundbreaking NSW birth trauma inquiryRead moreFor $45 per hour, I can put a cannula in so we can give life-saving medications. I can hang fluids, I can birth the placenta and I can reassure the woman as to what I need to do to stop the bleeding. Luckily I am not alone in this. I’ve pressed the buzzer, called for my midwifery and medical colleagues to come help. But for those critical first minutes, it is me, a woman in a highly gendered profession, underpaid and undervalued. Will there be enough colleagues available to answer my buzzer if the NSW government continues to make nurses and midwives thelowest paid of our profession in the country? Do you worry about the impact this will have on mothers and their babies?I do a lot for $45 per hour, and I don’t feel the NSW government appreciates that. I worry that it has an old-fashioned view of our profession – or maybe of women and their needs. Do you know midwives and nurses have a highly pressured, clinically skilled role? We assess, triage, cannulate, suture, medicate and resuscitate, and all while providing the soothing, reassuring care that many of us were drawn to the profession to do.And what about at 4am? I am now paid $51 – that extra 15% is meant to compensate for the physical health consequences and psychological impact of compulsory night shifts. I don’t get to nap or relax. We have less staff on at night. For my extra $6 per hour, I am one of the most senior midwives managing a heart-stopping (for me – breath-stopping for the baby) shoulder dystocia in the middle of the night. It takes a long time for the doctors to arrive to my emergency buzzer, but luckily I have the skills to internally rotate the baby’s shoulders that were stuck like cement for five long minutes. The smell of my cold sweat stays with me all night. It stinks of the fear and panic I feel, wondering if I’ll ever free this baby, if the resuscitation we do together after would be enough. It stinks of my exhaustion from being awake with my own kids all day, before having to work all night. Fifteen percent isn’t enough. Male-dominant industries compensate their night-shift workers with not just a better increase in pay but extra benefits and compensation, so why not us?NSW health minister apologises to women failed by maternity care after birth trauma inquiryRead moreIf you saw me give the first breaths to your grey lifeless baby, bringing forth that yearned-for sound of a cry, would you pay more attention to what we are asking for? Fairer pay and better conditions. We are not interested in claims from the state government that it is offering “more” than previous governments. Don’t tell us you can’taffordto. Prioritise us. Value us.I am ashamed to admit that I worked on the last strike day. But as a single mother of three, I desperately needed the overtime money of a double shift. It meant I was on shift from 7am till 10pm. I don’t think the women who came in to have a baby deserved a tired midwife. As the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association (NSWNMA) argues,midwives are on 2007 wagespaying 2025 prices, and with clinical skills and the responsibilities that are vastly different to what they were when these wages were first negotiated.I am asking the NSW government to have empathy and compassion but also common sense. Supporting women to have safe and healthy pregnancies, births and postnatal experiences has got to be a core priority. Maybe the old adage of “you can judge a society by how it treats its most vulnerable” could guide you. Birthing women are strong, courageous and incredible. But they are vulnerable too. And they deserve appropriately paid midwives with safe ratios and work conditions.Oceane Campbell is a midwife and author living in NSW.

Not among the VIPs in that Oxfordshire hall but far outside, from a woman in Newcastle.I have told her story before: as the Brexit vote loomed, a London professor warned the geordie heathens that leaving Europe would harm the UK’s economy. Then one of the aforementioned heathens yelled back: “That’s your bloody GDP. Not ours.”Rude, crass? Absolutely. Yet she raised one of the big questions for the Westminster classes, which cuts to the very heart of politics. Jabbing a finger into a navy lapel, it demands: who are you actually helping? The answer sealed the fate of George Osborne and David Cameron, and it will prove as decisive for Reeves and Keir Starmer.No one can be unclear what thisLabourgovernment wants. “Growth, growth, growth,” clapped Reeves this week, as she strode into a meeting of Labour MPs. Even after the Christmas pantos, ministers are staging their own version of Peter Pan: they close their eyes – andbelieve! The prime minister dreams of a “growth lever”; the chancellor wants everyone to “start saying ‘yes’”. And from the stalls cry the humble voters: further and faster!Magic shall happen. The G-word will be slapped across everything that moves – and quite a few things that don’t any more. Whitehall has already stuckout a press releaseclaiming “the need for people to queue at the local council to register the death of a loved one” is “getting in the way of growth”. That’s the real downer about death – it gums up income streams.What ministers want is photos of them wearing hard hats and hi-vis. Here is Angela Rayner, whooping it up in front of a half-built housing estate. There is Ed Miliband, peering intensely at a windfarm. You may recall another politician trying this tactic: George Osborne touring construction sites to distract attention from the misery he was inflicting on the working poor. Even as Labour ministers rejoice in infrastructure projects to come on stream at the earliest by the end of the 2020s, their chancellor is readying another burst of austerity for this April. From next Tuesday, the Office for Budget Responsibility will start laying out how far adrift public finances are from the fiscal rules that Reeves claims are “non-negotiable”. With the economy flatlining since summer, she is preparing to cut social security, as well as civil servants’ jobs.What would our heckler in Newcastle make of this? I think we can guess. What drove so many towards Brexit or Jeremy Corbyn or even Boris Johnson was a failed economic model that boasted of itslow tax, low costs and low regulation. Now that low tax is no longer an option and Britain has broken off its close trading relationship with Europe, the Labour government is stripping out whatever regulation it can.The same ministers who harrumphed about rip-off prices for Oasis tickets now order watchdogs to be “pro-growth”. They oust one chair of the competition regulator to bring in a guy from Amazon – lambasted by Reeves in 2018 as“one of the new monopolies”that “block competitive markets, avoid taxation and impose oppressive control over their employees”. Starmer, Miliband and the five other cabinet members who in 2018 rejected a third runway at Heathrow as a climate disaster have lost their sense of shame. In the name of growth, the governmentsupports car finance companies over consumers, and calls for mortgage lenders to be allowed toload up first-time buyers with more debt, even while financial regulators warn parliament that this will heap upbad loans and fraud.Growth strategy? This is more like a trolley dash, grabbing whatever’s close to hand and might do. Forswearing big tax rises before the election, increasing taxes by £40bn after it; a giant fund for investment in green energy that shrinks before our eyes;“growth everywhere”, which turns into sweeties for London and the south; austerity is over, apart from for all those government departments starved of funds. The same week that Joe Biden warned of anew tech oligarchy, his former students in Downing Street cosied up to the AI sector.A Labour government that promised change is, for now, trying to attract investment – and doing so in the most craven, credulous fashion imaginable. So the chancellor who vowed to stamp on tax loopholes for non-doms now says she is “listening to the concerns that have been raised by the non-dom community”. The non-dom community! Here is identity politics at its most fraudulent. Whatever next, a Non-Dom History Month? Note that the chancellor hasn’t paid so much attention to those who can’t afford to heat their house this winter.Such politics would once have been labelled trickle-down – except not much actually trickled down at all. As the Foundational Economy Collective of academics and researchers show, of all the growth in take-home pay between 1999 and 2020, the top 10% of households made off with 25%,while the bottom 10% got only 3%. The papers that were full of talk about a cost of living crisis no longer talk about it, but for poor people it hasn’t gone away. Between 2022 and the eve of last summer’s general election, the researchers found, the poorest 10% were spending 95% of any increase in disposable pay on food, rent, energy and transport – the essentials to get by.Whose bloody GDP is it? Rather than offering big companies sweeteners in exchange for photo opportunities, and claiming it’s in aid of growth, Labour ministers should instead focus on protecting households from utility bills and transport and housing costs, which remain high and will not be falling far any time soon.The polling shows that is what voters actually want. Two surveys this week alone show the cost of living near the top of thereasons voters give for being angry at Starmer, just after cutting winter fuel allowance. But I suspect ministers will not listen until next year, by which time the photo ops will not have translated into better polling and Nigel Farage’s troops will be preparing to wipe the floor with Labour in theelections for the Welsh Senedd.

For damaging picture frames, obstructing the road, or justtalkingabout obstructing the road, they have received punishments that we would normally reserve for serious crimes. People trying to draw attention to the government failure to confront the cause of the climate crisis were imprisoned for up to five years.These sentenceshave been condemnedas draconian by Amnesty International, as “a grave erosion of … freedoms” by Liberty, as “a profound injustice” by Global Witness, and as “not acceptable in a democracy” by a special rapporteur for the UN. They represent the terrifying decline of our nation, from a beacon of tolerance with a clear division between politics and policing, towards an oppressive state where that dividing line is becoming harder and harder to discern. Regardless of your politics and what you are standing for, the right of peaceful protest is a vital sign of a healthy democracy and an essential guardrail against authoritarian politicians and reckless companies.I have campaigned inside and outside parliament, and in 2013 I was arrested for taking part in a peaceful protest at a proposed fracking site in West Sussex. Police forcefully removed me and my fellow protesters, and I was charged with a public order offence, of which I was later cleared.I took action on that day because I felt I had exhausted all democratic options – and as MP for Brighton Pavilion, I had more options than most. Residents living around the proposed fracking sites felt their concerns had been ignored, andpolls consistently showthat the practice is deeply unpopular with the wider population. Many people protested, and in 2019, the government finally saw sense andimposed a fracking banthat remains in force in England today. This was a clear example of concerned citizens standing up to the vested interests of companies and the misguided actions of the government to bring about change. Protest is part of how democracy works, and it has led to many of the freedoms we enjoy today including a two-day weekend, national parks and votes for women.I was jailed for four years for a non-violent climate protest – this is my prison diaryRead moreThe appeal this week is proof that it is becoming much harder for citizens to make their voices heard – whether it’s about the cost of living, the climate crisis or the state of our polluted rivers. Recent governments have expanded the legal definition of public nuisance to include anything that causes “more than minor” disruption, including making noise. Police have new powers to preemptively stop and search or arrest protesters. In just one month at the end of 2023,police arrested at least 630peaceful protesters.Research showsthat British police arrest environmental protesters at a rate of nearly three times the global average.For many, arrest is just the start of their ordeal: sentences for causing a public nuisance can range up to 10 years in prison. One protester appealing this week has been jailed for five years for taking part in a Zoom call about a planned climate protest. Forty people spent Christmas Day behind bars for voicing their dissent to war and the climate crisis.The scope of the appeal is limited tochallenging the sentences. A decision to reduce these over-harsh punishments would set an important precedent for future cases. However, the underlying problem of the excessive powers granted to police and the courts to arrest and prosecute peaceful protesters, which increased dramatically under the last government, is being happily accommodated by this one, along with tabloid rhetoric to demonise the protesters in civil society.Keir Starmer and his government must know, deep down, that this is wrong. In a past life, the prime minister himself represented climate activists like those in court this week. The home secretary, Yvette Cooper, haspreviously saidshe fears that certain measures in the Public Order Act could “erode historic freedoms of peaceful protest”. And yet this government seems perfectly content to continue sleepwalking into many of the practices used by authoritarian states.Caroline Lucas is an environmental activist and former Green MPExplore more on these topicsProtestOpinionJust Stop OilCaroline LucasSentencingcommentShareReuse this content"

He knows that it will soon be his turn to be arrested by Stalin’s secret police and is prepared for it.Power in the Soviet Union had been seized by many who were uneducated and coarse, driven by a vindictiveness amplified by the sense that they were merely taking what was rightfully theirs. Shostakovich, along with writers such as Leonid Andreyev, Ivan Bunin, Alja Rachmanowa and others left strikingly similar depictions of the upheaval caused by the Stalinist purges: society was divided and riven by fear, anxiety, acts of revenge, lists of inconvenient people, destruction. Brute force prevailed over talent, expertise and education. The winner took all.Slovakia is (for now) a member of the EU, it is (for now) a democratic country and has not (so far) endured a bloody or violent coup. But the atmosphere today feels to me in some ways quite similar to that described in Russia 100 years ago.Since the populist Robert Fico’s return for a fourth term as prime minister in October 2023, Slovakia has pivoted from the west to the east and is drifting away from liberal democracy to what looks like authoritarianism. A long-term critic of the EU and Nato, Fico hasquestioned Russia’s roleas the aggressor in the war in Ukraine, threatening to stop electricity supplies to Kyiv.In December Fico travelled to Moscow for a private meeting with Vladimir Putin,only the third western leaderto do so since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In response, Slovaks have taken to the streets to voice their anger about the country’s future, their support for Ukraine and for Slovakia’s continued membership of the EU and Nato. The most recent protest, drew more than 100,000people, many calling for Fico to resign.But how does one defend democracy if the state’s very representatives are involved in systematically dismantling it? And how could the achievements of the 35 years since theVelvet Revolutionhave been upended so quickly?Slovakia’s artistic and cultural community has always been at the forefront of the pro-democracy cause. That was the case during the Velvet Revolution and in the 1990s protests against prime minister Vladimír Mečiar’s government. Thirty years later, in the massrallies that followed the murderof the investigative journalist Ján Kuciak, it was the voices of Slovakian artists and cultural workers that sounded loudest about the threat to freedom and democratic values. That uprising led to the collapse of Fico’s third government.No wonder, then, that attempts to silence government critics are now targeted on the arts, culture and NGOs. Under the guise of balancing budgets, Fico has brought in sweeping institutional changes and taken a scythe to sources of funding for culture. Those who can’t be sacked or silenced are starved and exhausted out of existence.Tens of thousands in Slovakia protest against PM’s shift towards RussiaRead moreWhile the media, judiciary, police, prosecution and security services – key areas by which democracy stands or falls – have been subjected to similarly radical shake-ups, a look back at the assault on the arts over the past year tells an alarming story.One of Fico’s first and most controversial appointments wasMartina Šimkovičová. The former TV presenter, who lost her job at a private TV station in 2015 foranti-refugee posts on social media, was appointed minister for culture.Šimkovičová, a member of the far-right Slovak National party, set the tone for her new role by stating that “the culture of the Slovak peoplemust be Slovak and no other”. Her head of office, Lukáš Machala, is a man who questionswhether the Earth is really round(this is not a joke).View image in fullscreenSlovakian minister for culture, Martina Šimkovičová, takes the oath in the Slovak parliament, Bratislava, 25 October 2023.Photograph: CTK/AlamyŠimkovičová quickly embarked on a wholesalepurge across the arts. She started by sacking alarge number of culture ministry staff, followed by weekly dismissals of key employees in almost every state-run cultural institution, including the National Library. Hardly a week has gone by without a leading figure in a well-regarded museum, theatre, gallery or conservation agency being fired. Those who have not yet been removed or demoted are dreading their turn, which they know is only a question of time.One of the most egregious examples of the purge is what happened at the Slovak National Gallery (SNG). It underwent an extraordinarily thorough and, by Slovakian standards, successful reconstruction under its director, Alexandra Kusá, who turned it into a modern, acclaimed and popular institution. But in August last year, shortly after the big opening of the refurbished galleries, Kusá was dismissed.This led to apublic protestand theresignations of a number of key SNG staff, not only in solidarity with Kusá but citing untenable working conditions. Alarmed by the situation, two partner museums, in Austria and Germany, have taken the unprecedented step ofwithdrawing from an exhibitionthey had long planned jointly with SNG, because as their letter noted, “the current situation poses a potential risk to the items to be lent, for the protection of which the institutions themselves are responsible”. Kusá has accused accused the culture ministry of launching “an era of bullying and intimidation”.A hundred National Gallery employeesresigneden masse this week and the biggest sponsor stopped its financial support.The blows keep coming. The functioning of the Slovak Arts Fund (modelled on Arts Council England) has been brought to a complete standstill and rendered incapable of allocating and disbursing grants. With other funding schemes paralysed, thousands of artists, professional and amateur alike, from folklore through literature, theatre and the visual arts face uncertainty as to whether they will be able to survive financially. Even works to restore dilapidated historic buildings have been halted after the abolition of arange of culture ministry departments, including the one tasked with the preservation of monuments.The director of the Slovak Literary Centre, the agency responsible for promoting Slovakian literature at home and abroad, has been replaced by a figure who is accused ofties withconspiracy platforms. The head of the national heritage office was dismissed in December. As if this were not enough, the writer Michal Hvorecký and the visual artist Ilona Németh say the culture minister has filedcriminal complaintsagainst them.For a year now, the arts community has implored the government to listen to sense, but to no avail.Two petitionsfor the dismissal of Šimkovičová have appeared in the space of six months, garnering record numbers of signatures.Castles and historical landmarks havehoisted black flagsin protest. At the Slovak National Theatre, another institution whose director was dismissed without notice, actors have taken to reading statements before or after performances.Slovakia’s president, Peter Pellegrini, has ignored pleas from the arts community for a meeting. His continued silence prompted Zdena Studenková, an acclaimed Slovakian actor, toturn downa new year honour.More than 700 psychiatrists and psychologists have signed an open letter to the PM, as have more than2,000 academicsand almost 6,000workers in education. But since Fico’s Moscow visit, such small-scale protests have widened into the mass demonstrations we’ve been seeing.Fico says he has no intention of stepping down. And in the context of other crises plaguing Europe, the dismantling of Slovakian culture may seem insignificant. But a vast machine now appears aimed at unravelling our democracy. Every regional museum closure or curator sacking is a another step in that process.

Just ask Ed MilibandRafael BehrLabour is constantly torn between its self-image as a party of radical change and its fear of alienating voters with the wrong kind of radicalismWed 29 Jan 2025 01.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 06.51 ESTShareWhenKeir Starmerbecame Labour leader he was unpractised in politics. For advice, he naturally turned to someone who had done his job before and with whom he had a good personal rapport: Ed Miliband.As Starmer grew in confidence he stayed friendly with Miliband, deferential to his status as a veteran of government and appreciative of his sincere enthusiasm for the energy and climate brief. But the new leader was also ruthlessly focused on winning power, and increasingly alert to toxicities in theLabourbrand. He was persuaded that the journey to Downing Street could be completed only by jettisoning policy baggage and paying less heed to people associated with past failure.Miliband’s counsel was downgraded. I remember one shadow cabinet minister observing acidly that “if Ed wants to be helpful he should offer to visit every constituency Labour party in the country and explain how to lose an election”.The arc of Miliband’s influence describes a tension that is still unresolved in the Starmer project – between Labour’s self-image as a party with radical purpose and the constant fear of alienating voters with the wrong kind of radicalism.The pattern was prefigured in the fate of the £28bn annual investment in low-carbon technology thatRachel Reevespledged in a speech to Labour conference in 2021. She said she would be Britain’s first “green chancellor”.Reeves, a former Miliband protege, had held the shadow Treasury brief for less than six months. She later came to see the £28bn figure as a fiscal and political liability – a heap of ammunition for Tory election propaganda that would depict Labour as debt-addicted spendthrifts. The green chancellor wrought herself instead into an “iron chancellor”. Miliband’s climate-friendly industrial strategy made it into the 2024 manifesto, but with a drastically reduced budget.1:43Rachel Reeves: I will be UK's first green chancellor  – videoThat was still a more generous upfront funding commitment than most other departments received. The ambition to make Britain a “clean energy superpower” was, after all, one of the five missions that Starmer declared as the motivating purpose of a future Labour government.But by last month, the missions were deemed too vague. The message was rewritten with “milestones” to measure progress. Climate action became a sub-clause appended to a promise of lower household energy bills.Now, once again, the government is restating its ambitions. And, once again, that means a leaner ration for Miliband. Reeves has declared that economic growth is theoverriding goalin every department. If that involves new runways atHeathrow and Gatwick, the energy secretary – a longstanding opponent of airport expansion – will just have to suck it up.His compensation is that the pro-growth agenda also entails a massive liberalisation of planning regulations. That will make it easier to erect the turbines and the electricity pylons necessary to meet goals for greener energy production.Climate policy, growth and political strategy don’t have to be in conflict. The case for transition to low-carbon industry can be made in terms of public benefit (people like clean air and fear extreme weather); national security (Vladimir Putin doesn’t control the flow of air to windfarms); and future prosperity (the world needs this stuff and Britain should be at the forefront of developing it).But there are awkward trade-offs between long- and short-term effects. Boosting economic activityright nowis carbon intensive. Some of the cost of switching to greener tech has to be borne by consumers. Voters who have endured years of shrinking living standards and rising inflation are easily spooked by talk of taxes on gas boilers and deadlines to swap their old petrol cars for swanky electric ones.Across Europe, populist rightwing parties have made gains by casting environmental policies as expensive luxuries charged to ordinary folk by smug elites. Nigel Farage wants to scrap net zero targets. The Tories, under Kemi Badenoch, will gravitate in the same direction.The potential resonance of an anti-green backlash among swing voters is a concern for Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff and the man in charge of plotting the route to a second term. McSweeney’s internal critics accuse him of an unhealthy obsession with Reform UK and an outdated hostility to anything that carries even the whiff of leftism. His allies say he is shrewdly mapping battle lines for the next election. Either way, allergic sensitivity to anything that Conservative media like to caricature as “eco-zealotry” has crept into the government’s economic message.Labour MPs submit to the logic that a growing economy is obviously better than a recession and Reeves’s plan is the only one they have. But confidence in the chancellor’s judgment has been shaken by the turbulence of Labour’s first six months in office – messy fights with pensioners and farmers; the lack of political or economic dividend from the budget.Reeves seems to have overestimated how grateful the public, businesses and financial markets would be for the end of Conservative rule. Voters were supposed to admire the early infliction of pain for the sake of fiscal responsibility. Investors who had taken fright at Tory chaos would flock to Labour’s newly stable regime and not sweat tax rises. The failure of any such credit to turn up in the government’s accounts has rattled the Treasury.In Reeves’s defence, she has been consistent. Most of the package touted as a plan to unleash Britain’s productive potential builds on things she said in opposition. And it might work.Rachel Reeves tells MPs of plans to go ‘further and faster’ in pursuit of growthRead moreBut there are worrying symptoms of panic. Governments with stockpiles of pro-growth policy don’t publicly urge regulators to come up with ideas of their own. The complaint that rumbles along the Labour benches, quietly for now but at rising volume, is that the leadership still, after all this time, can’t narrate economic action and political strategy as one compelling story.There might be a thread linking it all together, but it isn’t obvious. In opposition, Reeves elaborated a distinctly social democratic theory of “securonomics” – an assertion of the state’s duty to cultivate stable conditions for investment and protect citizens from global volatility.One inspiration was Joe Biden’s multitrillion-dollar programme of green subsidies. Reevescitedthe US’s grand adventure in eco-industrial activism as proof that international trends were moving Labour’s way. Donald Trump’s election victory killed that argument.What was advertised in opposition as an intellectually coherent and globally pioneering new economic model looks more like a disjointed sequence of tactical expedients. Instead of marching boldly forwards, Labour lurches from defensive crouch to arm-waving frenzy and back again. The signal goes out that Starmer and Reeves are determined to get the economy growing. What comes across is the message that their horizons are shrinking.Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsLabourOpinionClimate crisisEd MilibandKeir StarmerRachel ReevescommentShareReuse this content"

After the release of theDecember quarter inflation figures, the RBA not only should cut interest rates, but it almost certainly will. Failure to do so would be one of the most political and misguided decisions the RBA would have made in recent history.The December quarter inflation figures released on Wednesday showed prices in 2024 rose just 2.4% – well within the RBA’s target range and the trimmed mean measure of core inflation slowed appreciably from 3.5% to 3.2%.If the graph does not display click hereThis was the last major set of data everyone has been waiting for in order to gauge what the Reserve Bank board will do when it finally (after two months off) meets on 17 and 18 February. Now all the boxes have been ticked.Inflation figures to ‘make or break’ the case for an Australian pre-election February rate cutRead moreAnd sure, the December quarter figures were more of a confirmation of what most already knew, but had there been a surprise jump in inflation, the pressure on the RBA to cut rates would have lifted.Now they have no excuse.Not only are the annual inflation figures showing prices are rising at the pace the RBA aims for – within 2% and 3% – but the December quarter itself had prices growing slower than that associated with 2% annual inflation.If the graph does not display click hereTo not cut rates now would mean everything the RBA has said it cares about with regards inflation is total mush – just some convenient sounding lines to pacify the plebs.The only reasons you could argue the RBA should not cut rates is because you remain annoyed that your claims that government spending was fuelling inflation have been shown to be laughably wrong, or that you just want more people to be unemployed because your twisted ideology demands 4.5% of people always be looking for work.Once again, these figures highlight that governments can actually reduce inflation. The government’s energy subsidies have been a crucial reason why overall inflation is down:If the graph does not display click hereNever again should we swallow the lie that only the Reserve Bank can tackle inflation. We also should never again listen to those economists who seem to desire other people (it is never themselves) to be unemployed in order to apparently cause inflation to fall.A year ago, unemployment was 4.0% and inflation was 4.1%. Now unemployment is 4.0% and inflation is 2.4%. All those crying about the need to adhere to the “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment” and either raise interest rates (yes, some were arguing that last year) or keep them steady, will once again have to update their formulas and declare that the “Nairu” has fallen. Huzzah!If the graph does not display click hereThose wanting to claim that it’s just the electricity subsidies that have caused inflation to fall, and the CPI is not real inflation but just “measured inflation”, need to explain why the prices of 61% of items in the CPI basket of goods and services are rising slower than 3% a year, and why the RBA should keep rates steady even though the share of goods and services that have prices going up by more than 5% a year has fallen from 40% a year ago to just 20%:If the graph does not display click hereOne thing that has not changed is that rental prices remain the biggest driver of inflation, and that restaurant meals are really the only items among the top dozen which would be directly slowed by higher interest rates:If the graph does not display click hereRental price growth across the nation has not been consistent – Perth renters have really taken it in the neck, while those in Canberra and Hobart have been relatively less hurt:If the graph does not display click hereOther major services are showing price growth getting back to normal. The main exception is insurance costs. This is not surprising given the impact of the climate crisis on insurance costs. The recent fires both here and in the United States will probably mean insurance premiums continue to rise ahead of other items:If the graph does not display click hereIn the run up to the election, commentators often like to argue that the RBA wants to avoid looking political. Usually this relates to it choosing not to either cut or raise rates and thus choosing to keep rates steady to look “neutral”. But in this current instance, not cutting rates in three weeks would be highly political.And given the inflation figures, it would also be wrong. The time has come to cut rates.Greg Jericho is a Guardian columnist and chief economist at the Australia Institute and the Centre for Future WorkExplore more on these topicsInterest ratesGrogonomicsReserve Bank of AustraliaAustralian economycommentShareReuse this content"

The patient has several health problems that, taken together, amount to significant impairment. For such patients, even small complications can spell big trouble.There is an old joke in medicine: “When in doubt, cut it out.” But emerging evidence tells us to proceed slowly, especially when it comes to the elderly. For such patients, more is not always better – and can often be worse.I am part of a geriatric oncology service which combines the expertise of an oncologist, geriatrician and allied health professionals to tailor cancer treatment. Our youngest patients are often in their 70s, the oldest (who said he only came to humour us) is 100.Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news emailTo assess people’s fitness for cancer treatments including surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, we use geriatric assessment tools to interrogate domains not routinely assessed – cognition, mobility, nutrition, emotional health, community support and aged-care services, to name a few. It’s easy to see why this kind of deliberate information gathering is helpful not just for cancer patients but all elderly patients to plan their healthcare.But what is interesting is how often people are surprised by the findings once they are laid bare. Suddenly, the person who “might be a bit slow” is found to be falling, every fall increasing mortality. Someone who “didn’t look all that bad” has impaired judgment and can’t make decisions. Caregivers are found to be emotionally spent – and keeping mum about it.I have found myself reflecting on this phenomenon in the context of former US president Joe Biden’s vulnerabilities. Over time, his speech became halting, and he wasmixing up names. His gait was slow and, when he fell, he had difficulty getting up. His mood was variable and he seemed to need more rest between tasks. He appeared physically frail.Amid widespread concerns about Biden’s stamina, it is said that the people closest to him, including his wife, protected him. Reasons include their devotion to him, his determination to appear vital, and the pursuit of the White House seen as “the family’s project”.Anarticle in the New York Timesexplained the thinking among insiders: “The consensus was that Mr Biden might look old, but he was not too old for the presidency.”In the medical world, the analogous idea is “the patient might look old but should be just fine for major intervention”.The problem is that most elderly patients don’t just look old – theyareold and suffer from the cumulative impact of multiple comorbidities. Their “regular” aches now inhibit function; their need for daytime rest is not indulgent but necessary; their emerging forgetfulness deserves sympathetic oversight, not turning a blind eye.In an age alert to even implied discrimination, there is a temptation to declare that elderly people shouldn’t be treated differently.Obviously, not all elderly people are the same. My mother’s gym instructor is approaching 95 and is the fittest person in the room. My friend’s octogenarian dad plays an impressive schedule of cricket. But for every vigorous elderly person, there are many others who experience the indignities of ageing that could be addressed with a pragmatic approach.Frontline staff are often unfairly blamed for NSW’s collapsing mental health system, but it is patients who suffer most | Kamran AhmedRead moreIn my clinic, I meet once-professionals who now struggle to speak cogently and past runners who need help getting out of a chair. For them, the real disservice is when those around them see these warning signs and then unsee them. Relatives may do so out of loyalty or because it’s easy to miss subtle decline.Doctors, for their part, often fail to consider things they are not trained to fix. A surgeon doesn’t treat dementia. An anaesthetist doesn’t manage rehabilitation. An oncologist doesn’t perform the cancer operation.Increasing sub-specialisation means patients see more doctors for less cohesive care. The older you get, the more scrutiny your health deserves, with formal tools rather than casual chatter.In the case of my older patients, we often discuss the alternatives to an all-or-none approach. It may be prudent to avoid aggressive surgery but consider treatments not strictly curative but distinctly better for quality of life. Or to proceed to aggressive treatments accepting a high risk of needing residential care.We incorporate the expertise of occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dietitians, palliative care workers and others to keep people healthier for longer. Last week, I met a daughter who exultedthat the best thing about her mother’s geriatric assessment was the home rehab referral that restored her confidence to walk. The mother was obviously relieved that she was cured, but seemed even more grateful to be on her feet.I wonder if, surrounded by doctors of the highest calibre, Biden was advised of a comprehensive geriatric assessment to formally assess his physical and cognitive function. This information could have been the basis for informed discussions rather than a guessing game about how fit is fit.Not a lot about the health of privileged world leaders is relevant to my patients. But when it comes to appreciating the vulnerabilities of the elderly and helping them make decisions in their best interest, Biden’s story has been an object lesson from the world stage.The surgeon who approached me had the right instincts. Her patient was even frailer in person than on paper, and we made a joint decision for a non-surgical approach.Ranjana Srivastava is an Australian oncologist, award-winning author and Fulbright scholar.

Donors must now press Rwanda to pull back from this warWed 29 Jan 2025 13.34 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 17.13 ESTShareThere are bodies on the streets, hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing and overwhelmed hospitals draining fuel from ambulances to keep respirators running. The rapidly escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) – which has seen rocketing sexual violence, theexecution of childrenand the displacement of 400,000 people this year alone – has just exploded with theM23 rebel  group’sseizure ofGoma, in the east.Their advance comes thanks to backingfrom Rwanda, despite the coyness of the Rwandan president, Paul Kagame. Mr Kagame suggests that M23 is defending the country’s Tutsis, victims of Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, against an armed group set up by former genocidal killers. But the threat those fighters pose appears greatly exaggerated: analysts believe the real aim is to seize mineral-rich territory. There is a striking parallel withRussia’s tactics in eastern Ukrainein 2014. On Wednesday, Rwandan troops were seen heading towards Bukavu, another key city, with the M23 fighters.Mr Kagame, in power since 2000, won last year’s election withmore than 99% of the vote. Despite his authoritarian regime’s record of human rights abuses, the west has embraced him as a key partner who stabilises the region. He has turned aid into economic growth andoffered to take asylum seekersoff European hands. He sent troops to battle jihadist militants in Mozambique,a rich source of gas, and Rwanda supplies valuable minerals for smartphones, electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure and other purposes.Campaigners heavily criticised the EU for signinga strategic minerals dealwith the country last year, given that many of those supplies clearly don’t originate in Rwanda. Europe has sidelined human rights concerns. The trade in minerals finances arms purchases, fuelling the fighting.There are concerns that ethnic violence could reignite. Diplomats fear that Rwanda may hope to topple the Burundi government. Some wonder if the DRC may seek help from the United Arab Emirates and Russia. The risk of a regional conflagrationcannot easily be dismissed: conflict in the late 90s and early 2000s claimed millions of lives.Attacks on embassies in Kinshasa this week show that many in the DRC are angered by the role of outsiders. Kenya and Angola have acted as mediators. But East African leaders have failed to prioritise the crisis as it has escalated. The DRC president Félix Tshisekedi’s poor relations with his neighbours and suspicion that they lean to Mr Kagame do not lend themselves to a solution, while Mr Kagame is wary of African Union mediation. He stayed away from talks last week but is keener to come to the table now that facts on the ground have shifted in his favour – while Mr Tshisekedi said he would sit out yesterday’s Wednesday’s virtual crisis summit. Further complicating matters, Mr Tshisekedi is unpopular at home, with strong suspicions that heplans to ditch term limits.This crisis has shown the folly of treating Kigali as a guarantor of regional stability. Germany has sent a welcome signal by suspending aid talks with Rwandan officials. Other European nations and the US should follow suit. Sanctions and travel bans could also be adopted to press for an end to fighting and the creation of humanitarian corridors. Countries are finally calling outRwandaover its role in this disaster. But with so many lives at stake, more than words are required.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

But does he regret blowing it with Dave Grohl? The great producer relives his smashes, parties and 11am vodkasWed 29 Jan 2025 11.07 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 14.43 ESTShareGiven that he is the producer behind some of the most cherished and idiosyncratic British pop of the 1980s, fromElvis Costelloto Dexys Midnight Runners and the Teardrop Explodes, Clive Langer sounds surprisingly bad at predicting what will do well. “I was invited to possibly work with Madonna, around the time of Holiday,” he remembers. “I went to see her at the Music Machine and I just didn’t get it. I still don’t get it.” So he turned her down. And when Dexys laid down Come on Eileen with Langer behind the mixing desk, he didn’t think it would be a hit. “I was completely wrong. I never had the faith.”It duly reached No 1 and became the biggest-selling single of 1982, just one of the many triumphs Langer had with production partner Alan Winstanley. Together they shaped a generation of British pop with David Bowie,Mick Jaggerand Lloyd Cole, plus eight full albums with Madness across five decades.Once the acid kicked in, Julian Cope spent four hours disagreeing about a guitar chordHe also dabbled with his own bands, and is now a frontman at the age of 70 in the Clang Group, whose second album of sharp guitar pop, New Clang, is out next month. It reflects a “compulsion to write songs, express myself and turn it up a bit louder,” Langer says over a cup of tea at his home in Hackney, London.He knows he’s lucky to have done any of it. His Polish father, who was Jewish, fled the Nazis – “They told him, ‘Go right …’ He took a left and never saw his parents or his brother again,” – later making it to the UK and joining the RAF, where he met Langer’s mother. Langer’s childhood in London put him at the centre of “an incredible time for music. I dropped acid aged 13 and saw Cream, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin in a pub called Klooks Kleek. We didn’t have tickets to Janis Joplin at the Albert Hall, but we figured that if six of us tried to run in, four of us would make it – and we did.”View image in fullscreenEight steps beyond … Madness in 1979; Langer made eight albums with the band.Photograph: Virginia Turbett/RedfernsLanger left for art school in Canterbury, where Ian Dury was a teacher. He formed his first band, Deaf School, at Liverpool School of Art in 1974, inspired by Dury’s pre-Blockheads band Kilburn and the High Roads. “We were very theatrical characters. A bit Sparks, a bit Roxy.” After punk arrived, “we lost all momentum”, but they had amassed a range of famous admirers: the likes of Julian Cope, Suggs, Pete Burns and Steve Strange. “Kevin Rowland came into our dressing room in Birmingham before starting Dexys Midnight Runners. Then Big In Japan started from our road crew and included Bill Drummond who formed the KLF,Holly Johnsonwho started Frankie Goes to Hollywood and Ian Broudie who became Lightning Seeds. I joined [as guitarist] and some of the others went on to be in the Teardrop Explodes or Siouxsie and the Banshees.”In Deaf School, Langer had paid close attention to the band’s producers, and remembered their techniques when teenage Deaf School fans North London Invaders asked him to record them just as they changed their name toMadness. “I was very nervous when I went in to their rehearsal room clutching a four-pack of beer,” he admits, “but as soon as I heard My Girl I knew this was very special. From then on every record was a hit. They were ambitious and sort of naughty. The studio petty cash might suddenly disappear and if there was any booze about it would soon be gone.”For the nutty boys’ 1979 debut album, One Step Beyond, Langer teamed up with more experienced engineer Winstanley, soon establishing a way of working where Winstanley handled the technical side while Langer would “rehearse with the bands, sort out the songwriting and arrangements and have an overview. You know, ‘Do we need a trumpet?’”The wonderfully berserk trumpet solo on the Teardrop Explodes’ 1981 smash Reward was recorded when “there was a lot of acid in the band. So once it kicked in Julian [Cope] spent four hours disagreeing about a guitar chord.” The recording of Dexys’ second album Too-Rye-Ay was just as colourful, with the band “wearing all the clothes and doing the moves like it was a gig. I felt as if I was being pinned to the wall of the rehearsal room. It was that powerful.”View image in fullscreenDiving for pearls … from left, Clive Langer, Alan Winstanley and Elvis Costello in 1984.Photograph: Estate Of Keith Morris/RedfernsLanger wrote the music himself for another classic, Shipbuilding, a Falklands-era hit forRobert Wyattlater recorded by Elvis Costello, who wrote the lyrics. “I’d tried to write something beautiful for Robert, but myself and various friends all tried to come up with lyrics for it and they were rubbish,” he says. “I bumped into Elvis at a party and a few days later he had the words.”Langer and Winstanley worked quickly. “Once, we were in the same studio asTrevor Hornand we’d done Elvis’s whole Goodbye Cruel World album in the three weeks Trevor spent on the snare sound for [Frankie Goes To Hollywood’s] Two Tribes.” Simplicity aside, he doesn’t feel they had any particular Midas touch. “Our job was to give record companies hit records and we were just rolling with it. Sometimes you’d be a bit pissed and get talked into it.”Morrissey was another client, and “working with him was brilliant, because he didn’t write his own music, so I could either co-write the songs [includingNovember Spawned a Monster] or shape them. But he would invite guests to the studio then disappear to his room. I’d have to look after them, thinking, ‘Who are these people?’”I got myself into a right pickle – needing vodka in my coffee at 11am just to feel normalLanger’s career zenith was producing Bowie and Jagger’s No 1 single Dancing in the Street and the former’s No 2 classicAbsolute Beginnerson the same day in 1985. “They were good friends, but Bowie ran the show and was always looking after Mick. ‘Everything all right, Mick?’ For Absolute Beginners, Bowie did the vocal in one take. He said, ‘There’s one line I can do better.’ We re-did that and the record was finished. He sounded utterly majestic. We hung out. Skiing. New Year’s Eve. With other people, he was always performing, but sometimes I’d get him for an hour or so and we’d just drink and talk. He was so intelligent, funny, knew what he was doing. After that I thought, ‘Where do I go next?’”In the 90s, Langer and Winstanley mortgaged themselves to the skies turning Hook End Manor, purchased from David Gilmour, into the best equipped studio in Europe. Then, Bush’s 1994 album Sixteen Stone shipped 6m copies in the US. “It was Nirvana lite, but 14-year-old girls absolutely loved them. It paid off all my mortgages.”After later working with Blur, Catatonia and a-ha, and “spending more time together than with our families”, the duo’s last full album production together was Madness’s 2009 The Liberty of Norton Folgate. Langer also joined a reformed Deaf School but drifted further into alcohol, which he candidly confronts in songs on New Clang.“I’d always liked a drink at 6pm to listen and reappraise everything with alcohol in me,” he says. “Bottle of wine by the mixing desk – not too close in case you knock it over and fuck everything up. The problem is it’s progressive, then it kills you. After I stopped working I got myself into a right pickle needing a vodka in my coffee at 11am just to feel normal. So I went to see someone for help.”Now three years sober, Langer is throwing his new energy into the Clang Group. “I don’t sit around thinking about what ifs but there’s a tiny regret that I didn’t do Foo Fighters’ second album,” he admits. “I was flown to the Capitol building in Los Angeles to meet Dave Grohl, but then I suggested that he should play drums on the record instead of the drummer they had then,” he reveals. “I walked out knowing that I’d blown it, but I don’t regret what I said.” This time, however, his instincts were correct: when The Colour and the Shape went double platinum he noticed that the drummer on all but two tracks was Grohl.New Clang is released on 21 February.

He’s like a supernatural forceLeila LatifWed 29 Jan 2025 17.00 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 17.03 ESTShareThe director Guillermo del Toro once saidIdris Elbahas “a supernatural gravitational force” and compared him to a “Rodin sculpture … [with] all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes”. It is those qualities – being a magnetic TV and movie star and an activist seemingly carrying the burden of the world on his shoulders – that makes him so compelling in Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis.The BBC documentary follows Elba throughout 2024, as he mounts a campaign to try to stop knife crime in the UK. The headlines have long been filled with tragic stories of young lives ended by blades, butin the past decadethe numbers have almost doubled, with four people in the UK dying from stab wounds every week. Elba first got involved in 2019, posting videos online about how more had to be done to stop it. Since then, he has become more informed and more involved. We watch him meet politicians, law enforcement officers, victims, prisoners, youth workers and trauma specialists to figure out a proactive – rather than reactive – approach, and carry out interventions in the lives of those who might one day become perpetrators.What takes this from being a good documentary to a great one is just how much complexity and nuance Elba and director Ben Steele are able to contain within its one-hour running time. It covers everything from the economic toll of recidivism to domestic violence in the home as early indicators, the lack of funding for youth programmes, the importance of mentorship and even how images of knife fights on social media can act as an incentive to carry weapons. The film immediately tackles common misconceptions around knife crime as a problem within black and brown urban communities, when in fact 69% of perpetrators are white and it is spreading fastest in Somerset, Bedfordshire and Sussex. Elba puts this gently to Tayla Pitman, the sister of 16-year-old Harold Pitman, who wasstabbed to deathwhile watching New Year’s Eve fireworks, and she responds: “Exactly, that’s the first thing that came out when Harry was killed was ‘I bet it was a black person’ and it wasn’t – it was another white boy.” But rather than just using her to vocalise a salient point, Elba extends warm empathy to the young woman, hugging her and commending her strength.Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis – trailerWith so many lives ruined, it would be easy to get caught up in the overwhelming statistics of these crimes, but Elba manages to convey just how seismic each loss is. Tayla is not the only person he meets who has been traumatised by knife crime; the charming youth worker Jhemar Jonas’s brother was stabbed to death at 15. Faz Ahmed, who runs a knife amnesty programme, was stabbed nine times on two occasions as a young man. And most harrowingly, Pooja Kanda’s teenage son Ronan had a sword plunged into his heartin a case of mistaken identity. The programme shows us disturbing footage of the event, with Ronan unaware of what is about to happen right up until the sword enters his rib cage from behind. Pooja sits in her son’s untouched bedroom two years on and recalls how each morning she’d rush straight in to his room for a cuddle. She can only say that: “Everyone failed. The police, education systems, the families. All those failures are why my son is not on this side of the bed. Why I’m not able to hug him.”Keir Starmer and Idris Elba launch project to tackle knife crime ‘national crisis’Read moreThe film is filled with heartbreak but is still ultimately an optimistic piece of work. It is packed with tangible solutions and examples of effective ways these crimes could be prevented if only those holding the purse strings would invest in solutions such as hospital interventions, knife amnesties and the scheme in Coventry (the Community Initiative to Reduce Violence, or CIRV) that takes 16-year-old Jayden – who was previously excluded from school and “felt naked” without a knife – and puts him on a path to becoming a football coach. It is made all the more maddening when the legislationElba backed to make it illegal to purchase “zombie knives”, machetes and ninja swords was rejected in May 2024 by the Conservatives. In the aftermath of that news, he seems crushed under the weight of political indifference and can only lament to the camera: “It felt like there was an attachment to swords which may have some traditional, heritage … thing. I just couldn’t understand it.”Still, Elba reminds us this is “a marathon not a sprint” and he will continue to do all he can to stop so many lives being destroyed by knife crime. By the time the programme ends, he has presented compelling arguments and practical solutions, met with King Charles, the prime minister and the home secretary. Despite making huge strides in his activism, he stays humble and says he considers himself simply “an amplification device”. But whether he’s a supernatural force, a Hackney boy done good or an amplifier for a noble cause, Elba is at the forefront of a vital documentary.Idris Elba: Our Knife Crime Crisis aired on BBC One and is on iPlayer nowExplore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewIdris ElbaKnife crimereviewsShareReuse this content"

Plus five minutes of fun from Kristen McNally and Rudi van Dantzig’s Four Last SongsLyndsey WinshipWed 29 Jan 2025 07.28 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 07.30 ESTShareYou cannot go wrong with a Romeo and Juliet story. This one isn’t inspired by Shakespeare but South African writer RL Peteni’s 1976 novel Hill of Fools, which has a similar set-up: two warring villages and two lovers caught in between. You can tell from the off this won’t end well.Choreographed by Mthuthuzeli November, Fools is set in a South African township – a minimal but effective set has a street lamp, telegraph lines and a corrugated metal wall. The Thembu and Hlubi villagers, represented by a marginally different colour palette for their costumes, at first show a jovial, teasing rivalry. But the union of the central couple (Harris Beattie and Sarah Chun) is too much for the forceful ego of Antoni Cañellas Artigues, the self-styled protector of Chun’s character. He eats up the stage with hungry leaps and bristling aggro.Beattie and Chun have you rooting for the loved-up couple, their dances playful and conversational until a kiss that is so intense it sends Chun’s quivering leg all the way to the sky. Beattie’s dancing is particularly dreamy as he pushes through the space with full-bodied richness, rather than balletic politeness.This might be November’s best piece yet in terms of stagecraft. The final dramatic beats could be a little clearer and more powerful, but he shows great mastery in handling the busy crisscrossing of multiple bodies, weaving and dashing and dancing through the space, keeping the energy buzzing. The choreography, fused with influences from ballet, contemporary and South African dance, is full of pattern, rhythm and moreish momentum.View image in fullscreenBreezy beauty … Northern Ballet dancers in Four Last Songs.Photograph: Robert David PearsonFools is the culmination of a triple bill.

A late 1970s piece, very much of its time: flowy, breezy, beautiful with long lyrical phrases as smooth as the sheen on the men’s tights. Despite the presence of Death, we’re not talking raw emotion here – it’s all perfectly contained in finessed technique, faraway looks and pin-sharp arabesques.

Yet it is an odd beast, perhaps because it is trying to do so much. It is partly an examination of the importance of the long-form political interview, for which Walden was famous, in a democratic society, and a lament for a bygone age when the argument for it could still be made. It is partly an examination of proximity to power and the cosiness that can develop between people who move in overlapping circles, the boundaries that can be crossed and what happens if you try to re-establish them. It’s about friendship, commonalities, betrayals of many kinds. It’s about 80s politics generally, Thatcherism specifically, the attraction felt for an ideologue and the ramifications when it wanes. It’s about class politics too, as Walden and Thatcher bond over their own-bootstraps upbringings and earned entry into the rarefied worlds of media and politics that their publicly schooled colleagues were effortlessly ushered into.It’s also a little bit about humanising rather than (further) demonising Thatcher, in showing what drove her and what she truly believed in. If she comes to look more admirable in her convictions than in previous portrayals, it is not revisionism at work but rather a measure of how extraordinarily, blatantly and provably venal and corrupt our last few crops of governing politicians have been. Are we in a bad way when Thatcher begins to look like the way and the light? Yes, yes we are.View image in fullscreenClunking (from left) … Emma Sidi as Sue Richardson, Ross Armstrong as John Wakefield, Steve Coogan as Brian Walden and Karan Gill as Vinay Ahmed.Photograph: Channel 4 / Matt FrostBut on with the show itself. In trying to do so much, it does – as you might expect – none of it quite well enough. The friendship, or at least the growing connection and understanding, between Walden and the prime minister and the difficulties and compromises it represents as the personal, political and professional collide is the most subtly worked element. The shading of Thatcher’s iconoclasm into isolation – the loneliness of rising to the top on your own terms – is convincing and (depending on where you stood in the 80s, how well you can put aside memories of the time) almost moving.But elsewhere there are great gobbets of exposition and extensive speechifying on every theme. “We were, still are, the only ones to put the interviewee through their paces for an entire show,” says London WeekendTelevisionproducer David Cox (Tom Mothersdale) as he tries to convince Walden to take over from Peter Jay as presenter of Weekend World. “Because political interviews ought to play a part in ordinary people’s understanding of the political landscape.” Got that? Similarly clunking scenes occur between cabinet members, especially when it becomes time to explain who stands where on Europe and the exchange rate mechanism versus a floating currency. And there is the occasional simply terrible line, such as Cox’s assurance to Walden as he preps for the great showdown: “You’re not a good interviewer, Brian. You’re an exceptional interviewer.” It makes for a herky-jerky dramatic experience, and this is – whatever it is billed as – a drama. The “docuseries” label is presumably demanded because verbatim extracts are performed by Coogan and Walters. But drama it is, and as drama, it fails to catch fire.This may also be due to the fact that Walden v Thatcher is not and never will be Frost v Nixon. It does not have iconic cultural status. Nobody remembers where they were when Walden asked Maggie if she was to blame for Lawson’s resignation. It was not instrumental in her downfall. He was in the right place at the right time, just as the resentful man-babies were gathering to push her off the cliff.Which is not to say Brian and Maggie isn’t interesting or doesn’t give you plenty to think about and chew over later (including the parts of the interview in which Walden criticises her inability to show warmth, which haven’t aged well in a more egalitarian age). But there is a detached, declamatory aspect to it overall that prevents the whole from triumphing.Brian and Maggie is onChannel 4now.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionTV reviewSteve CooganHarriet WalterChannel 4Margaret ThatcherreviewsShareReuse this content"

The TV show ended after nine series and 55 episodes, each one a surprise. So are Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton now winding down? Not a bit, if Stage/Fright is any guide. From its murderous prologue on – hands-down the most memorable mobile phone announcement ever made in a theatre – this live show is as twisty and unpredictable as the best of their episodes on the BBC.‘The show happened by accident’: cult comedy Inside No 9 shuts its doorsRead moreSome of those episodes are recalled here, in a two hours-plus performance that retains the TV series’ anthology spirit. You don’t leave feeling like you’ve seen one play but several. There’s the retread of series four yarn Bernie Clifton’s Dressing Room, which casts Shearsmith and Pemberton as former end-of-the-pier double act Cheese and Crackers, reuniting for a last feeble hurrah in a draughty church hall. There’s the kidnap scene (ostensibly one of Cheese and Crackers’ sketches) in which a celebrity guest is taken hostage and obliged to improvise their way out of trouble.View image in fullscreenJump scares and laughter … Shearsmith.Photograph: Marc BrennerPrior to those, our hosts give us a spine-chilling spiel about the haunted history of the Wyndham’s theatre, where they tell us an actor once lost her life in a misbegotten production of gothic melodrama Terror in the Asylum. Act two pitches us into a rehearsal for that same play, with Shearsmith as the smooth director, Pemberton as a maniacal surgeon, and Miranda Hennessy as a TikTok star turned leading lady spooked by the curse which haunts her role. There is nice work too from Anna Francolini as a hatchet-faced matron with a detachable eyeball. If that feels like a lot to wrap your head around – well, our hosts have more in store that I’m not allowed to tell you. And in any event, keeping you on edge, a little uncertain of what you’re watching and where it’s going, is all part of the project of this tricksy, one-step-ahead show.Arguably, its portfolio nature comes at the expense of cohesion – although we’re never far from the haunting theme, as lights flicker and the living are forever mistaken for the dead. Lily-livers such as me may spend half the show teetering on the edges of their seats, as Shearsmith and Pemberton deliver jump-scares on stage and, because their Terror in the Asylum production is trendily multimedia, on an upstage screen too. But alongside the thrills, there’s laughter, as Shearsmith performs a patter song about chemistry, Pemberton puns (“My migraines!” / “Your yourgraines?”), and Cheese and Crackers take various 1970s celebrity names in vain. (Good luck anyone under 45 getting those jokes.)It’s a slickly produced spooky wheeze, distinguished by Shearsmith and Pemberton’s clearly personal obsession with the double-act dynamic and old-school entertainment, and with theatres and their ghosts. One gets the impression they’d happily haunt the Wyndham’s stage centuries hence – failing which, the echo of tonight’s gasps and giggles should at least linger for quite some time.AtWyndham’s theatre, London, until 5 AprilExplore more on these topicsTheatreWest EndReece ShearsmithInside No 9Steve PembertonComedy (Culture)Horror (TV)reviewsShareReuse this content"

How has it gone almost unnoticed?Rebecca NicholsonWed 29 Jan 2025 09.54 ESTLast modified on Wed 29 Jan 2025 09.57 ESTShareTrust Netflix to make absolutely no fuss whatsoever about Asura, which could be the best drama it has put out in years. The lack of fanfare for the series, quietly released in early January, is genuinely baffling. It comes from the Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda, who previously made the gorgeousThe Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko Housefor the streamer and was nominated for an Oscar for his majestic 2018 filmShoplifters, which also won the Palme d’Or. You would think those credentials might have earned this a bit of a push. Instead, we must rely on word of mouth, so here it is: this is a fantastic television series, and it would be criminal to let it pass you by.‘My father buried his friends in minus-40 Siberia’: director Hirokazu Kore-eda on trauma and childhoodRead moreAsura is an adaptation of a novel by Kuniko Mukôda, which was turned into a popular Japanese TV series in 1979. In Kore-eda’s reimagining, the four Takezawa sisters represent a different vision and version of womanhood and femininity during this period. Takiko (Yû Aoi) is a civil servant, working in a library, who is as buttoned up as her youngest sister Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) – a waitress with a deadbeat boxer for a boyfriend – is flamboyant. They are frequently at each other’s throats in some of the show’s funniest scenes. Oldest sister Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is widowed with an adult son, and arranges flowers for a local restaurant, while Makiko (Machiko Ono) is a housewife, the mother of two teenage children, and the centre of these women’s firm bond.View image in fullscreen‘A remarkable, empathetic drama’ … the Takezawa sisters: Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa), Sakiko (Suzu Hirose), Makiko (Machiko Ono) and Takiko (Yû Aoi).Photograph: NetflixDespite the constant scrapping between Takiko and Sakiko, the sisters are a solid unit throughout. It begins with a phone call from Takiko, urging them all to get together so she can share some important news. They suspect that she may finally be getting married, but the big reveal is even more explosive: she has spotted her elderly father Kôtarô (Jun Kunimura) with another woman, and a small boy, whom she overheard calling their father “papa”. There is proof, in the form of clandestine photographs taken by the private detective she has hired to follow him. How should they handle this revelation, and what does it illuminate about their own lives?There are seven hour-long episodes, and each is as strikingly beautiful as the last. It is stunningly shot, the sort of show where you want to linger on every detail. For non-Japanese speakers, like me, it urges a second watch, to catch those delicate moments you may have missed when reading the subtitles. The sisters express their personalities through their clothing, their homes, the things they eat and how they eat them. And there is a lot of food here, as should be expected from Kore-eda. This is not a series to watch when even remotely peckish. Food is ceremonial, bonding, a plot driver and a focus. There are Fuji apples (for their mother, Fuji), rice cakes, pickled cabbage, endless platters of sushi. Food is savoured and shared. I have never been so desperate to gobble up everything on the screen.View image in fullscreen‘Food is ceremonial, bonding, a plot driver and a focus’ … two of the Takezawa sisters with their mother.Photograph: NetflixAs with food, phones are a focal point, too. The drama kicks off with Takiko’s phone call, summoning her sisters, but as this is set in the late 1970s, the telephone is the instigator of many dramatic moments: one call brings terrible news, another – a wrong number of sorts – sows the seeds of suspicion that form deep roots. The initial call, about their father’s big secret, could have been played for tragedy, but here it is both significant and not: the lightness of the sisters’ discussion about it, which zigzags between shock and amusement, hints at the show’s careful balancing of comedy and tragedy. Its sense of humour is consistent, even in dark moments. It is much more laugh-out-loud than I expected it to be, and as a result, much more touching when the chips are down.All of this is a testament to how much Asura makes us care about the sisters, and how quickly it achieves this. In 1979, the behaviour of men is difficult for the women to confront, let alone question. But they quietly question it, in turn revealing hidden truths about their own moral compasses. There are affairs, difficult relationships, imagined infidelities and real ones. Following the news of their father’s affair and a possible fifth sibling, a letter appears in the newspaper, outlining the family’s predicament, with only a few minor details changed. The sisters suspect that one of them has written it, though its author remains mysterious. The letter builds towards a climactic question, which is really the driving force behind the series: “Is it really happiness for women like us to live without making waves?”The Takezawa sisters make waves, some large, some smaller, each gathering up the turmoil of the moment and letting it crash down, before starting again. Asura is full of heart, full of joy, a remarkable, empathetic drama that deserves far more attention than it has been given so far.Asura is onNetflixnow.Explore more on these topicsTelevisionJapanese food and drinkNetflixJapanfeaturesShareReuse this content"

My portrait of this 65-year-old woman, her goose Axiuli and her cat Haytoo was taken at her home where Cary now lives with her animals. When I first met the cat, I asked why he was covered in dark patches. “Oh, he likes to sleep on the stove,” Cary replied, “and sometimes his fur catches fire, so I have to put it out.”Cary, whose full name is Caridad Ribalta Oviedo, was born just weeks before the Cuban Revolution in 1959. She explained how her home was once the site of a laundry run by her family – Chinese immigrants from Guangzhou who settled inCubain the late 19th century. I was struck by her connection with her animals: as well as Axiuli and Haytoo, she has two dogs, Shimao and Tabey – all named in homage to her Chinese ancestors.There were signs of a once-thriving business that existed before the revolution: art deco doors, neoclassical features and murals, and huge exposed iron beams where laundered clothes used to hang. Talking about her childhood, Cary said: “I remember playing here after dark and there would be strange noises. My siblings and I would hear people carrying buckets of water but when we looked there was no one there.”It was only after taking the picture that I noticed other details: an empty egg carton balanced on a chair, an unfilled bottle of cooking oil, and decades-old children’s toys. Everyday items scattered among cherished family heirlooms, painting a picture of both the island’s rich and distinct cultural identity and the present day harsh realities.As desperation in Cuba grows, Cary's story symbolises 'la lucha' – or the daily struggleCary’s situation felt emblematic of the worsening crisis afflicting Cuba and its longsuffering population. Economic conditions have induced desperation and the mass migration of more than a million Cubans since the pandemic. Widespread shortages, power outages, and soaring inflation – exacerbated by policies from the previous Trump era – have made daily life increasingly difficult.Trump’s second presidency threatens even tougher sanctions on Cuba, deepening the country’s socioeconomic crisis and further restricting migration options, with Trump also promising record deportations of illegal immigrants. As desperation grows, Cary’s story symbolises “la lucha” (the daily struggle) and the resilience of those who continue living on the island.I’ve been visiting Cuba since 2004. I taught at the University of Havana for a year. When I first arrived there, I walked into a dark classroom during a blackout to find everyone dancing. I fell in love with the place. I had a romanticised image of Cuba, but the idea it is frozen in time is reductive. Over 20 years, I’ve tried to capture a place that is constantly evolving. Doing that in black and white for this series helped me get away from the distraction of Cuba’s iconic tropical pastel colours.The title of my project is a local expression meaning: “There’s nothing left.” But it also means: “You have to stay strong and carry on.” In the past, people from marginalised communities often asked me for money. Lately, people have been pleading for food. There’s a growing sense of hopelessness and dreams are fading fast.

Now brutalism, the once-maligned postwar architectural style of chiselled concrete forms, has finally reached Hollywood, in the form of an epic three-and-a-half-hour film that looks set tosweep the Oscars. You would think that architecture fans would be thrilled to have their subject in the limelight for a change. But they are raging.There is nothing more irritating to enthusiasts than when the mainstream tries to portray their niche world and gets it wrong. And The Brutalist gets an awful lot wrong. Just as Gladiator II recentlyvexed classicistswith its inaccurate portrayal of the emperors and its anachronistic scenes of people reading the newspaper and drinking at cafes (neither of which, apparently, existed at the time), so too has director Brady Corbet riled the architecture world by playing fast and loose with his interpretation of brutalism, the Bauhaus, postwar immigration and the basic process of architecture itself.View image in fullscreenInverted ziggurat … Breuer’s Whitney Museum in New York in 1955.Photograph: Authenticated News/Getty ImagesWhile the film world has showered the movie withfive-star reviews– praising its heroic ambition, and drooling at the “authenticity” of shooting with hulking 1950s VistaVision cameras – architecture critics have been up in arms. “The Brutalist gets architecture wrong,” declared the Washington Post. It “perpetuates a colossal cliche,” fumed the Financial Times. Three prominent American architecture critics even got together to record a dedicated podcast, titledWhy the Brutalist Is a Terrible Movie. For almost an hour, they railed against everything from the stereotypical depiction of the architect as a lone male genius to the Bauhaus-inspired graphic design of the credits, as well as (spoiler alert!) the idea that anyone would design a community centre and chapel based on the form of a Nazi concentration camp. At the screening I attended, one leading figure from the 20th-century heritage movement could barely contain their fury during the (very welcome) half-time intermission: “It’s just utter tosh!”The film has aroused this much ire because, for all its claims to be fictional, it is so clearly based on a real historical figure:Marcel Lajos Breuer. Like Corbet’s fictional László Tóth (played by a tortured, quivering Adrien Brody), Breuer was a Hungarian-Jewish architect who trained at the Bauhaus in Germany before emigrating to the US, where he became a prominent proponent of brutalism. He and his contemporaries, including Walter Gropius and Mies van der Rohe, all emigrated in 1937 – crucially, before the second world war, not after, as Corbet has it – and built very successful careers, receiving deanships at major universities, and shaped the following century of modern architecture. None had to queue for free bread. Corbet consulted the architectural historian Jean-Louis Cohen, the leading authority on the period, to try to find the tragic figure that he had in mind, but none came to Cohen’s mind because none existed.Breuer is best known for designing the formerWhitney Museumin New York, which lurches above the street like an inverted ziggurat, and the striking trefoil-shapedUnesco headquartersin Paris. But he first made his name designing curved tubular steel furniture, of a kind practically identical to Tóth’s in the film’s early scenes. “It looks like a tricycle,” the furniture store owner’s wife remarks of the novel bent-steel design in the movie – just asBreuer’s chairswere compared to, and inspired by, bicycle frames at the time.View image in fullscreenBig and brutal … Marcel Breuer’s Abbey Church of the St John’s Benedictine monastery.Photograph: Robert W Kelley/The LIFE Picture Collection/ShutterstockThe similarities don’t stop there. Indeed, one of Breuer’s lesser-known building projects turns out to be the chief inspiration for the film. In the early 1950s, Breuer was commissioned to design abig brutalist churchon a hill, just like Tóth – only it was in Minnesota, rather than Pennsylvania, and the clients were Benedictine monks, rather than a millionaire psychopath industrialist. The epic project went through similar agonies to those portrayed in the movie, a fraught process that was meticulously documented in a fascinating book,Marcel Breuer and a Committee of Twelve Plan a Church: A Monastic Memoir, written by Fr Hilary Thimmesh, who served as a junior member of the building committee.“Our first concern was the novel architecture,” he writes of Breuer’s uncompromising proposal for an angular concrete box, flanked by an abstract bell tower – complete with a cross-shaped void, just like one in the roof of Tóth’s fictional building. “We needed assurance that it was all right to build this odd structure and call it a Catholic church.”From the very outset of the project, there was suspicion of Breuer who, just like Tóth, had never designed a church, as a Hungarian Jew. “He wasn’t Catholic,” Thimmesh recounts. “His manner was certainly not midwestern.” As in the film’s depiction of a community consultation event, where Tóth shows off a big model of his bulky design to local residents, “biases were noted in the community”, writes Thimmesh, “some against Breuer as a non-Catholic”. Just as the God-fearing people of Pennsylvania in the movie are “worried [the building] is going to ruin the hillside”, and complain that “concrete isn’t very attractive”, so too did the monks of St John fret about the “less than wholehearted support for the plan in the community” and that their Catholic brethren were generally “down on modern architecture”.Corbet has cited Thimmesh’s book as a key precedent, admitting that “narratively, that was one of the biggest inspirations” – before going on to describe the memoir dismissively as “a pretty dry account of the struggles Breuer went through”. The reality clearly wasn’t spicy enough for his melodramatic intentions. Breuer wasn’t a heroin addict, and the monks didn’t rape him in a quarry. Nor did the real life architect really lose his temper much, beyond the occasional politely worded letter.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He regularly erupts with prima-donna fits of screaming when he doesn’t get his way (giving us ample opportunities to learn the Hungarian for “fuck!”), throwing papers around and storming off in blind rage. As his longsuffering wife Erzsébet puts it at one point: “László worships only at the altar of himself.”By contrast, Breuer was evidently well-versed in navigating the necessary compromises of a building project, as all architects must, while remaining firm in his convictions. At the most heated point during the design of the Minnesota church, when the abbot asked Breuer to sketch out an alternative design, Thimmesh recalls the architect’s measured reaction.“Breuer responded with something close to emotion,” he writes. “To produce another design, he said, would take time and the same intensity he put into this one. The end result would probably be worse confusion. In choosing a building one does not have the luxury of selecting one of several existing things, he said.” The nuances played out in the decade-long development of this landmark building would have made for a much more interesting story than the film’s hackneyed portrayal of the tempestuous architect-client relationship; but such nuance would be lost on Corbet’s two-dimensional characterisation. Instead, he has his architect spouting meaningless platitudes, such as: “Is there a better description of a cube than that of its construction?” To which his wealthy industrialist client unconvincingly replies: “I find our conversations intellectually stimulating.”View image in fullscreenTrefoil triumph … Unesco headquarters, Paris.Photograph: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesPerhaps the most glaring anachronism is in the film’s bizarre epilogue, set years later at the 1980 Venice Architecture Biennale. Titled Presence of the Past, it was the moment that postmodernism took ascendancy, seeing a colourful parade of architects indulging in cartoonish historical references, embracing wit, humour and knowing pastiche. It was a stage for the new generation’s gleeful dance on the grave of their modernist and brutalist forebears, ushering ina period of buildingslike the pink confection of No 1 Poultry in the City of London, and the green-glass Maya temple of the MI6 headquarters in Vauxhall.Not in Corbet’s world. Instead, he portrays the landmark exhibition as a moment when his fictional, now wheelchair-using Tóth enjoys a heroic retrospective. His stripped-back concrete buildings are evaluated afresh, as “machines with no superfluous parts” – a reappraisal of brutalism that didn’t happen, in reality, until at leasttwo or three decades later.The architecture world awaits with bated breath the director’s five-hour marathons, The Postmodernist, The Deconstructivist, and The Parametricist – each to be shot with period-appropriate equipment and based on a brief skim through a coffee-table book.Explore more on these topicsFilmThe BrutalistArchitectureModernismBauhausfeaturesShareReuse this content"

It is not thought that the house burnt down.Elsewhere in the article, Abe Streep spoke to his aunt’s Only Murders in the Building co-star, Martin Short, who also encountered difficulties escaping the house in the Palisades he bought in 1984.Short reported that a drive to safety that would have normally taken five minutes took more than an hour, such was the gridlock and panic. Short said: “I will definitely stay in my home,” but reported that one of his sons lost his house.Among thecelebrities whose homes were destroyed in the firesare Anthony Hopkins, Mel Gibson, Billy Crystal, Paris Hilton and Eugene Levy.Explore more on these topicsMeryl StreepLos AngelesCalifornia wildfiresnewsShareReuse this content"

After careful consideration, we feel it would be impossible to continue in the context of the allegations against its original author.

On the far side are her other mother and father, parents almost identical to her own but with buttons for eyes and evil intent.The story found a new audience 15 years ago as a stop-motion animation by Henry Selick. Thenew musicalwas adapted by the playwright Zinnie Harris and the composer Louis Barabbas, and was to have been directed by Leeds Playhouse’s artistic director, James Brining.Nine women have accused Gaiman of sexual misconduct. The allegations were first made public last July when Tortoise Media reported on sexual assault allegations against Gaiman by two women. By the end of August, three more women had come forward with allegations.This month Vulture published an investigation in which four further women accused Gaiman of assault, including nonconsensual BDSM.Gaiman published astatement on his websitesaying he had “never engaged in nonconsensual sexual activity with anyone”.Since then, there have been many cancellations of his works. On Monday the US publisher Dark Horse Comicsannouncedit had cancelled plans to publish future Gaiman works, saying it took seriously the allegations against the author.Dark Horse Comics began publishing the Anansi Boys series, an adaptation of Gaiman’s 2005 novel, in June last year. It was intended to be an eight-issue series but has now been cancelled after the seventh issue, published on 15 January.HarperCollins, which publishes many of Gaiman’s books in the US, including Coraline and American Gods, told Publishers Weekly that it did not have any new books by Gaiman scheduled.WW Norton, the US publisher of Gaiman’s book Norse Mythology, said it would not have projects with the author in future, though it did not say whether this was connected to the allegations.Marvel Comics has no new works by Gaiman in progress, according to the New York Times.Prime Video’s Good Omens, based on the novel by Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, will now end with one 90-minute episode instead of a full third season, while a Disney film adaptation of Gaiman’s 2008 young adult novel The Graveyard Book, which was in development, was put on hold. Neither streamer has confirmed that these decisions were taken because of the allegations.Explore more on these topicsTheatreNeil GaimanMusicalsLeedsEnglandnewsShareReuse this content"

He was a private detective based in south London who, with his business partner, Jonathan Rees, ran an agency called Southern Investigations. Rees would go on to carry out extensive work for theNews of the World.The agency was said to be a “hub of corruption” through which police officers were paid for stories. The Met announced in 2007 that the motive for Morgan’s murder was probably that he “was about to expose a southLondondrugs network possibly involving corrupt police officers”.The Met commissioner, Sir Mark Rowley, admitted in 2023 that “corruption” and “professional incompetence” had marred investigations into the case.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toHeadlines UKFree newsletterGet the day’s headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

He ran the fifth and final investigation in 2006 into Morgan’s murder. It collapsed in court in 2011 because of claims around the police handling of “supergrass” witnesses.The Hack was filmed last year and will air later this year on ITV and STV and be available for streaming on ITVX and STV Player.The Hack’s executive producer, Patrick Spence, who was also behind Mr Bates vs the Post Office, said: “It’s clear that several questions remain unanswered. This drama is our contribution to that conversation.”The series is being written by the Bafta-winning screenwriter Jack Thorne, whose previous works include the 2019 series His Dark Materials. Thorne said: “This is a strange and deceptive piece of our recent history. One with so many layers to it. I thought, as someone who is interested in politics, I understood everything that happened. I did not.“It’s a fight for the truth that really shocked me. That is why it matters to tell this story now in an age where the truth seems more in danger than ever.”ITV Studios is the producer and co-financier of the drama along with Stan in Australia.A spokesperson for News UK declined to comment.Explore more on these topicsPhone hackingToby JonesNewspapersNewspapers & magazinesDavid TennantNews of the WorldITV plcnewsShareReuse this content"

It will run at the Swan theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, from 15 August to 13 September.The RSC has already announced two versions of the Shakespeare play. The first, which opens on 8 February, will see Rupert Goold, who wasrecently named as the new director of the Old Vic, direct the story of grief and family dysfunction in the Danish royal court.The second is a combination of Radiohead’sHail to the Thief album and the play, which will open at Aviva Studios, Manchester, from 27 April to 18 May before moving to the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, 4-28 June.TheRadioheadfrontman, Thom Yorke, has reworked the band’s critically acclaimed album into a deconstructed score that “illuminates the text” and is performed by live musicians.The RSC will also host a co-production of Roald Dahl’s The BFG, alongside the Roald Dahl Story Company and the Chichester Festival theatre, with the RSC co-artistic director, Daniel Evans, making his directorial debut at the theatre.Adapted by Tom Wells ofJumpers for GoalpostsandThe Kitchen Sinkfame, it will open in Stratford-upon-Avon on 25 November and run until 31 January 2026 before transferring to Chichester on 16 March 2026, where it will run until 12 April.The production is the latest big Roald Dahl adaptation, after the National Theatre’s Witches andthe Enormous Crocodileat Leeds Playhouse, and was described as “a play with music, rather than a musical”.Otherhighlights from the seasoninclude the Game of Thrones actor Rose Leslie making her debut in The Constant Wife, which has been adapted by Laura Wade and will be directed by RSC co-artistic director Tamara Harvey.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe GuideFree weekly newsletterGet our weekly pop culture email, free in your inbox every FridayEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This amounts to one in 67 people worldwide, with 71% of displacements occurring in low- and middle-income nations.“Film can drop you into the texture and realities of someone’s life like no other art form,” Blanchett said.“Working with UNHCR I have engaged in both the largescale impact and the vast statistics of forced displacement as an issue faced by millions of people – but I have also been fortunate to meet affected people directly and engage with their stories and experiences. It is this aim of creating personal, intimate touch points.”Moving pictures: comics and animation exhibition showcases stories of migrationRead moreA longlist will be drawn up in the coming months, with the final recipients chosen by a selection committee chaired by Blanchett, which includes the British actor Cynthia Erivo, Syrian journalist Waad al-Kateab, and Afghan activist Aisha Khurram.The selected film-makers will be announced at the Cannes film festival in May.Majid Adin, an Iranianrefugee film-makersaid he was “thrilled” to hear about the fund.

Born Marjorie Watson-Williams inBristol, she moved to Paris and became the artist she had always imagined being, brand new name and all. She thrived at the centre of Paris’s swirling avant-garde currents, quickly building a rich community for herself among the hotbed of artistic radicalism and experimentation. She exhibited regularly and found solace in her friendships. But when she returned to Britain at the onset of the second world war, she found herself out of step with its art world and found neither the fame nor the success she had been working towards in Paris.The RWA in Bristol has brought Vézelay home, hosting the largest exhibition of her work since her death in 1984 at the age of 91. It is only two rooms, but it’s packed with paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, letters and photographs from her own collection. Moving chronologically through her life and work, the show gives a powerful sense of Vézelay’s fierce, prickly personality.View image in fullscreenCosmopolitan … Paule Vézelay pictured circa 1919.Photograph: Estate of Paule Vézelay/RWAEven in her very earliest paintings and prints, made while a student at the RWA itself, then at the Slade in London, Vézelay’s style is clear. She was already interested in volume and line, depicting bodies and spaces that spring off the page with dramatic modelling and cross-hatching. Her early paintings are made with a heavy impasto and, although they depict the classic modernist subject of the crowd, they are much more interested in shape and colour than in social commentary.When she arrived in Paris for the first time in 1920, Vézelay was struck by what was happening there. People including Pablo Picasso, Wassily Kandinsky, Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Jean Arp, Joan Miró and Alexander Calder were pushing against the boundaries of visual art, creating new ways of depicting the world abstractly. Vézelay eventually met them all and joined Abstraction-Création,the group that exhibited works grappling with the interplay of abstraction and surrealism.The RWA’s exhibition includes two sculptures by Vézelay’s peers, one by Calder, one by Marlow Moss. Even though they are only two of the 60-plus works in the exhibition, they give a strong sense of the aesthetic questions Vézelay’s circle was addressing. The echoes of their lines, particularly those of the Calder mobile hanging from the ceiling in the first gallery, are eerily visible in the Vézelay painting hanging below it. Construction. Grey Lines on Pink Ground, 1938, is a large pink colour field with a map of 11 straight lines crisscrossing it. Some lines end in spheres, others have little flags planted in them, and the seemingly random composition comes together to look perfectly balanced – just like Calder’s mobile. There is no record indicating that the two works are related, but both artists were members of Abstraction-Création,so they certainly knew each other.The letters and photographs add to the sense of Vézelay’s rich community in Paris. One letter, from Sophie Taeuber-Arp, describes the difficulty of doing art with one arm while the other is being pulled into the kitchen, or to the telephone, or off on errands. The challenge of being an artist and a woman was always present for Vézelay, although she was outspoken in her desire to be seen as simply an artist, not a female artist.View image in fullscreenRelief sculptures … Lines in Space No 51 (1965).Photograph: © The Estate of Paule VézelayShe wrote to the British surrealist Ithell Colquhoun, saying she had chosen a somewhat androgynous name to avoid “this question of sex [being] dragged into discussions about my work”. Playing in the exhibition is an interview she did with Germaine Greer the year before her death. She pushes back against Greer’s suggestion that she wanted to be mistaken for a man. It was, she said, just the work she was concerned about – making good work regardless of her gender.When she returned to Britain, Vézelay took an active role in the war effort in Bristol, drawing harsh, dramatic scenes of destruction in the city that marked a brief return to figurative art. She then went back to painting largely abstract work and eventually began designing textiles, some of which are in the exhibition. The curtains that hung in her apartment are there, looking slightly faded around the edges where the light hit them. It’s an intimate, tactile element that, like her letters, evokes a tangible sense of who Vézelay was, in all her complexity.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toArt WeeklyFree weekly newsletterYour weekly art world round-up, sketching out all the biggest stories, scandals and exhibitionsEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

These works combine sculpture and painting, often featuring threads strung across a canvas to create a sort of relief sculpture that hangs on the wall. At first glance, they look like her other abstract paintings, but a closer examination shows their three-dimensionality. The phrase “lines in space” seems to nicely sum up Vézelay’s artistic ethos: her works all return to this fundamental idea.The RWA is the perfect venue for this renewed examination of Vézelay’s rich life and work, in the very building where she began to pursue a career as an artist. The exhibition illuminates the dramatic differences in aesthetic sensibility between Paris and Britain in the mid-20th century. Vézelay’s work is distinctly Parisian, fostered and formed in the melee of avant – garde personalities that made Paris the centre of modernism. It’s tempting to wonder how her legacy would have evolved had she returned to Paris after the war, but we must take her as she is: a cosmopolitan 20th-century woman who constructed her identity, and her art, exactly as she wished.At RWA Bristol until 27 AprilExplore more on these topicsArt and designArtBristolPaintingSculptureTextile artreviewsShareReuse this content"

It begins as a romance, with a couple meeting in a bar, then spirals into an authoritarian dystopia.The story is set in the future but its world is recognisable as our own, with a government in denial about climate damage even as temperatures rise and water resources become depleted. Environmental catastrophe reduces the planet to rubble and leads to the creation of an underworld called Top Official Protection Oasis (TOPO), which is advertised as a shiny, custom-made utopia for all but only serves certain echelons of society.View image in fullscreenBleak view … a scene from Five Lines.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThe hour-long show is written by Swiss duo Frau Trapp, comprising Matteo Frau and Mina Trapp, along with director Natalia Barraza. An intricate assortment of models and objects are filmed live by four cameras and appear lifesize when projected (set design by Trapp). The images have a poetic quality, with zoetrope-like effects on screen, and the cardboard characters are endearing. (The audience are invited to see the diorama and its delightful objects up close after the show is performed.)The music by Frau is as original as the visuals. It carries so much of the drama, with sultry, noirish jazz trumpet for the romance and electronic elements for the adrenalised moments. The bass is so low and rumbling during the story’s earthquake that you feel as if the ground is shaking beneath you.The weakest feature is the story, with its rather too vague romance (the narrator tells us “I wanted to improve my career, she wanted to better the planet”), and the generic detail of its dystopia. Tension is certainly built when characters are in flight or going missing, but there is not enough nuance or depth in these plot points. Those in charge of TOPO disappear abruptly, we are told, and leadership is handed over to AI. This is a chilling idea but entirely unexplored. It is all very exquisite, but approximate.Atthe Pit, Barbican, London, until 1 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreMimeBarbicanClimate crisisreviewsShareReuse this content"

No pharaonic headdresses, no pyramids, no hieroglyphs. This is an Aida with big ideas about the abuse of power and war between nations. We could be anywhere, as long as it is highly militarised.Annemarie Woods’ costumes showcase totalitarian chic; only Amneris is allowed, briefly, to stray from the grunge-for-all colour scheme with a bright red tailored number to watch the Triumphal March.Miriam Buether’s sets are a series of cavernous concrete bunkers.Rule No 2 of Carsen’s Aida: the work’s characteristic spectacle (specifically requested by the Cairo’s KhedivialOperaHouse which commissioned the opera) is almost entirely suppressed. We still hear Verdi’s self-consciously “exotic” dances, but what we see is marching, saluting and table-laying. The Triumphal March becomes a military parade involving an elaborate flag-folding routine. A fleeting passage of livelier choreography to narrate a battle follows hot on the heels of yet more striding around and looks like someone has hit fast-forward on basic video-game graphics.View image in fullscreenImpressive house debut … Raehann Bryce-Davis as Amneris (right) with Anna Pirozzi as Aida.Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianThis is one way to deal with theproblems of Aida’s ultra-Orientalismtoday. (Aida is, after all, the opera that eminent postcolonial scholarEdward Saidonce dismissed as an “embarrassment”.) Yet this commitment to abstraction introduces a serious schism between staging and score – not just in numerous details of the libretto but, more importantly, in pacing. Verdi was creating opportunities for scenic spectacle to take centre stage. Here it rarely does.In these circumstances it was unfortunate that musically, this revival can’t match the vividness and subtlety of its original outing. The solo singing was of mixed quality. Riccardo Massi was unwell, leavingJorge de Leónto step in as warrior-hero Radames – his huge voice set permanently at “intense” and driving up the volume of even his most intimate interactions with other characters. As his star-crossed lover,Anna Pirozzi’s Aida was controlled and dramatic, her soprano cutting cleanly through the densest textures, though by the final scene she sounded exhausted.Raehann Bryce-Davismade an impressive house debut as Aida’s romantic rival Amneris, by turns sensual and ferocious, her voice thrilling in its lower reaches if unable to compete, decibel-for-decibel, in the middle of her range.Amartuvshin Enkhbat(Aida’s father Amonasro) was instantly authoritative, their father-daughter duet genuinely touching.UnderDaniel Oren, the orchestral ensemble was periodically strained and the score’s many shifts of gear were managed largely by step-changes. Despite some beautifully shaped woodwind solos, many of the more delicate passages lacked polish. The Royal Opera Chorus were the stars of this show – the men’s voices exquisitely blended and superbly atmospheric in their quiet passages, barely more than murmured.Until 12 February.Explore more on these topicsOperaClassical musicRoyal Opera HouseGiuseppe VerdireviewsShareReuse this content"

The three sisters who gather in the family home inLiverpoolare refreshingly matter of fact about their bereavement. Their loss is a prompt to reflect, bicker and pick at old wounds, but happily, it is not an excuse to be maudlin.Whitehead is too witty a writer for that. Whether it is Mona (Jessica May Buxton) operating a chat line for people who get off on astronomy, Kelly (Katie Erich) being banned from Deliveroo or a running joke about a narcissistic priest, Pass the Parcel bubbles with quirky detail. Besides, the sisters know each other too well to get sentimental, even if they do enjoy raking up old grievances.A sometime Guardian contributor, the playwright has written in the past about her grandmother beingkept in the darkabout her adoption. Her great-grandmother, meanwhile, claimed to be psychic. Whitehead abstracts those ideas – a traumatic family secret and the gift of second sight – to fashion a drama in which Lindsay (Hayley Sheen) is forced to recalibrate her past during a spooky round of pass the parcel.In this, the play positions itself somewhere between the sisterly mourning of Shelagh Stephenson’sThe Memory of Waterand the raucous Catholic superstition of Des Dillon’sSix Black Candles. In front of a backdrop by Eleanor Ferguson that, depending on your frame of mind, represents either the layers of a wrapped-up parcel or the folds of a clitoris, Nicole Behan’s female-centred production explores the tensions between daughters, mothers and sisters, weighing freedom against responsibility, adventure against home.With a jolly cameo by Eithne Browne as family friend Pamela, equal parts devout and impious, and doing a mean karaoke Patsy Cline, it is a warmly acted production that captures the contradictions of close relationships. If the writing can be small-scale and televisual, Whitehead also builds a vivid sense of the offstage characters, be it Lindsay’s growing son Alex or the older generation whose actions continue to define the lives of the sisters even in their absence.At theRoyal Court, Liverpool, until 8 FebruaryExplore more on these topicsTheatreDeath and dyingLiverpoolreviewsShareReuse this content"

Chants ring round the stands every weekend:“We’ve got the oracle / He sees what you don’t … ”But Greatest of All Time is, in fact, much more concerned with what passes by unnoticed and is forced to exist in the shadows.As the novel opens, all seems fairly transparent. The anonymous first-person narrator – a player at the club – is asked to help persuade the exceptional French-Rwandan striker, teenager Samson Kabarebe, to sign for them. Our narrator’s willingness to take up the challenge is characteristic. He’s L’Oracolo’s protege, the team’s “teacher’s pet”: a dutiful, family-oriented, working-class 19-year-old who grew up close to the club’s grounds. He’s grateful for the life-changing possibilities top-tier football offers.Samson, by contrast, is all strutting bravado. He courts the attention of new teammates and ecstatic fans alike, exuding “pure chutzpah” as paparazzi cameras flash. There’s more than a passing resemblance to Zava from Ted Lasso in some of Samson’s faux-gnomic assertions (“Monaco is an illusion”). Indeed, the abiding spirit of that show is evident throughout the novel, which is intent on turning the grand narrative of global sport into something smaller and more humane.The sex writing has the recognisable headiness of teenage angst but it often tips into absurdity or excessInitially, the narrator’s engagement with the feted incomer is rivalrous: Samson is given his position and squad number. But the anxiety of usurpation morphs into something else. The narrator’s intensely observed descriptions of Samson concentrate on his dynamic physicality. Samson is motion and action: he pounces on the ball, “snapping like elastic”; he dominates the pitch with “hurtling runs … springing leaps”. As in Allison’s debut,The Art of the Body, an unusual study of the realities of care work, disability and making art, the physical body is foregrounded. The narrator cannot evade thoughts of “the sinews of [Samson’s] forearms, the sharp edge of his jaw”; Samson is “all limb and length”.Our narrator has “had these sorts of feelings before” and, in the past, a few secret kisses with Kyle, another player in the team. But Allison convincingly paints the hypermasculine milieu of the wider team as profoundly homophobic, resistant to the merest possibility of queer desire. “Locker room talk” is peppered with throwaway allusions to “poncey faggots”, slurs that the narrator works hard to appear unruffled by. And he is adept at that, after “years of hiding and ceaseless repression … auditing and controlling [his] emotions”.Somewhat predictably, the lure of Samson’s physicality and easy charisma thwart the usual operations of the narrator’s emotional control: “Desire throbbed in my groin like a disease I might succumb to.” And succumb he does. As the team travel to away games and the two protagonists share rooms, Samson and the narrator begin a clandestine sexual relationship.The juggernaut of transfer windows, possible relegation, dramatic injuries, gym sessions and post-match interviews chugs on as we might expect. Narrative drive is provided by the violent instabilities of Samson and the narrator’s relationship. A disquieting power imbalance and internalised homophobia underpin their encounters. Samson withdraws affection at will, decries their intimacy as “disgusting” and belittles the narrator’s careful tenderness. While the portrayal is keenly indicative of abuse, the narrator glows with a kind of pride that he alone “has the power to corrupt and pervert, tempt and turn” his lover. Notions of victimisation and predation are usefully equivocal.There are, however, questionable elements throughout. Peripheral characters such as the team’s psychologist and Samson’s Mephistophelean agent are wooden and could have been put to much better service to draw out more of the central characters’ interiorities. The sex writing, particularly in earlier parts of the novel, certainly has the recognisable headiness of teenage angst but it often tips into absurdity, silliness or excess.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

In the final pages, the ratcheted-up tension ebbs away in an inexplicably rushed flurry, to be replaced by underexamined heterosexist convention. The narrator’s tryst with Samson, consequently, ends up feeling rather futile and insubstantial, leaving only confusion and dissatisfaction as the final whistle blows.Greatest of All Time by Alex Allison is published by Dialogue (£22).

Like her first,The Lost Pianos of Siberia,it explores a land and its history. Reflective, watchful, calm, Roberts is such a vivid travel writer that you forget what a brilliant historian she is. She has the water-diviner’s gift for stories in unlikely places. And then, through research in archives as well as on the ground, for uncovering sparky details that bring the story to life. Her conversations with everyone she meets, from hospitable nuns to a chief in a red fez, who pores over the original expedition maps with her at a Chinese restaurant in Dodoma, give her narrative a glow of sympathetic charm.But she is telling a very grim story. The expedition she follows was dreamed up by King Leopold of Belgium, the plunderer of Central Africa at whose door the deaths of millions can be laid. Europeans at the time were preoccupied with how to get the plunder out: the French suggested flooding the Sahara. Leopold’s idea was to take Indian elephants and their handlers and use them to catch and train African elephants, then set up a supply line using these tsetse-fly resistant animals to transport Congo’s wealth out to waiting Belgian ships. Roberts’ recreation of their arduous route tells a tale “of blind ambition, violence and subjugation” which encapsulates the whole pitiless story of colonisation.Watching the British at work in India, Leopold realised what riches could be extracted from another people’s landTo carry out his plan, Leopold employed a charismatic Irishman, Frederick Carter. He made his name as a navigator on Mesopotamian rivers and spoke fluent Arabic, but knew little of Africa. Luckily, many of his letters and diaries survive and Roberts quotes from them so deftly that you feel you know him. She stays in places where he stayed, describing them as they are now and as he would have seen them. “As we retraced Carter’s steps, our views were his. Storks as slender as paint strokes picked their way along the bank.”She begins her archival work, however, by researching Leopold in Brussels. Even his father thought him “sly”. Watching the British at work in India, Leopold realised what riches could be extracted from another people’s land. Publicly, he presented his plan for Africa as a way of getting rid of the Arab slave trade. In fact, his appointees cooperated with Arab slavers rather than removing them, and privately he confessed he was after “a share of the magnificent African cake”. After Carter’s expedition, decades of trade treaties and informal imperialism were replaced by a naked power grab: the brutal “scramble for Africa” between 1884 and 1914. Infrastructure built by Leopold led to suffering on an unimaginable scale and his vicious enforcers, says Roberts, “routinely chopped hands off the Congolese if rubber quotas were not met”. He was personally responsible, it is estimated, for the death of more than 10 million people.It is Robert’s thoughtful reactions to these events in places where they happened, sometimes under the very same trees, that give her book its power. Carter, of course, failed in his mission. Of the four elephants he brought with him, all perished. Two died on the trek into the interior, where the party failed to find any wild ones to train. A third elephant died on the journey back and the last keeled over a week before Carter led his caravan into the Tanzanian town where bullets finally tore into his liver in a shootout.Twenty years after his death, an elephant training centre was set up in Congo and was still going in the 1930s when Nadine Gordimer visited. It was the ghostly ruins of this school that Roberts came across in 2015, sparking her interest in the subject, and giving rise to a book whose ugly story is made bearable by her warm, beautiful writing, and equally warm human encounters.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

My friend Anna and I are heading for the Cairngorms in a red campervan called Rowan, which we picked up fromBig Sky Campers, just across the Forth from Edinburgh. It’s an appropriate name, for we see the red berries of rowan trees everywhere we go, shining so brightly it’s as though someone’s strung tiny clusters of baubles on the silver-barked branches.At 1,748 square miles, the Cairngorms is the UK’s largest national park, stretching from Perthshire in the south to Moray in the north; mountains rear up just after we pass the riverside village of Dunkeld, armed with pastries fromAran Bakery. When I’ve been up here before, I’ve only skirted the edge of the park, sticking close to the hiking-shop-crammed town of Aviemore and seeing the hills – cloaked in snow at Easter and resplendent in purple heather in summer – from afar.Scotland mapDetermined to get right into the mountains, winter feels like the perfect time for a road trip – with few other tourists and the landscape arguably at its most dramatic. Our journey will take us north along the A9 before heading south from Grantown-on-Spey on what Visit Cairngorms callsthe Snow Roads. A 90-mile route that includes the highest public roads in Britain, the Snow Roads wind south through mountain passes to Blairgowrie, just outside the national park. Our plan is to drive its entirety over a couple of days, then loop back into the park near the village of Blair Atholl.View image in fullscreenDriving south from Braemar.Photograph: All images Anna MooresWith the short days, it feels like we’re chasing a sun that only just makes it above the hills. The light is already fading when we arrive atRSPB Insh Marshesafter a two-hour drive, silhouetting the leafless trees against the cotton-wool sky. The path – we have only enough daylight left for the one-mile track – winds through purple-tinged birch, frost crunching underfoot. Mountains, dusted with snow like icing-sugared cakes, loom in the distance, and honking gaggles of greylag geese stripe the sky in Vs.Our campsite for the night,Dalraddy Holiday Park, was set up onAlvie Estatein the late 1960s by the current laird’s father to cater for skiers. Today, it’s a sprawling but quiet site, handily open all year, with expansive mountain views and more secluded spots hidden among the trees. Rowan has two beds – one in the roof tent and the other on the back seats, which fold down – though we opt for the warmer option of sharing the latter, made extra cosy by the duvets, hot-water bottles and blankets Big Sky Campers provide. We sleep pretty well and wake to the piercing shriek of a tawny owl.The estate works in partnership, its manager Jonny tells me, with other local businesses includinghorse ridingandziplining, which I do at night, whizzing above the silver streak of a river. Many of these are run by people who have decided to diversify after having run ski businesses; the changing climate means snowfall is less reliable.View image in fullscreenCorgarff Castle as seen from The Watchers art installation.Despite the estate being managed it still feels wild, particularly as we climb up above the tree line for a view of the surrounding snow-streaked mountains. We have lunch in a candlelit bothy while red deer eat just outside; afterwards, we head to a hide to watch for red squirrels, though they only tease us with a brief appearance. Scotland’s relaxedOutdoor Access Codemeans that anyone can explore the land here on foot, but access to the bothy and hide is easiest (and most fun) on atour with Jamie, the laird of the estate.If anything, we are too spoiled for choice here in the Cairngorms – particularly when there are only about seven hours of daylight to play with. By the time we’re on the Snow Roads later that day, the only thing we can make out in the darkness is the thick fog that descends with no warning. It is with a sigh of relief that we reach the cosy pods atHowe of Torbeg, tucked on a hillside just outside the Cairngorms’ dark sky park; normally this would be a fantastic spot for stargazing, but tonight the weather is not in our favour.When the weather turns, we use the back of the van to squeeze into more thermals, and warm up on the heated seats after our walksThe next day, we retrace our steps to see the road in all its glory. It’s just 20 miles to Tomintoul, but it takes us a good couple of hours with all the stops to take in the views. “It’s like constant golden hour,” Anna says, our shadows cast long on the ground when we park up at The Watchers, an art installation of four striking cocoon-like seats.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe TravellerFree newsletterGet travel inspiration, featured trips and local tips for your next break, as well as the latest deals from Guardian HolidaysEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

(Judging from the number of vans we see at Dalraddy and Braemar campsites, there are a fair number of campers made of sturdier stuff than us.) Still, having a van is a real treat. At lunchtime, Rowan really comes into her own: we park beside a narrow burn on the Glenlivet Estate and make tea to accompany our sandwiches, which we enjoy with a mountain view from the back seat. Later, when the weather turns, we use the back of the van to squeeze into more thermals, and warm up on the heated seats after our walks.We head south for our next stop, Ballater, arriving in the dark (again) at theBalmoral Arms; the morning reveals the village’s graceful buildings and independent shops, the wide River Dee rushing nearby. We have just 50 miles left of the Snow Roads from here but allow a whole day to drive it, stopping at Braemar to join a tour with Simon Blackett ofYellow Welly Tours, who takes us to the Linn of Dee (“a linn is a narrow, whooshy gorge,” he tells us, as we watch the frothy coffee-coloured river buffer between steep rocky walls) and to see shaggy coated highland cows.The landscape becomes gentler and greener as we near the end of the Snow Roads, but swinging back up to theOld Manse of Blairfor our final night takes us back into the drama of the national park. We’re greeted with mulled cider and a warm welcome from front-of-house Jason. The next morning we wake to the hills just coming into focus, streaked with heather and soft sunlight.View image in fullscreenJason making a cocktail at the Old Manse of Blair.The trouble with having a campervan is that we feel even more untethered to normality than we usually would on holiday; there’s a feeling we could just keep going and going. Instead, we put off reality for just a little longer, wandering the woodlands around Blair Castle to find red squirrels, before chasing the last of the sun back to Edinburgh.Van hire was provided byBig Sky Campers(from£285for three nights).
