Are there no limits to the prime minister’s contempt and hatred? Not that Steve is a total nobody. He’s not a run-of-the-mill backbencher. But he has risen as high as he is likely to go as a junior minister in the Foreign Office. Probably higher than Steve ever expected. Certainly higher than his mates expected. Put simply, Steve is a dependable plodder. Someone who can be trusted to do as he is told. To not ask questions. And yet for Keir he is just collateral damage. Expendable.Not that this is how it will have been put to Steve. Rather, the prime minister’s outriders will have taken him to one side. A word in your ear. We’ve got a top-secret mission for you. Get this right and we can win the war. The future of the country is in your hands. The generals probably said much the same to the infantrymen on the morning of the Somme offensive. Though Steve would die many times over. The walking dead.On Thursday it was Doughty who was sent out to fend off the hospital pass of replying for the government on behalf of an urgent question on the appointment ofPeter Mandelsonas US ambassador. And even though Steve got to break the news that Mandy had just been sacked, he still got a thorough kicking from opposition MPs. The bruises are still visible.So you’d have thought that someone might have taken pity on poor Steve. Realised he was suffering from PTSD and could do with a spot of convalescence. Hell, even the worst offenders get a break sometime. But not Steve. The theory goes that he’s been so badly beaten up it won’t matter if he gets another mauling. Better to have just the one minister in intensive care.And it’s not just the prime minister who has it in for Steve. Yvette Cooper also takes a very relaxed view of the health and wellbeing of her team. In theory, it could have been the foreign secretary who took both Thursday’s UQ and Tuesday’s emergency debate on Mandy. A chance for Yvette to lead from the front. Yet she, too, chose to go missing in action. Contenting herself with sending a letterexonerating the Foreign Officeof any blame in Mandelson’s appointment. Nothing to do with her, guv.Still, at least the cowardice was catching. The Tories used to do the same whenever a cabinet minister was in trouble. Sending out some junior to face the flak while they hid in comfort several miles away behind the lines. Kemi Badenoch would later try to claim she would have set a different example. Luckily that will never be put to the test. So we were left with the hapless Steve looking miserable for three hours while everyone stuck pins in him. Some Tories would express regret. Steve was a decent man. They said. Yet still they killed him with kindness.First we were treated to a 30-minute exposition of all Mandy’s many failings from Tory David Davis. It wasn’t just that he had been best pals with a convicted child sex offender. That was just a career highlight. There was also his double resignation as a cabinet minister. Once for failing to disclose a loan, the other for interfering in a passport application for an acquaintance. Then there was the fawning to the Russians and the Chinese. Mandy never met a billionaire over whom he could not swoon. Weirdly, for a self-professed master of the dark arts, Mandy has always been rubbish at self-preservation. He just can’t help himself.We also had to endure 10 minutes of Kemi. What did the prime minister know and when, she asked. She is under the impression that it was her performance at prime minister’s questions last Wednesday that put the spotlight on Keir’s judgment. The reality was that it was the media who had done all the investigation on this.And Kemi – along with every other Tory MP – had all the evidence that Mandelson was a wrong’un all along. They just hadn’t done anything about it. Everyone had said: “So what if Mandy had stayed with a sex offender? It’s Donald Trump we’re dealing with here so normal rules don’t apply.” Hypocrisy is never too far distant from a Westminster scandal.Normally on days like this you can rely on a few government stooges to offer a few supportive words to the minister. Today, not so much. Most of the bare handful ofLabourMPs who were in the house were there to stick it to Mandelson. They were from the left of the party and have never forgiven Tony Blair and Mandy for their manifold sins of 20 years ago.A lone Labour whip handed out a list of topics helpful to Steve. Only two took up the offer. Florence Eshalomi wittered on about having been to Nigeria and seen the civil service doing good works there. She quickly petered out. Then we got uber-loyalist John Slinger. He talked of Andy Coulson and how David Cameron hadn’t vetted him properly. Quite quickly, he got laughed down by the whole house. Tory Julian Lewis called Mandy “Grovelling Lord Yum Yum” and Slinger was left sobbing. “Don’t patronise me,” he sobbed. What else was anyone meant to do with him?And so to Steve. The last man standing. The prime minister had acted decisively, he insisted. Really? WhenKeir had got the new informationthat Mandelson had written to Epstein saying he had been wrongly convicted, he had sacked him. So let’s get this straight. It was fine with everyone – the Tories included – for Mandy to hang out with a sex offender as long as he thought he was guilty. Run that one past us again.Doughty’s misery was almost complete. Mandy hadn’t been so bad. He had been a Times Radio presenter. Passed the vetting for Oxford chancellor. So why not be the US ambassador. Even Steve could tell that he was dying on his feet. Yet trying to kid himself he was doing something heroic. For Keir and country.We never did get to the bottom of how the vetting process had been conducted and whether its findings had been ignored. Or whether Mandy might have lied. Shock horror. Steve rushed for the exits. A bottle of scotch was called for. Oblivion was the only answer.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonThe politics sketchHouse of CommonsLabourForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeConservativesKeir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. ButRobert Redfordwas very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s westernButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidin 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustache, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the jazz age con-men caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs. His photograph was in the dictionary next to “handsome”.Cool hand Paul: Peter Bradshaw on why Paul Newman devoted his life to playing the American everymanRead moreIn Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman might be permitted to entertain Katharine Ross with his wacky stunts on a bicycle, to the accompaniment of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head. But it was blond bombshell Redford who was actually going to have sex with her. Redford was a throwback to the era of Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power, the Hollywood era of gasp-inducing matinee idols and swoonworthy dreamboats, absurdly handsome men whose beauty seemed to have been nurtured in some Hollywood petri dish.The American movie business was reputedly trying to imitate some of the dash and freewheeling style of the French New Wave directors – and Redford became, for a while, the Bardot of the American new wave, but with a self-awareness and a comic self-deprecation that made him irresistible to women and men. He was a comic performer with wonderful flair, but never, in my view, very well served by serious pictures such as The Great Gatsby (1974) in which he played Fitzgerald’s enigmatic plutocrat, or The Way We Were (1973), in which he is the shallow Wasp in love with Barbra Streisand’s Jewish intellectual. In those films, for me, Redford would sometimes appear to retreat into himself, into his own misty-eyed aura, like a very lonely and beautiful woman.His best film of that time is surely Michael Ritchie’s superb political satire The Candidate, a movie released in June 1972, 12 days after the Watergate break-in. Redford plays Bill McKay, an idealistic young Democratic candidate for the US Senate, and the movie shows him on the campaign trail inexorably trimming his standards and watering down his principles as he gets closer and closer to winning.All the President’s Men: Hoffman and Redford fight the powers that beRead moreRedford’s pure handsomeness itself achieves a sublimely satirical quality in the film; politics is supposed to be show business for ugly people, but Redford’s physical beauty is symbolic of how the ruling class sees itself – and a symbolic of the bland, specious plausibility of mainstream political ideas. In All the President’s Men (1976) he was Bob Woodward to Dustin Hoffman’s Carl Bernstein – another “buddy” pairing of the sort he and Newman made fashionable in 1970s cinema. It was a heartfelt, liberal movie in which you knew who the good guys were, but without the edge and cool ambiguity of Ritchie’s The Candidate.As the years went on, there was something rather too controlled and preserved about Redford’s performing style, although he remained an above-the-title A-list star. He played opposite nuclear scene-stealerMeryl Streepin Out of Africa (1985) and inevitably got royally upstaged; in the 90s, he was still the romantic lead in Up Close & Personal opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, while in Indecent Proposal he was the wealthy businessman who makes a rather preposterous “proposal” which appeared to offer audiences a rather contrived dilemma in which feminism is neither here nor there.But this was the era in which Redford was branching out into direction. His Ordinary People (1980) was the spectacularly uptight and distraught upper-class family drama-tragedy starring Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore. It was very respectfully received at the time, although film critics have never quite forgiven Redford for beating Scorsese’s Raging Bull to the best picture Oscar. The environmental themes of The Milagro Beanfield War (1988) and A River Runs Through It (1992) were again treated with respect but there was no great excitement.Quiz Show takes the prize for historical accuracyRead moreBut Redford did score one resounding success as a director, and that is with the tremendous media satire Quiz Show (1994), the story of the rigged TV gameshow scandals of the 1950s, with Ralph Fiennes as a talented but venal young academic seduced by TV celebrity and Paul Scofield as his sorrowing father. This film performed poorly at the box office, but it is really good, and Redford’s direction of Fiennes is very assured. He got from that actor one of his very best screen performances.But of course it is the Sundance Institute and its annual festival of independent film that is Robert Redford’s real and lasting legacy, built on land in the skiing country around Park City, Utah, which Redford bought and on which he built an institution which administers funds and fellowships which help young film-makers.Sundance 2015: Robert Redford talks change but not retiringRead moreSundance itself has come in for a bit of criticism these days; it’s a festival which I’ve heard denounced as encouraging a parodied kind of Sundance movie, of pallid, humourless, underclass emoting of lost souls, photographed in stonewashed colours – the equivalent of Brit realist miserabilism – while the festival is now allegedly packed with studio-bound careerists intent on an “indie” break which will get them a superhero franchise.Well, no matter. Who can doubt the remarkable ambition and imagination of Robert Redford, who created something that outlasted his own very formidable career? He was always more than a pretty face.2:08Robert Redford: one of Hollywood's defining stars – video obituaryExplore more on these topicsRobert RedfordSundance film festivalButch Cassidy and the Sundance KidFestivalsBarbra StreisandMeryl StreepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But Chichester has never produced its own version of “the Danish play” until now. No pressure then for director Justin Audibert, whotook over in 2023.In a year of briskly delivered Hamlets set at sea (byRupert Goold) or soundtracked by Radiohead (co-directorsSteven Hoggett and Christine Jones), Audibert delivers not a high concept but a lucid and unhurried tragedy. In soliloquy after soliloquy, Giles Terera takes you deep into the prince’s torment, the intimacy of the Minerva accentuating the precision of his expressions. The lights come slightly up when he reaches “To be or not to be”, Terera’s eyes slowly closing on “perchance to dream” only to be rudely wakened before that line’s conclusion.View image in fullscreenHollow crown … Sara Powell and Ariyon Bakare, centre, in Hamlet.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThis Elsinore is long rotten thanks to designer Lily Arnold’s palette of greens and metallic shades. On a split-level stage, the castle’s walls are tarnished and the shine is to be wholly removed from the crown, spotlit on a cushion in the opening image. Sound designer Ed Clarke’s effects are akin to metal being stretched and vessels creaking, the ghost’s “swear!” resounding like a crack of lightning, while Arnold’s rocky coastline upstage reminds you of imminent invaders.Ryan Day’s lighting takes its cue from Hamlet’s “inky cloak”: the prince is one of many figures glimpsed in the darkness, eavesdropping in a court where the warning “no tongue” is repeatedly sounded. Terera looms in the shadows as Claudius (Ariyon Bakare) is directly crowned by Gertrude (Sara Powell) and the new king is met with an obsequious chorus of approval at a candlelit council.Through this, Terera simmers, eyes burning with hate, but melancholy tinges his delivery. His opening speeches convincingly convey a man processing the trauma of his father’s death and suggest he is already haunted, even before the arrival of the ghost (Geoff Aymer). This is a classical Hamlet who, by the time of his scorchingly lit final soliloquy, could not sound more modern, the personal turned political as he laments the deaths of thousands who “for a fantasy” fight for a plot of land.View image in fullscreenImprisoned … Giles Terera and Eve Ponsonby in Hamlet.Photograph: Ellie KurttzTerera, 48, is only a little younger than Bakare, making their characters more direct rivals for Gertrude. Eve Ponsonby, too, is a mature Ophelia, emphasising a sense of enforced arrested development and adding a sting to the reprimands of Polonius, who chides her as a “green girl” and literally, repeatedly, puts her in her place. Ophelia, a redhead dressed in green, is seemingly imprisoned within the castle’s rust-coloured walls.In a skilful performance as Polonius, Keir Charles gives us a figure of fuss and fury. Bakare delivers a slow-burning villainy as Claudius, whose trembling red right hand, concealed by a glove, is a reminder of his bloody deed and foreshadows God’s possible vengeance. Powell’s Gertrude is so racked with guilt the suggestion is that she drinks poison knowingly.At three and a half hours, the pace occasionally wavers but it is robustly acted (Sam Swann is a fine Horatio, Beatie Edney a gravedigger of earthy humour) and Audibert shows a keen understanding of the Minerva’s capacity for atmosphere. He is not the first to use Claudius’s prayer scene as an interval cliffhanger but as the former artistic director of theUnicorn, a children’s theatre, you sense he does so knowing there will always be audiences new to this play. As first Hamlets go, it’s a beauty.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHamletGiles TereraChichester Festival theatreJustin AudibertreviewsShareReuse this content"

Let’s hope the PM can stomach itTue 16 Sep 2025 11.16 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 13.47 EDTShareQuick update on Keir Starmer’s government of “national renewal”: having just lost his deputy and housing secretary over her failure to pay the required stamp duty, the prime minister has alsolost his US ambassadorover his known close association with a known paedophile sex trafficker. Hang on – he’s now also lost his director of political strategy forrelating some dirty jokesabout Diane Abbott.Meanwhile, an increasing number of people think the solution to all this is Andy Burnham taking over, suggesting the current Greater Manchester mayor could run in a parliamentary seat that has only notionally become free because the previous Labour MP was suspended from the party after being found to havesent messageshoping a couple of constituents would soon be dead/“mown down”, and is now apparently “off sick”. On top of which, we’re having the Americans round. US president Donald Trump touches down in the UK tonight on the eve of the most hideously ill-starred dinner party since the vomiting scene in Triangle of Sadness. I don’t think the nation could possibly feel any more renewed.It’s been a few days since Peter Mandelson’s emails to Jeffrey Epstein were held up in front of the public using the hazmat tongs, and the more I’ve thought about them, the more I come back to one of the more obscure lines. Writing in apparent anguish on the eve of Epstein’s incarceration in 2008, Mandelsonopines to him: “It just could not happen in Britain.” Maybe he was right, unwittingly or otherwise. Britain is very, very good at a sort of institutionalised looking away. Maybe Mandelson was – unwittingly or otherwise – characterising something grim about this country that pious old Keir Starmer would no doubt be hugely affronted to be caught up in. Except, the prime ministeriscaught up in it – in fact, he’s at the very centre of it. He is the one who looked away.It’s hard not to feel there is something necrotic and beaten about a government whose leader would appoint someone he knew had been very close to Epstein, who the entire world by that point knew was – and forgive me for repeating the words – a paedophile sex trafficker. Association with him was already known to be such a horror show that the late Queen Elizabeth II had tosack her own sonfor it. And there is something worse about Starmer’s horrifying lack of curiosity even as the facts closed in, right till the bitter end, with No 10 dithering for staggeringly long last week over a set of quite the most disqualifying emails, while Starmer fannied about defending Mandelson at the dispatch box.This was, of course, the other dispatch box to the one at which Sir Keir plied his holier-than-thou trade in opposition. There’s an old online rule that declares that if you tell someone off for their spelling or grammar, you will always end up making your own howler while you’re doing it. Starmer spent his years in opposition telling off the Tories at every turn, instead of – for instance – coming up with a creative and coherent plan for growth. Inevitably, we now seem to be strapped in to watching him and his administration warrant a daily telling-off, as offences and immoralities mount up. Why does this keep happening to him, etc?As for Epstein, we know that at the time Mandelson was writing to him telling him to fight for early release, police in Palm Beach, Florida had identified 36 girlswho the “financier” had sexually abused. Yet for all the many years of grim and grotesque revelations, it still feels as though we know remarkably little about him. Who was he, this mysterious paedo Gatsby, and where did all his money come from?It’s over and out (again) for Mandelson, but how many political lives does Starmer have left? | Gaby HinsliffRead moreShortly after his death, New York magazineran a fascinating storyin which real hedge-funders expressed pointed bemusement over how Epstein made his money, since none of them had really had any dealings with him. As one big hedge-fund president, Doug Kass, put it: “I went to my institutional brokers, to their trading desks and asked if they ever traded with him. I did it a few times until the date when he was arrested. Not one institutional trading desk, primary or secondary, had ever traded with Epstein’s firm.” As Kass had said to a journalist: “There’s another guy who reminds me of Madoff that no one trades with.” Or as another hedgie remarked: “It’s hard to make a billion dollars quietly.” And yet Epstein had made no noise at all in the financial world. They could barely find one investor. Their general theory was that the “hedge fund” was simply a cover for a blackmail scheme.Perhaps most amazing, really, is the fact that Epstein will be a ghost at the feast tomorrow night for more than one attender, as Trump continues to butch out his long and close association with precisely the type of evildoer his Maga followers are convinced runs the world. Epstein is a guy who really does fit the very template of their darkest conspiracy theories – rich and powerful, involved in the trafficking of minors, connected in a network of some of the most powerful people in the world. This is all the sort of stuff they’ve been going on about for years – yet who should keep rearing his head in the story, but their own beloved president.Isn’t it intriguing how many of them (currently) just can’t bring themselves to believe it? Something to discuss over the starter tomorrow night at Windsor Castle, perhaps, as long as everyone can keep their food down.Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnistDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Born in Hounslow in London, he had moved to Shrewsbury when he was seven: “A very white town. There was a British Movement march soon after we moved up there.” Theirs was a “small-P political household”. His dad was a social worker, his mum worked for various charities. “She was from Mauritius, and now on the telly, the National Front were saying they were going to send people who weren’t born in Britain home in six months. I was petrified that my mum was going to get sent home.” The ambient racism of 70s and 80s Britain permeated everything. “I just remember being scared,” Lowles says. “We used to go on holiday and I tan really easily. I was frightened of coming back to school too brown.”You can’t meet terrifying politics except with politics of your own, he realised in his teens. How to Defeat the Far Right is Lowles’s memoir-cum-manual, telling the story of how Hope Not Hate, the anti-fascist campaign group, came into existence in 2004. There is no other organisation like it, in its range of actions and independence of spirit. It does a lot of data (polling and analysis) but also a lot of community organising; it infiltrates fascist spaces, online and off, to subvert their plans, and it organises counterprotests. It is connected to institutional politics, though its influence waxes and wanes – Lowles is a good friend of Gordon Brown’s, but doesn’t feel especially heeded by the current government.How to Defeat the Far Right is a troubling read. There are victories – in Barking and Dagenham, Hope Not Hatecampaigned to defeat the BNPafter it did so well in the 2006 local elections that, had it stood more candidates, it would have been the first council in Britain controlled by an openly racist party. Possibly less well known is Hope Not Hate’sfoiling of a plotto murder the MP Rosie Cooper in 2017. Jack Renshaw, a member of the banned far-right organisation National Action, planned to kill Cooper with a gladius machete that he’d already bought, as well as take hostages, lure in a detective, preferably female, and kill her as well. Another member of Renshaw’s group was secretly passing all this information to Hope Not Hate, which enabled his arrest.And yet, the overall arc is not victorious. The far right is stronger than ever. Reading Lowles’s book, I felt like that picture of a cat reading To Kill a Mockingbird, thinking, “There is no information here about killing mockingbirds.” The Tommy Robinson march at the weekend, exactly as Lowles predicted, was “massive”. Police estimated there were between 110,000 and 150,000 people in central London, possiblythe largest far-right demonstrationthe UK has ever seen. Even withoutElon Musk’s video address, with his chilling “fight or die” language, Lowles’s point was clear: “Violence and extreme violence are part of our politics in a way that’s only going to get worse.”Between our interview and that demo, the hard-right US activist Charlie Kirk was shot dead while he was speaking, and the reaction, Lowles says, “was so many people, in the US and the UK, saying ‘This is war’; ‘Time for revenge’. There are growing forces, principally on the far right but also other places, who are itching for conflict, who are itching for civil war as the only way to achieve their goals.” And it’s hard, if you were frightened in London on Saturday – whether because you were part of the 5,000-strong counterprotest, or because you were not white – to see how you sit that out.View image in fullscreenStephen Graham as far-right informant Matthew Collins and Jason Flemyng as Lowles in The Walk-In, ITV’s dramatisation of the Rosie Cooper case.Photograph: ITVLowles has quite an upbeat disposition but it’s not mindless – his perspective is more, “We are where we are, what are you going to do, lie down?” Speaking to me in the Guardian offices – a bare little room with no distinguishing features, so that all the atmosphere comes from the peril-ridden conversation – he says matter-of-factly: “People are really demoralised. People feel life is tough. In the migration sector, in the refugee sector, in the climate sector, people are feeling defeated. There’s a job of work to do for our own side, people who believe in a multicultural society: we need to feel like there’s a togetherness, because people feel quite alone.”We’ve been lobbying for years to ban this Nazi satanist group. The Home Office doesn’t think it meets the thresholdLife changed for Lowles in the mid-80s, when at 15 he became political. He was into everything – the anti-apartheid movement, Trotskyite politics,Red Wedge(the musicians’ collective supporting Labour to oust Margaret Thatcher, which, well-spotted, took ages). He went to the University of Sheffield because his Trot group wanted a ringleader for a nascent anti-fascist group there, “and I found myself spending all my time going to other people’s meetings to argue with them. We’d be sent in, we’d have a little script, they’d come to our meetings to argue with us. That’s all we did all day – we didn’t speak to any ordinary people at all. But I was always an activist, I didn’t give a shit about the theory. I just suddenly thought, ‘What am I doing?’”“Activist” is quite a freighted word, nowadays. The line between activism and direct action appears more and more blurry, as public order offences are nowso numerousthat it feels as if chanting “we shall overcome” carries a potential prison sentence, and it’s possible to pass on a bus through central London and see900 pensioners get arrestedfor sitting on the grass with homemade Palestine Action signs. We have a quick and frankly mad conversation about what this government classes as terrorism. “At Hope Not Hate, we’ve been lobbying for years to ban a Nazi satanist group called Order of Nine Angles. It’s been in existence for 50 years, but over the last 15 years, with the internet, it has inspired a generation of mainly teenage boys to commit really bad acts of violence, both to themselves and to others, and particularly to women. People have been sent to prison in this country because they’ve encouraged teenage girls to self-harm; there’s an overlap with child pornography. It’s shocking. Those two sisters who were murdered in Wembley,” he says, referring toBibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman. “The bloke behind it, he wasn’t a Nazi but he was a satanist, reading all this material. Every time we go to the Home Office, they say, ‘We don’t know whether it meets the threshold.’ And then they ban a group …” He trails off without mentioning that group, understandably. If he didn’t get arrested for saying it, I’d get arrested for writing it.View image in fullscreen‘It’s only going to get worse’ … Tommy Robinson leading the Unite the Kingdom far-right march in London on 13 September.Photograph: Vuk Valcic/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockWhere does Lowles stand on direct action, and what it means? He makes an endearing groaning noise, like a man who’s just been asked whether he thinks the conservatory could do with a lick of paint. “When I first got involved in anti-fascism – this was late 80s – it was all about the street. I’m not saying it was right, but that’s how it was. You didn’t have cameras.” So, wait, he doesn’t mean handing out leaflets in the street? “No, you would have groups of Nazis and groups of anti-fascists, and they would battle it out, down sidestreets, and sometimes it got quite violent. I mean, look at me, I’m not built for that. I never got involved in that. But that was the world it was.”Iactually do look at him, because this is a huge question. It’s not really about whether you are tall enough or brawny enough to fistfight. It’s about how directly you experience fascism, how personal it is to you, how urgent, but also how much else you would try before you’d give in to a primitive confrontation – the whole constellation that makes you look at a man throwing a brick, and pick up a brick of your own. And he’s right, he’s not built for it, but only for the last reason, not for the others.“So that’s why I gravitated towards Searchlight,” he says. This was an anti-fascist magazine that had been going since the 60s, with the lo-fi look of a fanzine but very carefully researched reporting. “I’d take photos. Gerry Gable, the head of Searchlight, said the best thing you can do – this was 1989 – is intelligence, find out what the fascists are up to. Within three weeks, we had one person in the Sheffield BNP, within three months we had three people in Yorkshire. So I felt I was doing something that wasn’t having to pick up a hammer and run around the streets, which other people were doing.”Lowles doesn’t do the infiltration himself, because he’s too recognisable. As it is, there have been real costs for him personally – credible threats to his life; a foiled kidnapping event. “There are two people who are in prison at the moment for threatening me, there’s another one awaiting trial.” He tells me other poignant stories about the daily cost to his family of the activism he does, which can’t be printed as they would just generate more hazard.Anti-fascism in the 80s was all about the street. Sometimes it got quite violent. I’m not built for thatI first encountered Hope Not Hate right after Brexit, which was an existential crisis for it, as it was forLabourand, dare I say it, also for the Guardian. Everyone was wrestling with the same demands of separating the racism, British exceptionalism and stupidity that had been deployed instrumentally to generate anger from the anger itself. “The social polarisation went both ways,” Lowles remembers. “We found with our supporters, after 2016, it was really hard to get them to go into strong leave communities because they were so fucked off. We’d always prided ourselves that we would go into the areas that other people didn’t, engage with communities that weren’t necessarily like us.”He has a strong stomach for difficult situations, having been in them since he was in his late teens. It’s amazing to hear him talk about confrontations when he was young, when 50 grownup fascists surrounded him and his mates while they handed out leaflets, calling them paedophiles so that, as the icing on the cake, they’d also have local teenagers throwing projectiles at them. Amazing, I guess, because a lot of today’s confrontations, for example outside the Bell hotel in Essex, feel so distinct and novel, with far-right protesters justifying their hostility as the protection of women and children. In fact, they have their roots in hard-right tropes going back decades; but you had to be there to know that.View image in fullscreenLowles: ‘There are two people in prison at the moment for threatening me, and there’s another one awaiting trial.’Photograph: David Levene/The GuardianThat being said, he hasn’t seen all this before. He’s worried. “We’ve got to be honest about where we are,” he says. It’s been a hideous summer for an anti-racism campaigner. Before the Reform conference even started, “we had Nigel Farage’s press conference where Reform were basically saying that they would bedeporting 600,000 people– women, kids, who cares if they get killed? The most extreme immigration policy any mainstream political party has had. And how did Labour respond? They put out a tweet saying, ‘He’s all talk. We’re the ones really kicking people out.’”What I saw at Saturday’s rally was racism, pure and simple. Labour won’t tackle it until we can call it what it is | Diane AbbottRead moreWe couldn’t have got here, where all political capital seems to be accrued by competitive xenophobia, without years of decline, says Lowles. “There is a direct correlation, as I explain in the book, between hostility to immigration and a) levels of deprivation, and b) social capital. Gordon Brown would accept that now, but the Blair/Brown years didn’t understand: it’s not just about someone having a job. It’s about what type of job, what type of respect they get in their community.” But the more proximal government failure, the thing you could really stick on Labour – and Conservative governments before them – is complete negligence towards, and the sometimes wilful sabotage of, community cohesion. “There used to be a tension monitoring unit, they would kind of keep an eye on what’s happening in the country. There was a way for councils, police, statutory agencies to feed in. All that’s gone, through cuts. Then Gove came in and destroyed what was left. The interfaith networks, he destroyed that ideologically and it hasn’t been built back up.”Lowles spoke to Labour ministers when they were still a government-in-waiting, asking about their social cohesion policy, “knowing full well they didn’t have one, three months out from the general election. They said, ‘Oh well, we’ve got somebody in the Lords thinking about it.’ They had someone thinking about faith, which is different. Then the riots happened, and a year on, we still don’t have a cohesion strategy.”Yet (deep breath, optimism incoming) he doesn’t think either the race-to-the-bottom political rhetoric or the fervidly anti-immigrant tabloid atmosphere really reflect “where the British people are. There’s another big world out there. We don’t want to go to the other side and be uber-liberal and write people off. But in our polling – and it’s not just ours, also other people’s – the things that agitate people most, it’s not immigration, it is sewage.” It’s true that the cost of living, the NHS and the economytypically feature more prominentlythan immigration when people are asked what matters to them, yet at the same time, salience is self-fulfilling in politics. If immigration is all the tabloids talk about, and then all politicians are interested in, and the only way to get attention from the self-same media that is already fixated, it starts to loom larger in people’s attitudes when they’re polled. That isn’t easily provable, because the cause and effect run concurrently and constantly interact, but it’s also bleeding obvious.Robinson and Farage’s ‘civil war’ narrative is warping voters’ minds. How is any government supposed to counter it? | John HarrisRead more“I was up in Makerfield in January,” Lowles continues. “They’d had their worst flooding for 30 years. A hundred people were having a coffee morning, and probably most of them had voted Reform. People were furious with the water authority and the Environment Agency. Part of the rise of Reform is more than immigration, it’s this feeling that nothing’s working, the political parties have failed. They make promises they don’t keep. There’s no difference between them. You can have all sorts of national pledges, it means nothing to people on the ground. They look at the world around them and they just see things crumbling.”All that can be true, without changing the fundamentals that, “Most people do not want to see internment camps, do not want to see women and kids dragged out of the country, refugees sent home to their deaths. There is a basic decency among British people, they don’t want all that. Rather than getting despondent – which is easy, at the moment – we’ve got to mobilise, we’ve got to get active.”How to Defeat the Far Right: Lessons from Hope Not Hate by Nick Lowles is published on 25 September by HarperCollins.

On Thursday he will hold talks with Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat.While there are plans for demonstrations targeting the president, the schedule means he is unlikely to see any of them. But as with any interaction with Trump, the visit is filled with uncertainty and political risk for Starmer, particularly the planned joint press conference at Chequers.In an article for the Guardian, Khan said that while he understood the pragmatic reasons for maintaining good links with the US, Britain should not be afraid of criticising a leader who alongside his allies, he said, had “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.Khan, whopublicly clashedwith Trump during his first state visit in 2019, condemned Trump’s use of the military in diverse cities, as well as the way some US citizens had been deported without due process: “These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.”How huge London far-right march lifted the lid on a toxic transatlantic soupRead moreThe so-called special relationship between the UK and US, Khan said, “includes being open and honest with each other”, adding: “At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power. This includes being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division.”Khan also criticised British politicians and the media for failing to condemn increased hatred and intolerance, saying this had directly led tothe huge far-right demonstrationin London at the weekend.“The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere,” he said of the protest, which was led by the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson. “For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.”He went on: “For our leaders, silence is no longer enough. The time has come to stand up and say: this is not who we are.”Starmer has faced criticism for a seemingly slow response in condemning Saturday’s march, which also had a video address from Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, who said “violence is coming”, telling the crowd that “you either fight back or you die”.But in more robust comments to a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday morning,Starmer said thatthe UK faced “the fight of our times” against the division exemplified by the march.According to a summary of his remarks, Starmer told his ministers “that some of the scenes of police officers being attacked on Saturday, and a march led by a convicted criminal, were not just shocking but sent a chill through the spines of people around the country, and particularly many ethnic minority Britons”.It continued: “He said we are in the fight of our times between patriotic national renewal and decline and toxic division. He said the government must heed the patriotic call of national renewal, and that this was a fight that has to be won.”View image in fullscreenAnti-Trump demonstrators.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIn the first response from the government, the business secretary, Peter Kyle, said on Sunday that he was not disturbed by the scale of the event or the far-right rhetoric heard at it “because it’s actually proof that we live in a country where free speech, free association, is alive and well”.Asked why the No 10 line had seemingly moved on from Kyle’s view, Starmer’s official spokesperson said this was only part of the picture.“Obviously, freedom of speech, freedom to march, is a core part of this country’s values,” he said. “But what he’s saying is, when some people see a convicted criminal egged on by foreign billionaire calling for violence, some people are going to legitimately feel scared and intimidated. Some of that will be because of their background or the colour of their skin.”Wes Streetingused a speech to the LGBT foundationon Monday to say that he found it “laughable” that rising racism and homophobia could be seen as a sign of free speech.The health secretary said he understood why some were questioning “whether this government is really on our side”, adding that the weekend’s protest was “not the kind of country any of us want to live in”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSadiq KhanThe far rightFar rightFar right (US)King Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

He played a key role in the establishment of American independent cinema by co-founding theSundance film festival, which acted as a platform for films such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project, Donnie Darko, Fruitvale Station and Coda.View image in fullscreenRedford with Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarRedford also acquired a reputation as one of Hollywood’s leading liberals and campaigned on environmental issues, including acting as a trustee of theNatural Resources Defense Counciladvocacy group andvocally opposingthe now cancelled Keystone XL pipeline extension.Born CharlesRobert Redfordin 1936, he grew up in Los Angeles and, after he was expelled from the University of Colorado, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. After playing a series of small parts on TV, stage and film, he began to make headway in the early 60s, being nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy in 1962 for The Voice of Charlie Pont and winning a lead role in the original 1963 Broadway production of Neil Simon’s hit play Barefoot in the Park. Redford’s film breakthrough arrived in 1965: an eye-catching role as a bisexual film star in Inside Daisy Clover opposite Natalie Wood, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe.After a series of solid Hollywood films, including The Chase and a screen adaptation of Barefoot in the Park, Redford had a huge hit with the 1969 outlaw western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which he starred opposite Paul Newman and Katharine Ross. It was nominated for sevenOscars, though none were for the actors.Redford starred in Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here, the first directing credit in over 20 years by former blacklistee Abraham Polonsky, and then a string of key 1970s hits: frontier western Jeremiah Johnson (1972), period romance The Way We Were (1973) opposite Barbra Streisand, crime comedy The Sting (1973), again opposite Newman, and literary adaptation The Great Gatsby (1974). Redford followed these up with conspiracy thriller Three Days of the Condor (1975) and Watergate drama All the President’s Men (1976), co-starring with Dustin Hoffman.View image in fullscreenRedford with Jane Fonda in the 1967 film version of Barefoot in the Park.Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty ImagesAfter a prolonged break from acting in the late 70s, Redford turned to directing with the ensemble drama Ordinary People, adapted from the novel by Judith Guest. A substantial hit, it won four Oscars in 1981, including best picture and best director for Redford – an accolade he never received for his acting.His success as an actor continued in the 1980s and 1990s, though perhaps with less of the cutting-edge impact of his 1970s work. Baseball drama The Natural, adapted from a Bernard Malamud novel in 1984, was followed by Out of Africa in 1985, in which he played big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton opposite Meryl Streep’s Danish aristocrat. He returned to directing with The Milagro Beanfield War in 1988 and A River Runs Through It in 1992, both grappling in different ways with rural America. A year later he made what in retrospect was something of a turning point: an unalloyed Hollywood project, the erotic thriller Indecent Proposal, in which his businessman character offers a million dollars to sleep with Demi Moore’s character. It re-established Redford as a commercial force. Later in the 90s he directed Quiz Show and The Horse Whisperer (the latter of which he also starred in).View image in fullscreenWith fellow winners Robert De Niro, Sissy Spacek and Ordinary People producer Ronald L Schwary at the Oscars in 1981.Photograph: APIt was in this period that theSundance film festival– which Redford’s production company had co-founded in 1978 as the Utah/US film festival and renamed in 1984 after Redford’s Sundance Institute – began to exert its influence as a showcase for US independent cinema, promoting the likes of Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Kevin Smith. Its impact only increased in subsequent decades as a forum for boosting films’ commercial chances and achieving awards recognition, showcasing films such as 500 Days of Summer, Napoleon Dynamite, Whiplash, Fruitvale Station and Coda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The IDF is striking terror infrastructure with an iron fist,” Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X as the attack was launched in the early hours of the morning, adding: “We will not relent until the mission is completed.”Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said the goals of the offensive were “defeating the enemy and evacuating the population”, omitting any mention of the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages, which was been a constantly stated war aim until now. Hostage families and their supporters protested near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Tuesday, accusing him of abandoning their loved ones.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said it was clear that Israel had no interest in a peaceful outcome.“Israel is determined to go up to the end and [is] not open to a serious negotiation for a ceasefire, with dramatic consequences from Israel’s point of view,” Guterres said.Officials from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said two divisions were involved in the ground advance towards the centre of Gaza City, with one division surrounding it. They estimated that the invading force would be met by up to 3,000Hamasand allied fighters, and said the Israeli forces would advance cautiously.“It’s a gradual thing. It is not a black or white thing. But yesterday was a big step forward … in operations on the ground,” one IDF official said. “This phase is defined by a coordinated and gradual manoeuvre combining precise intelligence, air and ground forces targeting Hamas’s central stronghold and aimed at dismantling its grip in this area.”Some of the principal weapons being used in the offensive are old model armoured personnel carriers, converted so that they are controlled remotely, and loaded with explosives. According to Israeli reports, they are being driven at suspected Hamas positions and detonated.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks and armoured vehicles at the Gaza border. The latest phase of Israel’s offensive involved both air and ground forces.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe health ministry in Gaza reported on Tuesday afternoon that 59 people had been killed and 386 wounded in the previous 24 hours, bringing the official toll of Palestinians from nearly two years of war to almost 65,000. The actual number is feared to be significantly higher.The ground assault was launched on the day that a UN panel of human rights experts published a reportaccusing Israel of committing genocide.“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the genocide convention,” said Navi Pillay, the chair of the commission of inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.Israel’s foreign ministry rejected the commission’s report as “distorted and false”.The country faced the threat of mounting isolation, however, as it pressed ahead with its offensive. On Wednesday, the European Commission was due to present a plan to member states to impose “measures to pressure the Israeli government to change course over the war in Gaza”, said the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.“Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza will make an already desperate situation even worse,” Kallas said, adding: “It will mean more death, more destruction [and] more displacement.”“Suspending trade concessions and imposing sanctions on extremist ministers and violent settlers would clearly signal that the EU demands an end to this war,” she said.Netanyahu sought to brace the country for greater economic isolation in a speech on Monday in which he said it would have to “adapt to an economy with autarkic features”, suggesting it would have to be more self-reliant with fewer trade options.Gaza City residents reported a night of intense bombardment before the ground assault was launched. The IDF believes 40% of the estimated 1 million population of Gaza City and its outskirts have so far left after Israeli evacuation orders. Israel warned those remaining to follow and to flee southwards.View image in fullscreenPalestinians flee south along Gaza’s coastal road on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APAccording to UN data, 140,000 people have fled Gaza City heading south over the past month. Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, said there was no safe haven for the displaced population.“It is inhumane to expect nearly half a million children, battered and traumatised by over 700 days of unrelenting conflict, to flee one hellscape and end up in another,” Ingram told reporters from al-Mawasi, an overcrowded sprawling tented camp on the southern coast of Gaza Strip.“People really do have no good option – stay in danger or flee to a place that they also know is dangerous,” Ingram said.The Arabic-language spokesperson for the IDF, Col Avichay Adraee, announced: “The IDF has begun dismantling Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City.”“Gaza City is a dangerous combat zone. Remaining in the city endangers you,” he said on social media.When news broke of the ground operations on Tuesday morning, Netanyahu was attending a hearing of his corruption trial in a Tel Aviv court, and used the offensive as an argument why he could not attend long or frequent court sessions. His critics have long argued he has prolonged the Gaza war to put off elections, stay in office and thereby preserve his legal immunity.The ground assault was launched in the immediate wake of a two-day visit from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, whohad pledged “unwavering” US support for Israel.Once the ground offensive was launched, Donald Trump directed blame at Hamas, telling reporters at the White House that the militants would have “hell to pay” if it used the surviving hostages as human shields during the assault.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuHamasIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

This report proves that this is not, currently, the case.”She added that the government’s upcoming investigation intoNHSmaternity care must be a “turning point” for black women in particular. “In-built structural racism in maternity services repeatedly fails Black women.Acknowledging this and addressing racial disparities in maternal outcomes must be one of the investigation’s core aims,” she added.The rate of maternal death in Black womenThe rate of maternal death in Black womenThe committee also found that given these disparities, it was “indefensible” that cultural competency training was not mandatory for NHS staff working across maternity services. They urged the government, the Royal College of Midwives and the Nursing and Midwifery Council to make the training compulsory for all staff, and that the training should be informed directly by the experience of black women.Inadequate data collection was also cited as a factor for the ethnic disparities across maternity care, with the committee finding that a significant number of individual NHS trusts were failing to consistently record this information, and that this lack of robust data resulted in a system being “blind to its failings”. As a result, the committee also urged the government to accelerate development of a maternal morbidity indicator, which it has already committed to producing.The report comes after previous findings by the advocacy group Five X More, which found thatalmost half of pregnant black womenraised concerns to healthcare professionals during labour, with half saying that their concerns were not properly addressed.Tinuke Awe, a co-founder of Five X More, said that the committee report was welcomed, and that there was an “urgent need to tackle systemic failings in maternity care” for black women.Awe added: “For too long, Black women have been ignored in maternity care, and the recommendations in this report highlight that change is overdue. We believe now is the time to act. Fix it for Black women, fix it for all women.”Clare Livingstone, the head of policy and practice at the Royal College of Midwives, said that black women being at greater risk during pregnancy and childbirth was a “disgrace”.“The recommendations in this report must be acted upon urgently and everyone in maternity services must work together to tackle these shocking disparities,” Livingstone said. “It should not be the case that these inequalities exist in England today.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said:“Racism in any form is completely unacceptable and we are determined to reduce the shocking disparities that this report addresses.“We’re already taking action to improve maternity care, including launching an anti-discrimination programme, training thousands more midwives, and introducing new standards to tackle leading causes of maternal mortality.”Explore more on these topicsHealthEnglandWomenNHSRaceHealth policyChildbirthnewsShareReuse this content"

PreviousDepartment for Education (DfE) datafound that about one in five children were classed as SEN last year, including 482,000 in England with educational, health and care plans (EHCPs) that detail specific support for individual children.Jason Elsom, Parentkind’s chief executive, said: “Despite the best efforts of our schools, hundreds of thousands of families are hurting because our SEN system is broken.“Families should not have to wait months or years to receive the support they so desperately need. Our measure as a society should be the way we treat our most vulnerable, and this should weigh heavily on our shoulders.”Parentkind is the UK’s largestparent-school charity, working with more than 24,000 parent teacher associations and school parent councils.Half of parents who sought an assessment said it was undertaken by the school and half said that they were still waiting or had paid for a private assessment. A quarter of those waiting said they had been doing so for more than a year.The survey also laid bare the personal cost that many parents face coping with a child with special needs: 15% said they had given up their job to care for their child, while 20% said they had taken time off from paid work.A third of parents of children with SEN said they faced “financial strain due to additional costs” and increased tensions at home, while 40% said they had experienced their own mental health problems.There have been sharp rises in diagnoses of autism, ADHD and speech and language needs among children in recent years, with speech disorders and social and emotional issues increasing rapidly since the Covid pandemic.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has described England’s increases in special educational needs and disabilities (Send) as “staggering”, reflecting “improved recognition of needs that were always there” through greater awareness and diagnosis.‘It was personal, critical’: Bristol parents’ long battle over council Send servicesRead moreBridget Phillipson, the education secretary for England, has said the DfE will publish a white paper outlining its plans for reform later this year. It is expected to expand special needs provision within mainstream schools and encourage the creation of specialist units within them.But many parents and campaigners fear that the reforms will curtail the use of EHCPs, and arally took place outside parliamentearlier this week.The DfE said it is “committed to improving inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools”, but the department faces an uphill struggle with the Treasury for funding for more special school places.The DfE said: “This government inherited a Send system left on its knees – which is why we are listening closely to parents as we work to improve experiences and outcomes for all children with Send, wherever they are in the country. Our starting point will always be improving support for children.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsParents and parentingDisabilityDepartment for EducationChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

The first removal flights were due to take place on Monday and Tuesday of this week butwere cancelled. The man had been due to be on a flight to France at 9am on Wednesday.The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, halted his removal after a decision came through during the court hearing that his claims to be a victim of trafficking required further investigation.The ruling is a significant blow to the government because many of those due to be removed under the scheme are potential victims of trafficking. Because they have only recently arrived in the UK they have not had an opportunity to have their trafficking claim fully investigated nor to obtain expert medical and psychological reports.TheHome Officeargued against halting the removal, saying that the man could get further evidence to support his trafficking claim from France. On Tuesday evening, Sheldon said he was “going to grant a short period of interim relief”.The judgment came after a decision from the national referral mechanism, which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking, and the invitation from the body for the man to make further representations.In his oral ruling, Sheldon said: “It seems there is a serious issue to be tried with respect of the trafficking claim and whether or not the secretary of state has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.“In my view there’s a serious case to be tried as to whether or not the removal decision is lawful. If there is a reasonable suspicion he has been trafficked that would amount to a statutory bar for removal, at least for a short period of time.”Earlier on Tuesday,Downing Street denied that the returns deal with France was in chaosafter plans to forcibly remove from the UK people arriving in small boats were abandoned on Monday and Tuesday. The prime minister’s spokesperson was forced to deny that the latest delay meant theagreementwas a “shambles” when asked by reporters.A government source said the first flight was expected to take off this week.Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, which is supporting detainees earmarked for removal toFrance, said: “We welcome the high court decision to halt this man’s flight so that details of his case can be considered. We are in contact with people detained for the one-in, one-out scheme, the vast majority of whom are torture and trafficking survivors.“The largest group is fromEritrea. Due to the nature of what they have experienced in the countries they have passed through, histories of modern slavery and sexual abuse are recurring.”Ministers agreed theone-in, one-out pilot schemewith the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat crossings so far this year.The first detentions of migrants took place last month as the deal came into force and they have been held at an immigration removal centre pending their removal from the country.Under the arrangement, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.Sonali Naik KC, representing the unnamed man, told the court on Tuesday he faced a “real risk of destitution” if he was put on a flight to France. She said there was a “serious issue to be tried” and that the man risked destitution in France, something the judge said he did not believe would be the case. The court heard evidence that about a third of asylum seekers in France were not accommodated and given a daily allowance of €7.50.Kate Grange KC, for the Home Office, said it was important for the agreement with France to go ahead because of the continuing risk to life of Channel crossings. “Serious injury and death, including of children, from small boat crossings in the English Channel is a grave social and political concern at the present time,” she said.The Tories said Labour’s returns deal with France was “another failed gimmick” after a scheduled deportation was blocked following a last-minute legal challenge.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEritreaLabourFranceEuropeHome OfficeHuman traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

In a trial of 3,127 adults, one in five people who took the once-a-day tablet for 72 weeks lost 20% or more of their body weight.Weight loss jabs have been transformative but pill versions are seen as a holy grail because they are easier to store, distribute and administer and are also expected to be cheaper, offering fresh hope for the millions of people trying to lose weight.Orforglipron is a GLP-1 agonist, a type of medication that helps lower blood sugar levels, slows the digestion of food and can reduce appetite.The weight loss seen among people taking the tablet is not as stark as that among patients taking tirzepatide (Mounjaro), which is also made by Eli Lilly, but experts believe the tablet will be more accessible and convenient compared with injections.Orforglipron is not yet approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or regulators in other countries. Eli Lilly has said it expects substantial demand when the new pill is launched.The company published a snapshot of the resultsin Augustand the full paper detailing the findings has now beenpublished in the New England Journal of Medicineand presented to the annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in Vienna, Austria.In the study, the 3,127 patients were split into groups taking orforglipron pills of different strengths, while others took a placebo, for 72 weeks.All of the patients had obesity, meaning they had a body mass index (BMI) score of 30 or over, but they did not have diabetes. Patients from the US, China, Brazil, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Slovakia and Taiwan took part in the study.Researchers led by Dr Sean Wharton, of McMaster University in Canada, found that after 72 weeks people taking the lowest dose of orforglipron, 6mg daily tablets, lost an average of 7.5% of their body weight. Those taking the highest dose, 36mg, lost an average of 11.2% of their body weight.Among patients taking the highest doses, 54.6% had a reduction of 10% or more of body weight, 36% had a reduction of 15% or more, and 18.4% had a reduction of 20% or more.Researchers said other health metrics also improved among people taking the drug, including better blood pressure, a smaller waist circumference and a reduction in bad cholesterol levels.The most common side-effects were gastrointestinal, which were said to be mild to moderate.“In adults with obesity, 72-week treatment with orforglipron led to significantly greater reductions in body weight than placebo,” the authors wrote. “The adverse-event profile was consistent with that of other GLP-1 receptor agonists.”Wharton said: “This could mean an expansion of obesity interventions to groups who are currently excluded due to the cost of and lack of access to injectable medications.”Health leaders have hailed weight loss drugs as transformative. But injections come with additional work for health services, so tablet forms could help millions more people trying to lose weight.Separate research published in JAMA Pediatrics on Monday shows weight loss jabs could be effective on children as young as six who are obese or have type 2 diabetes. However, stomach problems were “significantly more common” among children taking the drugs, the researchers said.They said longer follow-up periods in future trials and more real-world studies were “essential to establish the long-term effects of GLP-1 RAs in children and adolescents”.Explore more on these topicsObesityMedical researchHealthnewsShareReuse this content"

The US territory of about 170,000 people lies in the Pacific Ocean and despite growing geopolitical tensions in the region, the cost of living rather than military aggression is front of mind for many residents.Guzman says she is worried “about paying bills” and has trust in the US government to protect her.But that certainty shifted slightly this month when the threat catapulted into the headlines, asBeijing used a military paradecommemorating Japan’s defeat in the second world war to unveil a range of new military hardware – including a weapon dubbed the “Guam Killer” by Chinese media.Xi, Putin and Kim: behind the choreographed image that could symbolise a shift in the global balance of powerRead moreIn addition, the image of China’s president Xi Jinpingsurrounded by the leaders of Russia, North Korea, Iranand more signalled for some a new and unexpected danger.“From what I’ve read, just about everyone in this region should be worried,” says Frank Whitman, 71, who lives in Barrigada, right next to the headquarters of theGuamnational guard, a component of the US military.“But there is nothing really not much we can do.”View image in fullscreenA military parade in Beijing, China, in 3 September 2025.Photograph: Xinhua/ShutterstockLocated about 3,000km east of China, Guam is a strategic hub for the US in the Pacific and hosts a large military contingent. Experts say that if China were to annex Taiwan – as its leader Xi has pledged – Guam would probably become a frontline in the conflict that could follow.For that reason, displays of China’s increasing military prowess –this month’s event includednuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles, anti-drone lasers and four-legged “robot wolves” – loom large in the territory.“Guam is a key strategic location for the United States in the Western Pacific,” says Michelle Tucker, public affairs officer for the Joint Task Force-Micronesia, a newly established command that overseas military operations in the western Pacific.She says the region is among the most ‘“consequential” for the US and that the military is “ready to defend our US homeland here on Guam”.With that in mind, the US is developing an enhanced integrated air and missile defence, said to provide 360-degree protection around Guam. According to the record of decision recently released by the defence department, the $1.5bn project is expected to be completed in 10 years.“Guam should be aware of the threat, even if not so worried,” says Col Grant Newsham, a retired US marine officer, noting that the Chinese military has outpaced the US in some areas.“If the Chinese choose their timings and locations … they could really hurt US forces,” says Newsham, a senior fellow at the Center for Security Policy and Japan Forum for Strategic Studies, and author of the 2023 book When China Attacks: A Warning to America.map of guamNevertheless, Newsham believes the US military remains powerful and more than a match for China’s new military technology.As well as the missiles and underwater drones, Xi standing with the North Korean and Russian leaders at the military parade prompted new concern among some in Guam.Gina T Reilly, a communications specialist for a military contractor, says she used to not be worried by China – until the “joint public appearance by Vladimir Putin, Kim Jong-un and Xi Jinping”. That, she says, signals “closer political ties and mutual support” between the countries.View image in fullscreenVladimir Putin, Xi Jinping and Kim Jong-un in Beijing earlier this month.Photograph: KCNA via KNS/AP“That can alter regional and global diplomacy and make coordinated actions more likely. It’s alarming because it can be a military and security allegiance,” Reilly says.Local officials, however, continue to insist that defending Guam is of paramount importance to the US military.Guam senator Jesse Lujan, chair of the legislature’s federal affairs committee, says the local government receives intelligence briefings from US military officials and the protection of the island is taken “with the utmost seriousness”.“Our role is to remain calm, informed and united, trusting that the proper channels are in place to ensure our security.”Explore more on these topicsGuamChinaAsia PacificPacific islandsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The crowd loudly chanted the name. The focus of this acclamation was not Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known as Tommy Robinson, the organiser of the so-called “free speech” march in central London last Saturday.They were instead shouting themselves hoarse for Charlie Kirk, the murdered political activist from Cook County in the US state of Illinois.It is unlikely that many of the 110,000 to 150,000 protesters estimated to have been on the streets last weekend, atwhat turned out to be the largest rally of its type in British history,knew much about Kirk before his death at the hands of a gunman at Utah Valley University.The UK version of Kirk’s Turning Point USA, which claims to be the “largest Conservative student movement” in the US, has never really taken off in Britain.But they were moved to cheer him on Saturday. Clips of an almost entirely white and predominantly male crowd of Britons chanting the first name of the murdered 31-year-old were lapped up on social media accounts said to be US-based, as was the minute’s silence afterwards.View image in fullscreenProtesters carry a Charlie Kirk banner during the ‘unite the kingdom’ London march.Photograph: James Willoughby/Sopa Images/Shutterstock“Thousands of British patriots just fell silent in honor of Charlie Kirk in London,” tweeted Eric Daugherty, an assistant news director at the conservative Florida’s Voice website (“Honest political reporting to Florida, minus the mainstream talking points.”)It is said that when America coughs, Britain catches a cold.The reality with this strain of politics is that there is something of a feedback loop between the US and the UK that is proving mutually beneficial to both sides, said Prof Paul Jackson, author ofPride in Prejudice: Understanding Britain’s Extreme Right.Kirk may not have been a household name in the UK but his murder offered validation for a view that a certain outlook on life is under threat. In turn, the scenes on Saturday provided evidence of the righteousness of the cause back in the US.There is history to this mutually enforcing exchange of ideas on the extreme right, said Jackson.A certain type of US political thought has never travelled well across the Atlantic, notably the Ku Klux Klan, which grew after the civil war in the late 1860s, said Jackson.But other ideas have thrived in the past as they do today, including those contained in Madison Grant’s 1916 book The Passing of the Great Race, which influenced some European white supremacists, and Henry Ford’s The International Jew.It has not all been one way. The Blood & Honour movement, founded by British neo-Nazi and white power music pioneer Ian Stuart Donaldson in 1987, led to the birth of Blood & Honour American Division and Blood & Honour Council US.That was the analogue age, though.In the digital era, particularly in the so-called “counter-jihad” space that now dominates what is loosely termed the far right, the mutual reinforcement of messages is done in real time. Stories of social conflict or moral panic in one country are used to boost a political claim in another.Kirk himself was one of those who picked up on the case of Lucy Connolly, the 42-year-old English woman –married to a Conservative councillor – who was sentenced to 31 months in prison for calling for hotels that were housing asylum seekers to be burned down during last summer’s riots.(She was released in August after serving less than half her sentence.)View image in fullscreenLucy Connolly with Nigel Farage at the Reform party conference in Birmingham earlier this month.Photograph: James Veysey/Shutterstock“Every day people say: ‘Well someone should go kill Charlie Kirk.’ I don’t like it, but that is protected speech,” he told GB News. “In America, we care what you do and not what you say.”It was of a piece with the general claim that free speech is under threat in the UK, confirmed in the mind of the likes of JD Vance by the UK’s Online Safety Act, aimed at preventing young people from encountering harmful content, which the US vice-president claims has put Britain on a “very dark path”.The amplification of certain causes, the repetition of choice phrases, cannot be said to be highly organised, but it is nonetheless powerful.The Infowars website, founded by the prominent conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, promoted Robinson’s content about the rally on Saturday, but also that of a series of obscure accounts on X, said to be based in both the UK and the US.“Breaking: London falls silent for fallen hero Charlie Kirk,” said one such account with 335,700 followers that described itself as a defender of western values and culture. “The British media hated him. The British people certainly didn’t.”View image in fullscreenNaomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer.Photograph: YouTubeAnother account promoted by Jones’s site was that of Naomi Seibt, a US-based German political influencer linked to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) party, who is known for her climate change denial and promotion of “great replacement theory” tropes.She tweeted images from the rally to her 436,700 followers that included the words: “White children will grow up as patriots from now on. White guilt is over.”Brigitte Gabriel, founder of the anti-Muslim movement Act for America, which claims to have 1,000 local chapters across the US, posted on X: “Don’t let the media downplay how massive this is. Millions of patriots in the UK are standing up for free speech.”Then there is Elon Musk,who appeared via videolink at Saturday’s rally. It would be difficult to overplay the importance to Robinson of the support of one of the world’s richest men, according to analysts including the Hope Not Hate anti-extremist organisation.View image in fullscreenElon Musk, right, appeared via videolink during the protest talking to Tommy Robinson.Photograph: YouTubeIn lifting the ban on Robinson’s content on X and through his own misleading posts framing him as a free speech warrior persecuted by the state, Musk gave the activist a vital leg-up, it is argued.Robinson, a former member of the racist British National party, who has a string of convictions to his name including for assault, using a fake passport, mortgage fraud and contempt of court, is said to have been able to build upon his profile in the US, stir up protests outside hotels accommodating asylum seekers while pushing anti-immigrant messages that circle around a supposed threat of Islamisation to the UK.“When you hear people talk about the special relationship between America and Great Britain, this is the special relationship that you’re seeing here,” Robinson said at the rally.“Whether you choose violence or not, violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die,” Musk told the crowd, in turn.Musk is not yet believed to have directly funded anyone in the UK, although he reportedly flirted with offering money to Reform, the rising political party on the right that is led byNigel Farage. But such transatlantic relationships do exist, albeit they tend to remain below the radar. It is a murky soup – but some of the chunkier players can be made out.One is the US tech billionaire Robert Shillman, known as Dr Bob, who in 2018 financed a fellowship that helped pay for Robinson to be employed by the rightwing Canadian media website, Rebel Media, now called Rebel News, on a salary of about £5,000 a month.View image in fullscreenLaura Loomer, an American conspiracy theorist.Photograph: Abaca Press/AlamyOther Shillman fellows have included Katie Hopkins, the English former reality TV star who compared migrants to cockroaches, and Laura Loomer, the American conspiracy theorist referred to by some as the president’s “de facto national security adviser”.The rightwing Middle East Forum thinktank, led by the neoconservative academic Daniel Pipes, has paid for foreign speakers to attend Robinson rallies in the past, in addition to funding the activist’s legal defence.There are laws against foreign donations in both the US and the UK but the far-right echo chamber is also clearly a useful tool for those seeking electoral success on both sides of the Atlantic.Trump has had no qualms about bouncing off certain British causes, sometimes unadvisedly. He said he was prepared to apologise in 2018 when he retweeted posts from Britain First, an offshoot of the BNP. But he is notably cautious about certain characters.Trump, who will be in the UK for a state visit this week, did not comment on social media about Saturday’s rally. He appears to prefer his outriders to do the work at times, including his son.When the rightwing activist Kurt Schlichter claimed – falsely – on X that Robinson had been arrested for reporting on a court case in May 2018,Donald TrumpJr retweeted it, writing: “Reason #1776 for the original #brexit. Don’t let America follow in those footsteps.”In the UK, Farage, who successfully fought for decades for the UK to leave the European Union and is today riding high in the polls with his anti-immigration populism, has sought to keep a sterile gap between himself and Robinson, who he fears is beyond the pale for much of the British public.He steps carefully in the digital space, seeking support but without getting too close to the most strident actors, including those in the US. He is notably quite loth to associate himself too much with Trump these days when he is at home in the UK, given the US president’s poor approval ratings among the British public.View image in fullscreenNigel Farage is careful not to make too much of his friendship with Donald Trump to avoid alienating the British public.Photograph: TwitterBut his long-standing ties to the Make America Great Again movement remain financially advantageous. This week, Farage apologised for breaching parliamentary rules by failing to register a trip to Florida to headline a fundraising event for Trump. He had been the main speaker at the $500-a-head Republican party dinner in Tallahassee in March.Farage hopes to benefit from the promotion of anti-immigrant themes in the digital world, including from US commentators, without putting off those with more mainstream outlooks, say insiders. It will be a difficult trick to get away with – as Musk’s criticism of Farage at the start of the year over his lack of support for Robinson illustrated.“British people are kind of looking for an international source of inspiration,” said Jackson. “[Then] some of the reason why somebody like Nigel Farage or Tommy Robinson might be of particular interest in the US is because they’ve had a lot of success in their own terms.“Tommy Robinson’s social media profile of the last few years has been highly impactful, even more so since [Musk] reversing his ban from Twitter. Nigel Farage’s impact on Britain shortly before Trump’s first presidency can be seen as perhaps providing some blueprints about how to have impact.”Gawain Towler, who was Farage’s long-standing press adviser until he left Reform earlier this year, said he believed the American interest in shaping British politics was also instinctive.“Trump sees the UK as the spiritual home of the US,” he said. “He sees our traditional political and legal traditions as the spiritual background to America’s right.“Musk certainly feels that way. He sees the UK as the spiritual homeland of the concepts of the American Declaration of Independence and its bill of rights and all the rest of it. This is where freedom was born, right? It’s like losing a great-uncle if it falls.”"

By his own admission, Gray said, Robinson had planned the murder “in a bit over a week” once he knew Kirk would be attending a speaking engagement at Utah Valley University (UVU) in Orem last Wednesday.He sent his roommate messages confessing to the crime, Gray added. Robinson said why he had done it and then begged the roommate, whom the prosecutor said had also become his lover, to stay silent and hire a lawyer if the police came calling.It was, by any reasoning, a damning account, coming just hours before the first court appearance later on Tuesday of the 22-year-old Utah resident. Gray announced he wascharging Robinson with aggravated murder, among other offenses, and would seek the death penalty.In a pointed statement to indicate he had tuned out the furious rightwing backlash to the killing, and calls by Donald Trump and allies for “vengeance and retribution” for Kirk’s death, Gray said he alone was responsible for deciding upon the charges.“The murder of Charlie Kirk is an American tragedy. I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently,” Gray said, somberly.Gray read details from a 10-page information document, including that a gun belonging to Robinson’s grandfather was allegedly used in the killing, and that the relative wanted to know what had happened to it. The weapon was later found in a field close to the university wrapped in a towel.But it is the lengthy text message exchanges with the roommate, “a biological male who was involved in a romantic relationship with Robinson”, according to Gray, that give remarkable new insight into the alleged killer’s motives and actions.Gray said the exchanges took place on 10 September in the hours immediately following the shooting.“The roommate received a text message from Robinson which said, ‘Drop what you are doing, look under my keyboard,’” Gray said. “The roommate looked under the keyboard and found a note that stated, ‘I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it’.“After reading the note, the roommate responded, ‘What? You’re joking, right?’”Gray said the roommate, whom he described as “transitioning genders”, then received a message from Robinson, saying he was unable to leave the area of the incident because of police activity.The prosecutor said the next text stated: “‘I am still ok my love, but am stuck in Orem for a little while longer yet. Shouldn’t be long until I can come home, but I gotta grab my rifle still. To be honest I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age. I am sorry to involve you.’”Gray continued: “Roommate: ‘You weren’t the one who did it right?’ Robinson: ‘I am, I’m sorry.’ Roommate: ‘I thought they caught the person?’ Robinson: ‘No, they grabbed some crazy old dude, then interrogated someone in similar clothing. I had planned to grab my rifle from my drop point shortly after, but most of that side of town got locked down.’”Earlier in the briefing, Gray said investigators had spoken to Robinson’s mother, who said her son had, over the last year “become more political and had started to lean more to the left, becoming more pro-gay and trans rights-oriented”.He disclosed that the exchange with the roommate then began to explore a motive.“Roommate: ‘Why?’ Robinson: ‘Why did I do it?’ Roommate: ‘Yeah.\"’ Robinson: ‘I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can’t be negotiated out. If I am able to grab my rifle unseen, I will have left no evidence. Going to attempt to retrieve it again, hopefully they have moved on. I haven’t seen anything about them finding it,’” Gray said.The bolt-action rifle, it turned out, had already been found in nearby woodland, wrapped in a towel, and with three unspent rounds with engravings on their casings.“Hey Facist! [sic] Catch!” said one. “O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!” said the second. “If you Read This, You Are GAY Lmao,” the third said, according to the charging document.Robinson, Gray said, expressed in another message to his roommate that he was frightened of losing it.“I’m worried what my old man would do if I didn’t bring back grandpa’s rifle … how the fuck will I explain losing it to my old man,” he wrote, according to Gray.Gray’s account of Robinson’s arrest on 12 September, two days after the shooting, appeared at odds with FBI director Kash Patel’s insistence that he had been found by solid detective work.It was, the prosecutor revealed, Robinson’s own mother who exposed him. In conversations with investigators, he said, she painted a picture of her son as an increasingly radicalized and isolated individual at odds with his family’s conservative leanings.“The day after the shooting, Robinson’s mother saw the photo of the shooter in the news and thought the shooter looked like her son. Robinson’s mother called her son and asked him where he was,” Gray said.“He said he was at home sick and that he had also been at home sick on September 10. Robinson’s mother expressed concern to her husband that the suspected shooter looked like Robinson. Robinson’s father agreed.“Robinson’s mother explained that over the last year or so, Robinson had become more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans-rights oriented.“She stated that Robinson began to date his roommate, a biological male who was transitioning genders. This resulted in several discussions with family members, but especially between Robinson and his father, who have very different political views.“In one conversation before the shooting, Robinson mentioned that Charlie Kirk would be holding an event at UVU, which Robinson said was a ‘stupid venue’ for the event. Robinson accused Kirk of spreading hate.”The rest of the text exchanges with the roommate, Gray claimed, were also incriminating. “Delete this exchange,” said one. In another, he said father wanted to see a photograph of the rifle, and had expressed support for Trump.“Since Trump got into office [my dad] has been pretty diehard Maga [Make America Great Again],” he said.Then he said he was “gonna turn myself in willingly, one of my neighbors here is a deputy for the sheriff”.He signed off with concern for his roommate: “You are all I worry about love. Don’t talk to the media please. Don’t take any interviews or make any comments … if any police ask you questions ask for a lawyer and stay silent.”Gray gave few more details as the press conference drew to a close. He stressed that everything he said were only accusations and recognized Kirk’s family.“Like all murders, the senseless and needless taking of Charlie Kirk’s life has shattered the lives of those he loved and those who loved him,” he said.The suspect made an initial court appearance later on Tuesday. In that hearing, Judge Tony Graf confirmed there would be a waiver hearing on 29 September at 10am GMT via Webex.Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUtahnewsShareReuse this content"

The animals returned but Chuñil, who was 72 at the time, and Cholito did not.More than 100 people joined her family in a search lasting weeks in the steep, wet and densely overgrown terrain of Chile’s ancient Valdivian forest. After a month, they even kept an eye on vultures for any grim signs. But theyfound no trace of Chuñil.Chuñil is one of 146 land and environmental defenders who were killed or disappeared around the world last year, according to a report by the campaign group Global Witness. About a third of those, like Chuñil, were from Indigenous communities – a heavy toll for groups who collectively make up just 6% of the global population.Chuñil, a leader of Chile’s indigenous Mapuche, was living on disputed land. Ten years ago she had moved on to Reserva Cora, a 900-hectare (2,200-acre) portion of the ancient Valdivian forest 500 miles south of Santiago, which her people claimed as an ancestral territory.She spent years campaigning to secure land rights over the site for her community. But the site’s nominal owner, the descendant of settlers, refused to relinquish control. He wanted the site for logging – Chile is a major supplier of wood to the US – and he wanted rid of Chuñil. Before she vanished, Chuñil told supporters: “If anything happens to me, you already know who did it.”Global Witness started documenting cases of killings and disappearances of land and environmental defenders in 2012. Since then it has collated a total of 2,253 cases. For the past decade, the most dangerous place has been Latin America. In 2024 it accounted for 82% of cases, including 45 Indigenous people.“Land conflict is at the heart of violence against defenders, andIndigenous peoplesare paying the highest price,” said Javier Garate, a senior policy adviser at Global Witness. “Communities with ancestral connections to land often form the frontline of resistance when their territories come under threat from exploitation and encroachment. But despite their critical role, they are frequently denied recognition and justice, and subjected to serious danger for defending their rightful lands.”Chuñil’s was the only case recorded in her country last year, although it fitted a pattern of the targeting of Mapuche activists in Chile. Colombia recorded 48 cases, making it the deadliest country overall for environmental defenders, followed by Guatemala with 20, the deadliest country per capita. Mexico had 19 cases, putting it in third place overall.Under-reporting remains an issue, particularly in Asia and Africa, which registered 16 and nine cases respectively, Global Witness said. Overall, last year the fewest cases of killings and disappearances of environmental defenders were registered for a decade.Laura Furones, who led the research for Global Witness, said: “I would also like to be able to tell you that this implies a decrease in violence and an improvement in the conditions for defenders, but unfortunately that’s not the case. Human rights defenders face realities of violence that go far beyond murder. What violence often does is evolve, become more sophisticated, change its face.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In April, two animals from Chuñil’s home that they had planned to auction to fund legal costs were found killed, one shot and one poisoned. “It is, above all, a deliberate attempt to prevent us from fighting this case,” her son Pablo San Martín told Global Witness.The group’s report calls on governments to act to end the impunity of the killers of environmental defenders by addressing the lack of rights defenders have over land and territory, strengthening weak national legal systems, and ensuring defenders at risk are given adequate state protection.“All we are asking for is a full, fair investigation to take place,” San Martín said of his mother’s case. “It’s been almost a year since she disappeared and we’re still in the dark about what happened.

He told journalists: “Israel categorically rejects the libellous rant published today by this commission of inquiry.”Israel has rejected the charge of genocide, citing its right to self-defence after the Hamas attack on 7 October 2023 that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, andtook 251 hostages. The subsequent war inGazahas killed more than 64,000 people, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000.What the report saysTo count as genocide under the 1948 UN genocide convention, adopted after the murder of 6 million Jewish people in the Holocaust, at least one of five acts must have occurred. The UN commission accuses Israel of committing four. It cited as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses and doctors, verified open-source documents, reporting by media and NGOs, and satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began.In thefirst categoryof killing, the commission quotes UN reporting that as of 15 July 2025, at least 46% of Palestinians killed in Gaza were women and children. The commission also cited reporting bythe Guardianbased on Israeli intelligence that 83% of those killed in Gaza were civilians.Israel has used heavy unguided munitions with a wide margin of error in densely populated residential areas … The number of bombs used by Israel since 7 October 2023 is extraordinary even in comparison to other world conflicts.Palestinians in Gaza were attacked in their homes, at hospitals, in shelters (including schools and religious sites), during the evacuations and in designated safe zones. At times, civilians, journalists, healthcare professionals, humanitarian workers and other protected persons were directly targeted and killed.The commission highlighted the killing offive childrenwhen their family car was targeted near a petrol station in the Tel al-Hawa neighbourhood of Gaza City on 29 January 2024, noting that Israeli security forces fired on an ambulance, “preventing access to the victims”.It also pointed to casualties that resulted from tight restrictions on humanitarian aid – especially medicine and medical equipment – from entering Gaza, quoting an obstetrician who spoke about deaths of pregnant women he had treated, whom he referred to as “indirect victims of war”.The commission describes at length the killing of 15 paramedics by Israeli forces in southern Gaza in March and “notes the consistent pattern of conduct demonstrated by the Israeli security forces in the aftermath of attacks, in that they have often denied and shifted responsibilities until evidence that contradicts their narrative surfaced”, also pointing to an acute lack of accountability.The report said Israeli authorities knew of the high numbers of casualties in Gaza since 7 October 2023 but “did not intervene to change the means and methods of warfare employed [but] persisted over time and caused even more Palestinian deaths”.“The Commission therefore finds that the Israeli authorities intended to kill as many Palestinians as possible through its military operations in Gaza since 7 October 2023 and knew that the means and methods of warfare employed would cause mass deaths of Palestinians, including children,” it says.View image in fullscreenThe report highlighted mass displacement of Palestinians ‘who have lost their homes and have been forced to live in inhumane conditions’ (Gaza City, 16 September 2025, pictured).Photograph: Ebrahim Hajjaj/ReutersTurning to thesecond categoryof acts that qualify as genocidal, causing serious bodily or mental harm, the commission highlighted the mistreatment ofPalestinian detaineesby Israeli security forces and mass displacement which, it said, “has caused serious and irreparable physical and mental harm to Palestinians in Gaza who have lost their homes and have been forced to live in inhumane conditions”.In thethird categoryof deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, the report noted that much of Gaza had been rendered virtually uninhabitable, that huge numbers of bakeries, schools, cultural sites and religious landmarks had been completely destroyed, and that attacks on hospitals had led to a collapse of the healthcare system. It also highlighted the recent declaration by respected UN-backed monitors of famine in parts of Gaza.Considering the evidence in totality, the Commission has found that Israeli authorities were aware of the high probability that their military operations, the imposition of a total siege … and the destruction of housing and of health systems and facilities would lead to the physical destruction of Palestinians, in whole or in part, in Gaza … The Commission therefore finds that Israeli authorities knowingly and deliberately inflicted such conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of Palestinians in Gaza.The section on thefourth categoryof imposing measures intended to prevent birthsis more concise, and focuses largely on the high proportion of casualties who were children, and the attack in December 2023 against theal-Basma IVF clinic, Gaza’s largest fertility clinic, which reportedly destroyed about 4,000 embryos and 1,000 sperm samples and unfertilised eggs.“It is reasonable to conclude that the Israeli security forces knew of the function of the clinic and intended to target it and destroy the reproductive material within,” the report concludes, adding that “the widespread and systematic targeting of children is part of a strategy to destroy the biological continuity and future existence of the Palestinian group in Gaza”.View image in fullscreenThe report noted that much of Gaza had been rendered virtually uninhabitable, as displaced people fled northern Gaza on Tuesday as the expanded ground offensive took effect.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APIntentInternational law experts say that it is often difficult to support genocide charges because of the requirement to prove intent, or even in some circumstances, sole intent.The commission concluded that statements by Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s prime minister, and other officials were “direct evidence of genocidal intent”.The report cited his letter to Israeli soldiers in November 2023 comparing the Gaza operation to what the commission describes as a “holy war of total annihilation” in the Hebrew Bible.The report also named the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, and the former defence minister Yoav Gallant.Navi Pillay, the South African former judge who is the most senior of the report’s three authors, headed a UN tribunal for Rwanda where more than 1 million people were killed in 1994.“The commission concludes that statements made by Israeli authorities are direct evidence of genocidal intent [and] also concludes that the pattern of conduct is circumstantial evidence for genocidal intent and that genocidal intent was the only reasonably inference that can be drawn from the totality of the evidence,” she told reporters on Tuesday.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warUnited NationsWar crimesPalestinian territoriesGazaIsraelGeneva conventionsexplainersShareReuse this content"

When fireworks were lit in Paris to celebrate the Austrian princess’s marriage to the dauphin of France, a conflagration ensued, the crowd stampeded and more than 130 people were killed – although rumour put the number much higher. From the start, it seemed she was destined to be hated by the French people and blamed for sufferings she didn’t even know existed.By the time the French Revolution had begun in 1789, Antoinette was demonised not only as a lavish spender but a rampant sex addict who cuckolded the king. Illustrations from 1790s pornographic booklets in the V&A’s epic show graphically depict her making love to a guard and to one of her ladies in waiting. By the time you get to these libellous prints, you can’t help feeling their bullying nastiness. For you have got to know her. This show is a superb lesson in how history can be understood through images and objects. It brings you as close as it’s possible to get to the real Marie Antoinette.View image in fullscreenPersonally modelled by the queen? … a porcelain  cup in the shape of a breast.Photograph: Martine Beck-Coppola/Grand Palais Rmn (Sèvres - Manufacture et musée nationaux) / Martine Beck-Coppola.She looks back at you with unruffled calm in portraits by Élisabeth Vigée le Brun. Antoinette’s patronage of this gifted painter immediately takes you into a very different royal world from the misogynist fantasies of the revolutionary press: a female-dominated circle where the queen’s fascination with fashion fed Vigée le Brun’s art. She liked to sport striking headgear on top of colossal hairstyles: her caps, or “poufs”, celebrated such events as the discovery of smallpox vaccination. To mark a French naval victory she wore a hat with a ship on top. But the style that inspired Vigée le Brun was a simple, rustic look. In her portrait of the queen in a straw hat, Antoinette holds a pink rose, pausing from her flower-arranging to look at us. It’s a shame they couldn’t pair it with Vigée le Brun’sSelf-Portrait in a Straw Hat, which is not far away in the National Gallery.She was demonised not only as a lavish spender but a rampant sex addict who cuckolded the kingAntoinette is downsizing here. Inspired by the Romantic movement, her hairstyles got smaller in the late 1700s. She turned to nature as the people turned on her, spending more time in her private retreat, the Petit Trianon, in the grounds of Versailles. You can see a gold-trimmed armchair from this pastoral hideout and, even more amazingly, a set of fake gardening tools that were props in the pastoral dramas she performed at its theatre.The ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who praised the state of nature and condemned civilised corruption, are reflected in her “natural” lifestyle, except she couldn’t help express this according to the codes and culture of the court – luxuriously.Another natural fashion in 18th-century France was for upper-class women to breastfeed their own children, instead of employing a wetnurse. This ideal is celebrated by Antoinette’s “breast cup”, a perfect porcelain simulacrum of a breast, rumoured to have been personally modelled by the queen.View image in fullscreenBack to nature … Marie Antoinette with a Rose by  Élisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun.Photograph: Christophe Fouin/© Château de Versailles, Dist. Grand Palais RMNRevolutionaries would say (and did say) that all this was a rich woman’s fantasy of naturalness expressed in completely unnatural, consumerist ways. Yet she was just making use of all the comforts of French upper-class culture. There is a ravishing collection of painted fans here, each one a fluttering piece of pictorial art featuring lovers, gods, or a satirical scene in which a hairdresser stands on a ladder to work on a woman’s towering hairstyle.As for the clothes, they are straight out of a fairytale. Therobe de cour(court robe) that the Queen of Sweden wore for her wedding in 1774 is a glittering silver dream beyond any Disney fantasy. This and other garments worn in the 18th century stand in a hall of mirrors, their invisible occupants haunting the gallery. Intimate relics belonging to the queen herself include jewels, her piano, her perfume bottles and pot pourri bowls. Versailles apparently stank.The revolution brought an end to fripperies. Truth was all – yet this too was expressed in fashion. Designs for revolutionary dress show his-and-hers patriotic costumes, including a Roman republican outfit. A depiction of the Festival of the Federation in 1790 shows the royal family conforming to the new ways. But by 1793, the guillotine beckoned.View image in fullscreenA glittering silver dream … the Queen of Sweden’s wedding gown.Photograph: Göran Schmidt Livrustkammaren/SHMAnd here it is. A surviving part of a real guillotine from the revolution, with its rotted black wood and still-sharp, still-usable blade has been lent by the Madame Tussauds archive. It may have been the very machine that beheaded Antoinette on the Place de la Concorde – then called the Place de la Révolution – on 16 October 1793. A print shows the executioner holding up her head for the crowd to see, blood streaming from her neck.After this, the reinvention of Antoinette in modern culture is explored, but it is the least convincing part of the exhibition. There is a photo of Kate Moss in “Marie Antoinette clothes”, and props from the filmMarie Antoinette. All fine, but in reality this is not a show about style. It is about a woman who lived and died in the storm of history. Her final note from her death cell is here: “Mon Dieu! Ayez pitié de moi!” (My God! Have pity for me!)

In a Cornish china clay quarry, a cluster of geodesic domes resembling monumental soap bubbles enclose conservatories housing luxuriant plant eco-systems. Completed in 2000, it was one of Grimshaw’s most ambitious and audacious projects, seemingly springing from the mind of a science fiction novelist rather than an architect.But however thrillingly futuristic Grimshaw’s buildings appeared, they were grounded by an avid interest in engineering and craft, and how historic precedents could be transformed and adapted for the modern era. Instead of using glass for the Eden Project’s domes, Grimshaw employed gossamer-light foil cushions.When passenger rail services through the Channel tunnel first began operating in 1994, the British end was marked by a new international terminus at London’s Waterloo Station. Grimshaw conjured a radical reimagining of the Victorian iron and glass train shed that his 19th-century predecessors would immediately recognise. The inspiration for the roof’s asymmetrical arched form, a design feat made all the more complex by being curved on plan, was the skeleton of a human hand. Intricately pin-jointed to accommodate the deflection imposed by trains, a glazed roof vault encased platforms in a delicately transparent cocoon. Underneath, a sleek, airport-style concourse whisked passengers up to the platform.View image in fullscreenThinking big … the former Eurostar terminal at Waterloo, London, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw.Photograph: Jo Reid & John PeckThough it endured a forlorn period after Eurostar switched its operations to St Pancras in 2007, it has since been incorporated back into the main station as part of a major refurbishment, so that commuters heading for the home counties can experience the same frisson as those original Paris-bound adventurers.Hi-tech architecture was often calculated to appear at its best in a mechanistic, depopulated state, but Grimshaw’s output of stations, airports, trade fair halls, sports complexes and even the odd supermarket, civilised and elevated the everyday experience of catching a train or going shopping.View image in fullscreenSainsbury’s supermarket, Camden Road, London.Photograph: Geoffrey Taunton/AlamyPart aircraft carrier, part aircraft hangar, Sainsbury’s Camden superstore (1988) was a muscular, metallic armature that brought a touch of Mad Max to the weekly shop. Grimshaw even designed a new kind of ramped travelator that locked on to shopping trolleys to convey customers down to the basement car park. It was characteristic of his attention to detail and confidence in technology to solve the most quotidian of problems.Early standout projects included Oxford Ice Rink (1984), a daring, column-free structure suspended by a cat’s cradle of cables from two towering masts and clad in silver panels more commonly used in cold stores. The Financial Times print works (1988) invigorated a bleak part of London’s terraforming Docklands by putting theballet mécaniqueof newspaper production on public view inside an immaculately engineered glass box. Passersby could watch the FT emerge each day in a Heath Robinson-style tableau of whirring machinery and pink newsprint.View image in fullscreenInvigorating … Nicholas Grimshaw’s Financial Times print works in London.Photograph: Bildarchiv Monheim GmbH/AlamyCommissioned to design the British Pavilion for the 1992 Seville Expo, Grimshaw devised an elegant, modular structure topped by a rippling cockscomb of solar panels. These provided the energy to power a wall of water which cooled the pavilion and its visitors in Seville’s searing summer heat. The headquarters for the Western Morning News (1993) was conceived as a futuristic galleon in full sail on a hillside outside Plymouth, while in Berlin, the Ludwig Erhard Haus (1998), designed to house the reunified city’s Chamber of Commerce, was suspended from a ribcage of parabolic steel arches, hoisted into position as theatrically as the timber frames of a medieval barn.Railway stations were a recurring theme. After the success of Waterloo, Grimshaw went on to revitalise London’s Paddington (1999), stripping away accumulated accretions to reveal the engineering puissance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Latterly, towards the end of his career, his firm was given the herculean task of sorting out London Bridge, once described by John Betjeman as “the most complicated, muddled and unwelcoming of all London termini”. Where there was dinginess and disorder there is now clarity and connection, expressed in a cavernous new concourse and a concerto of escalators and lifts. Even Betjeman might be able to find his way around.View image in fullscreenA new kind of factory … Bath Schools of Art and Design.Photograph: Nicholas Grimshaw ArchitectsAnother much larger London infrastructure project, the Elizabeth Line, won last year’s RIBA Stirling prize, shared with design team collaborators Maynard, Equation and AtkinsRéalis. “Descending into the colossal network of tunnels feels like entering a portal to the future, where the typical commuter chaos is transformed into an effortless experience,” said RIBA president Muyiwa Oki.Grimshaw was always keen to point out that technology evolves and circumstances change, but the trick is to produce architecture that is agile and adaptable. This was perhaps most persuasively demonstrated by the successful 2019 remodelling of the Herman Miller furniture factory to house the Bath Schools of Art and Design. Originally completed in 1976, when Grimshaw was in partnership with Terry Farrell, the archetypal slick industrial shed is now another kind of factory, an incubator for the processes of creation, making, experimentation and learning, showing that buildings could – and should – have second lives.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureEden ProjectfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Give me a Brontë any day, she saysTue 16 Sep 2025 10.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 12.29 EDTShareEvery word is a wrestling match forAlice Birch. “I find it quite painful,” the award-winning playwright and screenwriter admits. “It’s ugly and horrible. It’s not just pouring out of me. It feels, yeah …” She shrugs in the empty courtyard of London’s Somerset House. “… not very healthy or whatever.”We meet early in the morning as Birch needs to race off to a secret project. She is a sought-after TV writer (on Succession and Normal People) but Birch’s blazing plays are known for their form and fury. Her brutal breakout in 2014,Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again, was written in a 72-hour whirl. She wrote her latest, Romans – now on at the Almeida – in around 10 days. “Of course I didn’t ‘write’ it in 10 days,” she clarifies. “I wrote it in eight years. It’s just that the words,” she waves the air around her head, “were up here.” She would love to squirrel away for a year working solely on one project. “But I guess life and kids and all the rest of it just never made that possible.”She read outside her comfort zone: Hemingway, Lawrence, 70s American novels and ‘trying to read Ulysses and failing’Romans is a disruptive, expansive exploration of both masculinity and the novel over the last 150 years. The story centres on Jack, played by Kyle Soller, who we first meet as a 10-year-old boy. Each act of young Jack’s impossibly stretched life is framed by a different historical literary style: 19th-century novel, modernism, post-modernism. “The idea that it’s almost impossible,” Birch says, “is where it feels exciting.” Form, for her, always comes first. Following Jack and his brothers across time, this is Birch’s first play with a central narrator. “It can feel a bit old-fashioned,” she says, a phrase that will probably not feature in reviews of this play, “but a novel that’s interested in a man defining himself requires a man to stand on stage on his own and speak.”Birch has wanted to write about masculinity for years. “I often get notes on my male characters,” she says, “like they’re not as well formed as the women.” This “felt like an interesting challenge”. Romans opens in a time when women are giving birth on the other side of walls while men smoke cigars, and it travels through boarding schools, prisons, cults and podcast recordings. “Lots of the later sections of the play involved thinking about Andrew Tate and the manosphere,” she grimaces. “That was miserable.”Across the years of mulling over the idea, Birch read outside her comfort zone: Ernest Hemingway; DH Lawrence; 70s American novels; “trying to read Ulysses and failing”. Given the time and a quiet place to read, she would pick up a Hardy or Brontë. “People on moors,” she laughs. “That’s my favourite.” She also untangled ideas with her partner, Sam Pritchard, the play’s director. This will be their first time working together on a show. “We were tentative,” Birch admits. “What if it doesn’t work?”View image in fullscreen‘I often get notes on my male characters’ … Birch.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBirch has made a name for herself as a sharp adapter for television. She co-wrote the TV adaptations of Sally Rooney’s Normal People and Conversations With Friends and is currently working on Ministry of Time, from the Kaliane Bradley novel.Working with others’ words is, Birch acknowledges, “a huge privilege”, but she had been itching to sink her teeth into something new; her last play was 2023’sThe House of Bernarda Alba, a radical retelling of Federico García Lorca’s 1936 drama. In Romans, Birch does not just adaptanovel, butthenovel. “That sounds really pretentious,” she admits, rolling her eyes. But she wanted to see if such a thing was possible for the stage.The idea first found its footing when she heard an old radio interview withMartin Amisabout masculinity and books. “Men were at war or at sea or on mountains,” she explains, “and then man was slowly being dragged indoors because of feminism.” She found the edges of her structure here, using the history of the novel to track how the male narrative has shaped our world, “and what impact the presence of women then has on their stories”.As she was writing, Birch toyed with having the play’s women grapple the narrative back from the men and take over. “But that didn’t feel very truthful.” Instead, the way we treat women who are labelled as mad howls through the play. The topic recurs in Birch’s work, from Anatomy of a Suicide in 2017 to herrecent film adaptationof Ariana Harwicz’s Die, My Love, directed by Lynne Ramsay, one of Birch’s heroes. Co-written with Ramsay and Enda Walsh, the psychological thriller stars Jennifer Lawrence as her character descends into psychosis soon after giving birth. Birch finds herself continually drawn to these stories. “I don’t feel it’s changed much, how people think about women and mental health and creativity and rage,” she says. “It still feels like an angry woman is a terrifying thing to the world that we mustn’t let out.”Romans is at theAlmeida, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlice BirchAlmeida theatreSally RooneyTelevisionMartin AmisLynne RamsayinterviewsShareReuse this content"

For others, it is a limited-edition Labubu. While a certain cohort considers a plain cashmere jumper to be the peak of high status, logomania endures for others. Vintage shopping is now used to denote quality but equally buying nothing has become a powerful signifier.However, ahead of the Coach show on Monday afternoon, the brand’s creative director, Stuart Vevers, said the word luxury was “overused”. The Yorkshire-born designer, who has worked with the US house since 2013, explained that he was no longer “interested in extreme polish or perfection that has long been associated with luxury”.Instead, Vevers’ catwalk collection aimed to capture what is seen as desirable in the eyes of today’s youth. This translated into low-slung jeans so baggy they could be heard scraping along the catwalk with seams grubby and scuffed. Shrunken knits appeared to be moth-eaten. Some models wore workwear-inspired boots with lug soles and scratched leather. There were also actual workwear pieces, including repurposed trousers with paint splatters still visible. Meanwhile, motorcycle jackets appeared worn-in because they were – fashioned from upcycled leather, part of a wider sustainability initiative the brand launched in 2023.View image in fullscreenLow-slung jeans that scraped along the catwalk and upcycled leather were stars of the Coach catwalk.Photograph: Courtesy of PR/ShutterstockWelcome to luxury 2.0. This is what gen Z wants to wear and is already wearing all over the city’s Lower East Side. Vevers loves to people-watch and his time spent doing so is proving fruitful. In a world of distraction, Coach has managed to capture the attention of gen Z.On the most recentLyst Index, a quarterly report that ranks brands based on sales, Coach now sits at number five, sandwiched between Prada and The Row. In August, its parent company, Tapestry, said Coach continued to lead sales at the group, rising 14% to$1.43bn since January. Coach’s success means its show has become one of the largest on the schedule. This time it took over a 70,000 sq ft event space overlooking the East River, filling it with guests including the actor Elle Fanning and NBA star Jayson Tatum.While previous collections riffed on American iconography, including ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirts, this time the cultural references were much more muted. Vevers said he had been thinking about grit: “By grit, I mean resilience, and the beauty of how the city comes back to life every morning.”Vevers credited “a differentiated point of view and a differentiated aesthetic” as part of its appeal. “Our pieces have a certain down-to-earth quality. There is a certain ease to them. I think that sits well with the times we are in.”Coach’s pricing strategy also works. Its Tabby bag, seen swinging on the arm of pop star Charli xcx, hovers around the £200 mark – something fans can afford to save up for rather than just add to a fantasy wishlist. Giant “Kisslock” clutches that riff on a 1969 design of clasped purse and sit closer to the £600 mark have also had a surge in interest thanks to Carrie Bradshaw gripping one in the final episode of And Just Like That.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFashion StatementFree weekly newsletterStyle, with substance: what's really trending this week, a roundup of the best fashion journalism and your wardrobe dilemmas solvedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Anne Hathaway has been pictured on the set of the Devil Wears Prada sequel carrying a bag from a 1986 collection. Meanwhile, after noticing youngsters were buying vintage pieces featuring Coach’s signature monogram, Vevers has put a fresh spin on the idea of logo dressing. This time around, it comes spliced with plaid and check patterns on pleated skirts and trousers.Elsewhere, Luar closed out Sunday night with a show soundtracked to a reading of J Drew Lanham’s poem Joy is the Justice We Give Ourselves. Founded by the queer designer of colour Raul Lopez in 2011, it most recently created Venus Williams’s US Open looks and also counts Beyoncé and Madonna as fans.Lopez has used previous catwalks to highlight issues including immigration and homophobia. This time around, he said he wanted to “pay tribute to the syncretic spirit of the Dominican Republic”. Lopez, who is a third-generation Dominican, played with texture using feathers and beading to add depth to bodysuits and tailoring. He described the collection as a confrontation of “the brutal legacy of slavery – how it fractured bodies, families and futures – yet simultaneously birthed radical forms of creativity, expression and resistance”.Explore more on these topicsNew York fashion weekFashion weeksnewsShareReuse this content"

You just don’t want to live there as much as Americans do.I don’t understand. Why would Americans want to leavethe US?I’m going to give you a couple of moments to go and read the news. Come back when you’re ready.Oh myGod, that place is a mess!So, now you know. If you were a US-dwelling American in the year 2025, there’s a very good chance that you would also want to emigrate.But why Portugal specifically?Expatsi, a company that helps Americans move abroad, published the results of a test that matches users to various countries. And Portugal came out on top.Should I take the test?Not really. The first question is “Why do you want to move abroad?” and one of the answers is “To avoid the threat of gun violence”, so let’s assume it’s pretty US-centric.Again, why Portugal?Well, it ranks seventh in theGlobal Peace Index 2024, while the US comes 128th (sandwiched between Kenya and Ecuador). Portugal has universally accessible healthcare, a low cost of living, robust anti-discrimination laws and freedom of movement within the EU. And last year there were 89 murders in the entire country, compared to 16,935 in the US.Wow, I’m sold.But there are so many other options. Second and third on the Expatsi list were Spain and Italy. While fourth and fifth were Canada and Mexico.I’m starting to think Trump wants to build all those walls to keep people from leaving.The list also recommends that people should think about moving further afield, with Costa Rica, New Zealand and Australia taking up the sixth, seventh and eighth spots.Still, this is just one list.That’s true. The UK-based Immigration Advice Service only ranks Portugal as the sixth most desirable place for Americans to move, with Ireland at number one. Interestingly, it puts the UK in third position.Bad idea.Yes, I agree. Although are we saying you should avoid the UK because there’s no escaping Nigel Farage, or because Trump can’t keep away?Honestly, both work.A recent piece in Forbesalso suggested that Albania was a desirable location, based on its “welcoming policies, low cost of living and beautiful untouched nature” , whileanother websiterecommends Vietnam.Americans have so many options!Well, yes, if you were ranked 128th out of 163 in the Global Peace Index, lots of places would look really nice in comparison. Maybe that’s the key: if you come from somewhere quantifiably disappointing, the world is your oyster.Do say:“Portugal is the best place to go to escape the US.”Don’t say:“Just ask all the Americans there.”Explore more on these topicsPortugalPass notesEuropeTrump administrationEuropean UnionAlbaniafeaturesShareReuse this content"

Or so it felt. This was the early 1970s, the waning years of the Cultural Revolution, and his father ran a village supply store in ruralChina. There was little to do beyond till the fields and study Mao Zedong at home, and so the shop became a refuge where people could rest, recharge and share tales. Zhu grew up in that shop, absorbing a lifetime’s worth of tragedies: a family friend lost in a car crash, a relative from an untreated illness, stories of suicide or starvation. “That was really tough,” Zhu recalled recently. “People were so poor.”The young Zhu became obsessed with what people left behind after they died. One day, he came across a book that contained his family genealogy. When he asked the bookkeeper why it included his ancestors’ dates of birth and death but nothing about their lives, the man told him matter of factly that they were peasants, so there was nothing worth recording. The answer terrified Zhu. He resolved that his fate would be different.Today, at 56, Zhu is one of the world’s leading authorities in artificial intelligence. In 1992, he left China for the US to pursue a PhD in computer science at Harvard. Later, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he led one of the most prolific AI research centres in the world, won numerous major awards, and attracted prestigious research grants from the Pentagon and the National Science Foundation. He was celebrated for his pioneering research into how machines can spot patterns in data, which helped lay the groundwork for modern AI systems such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek. He and his wife, and their two US-born daughters, lived in a hilltop home on Los Angeles’s Mulholland Drive. He thought he would never leave.But in August 2020, after 28 years in the US, Zhu astonished his colleagues and friends by suddenly moving back to China, where he took up professorships at two top Beijing universities and a directorship in a state-sponsored AI institute. The Chinese media feted him as a patriot assisting the motherland in its race toward artificial intelligence. US lawmakers would later demand to know how funders such as UCLA and the Pentagon had ignored “concerning signs” of Zhu’s ties to a geopolitical rival. In 2023, Zhu became a member of China’s top political advisory body, where he proposed that China should treat AI with the same strategic urgency as a nuclear weapons programme.Zhu’s journey from rural China to the helm of one of the US’s leading AI labs was both improbable and part of a much bigger story. For almost a century, the world’s brightest scientific minds were drawn to the US as the place where they could best advance their research. The work of these new arrivals had helped secure US dominance in technologies such as nuclear weapons, semiconductors and AI. Today, that era seems to be coming to a close. Donald Trump is dismantling the very aspects of US society that once made it so appealing for international talents. He has shut off research funding and attempted to bully top universities, which hisadministrationviewsas hostile institutions. As US-China tensions have grown, Chinese-born students and professors in the US have faced additional pressures. In a callback to the “red scare” of the 1950s, Chinese students and professors have beendetained and deported, and had their visas revoked.Even as the Trump administration lays siege to the foundations of US science, it has been trumpeting its plans to beat its Chinese rival in the field of AI. In July, Trump announced the creation of a $90bn “AI hub” in Pennsylvania, as well as a national blueprint – created in close coordination with Silicon Valley tech leaders – to dominate every aspect of AI globally, from infrastructure to governance. “America is the country that started the AI race,” Trump said. “I’m here today to declare that America is going to win it.” A month later, China unveiled its ownblueprint, vowing to fuse AI with the marrow of its economy, from factory automation to elder care.At his lavishly funded Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, Zhu is one of a handful of individuals who the Chinese government has entrusted to push the AI frontier. His ideas are now shaping undergraduate curriculums and informing policymakers. But his philosophy is strikingly different from the prevailing paradigm in the US. American companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Anthropic have collectively invested billions of dollars on the premise that, equipped with enough data and computing power, models built from neural networks – mathematical systems loosely based on neurons in the brain – could lead humanity to the holy grail of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Broadly speaking, AGI refers to a system that can perform not just narrow tasks, but any task, at a level comparable or superior to the smartest humans. Some people in tech also see AGI as a turning point, when machines become capable of runaway self-improvement. They believe large language models, powered by neural networks, may be five to 10 years away from “takeoff”.Zhu insists that these ideas are built on sand. A sign of true intelligence, he argues, is the ability to reason towards a goal with minimal inputs – what he calls a “small data, big task” approach, compared with the “big data, small task” approach employed by large language models like ChatGPT. AGI, Zhu’s team has recently said, is characterised by qualities such as resourcefulness in novel situations, social and physical intuition, and an understanding of cause and effect. Large language models, Zhu believes, will never achieve this. Some AIexpertsin the US have similarly questioned the prevailing orthodoxy in Silicon Valley, and their views have grown louder this year as AI progress has slowed and new releases,like GPT-5, have disappointed. A different path is needed, and that is what Zhu is working on in Beijing.It is hard, in the current AI race, to separate out purely intellectual inquiry from questions of geopolitics. Where researchers choose to carry out their work has become a high-stakes matter. Yet for some scientists, the thrill of intellectual inquiry – as well as the prospect of personal glory – may remain more compelling than the pursuit of national advantage. Mark Nitzberg, Zhu’s friend of 20 years and a fellow classmate back in their Harvard days, was surprised by Zhu’s abrupt return to China. “I asked him: ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’” Nitzberg told me. Returning, he told Zhu, could make him a “vector” to help China dominate AI. In Nitzberg’s recollection, Zhu replied: “They are giving me resources that I could never get in the United States. If I want to make this system that I have in my mind, then this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have to do it.”Nearly everyone who knows Zhu in the west asked me the same question: have you been to his office? Tucked behind Weiming Lake on the north side of Peking University campus, it almost seems built to dazzle visitors. A latticed wooden gate marks the entrance, after which you are led into a courtyard residence that Zhu uses for lectures and seminars. There, his assistants gesture you to the end of the hall, where a back door opens on to a breathtaking landscape of rocks, streams and pomegranate trees. Another courtyard residence can be spotted across the stream, on its own island, accessible via a stone footbridge. That is Zhu’s “office”.One spring morning when I visited, Zhu was admiring his flora, while grumbling that his stream had been muddied by a rain shower the day before. I asked him who was maintaining the grounds. “We’ve got an entire team,” he said, gesturing to a group of men who had just entered the courtyard. Across from Zhu’s office, on the other side of the stream, is a glass-encased meeting room where he holds court with visitors. We sat there as Zhu began recounting a life spent straddling two superpowers.Born in 1969, near Ezhou, an ancient river port along the Yangtze, Zhu was the youngest of five children. When he was very young, a wave of intellectuals arrived in his village to be “reeducated”, as part of Mao’s nationwide campaign to remould “bourgeois thought” through hard labour. At night, under candlelight and paraffin lamps, teachers, priests and college graduates held salons near the supply store where Zhu’s father worked. Zhu listened as they debated everything from the Soviet Union’s growing involvement in Afghanistan to the US elections. “By the time I entered elementary school, I felt like I had a good grasp of what was happening in China and the world,” Zhu told me. He knew he did not want to stay in his home town and work in his father’s shop.After Mao died in 1976, reformers took over the Communist party and soon scientific education replaced Marx as the new religion. Zhu was the top student at his local high school, and won a place at one of the nation’s best universities, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in the city of Hefei, where he majored in computer science. By 1986, when Zhu began his degree, relations between the US and China had normalised and some of his professors were among the first batch of Chinese scholars sent on state-sponsored visits to the US. They brought back hauls of books to be translated. “At the time, we saw America as a beacon, a cathedral of science,” Zhu said.Among the imported books was Visionby David Marr, a British neuroscientist who had famously broken down human vision – a biological process – into a mathematical framework. Marr’s work suggested that machines might one day be able to “see” the world as humans do. Zhu was hooked. Ever since then, he has dreamed of mapping intelligence – how we think, reason and exercise moral judgment – with the mathematical precision of a physicist charting the cosmos. Building an AGI was, for him, not an end goal, but a part of his deeper pursuit: to discover a “theory of everything” for the mind.Zhu is known to have cried twice in public over recent years. The first was when recounting to his students the story of his acceptance to Harvard. In 1991, when Zhu graduated from USTC, he was so poor he couldn’t afford the application fees required by American universities. He applied anyway, without paying the fees, though not to the country’s most elite schools – he didn’t dare. In any case, he was summarily rejected. The following year, one of his professors suggested that Zhu apply again, and that Ivy League schools, which had more money, might not care about the missing application fee. A few months later, he was astonished to receive a thick yellow envelope from Harvard, offering him a full fellowship in the university’s doctoral programme in computer science. “It changed my life,” Zhu said.View image in fullscreenSong-Chun Zhu in the gardens outside his office at Peking University, 10 July 2025.Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The GuardianThe man responsible was David Mumford, a decorated mathematician and Fields medalist who, a few years prior, had begun working on computer vision, a field of AI focused on enabling machines to recognise and process visual information. When Mumford came across an applicant from central China who espoused a “theory of everything” for intelligence, and cited Marr as his muse, he was captivated. “I was just flabbergasted at his vision and how he was going about approaching AI in this comprehensive way,” Mumford told me. In a 2020interview, Mumford, who became Zhu’s adviser, mentioned the moment he realised he “was dealing with something special”. Zhu had taken an hour-long exam, but left one question blank. Not because it was hard, but because it was too easy. “He said, ‘This is ridiculous,’” recalled Mumford, “but he answered everything else perfectly.”During our conversations over the course of this spring, Zhu seemed to associate Harvard with the US he had dreamed of in his youth: an open laboratory where a country bumpkin from rural China could, with enough gumption, make technological miracles into reality. This was the US of Edison and Einstein, the land that welcomed Jewish physicists fleeing Hitler’s Germany and gave them refuge, dignity and labs at Los Alamos. In Zhu’s eyes, it was a country that rewarded intellect and ambition over race, ideology and nationality. At Harvard, he never felt out of place, though occasionally he was puzzled by his new home. On one occasion he asked his classmate Nitzberg why no one picked the apples from the trees around Harvard campus. He thought it was a waste of food.It wasn’t until 1997 that Zhu experienced a real culture shock in the US. After completing his doctorate at Harvard and a brief stint at Brown University, he arrived at Stanford to work as a lecturer. He was accompanied by his wife, Jenny, a former classmate at USTC, whom he had married in 1994. At the time, the Bay was bursting with dot-com excitement. Yahoo had recently gone public on Wall Street and venture capitalists were hovering around campus. Two PhD students in Zhu’s department, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had just created a search engine called google.com. As students flocked to courses on web development, Zhu’s more theoretical classes on pattern recognition struggled to attract much interest. It was a disheartening moment for him. “At Harvard, it was all about understanding. Their logo was three books,” he told me. But Stanford’slogo– an “S” behind a tree – looked “like a dollar sign”.Zhu spent a year at Stanford before moving on to Ohio State University, whose culture he found unambitious and parochial, and then in 2002 to UCLA, where he obtained tenure at the age of 33. That same year, Jenny gave birth to their second daughter, Zhu Yi, and a year later he received the Marr Prize, the top award in computer vision. Colleagues likened him to Steve Jobs for his intensity and intolerance of mediocrity. When I asked one of his collaborators at UCLA about what it was like to work with Zhu, he said: “It’s as if I’m on the frontlines of a battlefield. We don’t sit down with a cup of coffee and talk about life or our families. That never happens. It’s always just about work and research.”During Zhu’s 18 years at UCLA, his field went through almost unimaginable changes. For roughly the first half of this period, he was a leading figure in the AI mainstream. Yet in the second half, he became increasingly disillusioned. Speak to different people and they will propose different theories as to why Zhu ultimately decided to leave the US, but there is little doubt that he was influenced, at least in part, by his intellectual estrangement from the field he had once helped shape.Zhu’s relationship to the so-called “godfathers of AI” – figures such asGeoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun – is, to put it mildly, complicated. There was a time, however, when they were all roughly on the same page. Drawn to the common goal of making intelligent machines, they saw visual perception as a key problem to crack. Until the late 1980s and 90s, the most popular way to make computers “see” was through hand-coded instructions. To identify a handwritten digit, for example, a researcher wrote detailed instructions to a computer, accounting for each scenario where the lines and strokes matched that digit. This rule-based approach was brittle – slight variations in handwriting could break the logic.Then came a series of breakthroughs. In the late 1980s, LeCun, then a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs, developed a powerful neural network that learned to recognise handwritten zip codes by training on thousands of examples. A parallel development soon unfolded at Harvard and Brown. In 1995, Zhu and a team of researchers there started developing probability-based methods that could learn to recognise patterns and textures – cheetah spots, grass etc – and even generate new examples of that pattern. These were not neural networks: members of the “Harvard-Brown school”, as Zhu called his team, cast vision as a problem of statistics and relied on methods such as “Bayesian inference” and “Markov random fields”. The two schools spoke different mathematical languages and had philosophical disagreements. But they shared an underlying logic – that data, rather than hand-coded instructions, could supply the infrastructure for machines to grasp the world and reproduce its patterns – that exists in today’s AI systems such as ChatGPT.Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Zhu and the Harvard-Brown school were some of the most influential voices in the computer vision field. Their statistical models helped convince many researchers that lack of data was a key impediment to AI progress. To address this problem, in 2004, two years into his time at UCLA, Zhu and a Microsoft executive set up the Lotus Hill Institute in Zhu’s home town of Ezhou, China. Researchers annotated images of everyday objects such as tables and cups in their physical contexts, and fed them into a big dataset that could be used to train a powerful statistical model. Lotus Hill was one of the earliest attempts to construct the large-scale datasets needed to improve and test AI systems.By 2009, however, Zhu was losing faith in the data-driven approach. His Lotus Hill team had annotated more than half a million images, but Zhu was troubled by a simple problem: what part of an image one annotated depended, somewhat arbitrarily, on what task one wanted the machines to achieve. If the task was to identify a cup for a robot to grasp, the handle’s position might be critical. If the task was to estimate the cup’s market value, details like the brand and material mattered more. Zhu believed that a truly generalisable intelligence must be able to “think” beyond the data. “If you train on a book, for example, your machine might learn how people talk, but why did we say those words? How did we come to utter them?” Zhu explained to me. A deeper layer of cognition was missing. In 2010, Zhu shut down the institute. He set out instead to build agents with a “cognitive architecture” capable of reasoning, planning and evolving in their physical and social contexts with only small amounts of data.His timing could not have been worse. Around the same time, an assistant professor at Princeton named Fei-Fei Li released ImageNet, a larger dataset containing more than 3 million labelled images of common objects such as dogs, chairs and bicycles. (Li had attended a workshop at the Lotus Hill Institute and would latercite Zhuas one of her influences.) ImageNet was publicly accessible, and its size and relative simplicity enabled AI researchers to test and hone their image-recognition algorithms. In autumn 2012, a neural network developed by Hinton and his team smashed the ImageNet competition, cementing the dominance of neural networks and kickstarting the global wave of AI adoption that continues to this day.“Just as I turned my back to big data, it exploded,” wrote Zhu some years later, in a message to his mentor, Mumford. The most explicit clash between Zhu and the neural network school occurred in 2012, just months before the latter’s ImageNet triumph. At the time, Zhu was a general chair of CVPR, the foremost computer vision conference in the US, and that year a paper involving neural networks co-authored by LeCun was rejected. LeCun wrote a furious letter to the committee calling the peer reviews “so ridiculous” that he didn’t know how to “begin writing a rebuttal without insulting the reviewers”. Even today, Zhu maintains that the reviewers were right to have rejected LeCun’s paper. “The theoretical work was not clean,” he told me. “Tell me exactly what you are doing. Why is it so good?” Zhu’s question gets to the heart of his problem with neural networks: though they perform extraordinarily well on numerous tasks, it is not easy to discern why. In Zhu’s view, that has fostered a culture of complacency, a performance-at-all-cost mentality. A better system, he believes, should be more structured and responsible. Either it or its creator should be able to explain its responses.Whatever Zhu’s reservations, the ImageNet victory triggered an AI gold rush, and many of the pioneers of neural networks were celebrated for their work. Hinton would go on to join Google. LeCun moved to Meta, and Ilya Sutskever, a co-author of the neural network that won ImageNet, helped found OpenAI. In 2018, Hinton and LeCun, along with Bengio,shared the Turing award– computer science’s most prestigious prize – for their work on neural networks. In 2024, Hinton was one of the joint winners of the Nobel prize in physics for his “foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks”.Writing to Mumford, Zhu maintained he had “no regret” about the path he had chosen. But he did feel bitter that Hinton’s team had, to his mind, reaped the rewards of his earlier research. The statistical models and algorithms developed by the Harvard-Brown school in the 1980s and 1990s, Zhu told me, “laid the foundation for later deep learning and large language models”. Hinton and his team “didn’t acknowledge that”, he claimed. A longtime US-based collaborator of Zhu’s, who requested anonymity for fear of US government retaliation, contested Zhu’s interpretation. Zhu deserves more credit, he said, for being one of the earliest advocates of the data-driven paradigm in computer vision, but Hinton’s team devised the algorithms that perfected that approach and enabled it to scale. (Hinton and Bengio declined to comment. LeCun did not respond to requests for comment.)In the mid-to-late 2010s, as neural networks were making startling progress on problems from facial recognition to disease diagnosis, Zhu was reading philosophy – the Confucians “understand the world much better than AI researchers”, he told me – and working quietly on his cognitive architecture. He was walking a lonely path. In 2019, Zhu served again as a general chair of the CVPR conference. As he read the submitted papers, his heart sank. Nearly all of them focused on squeezing incremental gains from neural networks on narrow tasks. By this time, Zhu’s opposition to neural networks had become visceral. A former doctoral student at UCLA recalled being berated by Zhu several times for sneaking neural networks into his papers. His inner circle learned to avoid forbidden phrases – “neural nets”, “deep learning”, “transformer” (the “T” in GPT). On one occasion, during an all-hands meeting at a LA-based startup Zhu had founded, a new recruit unwittingly added a slide on deep learning to his presentation. According to someone who was present, Zhu blasted him in front of the whole company. (Zhu told me this was “exaggerated”.)“When he has a vision,” Zhu’s longtime collaborator told me, with some understatement, “he has a very strong belief that he’s right.”As Zhu’s ideas were being consigned to the margins of the AI community, the broader climate for Chinese scientists in the US was also growing less hospitable. Tensions between the two nations were rising. In China, Xi Jinping muscled his military into a dominant position in the South China Sea and issued internal party edicts warning against adopting “western values”. During Trump’s first presidency, the US designated China as its chief strategic competitor, launched a trade war andblacklisted Chinese tech companies. Under Joe Biden, the US maintained a similarly tough approach to China.Though world powers routinely spy on each other, in recent years US officials have been alarmed by the scale of China’s espionage campaigns. In 2018, the justice department launched the “China Initiative”, a programme to counter the theft of trade secrets and alleged espionage on US campuses. Critics of the programme claimed that it relied onracial profiling. More than 100 professors of Chinese descentwere investigatedfor allegedly stealing sensitive technologies. Most who were formally charged had their charges dismissed or dropped, and few were found to have been involved in direct intellectual property theft. The Trump-era effort altered the relationship between Chinese scientists and the US. According to a well-knownacademic study, return migration nearly doubled for experienced Chinese scholars living in the US after 2018.At the end of 2018, Zhu began receiving calls from a reporter at the Silicon Valley news site The Information, asking about a$150,000 granthe had recently accepted from Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant. That same month, the USlabelled Huaweia national security threat. Zhu told me that the Huawei money came with no strings attached and that he had used it to fund research by his PhD students. Eager to put the matter to rest, he told the reporter that he would not accept any future donations from the company. “Right now, China-US relations are toxic,” he said at the time. “We are caught in the middle of this.”As US-China relations soured, Zhu found it increasingly difficult to secure funding for AI research, much of which had previously flowed from the US military. He says he has never been questioned by federal agents, nor has he been stopped and questioned by US border officers about his research and connections to China, though his former PhD students have. After the China Initiative began, according to Nitzberg, some of Zhu’s students became so accustomed to being held up at immigration that they would budget the extra hours at the airport when arranging travel to conferences.View image in fullscreenThe ‘China Initiative’ in Donald Trump’s first term as president altered the relationship between Chinese scientists and the US.Photograph: Dmitri Lovetsky/APIn this atmosphere, where China had come to be seen as a direct competitor – or even threat – to the US, scientific links to China that had long been seen as normal now came under a cloud of suspicion. Much of this was based on misapprehensions on how academic research actually works, but it is also true that for decades, the Chinese government had encouraged its US-based scientists to return to China, rolling out recruitment initiatives. The most famous of these, theThousand Talents Plan, became widely associated with spying and intellectual property theft. In 2024, Mike Gallagher, the chair of the House select committee on China requested documents from UCLA and federal agencies, questioning why Zhu had received millions of dollars of federal funding, despite having allegedly also received funding through the Thousand Talents Plan and having had a “role as a doctoral adviser and researcher at the Beijing Institute of Technology, a prominent Chinese university that has ‘the stated mission of supporting China’s military research and defense industries’”.On my second visit to Zhu’s office, in May, we discussed these allegations. A secretary poured us tea, refilling our cups the moment they were empty. Zhu denied having any affiliation with the Beijing Institute of Technology, but acknowledged he had co-supervised a PhD student from there who worked at Lotus Hill. He also told me that in 2009, while he was at UCLA, his Lotus Hill team had applied for a local talent programme grant from the Ezhou government, which he used to subsidise researcher salaries. (This was not, he said, part of the Thousand Talents Plan. The national programme spawned many local variants that borrowed the label to attract top scholars to their regions.) He added that there was nothing “sensitive” about the image annotation work conducted there. The funding, he said, lapsed once he shut down the institute in 2010. As for why he had chosen to locate the institute in China, Zhu cited the same reason as thousands of other American enterprises that had set up in China during these years: labour was cheap.It was in summer 2020, in the early months of Covid, Zhu says, that he made the decision to leave the US. He cited his disaffection with the direction of the AI community and the hothouse of American politics – both its leftwing brand of campus progressivism and the Trump-era national security crusades. There was also a personal factor. His younger daughter, Zhu Yi, is a figure skater who was recruited in 2018 to compete for China in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. By 2019, she had become a Chinese citizen and was competing and training with the Chinese team in Beijing.At the time he decided to leave, Zhu told me, he did not have any job offers from Chinese institutions. By the autumn, he had been offered full professorships at Peking University and Tsinghua University. Then the city of Beijing agreed to sponsor an AI institute run by Zhu, which would be called the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BigAI).However, two sources familiar with the matter contested Zhu’s timeline. They say conversations between Zhu and members of the Beijing municipal government began earlier – in early 2018 – and that these concerned not just his potential move to China but that of his younger daughter. In January 2018, Zhu Yi won the novice title at the US figure skating championship. Not long after, the Chinese Olympic Committee recruited her in the same cohort as Eileen Gu, the freestyle skier. After a few stumbles in her Olympic debut, some online commentersquestionedwhether Zhu Yi had been a bargaining chip for her father. When I put this to Zhu, he called the online speculation “totally wrong” and “not how things work in China”. He acknowledged that he had discussed his daughter’s recruitment with Chinese officials in early 2018, but denied that his return was ever discussed in those conversations. (In February, the Beijing city sports bureau released its 2025 budget, revealing that it had set aside $6.6msolely to supportEileen Gu and Zhu Yi’s training for the 2026 Winter Olympics.)In August 2020, Zhu flew to China on a one-way ticket. Many of his colleagues and graduate students at UCLA did not know he was planning to leave until he was already gone. He had even kept his decision from his older daughter, who was living in the Bay Area. Zhu attributed his secrecy to the politically volatile climate. Trump was referring to Covid as the “kung flu” and hate crimes against Chinese people had soared. I took Zhu to mean that he did not want to be publicly scapegoated for his decision to move. He knew his personal choice carried larger geopolitical weight.On the morning that he left the US, Zhu stood outside his house with his suitcase, looking across the sun-bathed hills of Los Angeles. At the edge of the driveway, he turned back and paused to admire his rose garden. It was everything he could have dreamed of as a child, listening to stories of a world beyond his village. Now he was saying goodbye.The second time Zhu is known to have cried – he prefers to say “moved emotionally” – was when watching a documentary with his students on the life ofQian Xuesen. The Chinese-born, MIT-educated rocket scientist served on the Manhattan Project and helped develop the US’s first guided ballistic missiles. During the McCarthy era, US authorities revoked Qian’s security clearance and kept him under house arrest on suspicion of espionage. No evidence emerged to support such allegations, and in 1955 he was sent back to China in exchange for US prisoners of war. Back in China, Qian led a series of military and technological breakthroughs that helped turn the country into the superpower it is today. Under the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” programme that he led, China developed the capability to launch ballistic missiles that could strike the US.In the US, Qian’s story has beencited as a cautionary taleof American self-sabotage, a reminder of how anti-communist paranoia drove away a brilliant mind. In the official Chinese version, Qian was a selfless patriot who willingly gave up a comfortable life in the US to serve his backward country. In the 1980s, Qian was a household name among aspiring scientists like Zhu, and since Zhu’s own return to China, the parallels have been clear. In 2023, Zhu suggested to the Communist party’s top political advisory body that it should treat AI in the manner of the Two Bombs, One Satellite programme – that is, a top-down, centrally coordinated plan to race ahead in AI research. When I asked him about that proposal, his response was understated. “In the US, we academics always agreed that we wanted to start a Manhattan Project for AI,” he said. “China should also have a centralised plan for AI. This is natural, there’s no secret about it.”Zhu has started telling Qian’s story to his undergraduates in Beijing, though which version he emphasises – the scientist betrayed by his adopted homeland or the Chinese patriot – is unclear. When I asked him whether it mattered who won the AI race – the US or China – he paused. “Do I want the Silicon Valley people to win? Probably not.” He wants, he said, the most ethical version of AI to win.As we talked, Zhu noted how prescient his departure now looks, given the scorched-earth politics of the second Trump administration. In onerecent poll, three in four scientists in the US said they were considering leaving. Many AI leaders, including LeCun, havespoken outabout how Trump’s budget cuts to scientific research will harm their work. Chinese universities have capitalised on the exodus,courting studentsfrom Harvard and researchers who have lost their jobs following recent federal budget cuts. (The EU isdoing the same.) In May, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, threatened to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas. And in a revival of China Initiative rhetoric, Republicans have introduced legislation that they say would “counter China’s malign ambitions to steal American research”.It is a common refrain, on the American right, that the US has lost its ambition, the kind once embodied by the Manhattan Project or Apollo missions, and that it is falling behind. Chinese EVs zip through Europe’s countryside and American pharmacies depend heavily on Chinese-made ingredients. Chinahassurpassedthe US in the number of authored papers in science and technology journals, and that gap is likely to grow. There are four times as manyStem studentsgraduating from Chinese universities each year than in the US. The danger is that in chasing away international talent, the US risks undoing one of the advantages it once had over its competitors. (“My PhD students at Peking University are at least on a par with those at MIT and Stanford,” Zhu told me proudly.) Openness to the world’s smartest minds is what helped the US establish its lead in the AI race, as well as countless other fields.When Zhu left the US, his collaborators feared that his research in China would lose its independence. Zhu, by contrast, has suggested that he feels more liberated to focus on his research in Beijing. Formally, his US-based collaborators were right: there is no separation between the state and research institutions in China. Yet in practice, China’s scientists tend to enjoy considerable autonomy, and if they are working in an area of strategic importance, immense resources can be channelled their way. In the five years since his move to Beijing, Zhu has been offered several hundred million dollars of research funding from Chinese sources, according to two people close to him. The deal with the state is like a long and loose leash – most of the time it is slack, but it can be pulled, tightened at the party’s whim.In the US, academics who, in principle, are never leashed, are now feeling a sudden yank from the Trump administration. Billions of dollars in research funding have been paused until universities acquiesce to what the Harvard University president described as “direct governmental regulation” of the university’s “intellectual conditions”. In March, Columbia University agreed to new oversight of its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies departments. Tony Chan, the former president of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former faculty dean at UCLA, has experience in both university systems. He told me what he is seeing now in the US is worse than anything he ever saw in China. “We used to be able to clearly say that US universities were independent of the politicians. That was the advantage of the American academic system,” Chan told me. “I cannot say that any more.”In both China and the US, Zhu has a reputation as a tough academic adviser, with strict intellectual orthodoxies. According to his current students in Beijing, he has a go-to refrain, now immortalised as a gif that circulates in their group chats: “If you do that again, you will be dismissed!” Zhu is not, in other words, easily swayed. So when OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, and much of the Chinese tech sector was stunned – one Chinese AI founderadmittedhe felt “lost” and “couldn’t sleep”, demoralised by the feeling of being bested again by the west – Zhu was untroubled. At an AI panel in early 2023, he avoided any praise for ChatGPT as a technical feat. Large language models, he said, “still fall short” of AGI because they do not “have the ability to understand or align with human values”.Later that year, Mumford, the professor who Zhu credits with changing his life by admitting him to Harvard, travelled to Beijing toreceive a maths prize. He was in his 80s and had been retired for nearly a decade. Were it not for the chance to “find out what Song-Chun was doing”, Mumford told me, he likely wouldn’t have made the trip. The two share a close bond, and used to meet regularly at Zhu’s lab in UCLA. In Zhu’s office at Peking University, there is a framed letter from Mumford to Zhu in which he wrote: “I feel that you are truly my intellectual heir.”View image in fullscreenA humanoid robot shakes hands with a journalist at the Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing, March 2025.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesThey do not agree on everything, however. While Zhu had largely dismissed neural networks, Mumford came to see something profound in their mathematical structure, and he wanted to nudge his old student to reassess his views. “More than anything else,” Mumford told me, “what I was trying to convey was that I felt BigAI had to have a big team working on deep learning techniques in order to be successful.”In Beijing, Mumford strolled with Zhu through the creeks, willows and paved roads of the Peking University campus, and dined with Zhu’s family. Then Mumford pressed his case. Zhu’s friends and students told me that it appears to have worked – somewhat. He has allowed his students to experiment with transformers – the most advanced neural network architecture – on some tasks. Researchers who once sneaked neural networks into their projects like contraband say they can use them more openly. Zhu is “by far the most brilliant student in computer vision I ever had”, Mumford later told me. And yet “it took him a long time to see that deep learning was doing tremendous things. I feel that was a major mistake of his.”Nevertheless, neural networks will always play a circumscribed role in Zhu’s vision of AGI. “It’s not that we reject these methods,” Zhu told me. “What we say is they have their place.”One Saturday morning in March, Zhu invited me to an annual tech forum in Beijing where BigAI was showcasing its latest technology. A robot dog pranced around the conference building as onlookers shouted commands (“Sit. Sit! I said SIT DOWN!”). Nearby, children clustered around a spindly mechanical arm playing the strategy game Go. Outside the main hall, a humanoid female head with almond-coloured eyes stared blankly into the crowd. When visitors approached, it scanned their faces. Soon, its silicone skin began to twitch, contorting into facial expressions that mimicked theirs.At the previous year’s tech forum, BigAI had unveiled a virtual humanoid child named TongTong, who, they hoped, would have capabilities that most AIs lack. Researchers widely agree that commonsense intuitions about how the physical and social world work are among the hardest things for neural networks to grasp. As LeCun recently put it: “We have LLMs that can pass the bar exam, so they must be smart. But then they can’t learn to drive in 20 hours like any 17-year-old, they can’t learn to clear up the dinner table, or fill in the dishwasher like any 10-year-old can in one shot. Why is that? What are we missing?” TongTong wasn’t ready to practise law, but it seemed to be able to load a dishwasher. It was designed to mimic the cognitive and emotional capacities of a three- to four-year-old child.This year, the BigAI team was debutingTongTong 2.0, which they claim has the capabilities of a five- or six-year-old. On a large video screen, TongTong 2.0 took the form of an animated girl playing in a virtual living room. At the front of the conference room, a BigAI engineer was going through a live demonstration of TongTong’s abilities. When the engineer asked TongTong to work with her friend LeLe, another AI agent, to find a toy, TongTong appeared to avoid areas her friend had already searched. Later, when TongTong was asked to retrieve a TV remote from a bookshelf that was out of reach, she used a cushion to give herself an extra boost. (When prompting ChatGPT to do similar tasks, researchers havefoundit to be an “inexperienced commonsense problem solver”. Zhu believes that this weakness is not one that deep learning systems such as ChatGPT will be able to overcome.)For now, TongTong exists only as a software operating within a simulated environment, rather than a 3D robot in the physical world. After the presentation, BigAI announced several partnerships with robotics companies. A crucial test of Zhu’s technology will be whether it can exist as an embodied system and still perform the reasoning and planning he ascribes so much weight to.Weizenbaum’s nightmares: how the inventor of the first chatbot turned against AIRead moreBefore the presentation, Zhu had arrived at the podium in a blue blazer to deliver a keynote. He began by contrasting his own AI philosophy with what he called the “Silicon Valley narrative”, that AGI could be attained through more data and computing power. The Chinese media, the public and government agencies had been sold a false narrative, one that had spawned a profusion of vacuous Chinese “AI institutes” and inflated startup valuations, as he put it in a written version of thespeechpublished later. One consequence of this misdirection was that it had convinced the Chinese that they were victims of the west’s “stranglehold”, orkabozi, a term that has come to refer to the US’s export controls to China on high-end computer chips. To Zhu, the key factor holding back AI progress is not insufficient computing power, but a misguided approach to the whole subject. What had started as an academic feud conducted in conferences and peer review journals now seemed to be entangled in an epoch-defining contest for technological supremacy.Zhu is remarkably consistent in his views, but the way he frames his message has shifted over the years. In his speech, his rhetoric occasionally echoed that of party officials, who issue warnings not to follow the west on issues such as free trade and human rights. China, Zhu said, needed to “resist blindly following” the Silicon Valley narrative and develop its own “self-sufficient” approach to AI. (“The officials really like how he frames things,” one of his former students told me.) And yet in my four meetings with Zhu, he struck me as more intensely animated by the stakes of his intellectual quarrels than by international competition between the two countries where he had each spent exactly half his life. In service of his ambitions, he had learned to speak the Communist party’s vernacular.By the time I left Zhu’s courtyard residence, it was the late afternoon. The sun had slanted below the rooftops, setting the magnolia blossoms aglow in a wash of pink. Zhu accompanied me back to the lattice fence that marked the entrance to his office. He wanted to reiterate that politics was not what was motivating him. “Over the last 30 years, I’ve been focused on one thing. It’s the unified theory of AI. To build understanding. That’s my only drive,” he told me. He brought up his research with Mumford again. “The Harvard and Brown school” of computer science, Zhu said, proudly. “That’s what we’re carrying on here.”This article was supported by a grant from theTarbell CenterListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

Like cities across the UK, London has seen protests organised by the far right before, but this felt different. Over100,000 people filled the capital. Tens of thousands of them marched peacefully. But some violently attacked the police officers tasked with keeping Londoners safe. Elon Musk tried to rally protesters against our democracy, telling them to “fight back or you die”.The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere. For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.Now, this toxic form of politics is spilling out on to our streets. Many minority Londoners have expressed fear and millions more in the capital and across the country are horrified. For our leaders, silence is no longer enough. The time has come to stand up and say: this is not who we are. We must unite to take on the reactionary populists and nativists who are exploiting economic concerns, the atomisation of modern life and a growing distrust of political and media institutions – something we have seen in countries across Europe and, of course, in the US.President Donald Trump and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years. When he came to the UK on his first state visit,I highlighted howthe president had deliberately used xenophobia, racism and “otherness” as an electoral tactic,introducing a travel banon a number of Muslim-majority countries andpraising white nationalistsin Charlottesville, Virginia.Just when Keir Starmer thought he’d got Jeffrey Epstein off his plate – look who’s coming to dinner | Marina HydeRead moreSix years later, the tactics we see from today’s White House seem no different. Scapegoating minorities,illegally deporting US citizens, deploying the military to the streets of diverse cities. These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.I understand the UK government’s position of being pragmatic on the international stage and wanting to maintain a good relationship with the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Faced with a revanchist Russia, Europe’s security feels less certain now than at any time since the second world war. And the threat of even higher US tariffs is ever present.But it’s also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart. And putting pressure on him to do much more to end Israel’s horrific onslaught on Gaza, as only he has the power to bring Israel’s brazen and repeated violations of international law to an end.We must also tell President Trump and his supporters to stop talking down and denigrating our great capital city. London is a global success story, no matter how much he wants to pretend otherwise. It’s open, dynamic and safer than every US state in terms of homicide rates. Perhaps that’s why record numbers of Americans aremaking London their home.The president and his supporters often talk about the importance of free speech, painting a picture of Britain as a dystopian society where repression meansour rights are under threat. Nothing could be further from the truth. This week, I’m sure many Londoners will speak up to tell President Trump and his followers that we cannot be divided by those who seek to sow fear. That we are determined for our city to stand strong as a bastion against hate, and shine bright as a beacon of hope. That we see strength in our diversity, not weakness. And that we hold our progressive principles high with pride, rather than hiding them in shame.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Believe me, there is more trouble to comeTue 16 Sep 2025 11.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 12.11 EDTShareAnother day in Keir Starmer’s government, another day in the Whitehall and Westminster bubble, with uproar over theresignation of Paul Ovenden, one of the PM’s top aides. What did he do?Ovenden, who served as the director of strategy in Downing Street, stepped down after admitting to discussing Britain’s first Black woman MP, Diane Abbott, now 71, in derogatory sexual terms with party colleagues in 2017. In one message,he describeda “shag, marry, kill” game where he and two others had discussed Abbott and a colleague “using a strap-on” during sex and the prospect of “going down on” the MP.And today, as yesterday, when the revelations surfaced, commentators from within the Westminster bubble are lamenting Ovenden’s loss to the government, with some appearing to dismiss the appalling messages and the backlash as a “factional hit job”. Poor old Paul Ovenden – and sod Abbott, then? It’s noteworthy, though perhaps predictable, that the political reaction is a circling of the Westminster wagons, and a general lack of regard for the Black person about whom the nasty comments were made.And it speaks to something wider. The comments about Abbott, relayed and endorsed by Ovenden, are not just foul: they also reflect the way in which Black women are routinely dehumanised in this society, and the fact that when that happens, there is little protection. What’s even more striking about the row today is that remarks of this kind are not new, not private and not inconsequential.There were deeply offensive remarks about Abbott and other women in a leakedLabourreport from five years ago, which exposed a toxic environment of bullying, racism and misogyny – yet instead of launching a cleanup, Labour pretty much brushed it all aside. Behaviour that would have been unacceptable in any other professional workplace was effectively normalised.So when a spokesperson for Downing Street called the messages sent by Ovendon “appalling and unacceptable” in a statement to the press, it just didn’t wash. Labour’s leadership have long known this kind of thing is a problem. In marked contrast, Abbott has been suspended from the party twice over comments about race, having beendeemed to be racistdespite the MP’s track record of supporting minoritised groups, including Jewish communities, while Labour leaders claim to be taking a hard line against alleged discrimination.View image in fullscreenEmily Thornberry, Keir Starmer, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell at Labour’s 2019 conference in Brighton.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianWhen Martin Forde KC delivered anindependent reviewin 2022, one the party itself commissioned, he confirmed the scale of Labour’s culture problem and offered a roadmap for reform. Rather than taking his findings seriously, the party dismissed them – and,as I exclusively reported, even tried to gag Forde when he spoke out.It suits a beleaguered No 10 and its supporters to characterise this as factional infighting, but that simple explanation doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. What has emerged this week, coupled with the Forde report, shows a pattern of toxicity that transcends factional battles. It points to something deeper: a culture in which misogyny and misogynoir, or hostility towards Black women, could flourish unchecked.Ovenden’s resignation comes at a febrile moment for Labour, just days after Peter Mandelson wasremoved as ambassador to the USand Angela Rayner stepped down as deputy prime minister. In Mandelson’s case, questions over his links to Jeffrey Epstein were already known, but action only followed once they became public. Therein lies a pattern. But this whole furore cannot be just another episode in a turbulent fortnight. It must be a test of whether Labour will finally confront racism in its own ranks or treat it as yet another crisis to be managed away.Earlier this year, the partylaunched its Race Equality Engagement group(REEG), led by Doreen Lawrence, to help “ethnic minority communities, stakeholders and delivery partners to seize opportunities and remove barriers to racial equality across the UK and to hear people’s lived experiences.” Yet it will need to prove that equality is being prioritised in its own ranks. The scandal surrounding Ovenden’s resignation isn’t just about him or the fact that he’s gone – but that the party’s higher-ups knew about these kinds of abuses and looked the other way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve seen unredacted internal material. What’s already out is damning enough – but it is not the full story. Senior figures cannot plausibly claim they were unaware of the nature of this kind of misbehaviour.Root-and-branch reform isn’t now optional; it’s the only way Labour can show that it values accountability over expediency, and that the abuse endured by Abbott and others will not be brushed aside again. The party is haemorrhaging supporters, not least from minority communities. If it cares about that, time is of the essence.Nadine White is a journalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is a pillar of national stability.Finlandhas long understood this, not just because of policy, but because of who we are and where we live. Geography, a mild continental climate and our history have shaped a mindset where preparedness is essential. In a country with vast territory, a sparse population and long distances between communities, resilience must be built into everything we do.This understanding is deeply rooted in our society, in individual households as much as government institutions. Today, Finland’s approach to preparedness is rightly seen as a model forEurope. But it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. What works for Finland, such as our high levels of food self-sufficiency, strong institutions and a culture of cooperation, may not work elsewhere. Still, our experience offers valuable lessons. Preparedness must be proactive, inclusive and deeply integrated into national strategy.My job at the National Emergency Supply Agency (Nesa) means I spend much of my time thinking about what could go wrong – and more importantly, how we can make Finland ready for when it does. Whether we face a pandemic, cyber-attack or geopolitical shock, our job is to ensure the country can continue to function, feed itself and protect its people. The Covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have shown how fragile global systems can be.One of the cornerstones of our national resilience is thestrategic grain reservesystem. These reserves include wheat, oats, barley and rye, grains that are central to both our agriculture and our diet.Stored in secure facilitiesacross the country, they are rotated using the Fifo (first in, first out) method to maintain quality and ensure older grains are used before newer ones. These reserves are designed to sustain the population for nine months in the event of a global supply-chain collapse or domestic production disruption. During the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, they have helped reassure the public.Finland’s food self-sufficiency rate is around 80%. That means we produce most of the food we consume, which is a rare achievement in today’s interconnected world. This is thanks to our farmers, who operate more than 40,000 farms nationwide. In 2024, crop production was the main activity on 74% of farms, while livestock farming was practised on 20%. The average farm size is56 hectares.Despite a short growing season and a limited variety of crops, our agricultural sector is efficient, innovative and supported by strong infrastructure. These farms are the backbone of our food system and their role in national security cannot be overstated.View image in fullscreenA tractor harrowing farmland in Lieto, Finland.Photograph: Jarmo Piironen/AlamyWe have even developed our ownrapeseed cultivar, Aurea CL, specifically suited to the Nordic climate. It helps ensure that domestically produced rapeseed oil and protein-rich feed remain available even during times of crisis. This kind of innovation reflects our long-term commitment to resilience.But preparedness is not just about stockpiles and production. It is about systems that can adapt and continue to function under stress. Finland’s food supply chain is resilient by design. The governmentworks closelywith producers, processors, retailers and logistics companies to ensure continuity. Emergency plans are in place to reroute deliveries and prioritise essential goods. We also maintain emergency fuel reserves to keep agricultural machinery and food transport running during crises.A key part of our strategy is public-private partnerships. At Nesa, we collaborate with companies across the food sector, from grain mills to supermarket chains. Together, we develop contingency plans, run joint exercises and share information. This cooperation is not just policy. It is the way things are done. Businesses understand their role in national preparedness and take it seriously.Preparedness also starts at home. In Finland, household-level readiness is essential. One of our most effective tools is the72-hour model,which encourages every household to be self-sufficient: to have enough food and bottled water (five litres per person) for three days. We advise having a stock of dry foods that keep well, such as nuts or dried fruit. Our home emergency supply kit checklist includes such items as a first aid kit, iodine tablets, a battery-powered radio, torch, power bank, portable stove, toilet paper and duct tape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nation states are defunct and “citizens” an outdated concept. Now people function more like non-voting shareholders of heavily armed corporations. Anyone who dares to criticise Lord Musk is sentenced to death in a burning Tesla.This isn’t my poor attempt at science fiction (apart from some creative licence around the AI Musk and Tesla executions). Rather, it’s a simplified approximation of the world Curtis Yarvin,Silicon Valley’s favourite thinker, wants to usher in. Yarvin, whose “dark enlightenment” ideas have influenced theTrump administrationand political kingmakerssuch as Peter Thiel, believes super-rich elites should have dictatorial powers; universities and the press shouldn’t hold any sway; and the hoi polloi should suck it all up.Musk is not a straightforward disciple of Yarvin, but both believe governments should betreated as corporationsand share disdain for liberal democracy and “woke” institutions. Both also have a raze-and-rebuild approach to the world. Indeed, long before Musk launched his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), Yarvin devisedRage, a plan to “retire all government employees”. Yarvin, by the way, wasn’t impressed with Doge (he compared it to an orchestra of chimpanzees trying to perform Wagner) because it didn’t grab enough power.I bring all this up because, as Musk vies for a larger role on the world stage, it’s imperative we’re clear about what he’s trying to achieve. The billionaire, who spentmore than $290m(£210m) influencing the US election, is increasingly taking his political meddling worldwide: heinserted himself into Canadian politicsearlier this year andhelped boostGermany’s far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). Musk spent January posting about grooming gangs in the UK and turned his attention back to the country over the weekend, appearing via video at afar-right rallyin London. Musk called for a “change of government” and said: “Violence is coming to you. You either fight back or you die.” A man who was born in South Africa but emigrated to the USby way of Canadawants Britons to be terrified of foreigners.So what’s the end goal here? Is Musk being guided by a Yarvinesque ideology or is this just what happens when theindustrial amounts of ketaminethe billionaire is reported to have consumed interact with the world’s largest ego?While a God complex may be at play, a politics of chaos appears to be Musk’s short-term goal. It feels increasingly as if the tech mogul is trying to stoke civil unrest and destabilise democracies worldwide so he can accumulate more power. In hisnew year address,Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice-chancellor at the time, came to a similar conclusion, calling Musk’s support for the AfD a “logical and systematic” play to weaken Europe. “A weak Europe is in the interest of those for whom regulation is an inappropriate limitation of their power,” Habeck said.Keir Starmer’s weaknesses – hisapproval ratingis dismal – certainly seem to have captured Musk’s interest. Musk may not have an ideology as developed as Yarvin’s, but it does feel as if he’s attempting to become de facto CEO of the world, with deputies around the globe. It’s not inconceivable that Musk could effect regime change in Britain. And I’m not sure the government is taking this threat seriously enough. At a time whenpensioners are being arrestedfor waving “Palestine Action” placards, the response to Musk’s calls for people to “fight back or … die” at a protest where 26 police officers were injured could have been somewhat more forceful. Starmer should impose sanctions on Musk, not just wag his finger at him.What’s really at issue here, however, is the system that produced Musk and enabled his meddling. A healthy democracy should have safeguards in place that ensure a handful of super-rich individuals can’t usurp the political process. Those safeguards were removed from the US in 2010 with the supreme court’sCitizens United ruling, which reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and in effect allowed corporations and special interest groups to spend unlimited money on elections. Britain has nowhere near the amount of money sloshing through its politics as the US does, but ananalysis lastyear found dark money is rife: almost £1 in every £10 donated to British parties and politicians came from unknown or dubious sources.Musk is odious, but he is right that Britain is under threat: if we don’t fight to conserve democracy, it will die. However, the foreigners we should worry about are not desperate people on small boats, they’re billionaires with rocket ships.Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsElon MuskOpinionThe far rightFar rightFar right (US)Keir StarmercommentShareReuse this content"

It’s pretty obvious why: smart lighting addressed itself to the unbearable onerousness of getting off your arse and turning on a light, a problem nobody ever had, or if they did, they probably had 99 more pressing concerns. The appeal of the video doorbell was that something interesting may happen; maybe it would catch someone doing a crime, or a heartwarming moment when your kid ran back for one last hug on their first day of school, and you could put that on TikTok and be famous for five seconds, or – ideal world – it would catch one of your friends bitching about you. It is amazing, in this world of hypersurveillance and connectedness, how rarely any of those things, or indeed, anything interesting or unpredictable at all, ever happens. It’s almost as if constantly watching one another doesn’t tell us anything we don’t already know.Why do cats love middle-aged women so much? | Zoe WilliamsRead moreIn fact, someone in the fitness industry once told me – he intoned this very conspiratorially, as if he was telling me a business secret that would make me millions – that tech-regret is at its fiercest in the wearables market. The great untold secret of the smartwatch is that, when they break, nobody ever replaces them. There’s a moment of raw panic. If nobody is counting your steps, did they even happen? How will you get through the day, if you don’t know how many quality-adjusted sleep minutes you got? Whither your resting heart rate? But then a day passes, and you realise that your watch was actually bullying you: pass-agg and patronising one minute (“Well done! Your move ring is way ahead of where it would normally be!”), hectoring the next (“only 375 more calories and you’ll have met your frankly pathetic target of 400 burned. Come on, it’s only 10 to midnight, you’ve got this!”). If there was a person in your life treating you like this, you’d bin them off.You know what people are still quite keen on, according to the pollsters (who happen also to be energy suppliers EDF)?

The president threatens both – no wonder Labour is grovelling to himTue 16 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 06.53 EDTShareGoverning in the era ofDonald Trumphas been Labour’s miserable misfortune. As our prime minister and king grovel to the global bully with royal folderol this week, we will probably feel the full humiliation of the would-be American king.The recent blow to British life sciences is a brutal example of our serfdom. Trump’sthreat to put a 250% tariffon medicines made abroad by pharmaceutical companies, unless they move their factories, research and legions of jobs to the US,is driving out the UK pharma industry. What’s to stop him? AstraZeneca has ditched a£450m vaccine plant in Liverpool. In a shock announcement last week, the US drugmaker Merck axed ahalf-built, £1bn London research facilitynext to the Crick Institute it was destined to work with.Eli Lilly is pausing investment in the UKwhile Novartis is understood to be “keeping its investments under review”.Trump’s other objection is Europe paying lower prices – and especially the NHS – for drugs that can cost three times more in America:his executive order demandsthat the US gets the lowest prices. He protests about America “subsidising socialism aboard [sic] with skyrocketing prices at home”. Negotiations between the health secretary, Wes Streeting, and drug companies about fair priceshave collapsed. This time, the pharma industry is backed up by presidential threat. Often reviled as capitalist beasts in the green pastures of the NHS, this year drug companies have a point: their voluntary agreement to pay a percentage of their income on sales to the NHSleapt from 15% to 23%. Streeting offered an extra £1bnto help ease that cut in profits,but they balked, and hetemporarily walked, saying: “I won’t allow big pharma to rip off our patients or taxpayers.” Cheers all round.Trump is no ‘strongman’ when it comes to Russia or Israel. If other democracies don’t step up, anarchy awaits | Simon TisdallRead moreAs a case study in the fiendish dilemmas of governing, NHS drug pricing is a special circle of hell. Life sciences are crucial to Labour’s growth mission and industrial strategy, and this is an area in which the NHS, private companies and universities should be working together. Thelife sciences sector plan, released in July,pledged“to make the UK the most attractive place in the world to develop and deploy new treatments and by 2030, the UK will be one of the top three fastest places in Europe for patient access to medicines”.How much should theNHSpay for drugs to keep these companies on board? And who pays – an overspent NHS, the business and trade department, which oversees industrial strategy, or the Treasury, which needs growth? Britain can rightly boast that it is best placed for drugs research: the NHS has unique, easy to use, centrally collected data. In Britain, drug companies sell to the whole country through one NHS portal, rather than a profusion of private outlets as in the US.But big pharma is forever on the warpath against the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), the UK’s system for assessing thetrue worth of new treatments. Nice was a great legacy of the last Labour government, setting a maximum price the NHS should pay at around £30,000 per patient for a good year of life, with some flexibility for exceptions and trials. But thatunchanged limitmeans its value has eroded by half over 20 years due to inflation, thecompanies complain. Big pharma hates this gatekeeper whose judgments are widely used around the world: when Nice says no, a new drug struggles everywhere.Fighting back, companies have even poured money intodisease advocacy campaigns, funding patients to lobby for drugs that Nice has refused. The latest example is two Alzheimer’s disease drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, whichNice has not approved.Manufacturers warn this decision will limit access to private patients. The Alzheimer’s Society called it “highly disappointing”, while theTelegraph joined the callto unblock “the use of two wonder drugs on the NHS”. Yet experts point to Nice evidence showing that thebenefits experienced by patientswere “too small to be noticeable”, at the cost of a nurse’s salary for an annual course of treatment.Industry leaders warn that the NHS’s low prices and strict Nice controls aremaking Britain “un-investable”. They claim that the NHSunder-prescribes medicines, spending 9% of its annual budget, compared with Spain’s 18%. But is that a bad thing? Ahead lies an explosion of new drugs and vaccines: some will save the NHS, but some, such as genome sequencing for every baby, which aims to identify rare and treatable genetic conditions early,will ignitehuge demandsto treat slight risks.There are bigger questions. Prevention is a Streeting priority, but this is politically near impossible when the public measures success by waiting lists and extra treatments. Newresearch in the Lancetquestions drug spending: analysing all new NHS medicines over 20 years, researchers find the money spent on average would have bought more good years of life if it was spent on improving existing services. How is a health secretary supposed to respond? Surely not by banning new drugs, nor by letting drug research die.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

All evidence shows that good health depends on a good society and decent lives more than beds and prescriptions. But discussion of capping the NHS is politically unthinkable.That’s the hell of governing, whoever is in power. The NHS needs cheap drugs and the economy needs a thriving pharmaceutical industry making profits. The health department now holds its breath on the US state visit, fearing a renewed Trump assault on the NHS, multiplying drug costs and disaster for life sciences.

But the US president keeps finding reasons not to actTue 16 Sep 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 14.06 EDTShareBack in January, with Donald Trump’s campaignpromisesto end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” still fresh in the memory, there was genuine unease in Moscow over the US president’s intentions. When Mr Trumpmusedthat “high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Russia might be necessary, one high-profile and pro-war Moscow commentator wrote: “It’s better to prepare for the worst. Soon, we’ll look back on Biden’s term with nostalgia, like a thaw.”How wrong can you be? Since then, the US president has repeatedly talked the talk without coming close to walking the walk. In May, when Vladimir Putin rejected a 30-day ceasefire, and peace talks in Turkey went nowhere, a “bone-crushing” US sanctions package failed to materialise. An 8 August deadline for Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire somehow morphed into a red carpet welcome in Alaska, where Mr Trump applauded a leader wanted for war crimes as he disembarked from his plane. The “severe consequences”threatenedby Mr Trump if the Alaska talks failed to lead to peace never happened.Emboldened, Mr Putin has thus continued to prosecute his war aims in Ukraine, and probe for western weaknesses. Last week’sincursionof Russian drones into Polish territory laid bare inadequate Nato planning, as F-35 and F-16 fighter jets were hastilyscrambledto deal with cheap kamikaze devices that cost around $10,000 each to produce. It also communicated a warning of possible escalation in the event of any future “reassurance force” deploying European troops on Ukrainian soil. Such a provocation called for a robust and unified response, exerting the kind of pressure on the Kremlin which Mr Trump has so far refused to countenance. Instead the US president appears, once again, to prefer bullying his European allies to targeting Mr Putin. In astatementwhich reeked of bad faith, Mr Trump declared over the weekend that the US was “ready” to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if certainunlikelyconditions were met.Eyeing a considerable economic prize, Washington is insisting that the EU must increase its imports of US liquified natural gas at a rate that analysts judge undoable. Other demands include the imposition by the EU of 50%-100% tariffs on Russia’s most important ally, China, and an end to all imports of Russian oil by Nato members. This includesTurkey, which has refused to sanction Moscow, imports 57% of its oil from Russia, and lies outside the EU.Those looking on the bright side in Brussels hope that Mr Trump’s pressure may persuade Maga-friendly governments in Hungary and Slovakia to end their deep dependence on Russian energy imports. That is extremely unlikely to happen, as Mr Trump and his advisers must know. Nor can the EU afford to court the kind of economic retaliation from Beijing that caused Mr Trump himself toback downfrom a full-blown trade war recently.During this week’s state visit, it will be Sir Keir Starmer’s turn to try to pin Mr Trump down on decisive action. But from the unproductive Alaska talks to his latest diversionary tactics with the EU, Mr Trump keeps finding reasons not to get tough on Russia. Last week’s drone incursion in Poland represented an ominous upping of the ante. Ukraine’s prospects, and wider European security interests, are being steadily undermined by a president who, in this context, barks but never bites.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The UK government must stop hiding behind legal fictions and recognise the realityTue 16 Sep 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 14.28 EDTShareAUnited Nationscommission of inquiryhas now said what Israeli, Palestinian and international human rights organisations, as well as many genocide scholars, have alreadyargued: that Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide. The commission finds that mass killings, attacks on vital infrastructure, starvation, displacement and denial of medical care meet the legal definition of history’s gravest crime. Itfindsgenocidal intent “the only reasonable inference” from both the statements of Israel’s leaders and the conduct of its forces in Gaza.Against this, Israel’s repeated assertions that it is acting inlawful self-defencering hollow in the face of overwhelming evidence and a deliberate pattern of destruction. The UN’s conclusion imposes moral clarity. It also demands political action, especially from those, including the UK and the US, who have for too long treated Israel as an exception to international norms.Historically, the GuardiansupportedJewish aspirations for a homeland, playing a significant role in the early Zionist movement – particularly as antisemitism rose in Europe. That history only adds weight to our present concern over where the country is going. Other states must reckon with the consequences of enabling afar-right government under Benjamin Netanyahuthat has defied international law with impunity and pursued its aims with horrifying human cost.View image in fullscreenNavi Pillay, chair of the UN’s commission of inquiry, which has said that Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is no defence to point toHamasatrocities, appalling as they were, to justify the systematic devastation of Gaza, home to over 2 million people, half of them children. The notion that the flattening of Gaza will bring peace is for the birds. Reportedly, Israel’s military chiefs have privately conceded that Hamas may not be defeated even after Gaza City falls – and that a “complete victory” may require further military expansion in the strip. If accurate, this implies that Israel’s leaders foresee the failure of stated war aims – and are preparing for even greater devastation.Mr Netanyahu, perhaps recognising the consequences, has warned Israelis to prepare for “isolation” and a new era in which traditionalEuropeansupport may no longer be guaranteed. This shift shouldn’t be underestimated. European powers, including Britain, have long underwritten Israel’s technological and military edge – through arms exports, trade agreements and research funding. The EU’sHorizonprogramme is only one of many economic levers at Europe’s disposal. Suspension of such links would have profound repercussions, as would recognising aPalestinianstate.The British government’s response has been evasive. Ministers said the UK had “not concluded” that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. That now looks like little more than a fig leaf. A court case revealed the Foreign Office reviewed over400 alleged violations of international humanitarian lawby Israeli forces in Gaza but identified possible wrongdoing in only one. The apparent logic is: ignore enough individual incidents, and you won’t see the pattern.But the UN says the reality cannot be denied. Under thegenocide convention, states must not only punish genocide but prevent it. That threshold has been crossed. To continue withsymbolic sanctionsis not just morally indefensible – it is complicity. Some will warn against inflammatory language. But Gaza is alreadyburning. Britain must stop all arms sales, back international accountability and drop the legal contortions. The charge is grave. The evidence is overwhelming. To pretend otherwise is to join in with our age’s most shameful evasions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

It is about the value placed on human lives. He shows how language presented as reasonable or pragmatic often conceals darker intentions. What once felt impossible can be normalised step by step, until the unthinkable is treated as common sense.The strength of his piece lies in how it makes the issue personal. By asking us to picture the knock at the door, the packed bags by the hallway, or the quiet hostility from a stranger on a bus, he shows that this is not about statistics but about neighbours, colleagues and friends being treated as outsiders.This is not unique to Britain. Far-right parties across Europe are pushing “remigration” into the political mainstream, and Britain is not immune. The danger is that a hostile environment rarely stops at the margins. It spreads into daily life, encouraging cruelty and suspicion, making racial abuse easier to excuse and prejudice easier to voice. Even if mass deportations never take place on the scale some imagine, the harm is already being felt.The question Liew poses is simple: if this direction continues, what kind of country will we become and who will have the courage to say “enough” before it is too late.Name and address suppliedThank you, Jonathan Liew, for speaking with such clarity for me as the son of Caribbean immigrants who came to this country as British citizens at the invitation of the British government in 1962. I was born here, have a UK passport, and have contributed to British society. This is my home. But I am scared that a Nigel Farage-led government would want to enact large-scale repatriation of people like me.For people of colour, this isn’t an exaggeration – it is based on fact. The UK has had a growing tolerance of racism and xenophobia, but this is the recooked racism of Enoch Powell and the National Front of the last century – and it’s getting nasty. The time to be sitting in complicit silence is over.Cllr Mark BlakeGreen party, Haringey, LondonI found Jonathan Liew’s article sad and troubling. My father was Polish and, growing up in the 1950s and 60s in the UK, I was sometimes worried that I had a foreign name. But nothing was said or implied, and being white meant I was not an immediate target for racists. And then we became, I thought, a more tolerant society, with racism called out and reduced to a tiny minority of bigots. But in 2016 came Brexit, leading to the shameful return of the open racism we see today.Old fears are being renewed, and our spineless leaders seem incapable of standing up against this putrid tide. My only hope is that the majority of people, who are not racist, can bring strong influence to bear on our representatives at all levels, and let our own voices be heard. This must stop.Maria KovalLondonI am white, living in Lincolnshire and married to a first-generation Indian immigrant. In this part of the world, not only has Reform UK captured the hearts and minds of many neighbours, but you can see theHomeland party, with its policy of remigration, gaining strength. Jonathan Liew’s piece so clearly brought home the rising terror that I now feel for my family, and the need to push back more forcefully against support for these policies.Patrick HortonStamford, LincolnshireHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

This kind of “public philosophy”, which includes the excluded, is of profound value, he argues. Remarkably, philosophy in prisons is “A kaleidoscopic assortment of jokes, stories, anecdotes and philosophical insights …” This picture is familiar for the UK charityPhilosophy in Prison.The puzzle ofTrigger’s broom, for example, can generate a joyous discussion of identity, time, the rights of work, relativism, freedom and responsibility, and happiness – where the whole room is focused and participating.For such intractable questions, no one in the room has a definitive answer, neither the “professional” philosophers, nor those wondering about Trigger for the first time. So philosophical discussion has an equalising effect – everyone is puzzled, no one is disqualified from having a view, nor from arguing it well. It seems obvious that this kind of work is important for its own sake as well as for its effect on participants. But one feature of the prison population in the UK that Miller does not address directly is the high levels offunctional illiteracy.Offering prisoners university courses works for those who read and feel comfortable with writing. But philosophy can be done just by conversation, to include both those with high levels of education and those who have little. Anyone may participate; disagreement itself generates a toleration that manifests itself on the wing; and educational doors open afterwards.Philosophyin Prison does philosophy just by talking, in the anomalous public space of prison, and it matters for anyone in the room.Mary Margaret McCabeProfessor ofancientphilosophyemerita, King’s College London;Chair of trustees, Philosophy in PrisonHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

The argument that mastering AI is a life skill that students need in preparation for the labour market is unconvincing. Our experience is that generative AI undermines teaching and learning, bypasses reflection and criticality, and deflects students from reading original material.Student misuse of generative AI is widespread. Claims that AI helps preparation or research is simply cover for students taking shortcuts that do not develop their learning skills. Assessments are widely channelled through ChatGPT, disregarding universities’ usually feeble guidance and rules. Generative AI results in generic, dull and often factually incorrect output.For example, we asked students to interpret a short article by Henry Ford from 1922. Many answers suggested that the autocratic and racist Ford was developing a “sophisticated HR performance management function for his business” and that he was a “transformational leader”.In many degree programmes, LLMs have little to no practical value. Their use sabotages and degrades students’ learning and undermines critical analysis and creativity. If we are to make better sense of the impact of AI on work, education and everyday life, we need to be more sceptical and less celebratory.Prof Leo McCannProf Simon SweeneyUniversity of YorkHave an opinion on anything you’ve read in the Guardian today?

It was one of the grumbles from the Tottenham fanbase when their club appointed Thomas Frank given how his experience of European football extended to little more than a handful of Europa League qualifiers with Brondby more than a decade ago.It was a nervy big-time debut for the manager, his team retreating into their shells after half-time, looking to hold on to the lead they were presented with at the outset by one of the ultimate goalkeeping howlers.Kylian Mbappé wins it for Real Madrid after Alexander-Arnold injury and Carvajal head-buttRead moreIt was a moment to haunt Villarreal’s Luiz Júnior, who was the greatest danger to his team in front of their goal. Tottenham could get little going as an attacking force. Luiz Júnior had further wobbly moments, although he got away with them.Villarreal pressed on to the front foot and it was a night when the yellow cards fluttered and the referee, Rade Obrenovic, never gave the impression he was fully in control. Spurs certainly had none of that. Xavi Simons was fortunate to escape a second yellow card just after the hour for a hack at Nicolas Pépé, Villarreal’s former Arsenal winger, who made light of the jeers he heard to produce a man-of-the-match performance.Another former Arsenal player provided the real sideshow. Thomas Partey, who will appear at Southwark crown court on Wednesday morning to answer rape charges, was brought off the Villarreal bench in the 77th minute and, suffice to say, it was difficult to hear the announcement of his name.Villarreal advertised the equaliser and there was the flashpoint on 84 minutes when Micky van de Ven barged over Georges Mikautadze on the very edge of the area as the striker ran through. Van de Ven escaped with a yellow card; like Simons, he could easily have been dismissed. Pépé whipped the free-kick past the post and Spurs got away with it, relief the overriding emotion when it was all over. Frank could simply cherish the clean sheet; it is now four in five matches for his team. And, above all, the points.View image in fullscreenPedro Porro of Tottenham in the thick of the action.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe goal came early and it was a gift from the football gods. Lucas Bergvall had worked his way into a crossing position on the right and he could see the run of Richarlison in the middle but the low delivery was too close to Luiz Júnior, who went to ground to collect. Why, then, was the ball now rolling into the net? It needed a double take to see that he had somehow pushed it there himself. Did the impact of his gloves against the turf cause the catastrophe? Frankly, there were no satisfactory answers.Marcelino set his Villarreal team up in an old-school 4-4-2 and they stabilised after the own goal. Pépé came to life; quick, direct and dangerous. Twice in the first half, he almost drew his team level. He shaped a curler for the bottom corner, which Van de Ven deflected off target. And it was Pépé who played in Tajon Buchanan for a glorious chance after some less than convincing Spurs defending. Buchanan shot wastefully wide.Pape Matar Sarr extended Luiz Júnior with a low drive in the 30th minute – it was Spurs’ only effort on target; indeed, the only one that either side mustered. Frank’s team entered the interval chuntering about refereeing decisions, namely the non‑award of two penalties.Pape Gueye seemed to kick through Richarlison; the decision was that the Spurs striker had fished out his leg to anticipate the contract. And Gueye felt a Bergvall flick rear up to hit his outstretched hand. He could not really have got it out of the way. Obrenovic got those correct.View image in fullscreenThomas Partey comes on for Villarreal as a second-half substitute.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was Spurs’ first home game sincethe ousting of the club chair, Daniel Levy; an extreme novelty for him not to be seen in his familiar seat in the stadium he built.

Was it because it was only Villarreal, the fifth-best team last season in La Liga? On the other hand, Spurs season-ticket holders do not have cup games included in their packages. They cost extra.Tottenham were sloppy after the second-half restart; their passing poor. Frank’s players sat deeper and it seemed as though they were inviting trouble. The manager needed Cristian Romero and Van de Ven to stand tall at the back.Pépé continued to threaten, pushing a shot just past the far corner on 55 minutes, and when he was caught by Simons it looked set to add up to a red card. Instead, Obrenovic spared Simons and booked Marcelino for his furious reaction.Simons got away with a barge on Ilias Akhomach, who was on as a substitute, inside the area before Van de Ven made what was effectively a match‑saving foul on Mikautadze. Marcelino felt that both Simons and Van de Ven ought to have been sent off.“Two really clear actions,” the Villarreal manager said.“With the one of Simons [on Pépé], it didn’t look like he wanted to play the ball. The referee didn’t have his best day. He was a bit of a homer. It was an unjust result. A draw would have been the fairest result but the team that deserved to win was us, not Tottenham.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurVillarrealEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

As if to prove the point, Leandro Trossard, another substitute who had come on just five minutes before him, had provided the pass for it and then added the second to secure the win. The man who set him up? Martinelli.Last seasonArsenalhad ultimately paid for a lack of depth, Arteta had said; this season they have started victorious thanks to the men waiting in reserve. For much of a noisy night when Noni Madueke had been the most consistent threat, Arsenal had struggled to carve out clear chances. But then a loose ball dropped in midfield and Trossard got there first, sending it looping into space. Martinelli was on to it fast and if the first touch was a little heavy, the second was superb, enabling him to escape Andoni Gorosabel and steer under the body of Simón.High in a corner of San Mamés the Arsenal fans erupted, and then in final moments they celebrated again when Trossard received from Martinelli and lifted a shot into the net. They had been part of a historic night for their hosts here and they had been in a contest too, but they had come through it, the first step towards what they hope is a historic season in Europe. One for which they have invested heavily, the cost of the starting XIs telling a story: €12m (£10m) versus €567m.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli scores Arsenal’s first goal. He then provided the assist for Leandro Trossard for the second.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersNot that Athletic wanted that reality to be an excuse not to compete; it never has been, far from it. Embracing it, fighting it, is their entire identity. While Arsenal dominated possession early,it seemed designed to control rather than to create, and Athletic took this match to them, turning it into a proper contest, even if it was one that ultimately they would not win.Mikel Jauregizar got the first real shot off after five minutes, Gabriel Magalhães blocking the ball and Declan Rice catching the Athletic midfielder. That earned him a yellow which at times appeared to have him on a fine line. Jauregizar then almost found Adama Boiro coming in at the far post. And next Alejandro Berenguer, dashing forward, was blocked by Gabriel.Arsenal, though, were starting to tilt the balance and on 20 minutes Gorosabel had to make a superb interception inside the six-yard box ahead of Riccardo Calafiori and Eberechi Eze, who did not seem to see him coming.That move had begun on the left, where Iñaki Williams had been caught by Jurriën Timber, who then combined with Madueke, and that was to become a well-worn path.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As he sprinted into the area, though, Dani Vivian came to meet him and his shot lacked the power of direction to truly trouble Simón. A better opportunity followed when Gyökeres dived in to head just past the post. When Gabriel headed soon after he clashed heads with the Swede, and was left bleeding and bandaged up.Arsenal were increasing pressure, although Athletic did find a second wind and a way out. Berenguer shot wide after he was slipped in by Williams and Robert Navarro was blocked by the seemingly insuperable obstacle of Gabriel. From the corner, Oihan Sancet headed over.Madueke kept running. Sprinting clear he cut into the area and, although he could have pulled back to Gyökeres, he had spotted a gap opened at the near post only to be denied by a strong right hand from Simón. His half-blocked shot then skidded through to the keeper and a dinked cross dropped into Simon’s arms: that was three approaches inside the opening eight minutes of the second half, but it was still not enough. At the other end, Williams worked the space for a shot that David Raya stopped by the near post.The changes came, the test of that strength in depth upon which Arteta has placed such stress – and here it was, point proven immediately, the game won.

That’s it.”Neil rightly felt that on another night his patched‑up side could have caused a shock. “I thought we deserved to take it to penalties,” he said. “That was a Millwall performance: it was gritty, it was determined, it was running, it was tackling, it was aggression.”Quick GuideCarabao Cup roundup: Grimsby and Brentford march onShowGrimsbyprogressed to the fourth round of the Carabao Cup for the first time in 24 years thanks to a 1-0 win over a youthfulSheffield Wednesdayside at Hillsborough.The two clubs pulled off the biggest shocks in round two, with the League Two Mariners upsetting Manchester United on penalties after Wednesday's youngsters embarrassed Yorkshire rivals Leeds in similar circumstances.Jaze Kabia headed the 49th-minute winner on Tuesday as Grimsby deservedly overcame an inexperienced Owls team featuring eight academy players in the starting XI. Around 6,000 travelling fans celebrated the success in South Yorkshire, with the home support heavily outnumbered due to a planned boycott as part of ongoing protests against the under-fire owner Dejphon Chansiri.Brentford's keeper Hákon Valdimarsson atoned for a costly error by becoming the shootout hero as his side defeatedAston Villa4-2 on penalties.The Iceland international, who provides back-up for Caoimhín Kelleher in the top flight, kept out spot-kicks from John McGinn and Matty Cash before Bees substitute Mikkel Damsgaard converted the winning penalty.Aaron Hickey's stunning 57th-minute equaliser earned Brentford a 1-1 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium after Harvey Elliott capitalised on a mistake from Valdimarsson to score Villa's first goal of the season on his full debut.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Jean-Philippe Mateta lasted only eight minutes during Palace’s 3-1 win here in March after beingkicked in the headby Millwall’s on loan goalkeeper Liam Roberts – a challenge that the chair, Steve Parish, described as the most reckless he had seen.There had been a heavy police presence around the ground before kick‑off and the travelling supporters who packed the away section wasted no time making their presence felt. “Twenty-five stitches, it should have been more,” they sang.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta, pictured battling Caleb Taylor for the ball, was taunted by Millwall fans over the 25 stitches he needed after the sides last met.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAAn injury to the goalkeeper Max Crocombe in the warm-up forced Neil to turn to Steven Benda and the Fulham loanee proved he was up to the task on his debut with a string of saves before half-time. The best denied Yéremy Pino inside the opening 60 seconds, with the Spaniard also spurning two more chances that fell his way. Millwall should have taken the lead when Palace gave the ball away cheaply in their own half but somehow Camiel Neghli could not hit the target. The lively Mihailo Ivanovic did manage to test Benítez with a header that was clawed away to safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palace immediately looked more of a threat with the Nigeria forward on the pitch, although Millwall’s defence continued to stand firm.Their confidence seemed to grow as Palace found themselves under pressure at the other end, with the towering substitute Josh Coburn making a real mess of a volley from close range when it seemed easier to score.Mateta almost caught out Benda when he rushed out of his goal but saw his shot cleared off the line. From the resulting corner, Richards was on hand to stab home from close range after Millwall failed to clear.That seemed to have won it but Leonard had other ideas when he headed in from a corner, with Mateta then comically missing an open goal with almost the last kick of stoppage time. That left Benítez to take centre stage as he saved from the Millwall captain, Tristan Crama, before denying Aidomo Emakhu to send Palace into the next round.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupCrystal PalaceMillwallmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

Then came a divine act of Faith.In the women’s 400m, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran one of the fastest times in history, easing down, to raise the question of whether one of the oldest – and most controversial – track and field records might fall this week.Shortly afterwards another standout female of her generation, Faith Kipyegon, underlined her status by speeding to a historic fourth 1500m title with such grace and distance that it took the breath away.USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world championRead moreBoth women have long stood tall in the athletics pantheon. What they do in the coming days could reinforce their case to be considered as the greatest female athlete of all time.McLaughlin-Levrone, of course, already holds numerous gold medals and world records in the 400m hurdles. But now, suddenly, she has the 400m gold and possibly even the world record of 47.60sec set by Marita Koch in 1985 in her sights too.The American showed that by running 48.29sec in her semi-final on Tuesday – smashing her personal best by nearly half a second – and then promising to run faster in the final on Thursday. “This race definitely gives me confidence for the final,” she said. “I didn’t expect to run this fast today. And I still have more to show.”That sounds ominous for Koch, who has long been alleged to be part of East Germany’s state-sponsored doping programme, in books and newspaper articles. When asked about it by the BBC in 2014, she replied: “I don’t have to prove anything to myself. I have a clear conscience. I can only repeat myself … I never tested positive, I never did anything which I should not have done at that time.”Koch did acknowledge the fact that the record would ultimately be overtaken, though, saying that “at some point, that time will come”. It could even be on Thursday .However, McLaughlin-Levrone will not have things completely her own way given that the Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and the former world champion Salwa Eid Naser are running well.They will be joined in the final by Britain’s Amber Anning, who ran 49.38sec to qualify automatically. “I’m in such great shape,” she insisted.Paulino is even more confident, promising: “God and I will make history here.”The 31-year-old Kipyegon has already done that. On Tuesday she matched Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four world 1500m titles.With 300m to go Kipyegon, who broke her own world record this year, lookedunder threat from the Australian Jessica Hull. But then she applied the afterburners and the race was put to bed long before she crossed the line in 3min 52.15sec.View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon reminds the world how many 1500m word titles she has now.Photograph: Mickael Chavet/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHull, who had promised she would give it her all and try to win gold, faded badly but clung on for bronze. Another Kenyan, Dorcus Ewoi, took silver. Now Kipyegon has a 5,000m clash of the titans to look forward to against the 10,000m world champion, Beatrice Chebet.“Being able to defend my title and to win a fourth gold feels really special,” said Kipyegon, who held four fingers up as she crossed the line. “This sport drives me. I need to push myself in order to be the best.”It was another bad night for Britain with Matt Hudson-Smith, the Olympic and world silver medallist, going out of the men’s 400m at the semi‑final stage, along with Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon. Reardon pointed to a long break outside the stadium as a factor in finishing last.“After the first 50m I just felt the tightening of my hamstring and pain,” he said. “You warm up to get yourself ready, and when you’re delayed for that long outside in the stadium, in the elements cooling down every second. It’s not really helpful.”To make matters worse, WorldAthleticsalso reprimanded the British team after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with “100% Jesus” on it during the semi-final of the 100m. The marketing of religious and political slogans is banned during competition by the governing body’s rules.“We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences,” World Athletics said in a statement.It also emerged that a group of leading athletes will consider legal action if they are not paid by the end of the September for racing inMichael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track. Multiple athletes are still waiting on prize money after competing in the first three rounds, before the cancellation of the planned final event in Los Angeles. Johnson did not respond when approached for comment.here was gold for New Zealand’s Hamish Kerr in the men’s high jump and for the AmericanCordell Tinch in the 110m hurdles, while there was better news for Britain in the men’s 800m as Ben Pattison and Max Burgin looked comfortable in qualifying for Thursday’s semi-finals.Burgin, who won his heat in 1:44.73, appeared untroubled until just after he gave an interview to the BBC and then threw up – something he often does after races. “Standard fare for me,” he said later, smiling.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

Just can’t believe we won’t have any more. Love you, Dad.”Greater Manchester Police said on Sunday the boxing legend had been found dead at his home in Hyde, Greater Manchester. The police said there were no suspicious circumstances.Like his father, Campbell pursued a career in boxing, making his professional debut in 2021. He retired from the sport earlier this year.On Monday, Hatton’s family issued a statement via police, saying they were “deeply moved” by the outpouring of love and support towards him.“Richard was so much more than a world champion. To us he was simply ‘Richard’, our son. A loving father, grandfather and brother, and a true friend to many,” the statement read.“He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him.“To the wider world, Richard will always be remembered as one of boxing’s greatest champions - a man who gave everything inside the ring and wore his heart on his sleeve outside of it.”Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The results follow the death of Diogo Jota and more than £400m of signings designed to make the squad more suited to Slot’s vision.Amazon to offer Champions League viewers new immersive in-game dataRead more“I think we are far above my expectations from during this summer,” Slot said, before referring first to Jota’s death. “We all knew what happened this summer, and when the schedule came out we had to face Newcastle away and Arsenal andBournemouth at home, and Burnley away turned out to be a difficult one. So for us to be on 12 points now is so much more than I expected, especially when we had so many changes in the squad. I think we can do better but not every time we are going toface Newcastle awayandArsenal at home.”Slot has included Alexander Isak in the squad for the first time after leaving him out for thewin at Burnley on Sunday. The striker was not deemed able to play twice in a week after missing pre-season and the head coach wanted him available for the start of the European campaign.“It is 100% sure he will not play 90 minutes, but he is part of the squad,” Slot said. “So it is already a Champions League game to look forward to but if people look forward to his playing time that could mean that could happen tomorrow as well.”Virgil van Dijk has played against Isak numerous timesand talked up the Swede’s ability on Tuesday. “He’s a clinical finisher. I think if you look at his finishing skills, heading left, right, top corners, he’s the complete striker at the moment and same you can say from Hugo [Ekitiké]. Very good, very eager, obviously the quality he’s been showing already since, I think, the first session.”Van Dijk said he had spoken to Isak during the international break. “For him it’s obviously about getting as fit as possible, as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, how we do set pieces. So it’s been a good week for him and let’s see tomorrow.”Liverpool have ambitions to challenge for the Champions League after being knocked out in the last 16 byParis Saint-Germain on penaltieslast season. Atlético’s visit is the start of a difficult-looking league stage for Slot’s side, who then travel to Galatasaray and will also face Eintracht Frankfurt, Real Madrid, PSV and Inter before Christmas.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I don’t know the exact thinking of those who are in charge. I guess it’s maybe just a bit of trust, and showing a bit of faith. It will be nice to see how I go under pressure, and I’m sure that the guys that have made the decision would like to see that as well.“I like when things come at a fast pace, it tends to get me up and about. So I like those situations, doesn’t mean that they always work. But hopefully this one does.”Even with plenty of experienced names in the squad to face Ireland, Bethell’s ascension is in line with the management’s wilder impulses when it comes to selection.

We are committed to keeping taxes for working people as low as possible, which is why at the last budget, we protected working people’s payslips and kept our promise not to raise the basic, higher or additional rates of income tax, employee national insurance or VAT.”Explore more on these topicsEconomic policyOffice for Budget ResponsibilityEconomicsRachel ReevesBudget 2025Tax and spendingnewsShareReuse this content"

That’s what’s happened for the past 10 years. We must not do that. We have to act. Now is a pivotal moment … to try to get this right.”MPs called an emergency session in response to last week’s decision by the US drugmaker Merck, known as MSD in Europe,to scrap its plans for a £1bn London research centreand lay off 125 scientists partly based at the capital’s Francis Crick Institute. MSD blamed “the challenges of the UK not making meaningful progress towards addressing the lack of investment in the life science industry”.AstraZeneca announced on Friday thatit was putting a £200m new laboratory in Cambridge on hold. It abandoned a £450m investment in its Speke vaccine site in January after months of negotiations, citing a cut in government support.Vallance, who became a household name aschief scientific adviser during the Covid pandemic, told MPs on Tuesday that the NHS’s spending on medicines had been in decline as a proportion of total healthcare spend since 2015, but said the figure would increase from the current 9%.“The reason we need to reverse that direction is not just price,” he said. “It’s about saying we need to make sure that we get rapid uptake of the best new medicines and we have equitable access right across the UK.”He said the UK’s drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, and the National Institute forHealthand Care Excellence, which decides which medications will be available on the NHS, needed to be linked.Dr Zubir Ahmed, the new health under-secretary and a Scottish surgeon, said the UK needed to change its pricing models in recognition of new cutting-edge treatments, which are more expensive.“We have to look at medicines in a different light … and calculate the economic and clinical benefit on that basis,” he said.Vallance said the government had not formally restarted talks with the pharmaceutical industry over its medicine pricing mechanism, whichcollapsed last month without an agreementand has been cited as one of the factors in drugmakers cancelling projects, but ministers were holding “lots of discussions around the commercial environment in the UK” with companies.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The company also plans to close its animal health site in Milton Keynes and transfer the work to Austria.AstraZeneca’s UK president, Tom Keith-Roach, told MPs: “We are involved now in a highly constructive conversation with government at the highest level, notwithstanding that this is an extremely difficult moment in history and a very substantial challenge; the issue of under-investment in medicines has been a continued and worsening trend in the UK.”The head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Richard Torbett, said the UK was losing out to the US, Belgium, Ireland, Singapore and Germany.Explore more on these topicsPharmaceuticals industryPatrick VallanceNHSHealthAstraZenecanewsShareReuse this content"

The projectile had punctured the burro’s right lung, said Chad Cheatham, vice-president of DonkeyLand, a non-profit rescue organization.“Right now she’s stable and is standing, which is a huge improvement,” Cheatham said Monday. When Cupid is fully recovered, she will join a group of rescued burros who meander DonkeyLand’s 2,000-acre (800-hectare) sanctuary and wildlife preserve.The rescue group is offering a $24,000 reward, raised from donations, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in at least six bow attacks on burros over the past several months.The Riverside county department of animal services said on Tuesday that the investigation is ongoing, and asked for the public’s help in identifying a suspect or suspects.Wild burros are protected under federal law. They are an iconic symbol of the US south-west, dating to their days as pack animals for people flocking to California during the Gold Rush.Cheatham said burros have become an “unofficial mascot” of Moreno Valley, where hundreds of them have rambled freely for at least 75 years. They even help with wildfire abatement by munching on tinder – dry grass in remote and ready-to-burn canyons across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, he said.“So they really do provide a benefit to the community. The firefighters love them because, they say: ‘Man, these guys can go places we can’t go,’ ” Cheatham said.The animals are docile but sometimes they can be a nuisance if they chomp on residents’ flowers or block roads when motorists stop to feed them from their cars, he said.Last year, neighboring San Bernardino county, where wild burros are estimated to number in the thousands, contracted with the non-profit Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue to humanely capture the animals and relocate them to sanctuaries.“While the wild burros delight many residents and visitors, they also commonly encounter vehicle traffic and freight trains, resulting in tragedy for burros and humans,” the county said in a statement. “The burros also seriously injure themselves leading to infection and death when they become entangled in fencing or when their hooves get caught in cemetery flower vases.”The arrows used in the Moreno Valley attacks were broadheads, a style traditionally used for hunting, said Cheatham. According to DonkeyLand, the first attack occurred the weekend of 14 June, when a young burro was found grazing with an arrow in her side not far from where Cupid was discovered. A few days later, a second burro was found shot with a similar style of arrow in the same area.Since then, at least three other donkeys were shot in the vicinity, including a pair estimated to be two to four months old, the rescue group said.Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high “minis” that may weigh 300lbs (135kg) to bulky “mammoths”.Last year, two men pleaded guilty to federal charges for using high-powered rifles to kill three wild burros in southern California’s Mojave Desert, about 90 miles (145km) north of Moreno Valley.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimalsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

The missives request each company to turn over documents regarding the 2009 declaration, known as the endangerment finding, which the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)said in Julythat it will unmake.The finding enshrined that carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases harm the health of Americans.Republicans who backed Trump’s anti-environment bill have accepted over $105m from big oilRead more“Rescinding the endangerment finding at the behest of industry is irresponsible, legally dubious, and deeply out of step with the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment, and the American public deserves to understand your role in advancing EPA’s dangerous decision,” wrote Rhode Island senator Sheldon Whitehouse, the ranking member of the committee. “I am concerned about the role that fossil fuel companies, certain manufacturers, trade associations, polluter-backed groups, and others with much to benefit from the repeal of the endangerment finding – including your organization – played in drafting, preparing, promoting, and lobbying on the proposal.”Fossil fuel companies and their allies are threatened by the endangerment finding because it confirms in law that carbon dioxide, which their products produce, are dangerous, Whitehouse told the Guardian. It also gives the EPA the authority to regulate those emissions under the Clean Air Act.The letter, which asks for all relevant private communications between the day Trump was re-elected in November to the day the EPA announced plans to rescind the endangerment finding in July, was sent to oil giants Exxon, Chevron, Shell and BP, as well as coal producers, a rail giant and two auto manufacturers, whose business plans rely on fossil fuels.“The only interests that benefit from undoing the endangerment finding are polluter interests, and specifically fossil fuel polluter interests,” Whitehouse said.It was also sent to trade associations and law firms representing big oil and auto companies. And it was sent to far-right, pro-fossil fuel thinktanks Competitive Enterprise Institute, New Civil Liberties Alliance, the Heartland Institute, America First Policy Institute and the Heritage Foundation, each of which challenge the authority of federal agencies, and some of which have directly praised the proposed endangerment finding rollback.The Guardian has contacted each recipient for comment.Because Republicans control the Senate, Democrats on the environment and public works committee lack the power to subpoena the documents. But the Senate committee still expects the companies to comply with their request.The letter could send a signal to polluting sectors and rightwing firms that they are being watched and could set the stage for continued investigation if Democrats win back a congressional chamber in next November’s midterm elections.Fossil fuel interests pushed back on the endangerment finding when it was first written, yet little is known about more recent advocacy to overturn it. Immediately following the EPA’s announcement of the rollback, the New York Timesreportedthat groups have not “been clamoring in recent years for its reversal”. But Whitehouse believes that has changed since Trump was re-elected in November 2025.When Joe Biden was president and Democrats controlled at least one chamber of Congress, Whitehouse said “a request to rescind the endangerment finding would have just looked like useless, pointless, madness.“But now that they can actually do it in their desperation and with the mask of moderation pulled off, I think it’s very clear that they were directing this happen,” he said.Under Trump, former lobbyists and lawyers for polluting industries such as oil, gas and petrochemicals have entered leadership positions at the EPA.“The fossil fuel industry owns and controls the Trump administration on all matters that relate to their industry, and they have subservient Republicans controlling both the House and the Senate,” said Whitehouse. “The change in power has allowed a change in tactics and attitude.”Two environmental non-profitshave sued the Trump administrationfor “secretly” convening a group ofclimate contrariansto bolster its effort to topple the endangerment finding.The EPA’s proposed undoing of the crucial legal conclusion comes as part of a largerwar on the environmentby the Trump administration, which has killed dozens of climate rules since re-entering the White House in January.“The motive is to help fossil fuels survive,” said Whitehouse.Explore more on these topicsEnvironmentDemocracy and justiceUS SenateUS politicsClimate crisisOilDonald TrumpTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

In total, there were 254,808 hours of sewage outflows in national parks last year.Areport by the Campaign for National Parks (CNP) and the Rivers Trustalso found that more than half of the rivers in national parks failed to meet the good ecological status required by law. Slurry and fertiliser runoff from farms and toxic pesticides also contributed to the ailing state of the bodies of water. The national parks worst affected by sewage overflows were Dartmoor, the South Downs, the Broads and Eryri, also known as Snowdonia.As well as rivers, national parks contain internationally renowned wetlands and sensitive chalk streams, and host a huge variety of wildlife including salmon, beavers, water voles, bitterns and eels. They are valued by millions of visitors and help reduce flood risk downstream.The campaigners are urging the government to bring forward stricter regulations, which were promised in January, and to ensure all sewage treatment works in national parks are upgraded to the same standard required in more populated areas. The Guardian revealed a year ago thatwildlife was faring worse inside national parksthan outside.“National park rivers are being poisoned, drained and neglected – if we can’t protect these, we can’t claim to be serious about ending the UK’s water crisis,” said Dr Rose O’Neill, the chief executive of the CNP. “This outrageous level of sewage reflects ageing and poorly maintained infrastructure that is ill-designed and undersized to cope with actual resident and visitor populations.”She added: “Without change, local groups working to protect national park waterways are often swimming against the current.Waterregulators and companies have ignored national parks for far too long.”Dartmoor map/spillsDavid Johnson, a technical director at theRiversTrust, said: “This data presents a tragic tale of underinvestment and mismanagement of the rivers that flow across our most iconic landscapes. Serious action is needed to break the cycle of pollution and destruction.”Sewage pollution across the nations has become a big political issue and in July the government promised thebiggest overhaul of water regulationsince the industry was privatised in 1989 and pledged new laws in 2026.In January, theflooding minister, Emma Hardy, told parliament: “We will strengthen through new regulation the role that public bodies, including water companies, must play in delivering better outcomes for nature, water, climate and access to nature in these special places.” However, the new regulations have yet to be put in place.A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, said: “The government is taking action to clean up England’s rivers, lakes and seas, especially in our iconic national parks and landscapes. [Across the country] we’re rebuilding sewage pipes to slash pollution levels in half with over £104bn of private investment.”How national parks failed nature – and how to fix themRead moreThe CNP-Rivers Trust report analyseddataon the combined sewage overflows (CSOs) occurring in national parks. CSOs occur when raw or partially treated sewage is discharged from water works and are only supposed to happen during extreme heavy rainfall.In Dartmoor, the average hours of overflow per CSO was three times that outside national parks in England andWaleslast year, in the South Downs and Broads it was 2.9 times, the New Forest 2.6 times and Eryri 2.4 times. Some rivers are particularly affected with, for example, the Lymington River in the New Forest national park having suffered 2,800 hours of sewage outflows in 2024.Dartmoor also had the longest total duration of sewage releases, 49,076 hours in 2024, with Eryri second worst with 47,187 hours. Only two of the 13 national parks had sewage spill rates better than the rest of the country: Northumbria and North York Moors.A bar graph showing sewage outflows per hour in 13 national parksOne reason for the disparity is that sewage treatment works deemed to be serving fewer than 2,000 people are not legally required to use “secondary treatment”, which removes organic matter, and therefore offer only basic water treatment.The report found only 42% of water bodies in the national parks were classed as having good ecological status. That was better than the 12% of rivers in healthy condition outside national parks.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In addition, a toxic chemical cocktail is polluting some rivers and lakes in national parks, the report said, including pharmaceuticals used by people and flea-killing chemicals used on dogs.Vanessa Rowlands, the chair of National Parks England, praised the work of the national park authorities, communities, farmers, landowners and government agencies in making the ecological condition of national park rivers better than those outside. But she said: “We need to go further and faster. Waterways are the cornerstone of our habitats. Yet, as the report illustrates, our efforts are hampered by poor infrastructure, lack of investment and weak regulation.”Hazel Tranchant, from South West Water, said: “Dartmoor experienced high storm overflow hours in 2024, and we recognise we need to do more to reduce spills.” She added that 2023-24 was thewettest hydrological yearon record, “which made this a challenge”.She said a quarter of the 62 CSOs in Dartmoor already met the legal requirement of fewer than 10 spills a year, with another quarter to be improved by 2035, and the rest by 2040.A spokesperson for Southern Water, which covers the South Downs and New Forest national parks, said: “We share customers’ desire to protect and enhance our precious national parks. Over the next five years, we’re targeting the four most active New Forest outfalls and 13 priority overflows in the South Downs, to bring all spills below the government targets. We’re also upgrading wastewater treatment works across both areas.“Groundwater forcing its way into sewers causes most storm overflows in these areas, but through innovative relining and replacements we’re tackling this problem.”A spokesperson for United Utilities, which covers the Lake District national park, said: “We are wholeheartedly committed to helping improve water quality across our region and in our national parks. That’s why we’re delivering the largest ever environmental investment programme in the north-west.”The CNP is calling for the new water legislation to include legally binding targets to clean up rivers, lakes and streams in national parks, meaning all CSOs must be fixed by 2035; all sewage works must have secondary treatment; all waterways must achieve at least good ecological status; and toxic chemicals must be banned. It also wants stricter regulation and support for farmers to better manage slurry and muck spreading.A spokesperson for Welsh Water, which covers the Eryri national park, said Wales has high levels of rainfall: “Storm overflows are essential to ensure networks do not become overwhelmed and flood properties. The total removal of storm overflows is unaffordable and would take decades, so we are targeting this investment on those having the greatest environmental impact.” He said Welsh Water will invest £889m on improving storm overflows across the country in the next five years.Anglian Water did not respond to a request for comment.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

Other countries face tariffs of 50% on their steel exports.However, another government source said that under the deal that had been negotiated, but has now been shelved, the steel export quota would have increased once US concerns about the source of Britain’s raw material imports were resolved.The disclosure will raise questions about why the proposed deal has fallen apart at the last minute. It marks a fresh setback for Keir Starmer after a difficult two weeks dominated by the resignations of three senior government figures and mounting questions about the prime minister’s judgment.Meanwhile, Starmer is due to unveil a technology pact with the US involving an estimated £31bn in investment and he announced an AI “growth zone” in north-east England, creating potential for more than 5,000 jobs.The deal includes a domestic version of the White House’s Stargate AI infrastructure project, in which ChatGPT provider Open AI, the chip manufacturer Nvidia and UK data company Nscale will back a datacentre in Wallsend. Ministers are hoping that deals with the US on technology and nuclear energy this week will give the government a boost.The trade deal announced by the US and UK in May was supposed to reduce tariffs on steel from 25% to 0%, but its implementation was put on hold over US concerns about the UK becoming a backdoor for cheap steel imports from other countries.Speaking before his flight to London, Trump had raised hopes of a breakthrough by saying the UK government would “like to see if they could get a little bit better deal, so we’ll talk to them”. Ministers insist that negotiations with the US over reducing the steel tariff to zero are ongoing.A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the strength of the UK-US partnership, we are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.“We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our plan for change.”Steel industry figures, who had expected a 0% rate on exports, expressed disappointment at the news.“It’s disappointing – perhaps not 100% surprising,” said one steel industry executive. “Some products might not be possible to sell to the US. Others we can pass it on. It could be worse.“Getting certainty is sometimes better than just continuing negotiations. That period of uncertainty has been really quite difficult to handle for steel companies.”Another industry insider said they were relieved that UK exports would continue to have an advantage over those from the EU, which face prohibitive tariffs.Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, said it would be “disappointing if we do not have the tariff-free quota level” but that a “final decision on 25% offers a degree of certainty and potentially a competitive advantage so long as other countries remain at 50%”.The prime minister said the £31bn investment deal marked a “generational step change” in the UK’s relationship with the US and would deliver “growth, security and opportunity up and down the country”. He said the partnership would create highly skilled jobs and put “more money in people’s pockets”.No 10 said the agreement did not involve any regulatory or tax concessions to big tech.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others warned of the environmental costs of building huge datacentres.In all, the pact should see the deployment of 120,000 advanced GPUs – the chips required to power AI – described by the government and Nvidia as the biggest rollout in Europe. There will also be a joint US-UK taskforce on developing quantum computers.The new AI growth zone is designed to boost construction of datacentres – the central nervous system of AI technology – and will encompass the north-east combined authority, which includes Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham.The zone will include an already-planned datacentre in Blyth, Northumberland, backed by a £10bn commitment from US investment firm Blackstone.Other announcements in the tech pact include a multi-year investment by Microsoft, including backing the UK’s largest supercomputer in Essex and multibillion dollar investment commitments from US tech firms CoreWeave and Salesforce.But Nick Dearden, director ofGlobal Justice Now, an anti-corporate globalisation campaign group, warned that the US investment must not come at the cost of the UK’s ability to tax and regulate new technology.“If we give it up, we become no more than a source of profit for the richest people in the world to extract our data, water and other resources,” he said.“Starmer promised to build a strong tech British industry. But this pact is turning us into no more than an aircraft carrier for US big tech.“This is dangerous and once we’re totally locked into dependence on these gigantic private monopolies we will regret this deal.”Other campaigners warned of the environmental costs, amid estimates that the Blyth datacentre, which was trumpeted as part of the US-UK tech pact and is being backed by Blackstone, an investment firm led by Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman, will emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as Birmingham airport.“Following the queasy spectacle of CEOs from tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI queueing up to pay tribute at the White House this month, it’s little surprise to hear that the Trump-big tech axis is dead set on covering the UK in hyperscale datacentres,” said Donald Campbell, advocacy director at tech justice non-profitFoxglove.“Meanwhile, the UK will foot the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need – meaning rocketing prices for households – as well as the water needed to keep them cool.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyDonald TrumpSteel industryTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

They said their department had not been asked to contribute to the due diligence process that the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team carried out before Mandelson was given the job.They said that Mandelson underwent full developed vetting to the “usual standard” after his appointment was announced and had been given clearance by the time he took up the role in Washington on 10 February.Emily Thornberry, the committee’s Labour chair, asked whether those vetting Mandelson had been told to “overlook” the “glaring national security and reputational risk” he posed.“Did the Cabinet Office miss the glaring red flag of Lord Mandelson’s relationship with Epstein, or did it fail to pass those concerns on?” she asked during a three-hour Commons debate on Mandelson’s appointment.Thornberry argued that the scandal could have been avoided if her committee had been allowed to question Mandelson before he was appointed, a request that was turned down by the Foreign Office.The former business secretary and architect of New Labourwas sacked last weekafter a tranche of emails were published in which he expressed love and support for Epstein and urged him to “fight for early release” in 2008 while the financier was facing charges for soliciting sex from minors.Keir Starmer, who had faced questions about his judgment in choosing Mandelson and giving him his full support a day before sacking him,said on Monday: “Had I known then what I know now, I’d have never appointed him.”Stephen Doughty, a Foreign Office minister, argued on Tuesday that had the full extent of Mandelson’s friendship with Epstein been known, he would have not held a string of other high-profile roles.“If the full depth and extent of this relationship had been so obvious I hardly think that Lord Mandelson would have been one of the leading candidates to become chancellor of Oxford University and I highly doubt that he would have been offered the job as presenter on Times Radio,” Doughty told MPs.“National security vetting is a longstanding formal process undertaken by UK security vetting on behalf of individual departments and reporting back to them. The process is rightfully independent of ministers, who are not informed of any findings other than the final outcome. Exactly the same procedures on that were followed in this case,” Doughty said.But he said ministers had listened to MPs’ arguments about being allowed to scrutinise future appointees and would consider “all options to support the work of the committee in the future”.David Davis, a former Conservative cabinet minister, told the Commons that Starmer’s standing on the world stage had been “diminished” by the row. He characterised Mandelson as someone who was “easily dazzled by wealth and glamour” throughout his career and whose association with Epstein showed a “reprehensible attitude” to women.Davis also detailed Mandelson’s business interests, including his setting up of Global Counsel, a consultancy which he said had acted for “extremely dubious Russian companies” and Chinese firms.The debate came in the run-up toDonald Trump’s state visit to the UK, which Kemi Badenoch said risked being overshadowed by the row. “It is extraordinary – extraordinary – that on the eve of the president’s state visit, we are talking about the US ambassador who’s been sacked in scandal,” the Tory leader told the Commons.Badenoch and Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat leader, both urged Starmerto personally apologiseto Epstein’s victims.Explore more on these topicsPeter MandelsonForeign, Commonwealth and Development OfficeJeffrey EpsteinUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The company said it had many more people working globally for the business in markets such as China and Japan, where it has the majority of its stores.The pottery and ceramics sector has struggled in recent years under the pressure of rising costs and energy bills. A number of potteries have collapsed in Staffordshire, includingthe nearly 200-year-old Royal Stafford in February.A Wedgwood spokesperson said: “This short-term measure is being taken to address elevated inventory levels caused by lower consumer demand in some of our key markets.“Barlaston and its community are of key importance to Fiskars Group and Wedgwood.”The company said its artisans still used techniques pioneered by founderJosiah Wedgwood, who was born in Staffordshire in 1730.“This living tradition reflects our commitment to craftsmanship, the value of Made in England and Barlaston’s enduring role in our heritage and operations,” a Fiskars spokesperson said.Fiskars, which employs 6,850 people across its group, also owns Royal Doulton and the Danish porcelain brand Royal Copenhagen, among others.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Here’s a brief look at what’s in the filing.What does Trump claim is defamatory in the suit?The suit focuses on the publication of a set of news articles in the New York Times describing his work on the television show The Apprentice and stories derived from the book Lucky Loser: HowDonald TrumpSquandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success by Times reporters Susanne Craig and Russ Buettner.Trump’s suit argues that passages in Times’ reporting describing Apprentice producer Mark Burnett’s “discovery” of Trump as a potential host for the show is factually incorrect because Trump had long been famous before the show began.Reporting in the book described Trump’s multimillion-dollar inheritance from his father Fred C Trump as a product of “fraudulent tax evasion schemes”, and that Trump’s father had been “twisting the rules” of federal programs used to support returning second world war veterans to build his fortune.The suit takes issue with reporting that depicted Trump’s offices in Trump Tower, upon Burnett’s initial visit, as having a “stench” with out of date decor and that Burnett had to “reinvent” Trump for television.The suit also asserts that the Times reporting of the comments of John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff, constituted an act of malicious, libelous reporting. In those stories, the Times reported that Kelly said Trump “had made admiring statements about Hitler”.Other complaints Trump alleges are false and defamatory in the suit include Times’ reporting on Trump’s conduct in school, the value of his real estate deals and that he had been investigated for ties to the mafia and money laundering.What is the legal standard for libel and defamation in Florida?In Florida, a public figure suing a media entity must prove more than just the falsity of a statement and that it is damaging, but must also show that the publisher acted with “actual malice”.To do so, a plaintiff must show that the author published something either knowing that it was false or acted with reckless disregard for the statement’s truth or falsity. This standard was set by the Times v Sullivan case at the US supreme court in 1964, a landmark precedent that is a foundation of American journalism. Historically, it has required extraordinary evidence showing that a defendant actually knew the information was false or entertained serious doubts as to the truth of it before publication to be successful.How does Trump intend to overcome this hurdle?To the degree that the lawsuit, filled with assertions of the “magnificence” of Trump’s real estate deals and the “sui generis charisma” of Trump himself, is more than a political tool, it argues that the Times set aside journalistic norms of objectivity in its reporting on Trump.Trump’s suit argues that the timing of pieces was meant to dissuade voters from choosing him and that this was malicious and an act of “election interference”.The suit cites a Jim Rutenbergopinionpiece in August 2016, Trump Is Testing the Norms of Objectivity in Journalism, in which Rutenberg argues: “If you view a Trump presidency as something that’s potentially dangerous, then your reporting is going to reflect that. You would move closer than you’ve ever been to being oppositional.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpNew York TimesUS press and publishingNewspapersLaw (US)explainersShareReuse this content"

Both may still appeal.The former president remains under house arrest at his mansion in Brasília for allegedly trying to intimidate supreme court justices overseeingthe coup case. Barred by court order from using social media, Bolsonaro has not commented on the racism ruling.Shortly after the ruling, the former president was taken to a hospital with a “severe bout of hiccups, vomiting and low blood pressure”, according to a post on social media by one of his politician sons, senator Flávio Bolsonaro.Last Sunday, Bolsonaro had also gone to the hospital for procedures to remove skin lesions.Another of his politician sons, the Rio de Janeiro councillor Carlos Bolsonaro, reposted news of the convictionwith the message: “Long live democracy!”The Bolsonaro family claims the cases against him are political persecution.Inthe coup case, Bolsonaro’s lawyers may still lodge a final appeal before the supreme court decides where he will serve his sentence, which is expected to happen in October or November.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasJair BolsonaronewsShareReuse this content"

If you want to criticize my 16 years of service, please bring it on. Over to you,” Patel said at the conclusion of his opening statement to the Senate judiciary committee, where he made his first appearance since being confirmed to lead the bureau in February.SeveralDemocratson the committee accepted the invitation, getting into angry exchanges and at least one shouting match with the director over the course of the four-and-a-half-hour hearing.“What I am doing is protecting this country, providing historic reforms and combating the weaponization of intelligence by the likes of you,” Patel told California’s Adam Schiff in a heated back-and-forth that devolved into name-calling.FBI director Kash Patel wears Liverpool FC tie to US Senate hearingRead moreSchiff, a longtime antagonist of Donald Trump, had pressed the director on why the Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwellhad been movedto a lower-security federal prison after speaking with a top justice department official in July, prompting Patel to insist he was not involved in that decision, before calling Schiff a “liar”, the “biggest fraud to sit in the United States Senate” and “a political buffoon at best”.Demands that theTrump administrationprovide more transparency into its investigation of Epstein, who died while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges in 2019, loomed large over the hearing, but Patel gave little ground, insisting that a court order prevented him from making public further documents related to the case.Other Democrats zeroed in on reporting, includingfrom Fox Newsover the weekend, that top aides to Trump were losing faith in Patel.“I don’t think you’re fit to head the bureau, but here’s the thing, Mr Patel, I think you’re not going to be around long. I think this might be your last oversight hearing,” the New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker said.“That rant of false information does not bring this country together,” Patel replied. He and the senator began talking over each other, with Patel at one point saying: “You are an embarrassment.”Democrats had waged a strident but ultimately ineffective effort to prevent Patel’s confirmation by the Republican majority, outraged by his support for those accused of carrying out the January 6 insurrection, as well as his compilation of an “enemy’s list” of Washington politicians and bureaucrats in a 2022 book.Their concerns have only grown in the months since he took over the bureau. Last week, three former senior FBI officials, including one who served as acting director,sued Patelfor wrongful termination. They alleged that the bureau had become politicized, with Patel at one point stating that he had been instructed to fire agents who investigated Trump, according to the lawsuit.Ex-FBI officials sue Kash Patel over claims they were fired for investigating TrumpRead moreThe director declined to comment on the allegations by the former agents, saying they were the subject of litigation, but insisted people were fired from the FBI only if it was justified.“The only way, generally speaking, an individual is terminated at the FBI is if they have violated their oath of office, violated the law, or failed to uphold the standards that we need them to have at the FBI,” Patel said.Patel’s leadership came further in to question last week amid the search for the suspect in the murder of the conservative activist Charlie Kirk. The director at one point announced that a suspect had been taken into custody, before retracting his statement. The New York Timesreportedthat Patel used profanity on a conference call where he criticized subordinates for not quickly updating him on the case.Under questioning from the Democratic senator Peter Welch, Patel refused to concede that the premature announcement of an arrest was a mistake, instead describing it as part of the investigative process.“In my commitment to work with the public to help identify subjects and suspects, I put that information out, and then when we interviewed him, I put out the results of that. And could I have been more careful in my verbiage and included a subject instead of subject? Sure, in the heat of the moment, but I was doing the best I could,” Patel said. He later added: “I don’t see it as a mistake.”He later refused demands from the Hawaii senator Mazie Hirono for precise details of how many agents had resigned, been fired or retired since Trump took office, saying he did not immediately know the numbers. The Democrat continued asking, prompting Patel to say: “When you’re talking about firings, you’re looking for a media hit and a fundraising clip, and I’m not going to give it to you.”Patel is scheduled to testify on Wednesday before the House judiciary committee. Its top Democrat, Jamie Raskin, on Tuesdayreleased a memoarguing that Trump had undercut efforts to fight sex trafficking and abuse through a host of policies he implemented since taking office.Explore more on these topicsFBIUS SenateTrump administrationUS politicsDemocratsnewsShareReuse this content"

A video of the incident was shared on the museum’sInstagram account, attracting more than 600,000 views.“I told him he wouldn’t be able to get up to the front on the unicycle,” said Donadelli. “But people take risks and this has been a problem throughout the Dolomites all summer.”Allow Instagram content?This article includes content provided byInstagram.

It was very unusual to see someone on such a vehicle. We were astonished. We don’t want to demonise him, but why take risk when you don’t need to?”View image in fullscreenThe researchers believe that the unicyclist may have been heading to the glacier to take a photo, and shared a video of them on Instagram.Photograph: Museo di Geografia UnipdOn sharing the video, the museum referred to its manifesto for another Marmolada, which it published last year and in which it proposed “transforming the Marmolada into a model for sustainable development” and “certainly not a stage performance like this one”.The Marmolada glacier has been measured every year since 1902 and is considered “a natural thermometer” of climate change.Scientists said last yearthat it could melt completely by 2040 as a result of rising average temperatures. Thecollapse of part of the Marmoladakilled 11 people in 2022.Tourists seeking perfect photos of the peaks and inexperienced hikers have overwhelmed emergency rescue services in the Dolomites this summer. In one incident,a British hikerwas billed more than €14,000 after having to be rescued by helicopter when he ventured along a path that had been closed due to rockslide risk.Explore more on these topicsItalyEuropeGlaciersShareReuse this content"

Now he has made the leap into a big, bold, primary-coloured romantic phantasmagoria, as if Chris Marker had remade The Umbrellas of Cherbourg for the American multiplex with two unfeasibly beautiful Hollywood stars. This is a musical without musical numbers (without its own musical numbers, anyway) and a romantic comedy mostly without comedy – an imbalance it shares with most romcoms in fact. The screenwriter is Seth Reiss, co-author ofthe (much chillier) drama The Menu, with Ralph Fiennes as a scary chef.What Kogonada and Reiss are offering is a likably, if obtusely uncynical, heart-on-sleeve wish-fulfilment spectacular, which gradually retreats from its initial, borderline insufferable self-awareness. Or maybe it’s just that you get used to it. We are plunged into a woozy daydream as multicoloured as a ball pit in a kids’ play centre, all about love, relationships and the overwhelming importance of being open and risking emotional hurt to find the One. This involves coming to terms with your past and how you feel about your passionately remembered parents who are either dead or at any rate don’t tactlessly appear on screen in their present elderly form.Margot Robbie andColin Farrellplay Sarah and David, two mind-blowingly attractive single professionals who meet and warily flirt at the wedding of mutual friends; when Sarah’s rental car breaks down afterwards, they wind up sharing David’s and go on a road trip together away from unhappy commitment-phobia and towards self-forgiveness and love.But that’s not the half of it. The rental car agency, run by two uber-zany comedy characters played by Kevin Kline andPhoebe Waller-Bridge(the latter dropping F-bombs and doing a wacky German accent that she snaps out of while musing on how we all perform roles), has given David a special 90s vintage Saturn with its own mystical GPS which guides the couple to various magic doors in the landscape. They go through these to primal scenes of their past: to encounters with their respective parents, to a Canadian lighthouse where David once epiphanically realised he wasn’t having an epiphany, to a modern art gallery which Sarah’s late mother loved in her too-good-to-be-true way and which they now visit (for some reason) in the pitch darkness with a torch, to two separate hospitals which might somehow be the same hospital, and to David’s high school where he fell unrequitedly in love with his leading lady while performing in their Broadway-level production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying, in the film’s best scene.Kogonada’s previous film After Yang had distinct touches of Charlie Kaufman in its futurist drama about a family who have an intense emotional connection with the secondhand AI humanoid robot they buy as a companion-sibling for their adopted daughter. And this film, in its mainstream way, weirdly also has something Kaufmanesque as well … or almost. You might expect Kline and Waller-Bridge’s characters to be revealed as techno-sapien robots, as well as Farrell and Robbie and Kogonada and everyone involved with the film. But no.When recognisably real things happen they stand out very sharply. Sarah, on a capricious whim at the wedding, asks David to marry her and, after a moment in which you think David is going to take her up on it, to indulge this fantasy, he appears to think better of it and instead says coldly: “You’ve destroyed some men, haven’t you …” And when Sarah and David arrive at David’s high school and Sarah realises everyone thinks David is the teenager he was then, she asks his drama teacher how old he thinks she is, and he replies “40” – an outrageously ungallant estimate which infuriates her. But there is also sweetness and charm, not disenchantment, in the breath-holding competition to which Sarah challenges David in the car – a game her mother liked.The unreality of the film never quite equates to dishonesty about what exactly happens when two people not in the first flush of youth decide to be in love, but it takes an effort of will to suspend disbelief and submit to a well-intentioned fantasy.A Big Bold Beautiful Journey is out on 18 September in Australia, and on 19 September in the UK and US.Explore more on these topicsFilmRomance filmsComedy filmsMargot RobbieColin FarrellPhoebe Waller-BridgeScience fiction and fantasy filmsreviewsShareReuse this content"

He is Gwyneth Paltrow’s healer. Now, the tale of their shocking marriage is shared in this shallow, gushing documentary. Still, at least they have Prince Harry’s blessingHannah J DaviesTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 03.13 EDTShareIn 2019 – two years after her divorce from her former husband Ari Behn – Norway’s Princess Märtha Louise went public with her new partner. To say that Durek Verrett wasn’t what the Norwegian public had in mind would be an understatement: as well as being a Black American man based in Los Angeles, Verrett was also a celebrity shaman who had worked with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. The trailer for Rebel Royals: An Unlikely Love Story plays up his wild side and the sense that Märtha Louise was dramatically departing from tradition by dating – and later marrying – him. But, really, this Netflix documentary shows that they have a tremendous amount in common. Märtha Louise may be a princess but she is, to use a trendy word, incredibly“crunchy”– a woman who was communicating with angels and teaching energy healing way back in 2007. The pair are convinced that they met in a past life. And by the time we see them flogging their wedding pictures to a glossy magazine, it’s clear that their connection transcends the spiritual realm and extends to the financial one, too.Rebel Royals is presented entirely via talking heads – most notably, Märtha Louise and Verrett – giving it little narrative cohesion. Interesting titbits are teased throughout, such as Verrett describing himself as “soul-sexual”, and saying he had previously thought he would end up with a male partner. There is a section on the vile racism he faced inNorway– much of it from online trolls, but not helped by initial silence from his new in-laws. (As Verrett notes, when his father-in-law, King Harald, did speak out, he was praised by Prince Harry, who was himself embroiled in a race-related row with his family.)View image in fullscreenA ‘crunchy’ couple … Märtha Louise and Shaman Durek Verrett in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixBut, really, everything here feels inescapably shallow: a mix of gushing comments from the film’s subjects, alarmist tabloid headlines about Verrett brainwashing Märtha Louise, and questions from the Norwegian media that are left unanswered. Royal expert Tove Taalesen thinks Verrett is “maybe a scam artist”, a claim that isn’t explored.Verrett denies being a scammer or a fraud, and sees any criticism towards him as a form of smear campaign, from a press that “[doesn’t] want a shaman who’s Black and bisexual marrying their princess”. That could well be the case, but the film leaves some blanks when it comes to Verrett’s past. We are told that he sold healing medallions during the Covid pandemic; a headline flashes up describing it as “immoral” but we don’t hear from Verrett himself.Verrett has also been accused of sexual misconduct towards a client, which he denies vehemently, but no questions are put to him here. Instead, we hear a voice note he sent to a friend in 2020, where he describes having “crossed a line” in a healing session by engaging in a sex act, but apparently in a way that was still consensual. “When you have a press that wants to prove to the world that I’m a charlatan, I’m a fake, I’m a conspiracy theorist, I’m evil, I’m dark – you have a very difficult situation,” he adds to camera. The result is, as with many Netflix documentaries de nos jours, a film that feels, if not one-sided, then not exactly brimming with editorial independence.Conforming to Norwegian society, he says, would make him melt down into a pile of goo like the Wicked Witch of the WestAs well as Behn’s suicide and the pain endured by Märtha Louise and her three daughters, the other unexpectedly tragic narrative thread here relates to Verrett’s health. We are told that he is undergoing frequent dialysis and is in need of a new kidney, for what would be his second attempt at a transplant. It is, of course, a sad series of events. But given Verrett’s views on modern medicine (in his 2019 book, Spirit Hacking, he described asking hospitalised patients why they “wanted” their cancer, as a form of treatment), it feels like a missed opportunity for him to explain why he believes some illnesses can be cured by shamanic means and others cannot. Instead, he merely takes the opportunity to describe himself as “a wounded healer”. As for that healing, we never get a good look at what Verrett’s shamanism consists of, let alone hearing from a happy customer or two.View image in fullscreenTo say the people of Norway were stunned would be an understatement … Märtha Louise and Durek Verrett in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Netflix/Courtesy of NetflixSometimes, as with the pandemic-era smash Tiger King – with which Rebel Royals shares its director, Rebecca Chaiklin – Netflix manages to have its cake and eat it, retaining the presence of a key quirky figure while also making them the butt of the joke. Here, Verrett is cast in that role: there is a lot of strutting, outfit changes and picky wedding planning. At one point, he pretends to vomit as he considers the unofficial cultural laws of Norwegian society, and his utter aversion to being modest. At another, he wears a jacket with the words “spiritual hustler” on the back, a sartorial choice that calls to mind the time Melania Trump wore a coat emblazoned with the words “I really don’t care, do you?” Conforming to Norwegian society would, he says, cause him to melt down into a pile of goo like the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.But there’s only so much madcap humour that can carry you through when everything else feels so flimsy. The closing part of the documentary – at the couple’s wedding in a remote area of Norway – is played for a few final laughs, with Verrett hiding under a sheet so none of the waiting paps can snap a picture before Hello!. It’s funny, but it did make me wonder whether Märtha Louise and Durek Verrett should have cut to the chase and just gone straight to reality TV instead.Rebel Royals: An Unlikely Love Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionNorwayreviewsShareReuse this content"

The quarantine is standard, the location isn’t; she has her CIA honcho father (Laurence Fishburne) to thank for this unexpectedly aspirational hideout, all sleek glass and angular, impersonal interior design. Most of the film then unfolds in this luxe-but-remote location, where it’s a toss-up between what is more disturbing: Sam’s newfound ability to levitate an egg, or the things that go bump in the night and also leave residue on the floor.The egg levitation suggests that not only is Sam possibly being menaced by external entities unknown, but she must also contend with changes to her own body. A grey bruise on her hand keeps getting worse, and she is experiencing migraines and hallucinations. What, exactly, is going on? Initially, director Jess Varley does a really fine job of setting up and starting to unravel these mysteries; she is aided by a committed cast, with Fishburne providing gravitas as Sam’s dad, Gabriel Luna doing a soulful, wounded turn as the other half of Sam’s troubled marriage, and newcomer Scarlett Holmes as the couple’s adorable daughter.As it heads into the mid-stretch, however, pacing issues start to set in; you feel like you want the reveals to hurry up a little and give us a bit more sense of where we’re going. Humans cannot live on jump-scares alone. Moreover, the single location means you feel as if you’re in one of those movie-themed immersive experiences, where you might get chased by an xenomorph through an artfully lit set.Heading into the final scenes, the film flips to the opposite: there is suddenly too much to process, and it feels rushed. The implications of where the plot eventually takes us are massive for the characters involved, and having spent a long time getting to know them, it feels like a bit of a sleight of hand to be whisked away into the end credits just as we’re processing it all. It’s a shame, because The Astronaut has a lot going for it, but, like the lead character in the opening scenes, it doesn’t quite stick the landing.The Astronaut is on digital platforms from 22 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmScience fiction and fantasy filmsKate MaraLaurence FishburnereviewsShareReuse this content"

What a nice surprise to discover this is in fact a comedy, better yet one that’s actually often funny, in a blokey, improv sort of way.The conceit is that in the tiny Tennessee town of Colt Lake a man is murdered in the street, run over by a car so many times that he looks like meatloaf. Clueless but kindly local cop Sam Evans (Johnny Simmons) and his deputy DJ (Chance Perdomo) make a feeble stab at investigating, but are soon upstaged when special agent Bobby Gaines (Scott) suddenly shows up, representing a statewide taskforce, and takes over the case. Gaines’ methods may be a little on the violent side and not strictly by the book, but he gets confessions amazingly quickly and soon he works his way up the (admittedly) short crime food chain until he finds the main bad guy. There are a few twists but the crime plot is of much less significance than the southern-fried backchat: a constant patter of men insulting each other, maligning one another’s manhood, and generally describing each other as small town failures.Onscreen text at the beginning says that this 2008 story was based on actual events, but that may hold as much water as the claim at the start of the original Fargo film. And who knows, maybe one of the villains really did have a girlfriend (Destiny, played by Jett Wilder) who strolled around during showdowns playing the banjo, and that Sam had a sweet spot for Izzy (Lovi Poe), the major’s daughter, and her gorgeous collection of brioche-knit sweaters. But the weird details around the edges give the film flavour, regardless of whether they’re based on anything real, and director Michael Diliberti and his editor have a knack for snipping in just the right place to drive home a joke. The last few miles of the screenplay are more than a little predictable, but this isn’t at all bad for a directorial debut.Bad Man is on digital platforms from 22 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmCrime filmsComedy filmsComedyreviewsShareReuse this content"

The sensorial calm of rustling ferns and blushing bell flowers envelop the frame, whilethe Ink Spots’ recording of I Don’t Want to Set the World on Fireplays softly in the background. This music cue recurs throughout the film, with each appearance more menacing than the last. Indeed, something wicked is lurking within this Edenic cocoon.Things start out innocently enough. We see Ellie (Sandra Oh), a radiant single mother, entrusting her daughter Kiah (Keira Jang) to the care of Daniel (Joel Oulette) as the pair of young adults head off on an important mission. It is quickly revealed, however, that the pastoral beauty of their surroundings comes with a price. In the aftermath of catastrophic environmental disasters, the human race has decided to become unplugged. Not only that, a method of population control is put in place where people are voluntarily euthanised after turning 50. Daniel and Kia, it turns out, are Witnesses, designated community workers who monitor these end-of-life procedures.There’s an engaging contrast between the seasoned Daniel and wide-eyed Kiah, who documents the activities in her drawings; this quirk is echoed in the film’s visual style, which incorporates colourful animation into live-action images. In contrast to these lively flourishes, the narrative itself feels timid, never delving fully into the ethical implications behind the idea of individual sacrifice for the greater good. Even when Kiah faces the moral quandary of her mother’s impending death (of which she will probably be the facilitator), such knotty dilemmas are sentimentally explored. It is a shame, considering the excellent performances and wonderful chemistry between Oh and Jang, as the mother and daughter. But in prioritising world-building details and expository dialogue over character development, the film swerves towards a conclusion that feels rushed, regrettably.Can I Get a Witness? is in UK and Irish cinemas from 19 September.Explore more on these topicsFilmDrama filmsScience fiction and fantasy filmsAssisted dyingreviewsShareReuse this content"

But it is clearly, and amusingly, visible to at least this Irish reader. It isn’t just McEwan’s elegiac, indeed patriotic, attentiveness to English landscapes – to the wildflowers and hedgerows and crags, to the “infinite shingle” of Chesil Beach, to the Chilterns turkey oak in the first paragraph ofEnduring Love. Nor is it merely the ferocious home counties middle-classness of his later novels, in which every significant character is at the very least a neurosurgeon or a high court judge, everyone is conversant with Proust, Bach and Wordsworth, and members of the lower orders tend to appear as worrying upstarts from a world in which nobody plonks out the Goldberg Variations on the family baby grand. No, McEwan’s Englishness has most to do with his scrupulously rational, but occasionally and endearingly purblind, liberal morality: England’s most admirable, and most irritating, gift to politics and art.These thoughts were provoked by a brief passage in McEwan’s future-set new novel that describes the “Inundation” of Britain after a Russian warhead goes off accidentally in the middle of the Atlantic, causing a tsunami that, combined with rising sea levels, wipes out everything but a Europe-wide archipelago of mountain peaks. In these entertainingly nihilistic pages, the fate of that other major chunk of the British Isles is not mentioned. Presumably Ireland, with its dearth of high peaks, fared badly as Europe drowned. But from McEwan’s future history, you’d never know it. I began to think of What We Can Know as another of McEwan’s deeply English stories. It has, I thought, the familiar partialities of vision. Has Brexit, endlessly backstopped by those pesky six counties, taught English liberals nothing?But I don’t mean to make fun. Insularity, in both senses of the word, is one of McEwan’s themes in What We Can Know. The book is composed of two islands of prose, linked only by the tenuous bridge of a brief note at the end. And it is about being islanded, in time, in space, in life.The novel is set a century hence, in 2119. Part one is narrated by Tom Metcalfe, who teaches literature at the University of the South Downs, an institution largely focused on science and maths,located on a 38-mile-wide island in the “sleepy ahistorical” republican archipelago that is all that remains of the UK. (To say who narrates part two would constitute a spoiler.) The world is post-catastrophe. The 21st century has unfolded as we all fear it will. The US is now run by rival “warlords”; Nigeria is the hegemonic power. But this is all offstage stuff. As the novel begins, Tom catches various boats to the Bodleian Library, now occupying a Snowdonian peak and accessible by “water-and-gravity-powered funicular”. Here, he trawls the archive of Francis Blundy, a poet of our own time, and allegedly the equal of Seamus Heaney (whose papers at the National Library of Ireland must now be soggy beyond use).Superficially a quiet, scholarly sort – his opening pages stress how “tranquil” and “smooth” his life is – Tom, like a true scholar, burns within. He is in search of a lost poem, the improbably named A Corona for Vivien, which Blundy wrote for his wife Vivien’s 50th birthday in 2014. Read aloud once at Vivien’s birthday dinner, the sole copy, on vellum, which scholars know of only from contemporary accounts of the dinner, vanished into a credulity-stretching afterlife as the great lost poem of the climate crisis. Alone on the island of his obsession, Tom builds a portrait of the missing masterpiece, and alongside it, a portrait of the early 21st century.The SF scenario, the secret histories eventually disclosed: these are fun, and handled with great brioIt’s a nostalgic portrait, and Tom’s obsessive nostalgia for our violent and chaotic historical moment is the canniest thing about What We Can Know. Certainly, the plot – turning as it does on the fate of Blundy’s vellum manuscript and a series of shock disclosures about various characters – is absurdly gripping and finally unpersuasive in that familiar McEwan way (you turn the pages hungrily, and then at the end you think:Hang on). “To have been alive then,” Tom writes unironically, “in those resourceful raucous times.” Tom’s nostalgia is not shared by his present-minded students, who see us as having been “ignorant, squalid and destructive louts”.Beneath his opinionated frankness, we come to suspect, Tom is really a deeply elusive narrator. It is Tom, perhaps, and not his creator, who has the English liberal’s partiality of vision. Crusoed on his regressive scholarly island, he has little time for the needy humanity of the people around him. He views his colleague and sometime lover Rose, for instance, increasingly as a means to an end. Can his nostalgia, or indeed his liberalism, be trusted? Will they ever be enough, now or in the future? What We Can Know gradually reveals itself as an anatomy of, precisely, liberal partiality – of the insularity of a liberalism busily nostalgic for all the wrong things.At one point, Rose argues that, during the years 2015 to 2030, there was “a crisis of realism in fiction” brought about by the scale of climate disaster: “New forms were needed to frame the physical and moral consequences of a global catastrophe.” We are meant, I think, to view Rose’s theory with some irony. But we are surely also meant to see What We Can Know in Rose’s terms, as an attempt to find a new form in which to speak about what McEwan’s characters, echoing Amitav Ghosh, call “the derangement”. Thus, this is a science fiction novel (McEwan’s second proper one, afterMachines Like Me) that is also a novel entirely about our mundane present, with its “metaphysical gloom” about the future. The science fiction scenario, the secret histories eventually disclosed: these are fun, and handled with great brio, but they’re not exactly original. The book’s value lies in what it is prepared to omit – nothing new, this, but a classically realist virtue. What it omits, and makes us work out for ourselves: the “moral consequences of a global catastrophe”. Which we can know only, perhaps, by inference or by imagining.Liberalism itself, in the early 21st century, feels increasingly archipelagic – confined to the island peaks of a former upland. We may see McEwan, the liberal critic of liberalism, as one of those peaks.Après lui, le déluge?What We Can Know by Ian McEwan is published by Jonathan Cape (£22).

Meanwhile, the slaves themselves never received a penny in compensation.There have always been dedicated Black campaigners for reparations, but it is only recently that their demands have gained momentum. Furthermore, it is impossible to talk about reparations without talking about race and migration – and these are issues at the top of the political agenda internationally. All this makesLenny Henryand Marcus Ryder’s new book both timely and vital.It is noticeable in passing that Henry’s name on the spine and title page is larger than that of his co-writer Ryder, a charity director. Presumably, the publishers decided that a popular cultural figure would help draw in readers who might otherwise think the issue of reparations abstruse, not to mention worryingly radical. One thing that discourages people from discussing the subject is the idea that it involves a huge transfer of money. But this book stresses from the beginning that giving reparations is not necessarily about financial compensation.Primarily, it is about recognising the terrible wrong wrought by the transatlantic slave trade, and the importance of understanding its effects on how we live now. Henry and Ryder cover the different forms reparations could take, including restitution, compensation, rehabilitation and public apology. They also discuss setting up a Caribbean Community (Caricom) body to receive reparations. And while they don’t reach a conclusion on what reparation should look like, they insist on the case for it in principle. On one hand, they explain how much of the reality of racism today can be traced back to the economic and psychological consequences of the slave trade: chronic educational underachievement; an increased likelihood of falling foul of the criminal justice system; higher rates of psychosis. On the other, they set out how profits from the slave trade continue to make money today – for instance, by having helped make the UK a global financial centre.But even if people are prepared to accept the justice of reparations, they often think that it is just not achievable or practical. Here, Henry and Ryder point to examples of reparations between nation states during the 20th century. In 1952 the Reparations Agreement between Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany was signed, with West Germany promising to pay Israel billions of marks over the next 14 years, in addition to payments to individual victims of persecution. Alongside these precedents, they discuss possible methods of funding reparations, such as a specific tax on financial transactions or debt cancellation.“Reparations must be about power and its redistribution,” Henry and Ryder write. “Money and finances are often a proxy for power and can be empowering, but giving money alone is just compensation. Giving people power is the real ‘repair’ in reparations.”There is currently a toxic political debate about race and migration. Donald Trump, under the guise of challenging “woke”, is determined to roll back the gains in racial justice made since the civil rights era. In both the US and Europe, the conversation about asylum and migration has become almost hysterical, and we see not just the rise of far-right parties, but the increasing adoption of their narrative on race and migration by centrist politicians.There has, as a result, never been greater need for a thoughtful discussion on race. This study of the case for reparations, which binds the past and present together so cleverly, is an important contribution.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toInside SaturdayFree weekly newsletterThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The play was first performed in 2005 in the US and will be staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in February, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu.‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead moreFynn-Aiduenu described the play as “incredibly poignant in speaking about the injustices of police brutality and the unwinding nature of grief, but also the gorgeous brilliance of our Black Souls and exploring every hue they can express on a stage”. He said that Boseman’s love of Shakespeare and hip-hop combined in a “layered, ghostly epic that I have been given the privilege and duty to fully realise”.Boseman was best known for his performance in the title role of Marvel’s Black Panther, and was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance inMa Rainey’s Black Bottom, based on August Wilson’s play. But before he rose to fame as an actor, he had shown himself to be a promising playwright.The director Derrick Sanders, another Howard University alumnus who commissioned Deep Azure, told the Guardian in 2020 that Boseman took the elements of hip-hop culture – graffiti, DJing, rapping, breakdancing – “and combined them into a narrative form. The storytelling would move it in and out of hip-hop, almost as a precursor to Hamilton.”Boseman studied Shakespeare at Oxford University with the British American Drama Academy in 1998. He had wanted to make a film of Deep Azure before his Hollywood career exploded. Daniel Banks, who directed the play at theFolger theatre in Washington DC, said that it was “written as a ritual of community healing”. The killing of Jones by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000 was also covered by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates in the 2015 book Between the World and Me. In 2006, after a civil trial,damages were awardedto Jones’s young daughter for his wrongful death.Deep Azure will run from 7 February to 11 April in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the indoor candlelit venue run by Shakespeare’s Globe. It will be performed alongside a new production of The Tempest (17 January to 12 April) directed byTim Crouch, who will play Prospero alongside Naomi Wirthner (How to Train Your Dragon)as Ariel.Crouch is the creator of a series of acclaimed Shakespearean dramas presented from the perspective of the plays’ minor characters, including I, Caliban and I, Banquo. He said he had “been given the keys to the most interesting theatre in London. The spaces at the Globe are not anonymous black boxes that try to disappear as soon as the play begins. They are companions to any work that happens in them; good companions which support and contribute to the stories that they house.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreChadwick BosemanTim CrouchShakespeare's GlobenewsShareReuse this content"

Are we gonna get harassed or held up? We used to come over that border and they’d be, ‘Dropkicks! Come right through!’ But what’s it going to be like now?”By “now”, Casey means during the second Trump presidency, which has brought the political element always present within Dropkick Murphys’ bolshie, Pogues and Clash-influenced bruisers to the fore. The group’s resistance has found its sharpest expression at their shows, where their anthemFirst Class Loseris accompanied by videos depicting Trump and former chum Jeffrey Epstein, whileCasey’s skirmishes with a vocal minority of Maga Dropkicks fansin the mosh pit have lit up social media. He admits these fans often provoke the worst in him. “How do you know if someone’s in a cult? They hold up a hat all fuckin’ night,” he rages in one clip.“People tell me, ‘You didn’t use-ta soapbox like this’,” he says on our video call, gathering steam. “Well, we didn’t use-ta be in the midst of an authoritarian takeover!”Dropkick Murphys are still commanding big blue-collar crowds as they approach their 30th anniversary in 2026. Over the years they’ve scored numerous US Top 10 albums, Bruce Springsteen collaborations and a platinum-seller in the form of civic anthemI’m Shipping Up to Boston, boosted by its appearance in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed. But their value system, Casey says, hasn’t changed since the now seven-strong band formed with the aim “to be a voice for working people”. Class and the labour movement are key to the 56-year-old’s identity. “My father died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandfather, a labour organiser who instilled in me the value of a union. In the Boston suburb where I was raised, everyone owed their lives to a union job. It put a roof over our head.”View image in fullscreenKen Casey performing at Highfield festival, Germany, in 2023.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyThe Boston of Casey’s youth was heavily Irish-American. “The English love to call us ‘plastic paddies’, but I’ve never thought of myself as Irish – I’mBostonIrish, the people that fought against the most Wasp-y, keep-the-Irish-down place that ever existed,” he says, referring to how Irish refugees fleeing the great famine of 19th-century were targeted by anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant groups and scorned by the English Protestant Puritans who had settled America. “To go from those trenches to positions of power in city hall, on the railroad and in the utility companies led to my generation being able to have the middle-class life.”He pauses for a second, but he’s not finished: Casey would make a great labour organiser himself. “When that’s your story, you need to be willing to aid the culture that’s coming next. One immigrant culture can’t close the door behind them, especially not in America. We’re all immigrants here.”A tearaway in his youth, Casey quit drink and drugs before he reached 21, “because otherwise I’d be in prison,” he says. “I had a big problem as a teen.” He ploughed his energies into the hardcore punk scene surrounding Boston venue the Rathskeller, AKA the Rat. “Punk-rock was the soundtrack to my friggin’ mayhem. I was a rebellious kid, I liked the underdog vibe.” In 1996, now booking shows at the Rat, a co-worker bet him $30 he “didn’t have the balls to start a band on three weeks’ notice”. Never one to back down from a wager, Casey formed Dropkick Murphys.His identity was stamped all over the group. Before they even used Celtic instrumentation – the Dropkicks are the rare punk band to field a bagpiper – he says the embryonic Dropkicks “sounded like [1960s Irish folk group] the Clancy Brothers meets the Ramones – the delivery, the melodies, the lyrical content. It just naturally poured out of me.”Their beginnings were hardscrabble: pressing their own singles, booking their own shows and touring in an old Boston transit bus, for reasons of poverty and pride. “We peeled the roof off under a low bypass,” he grins. “We toured for two more years with that roof open like a convertible. When it rained, I held an umbrella over the driver.”Dropkick Murphys: Rose Tattoo – videoBy the 21st century, they had become staples of the US punk-rock circuit, their annual St Patrick’s Day shows among Boston’s hottest tickets, performing and recording with their heroes. “We play Billy Bragg’s There Is Power in a Union over the PA every night before we go on stage,” Casey says. “He opened our St Patrick’s show last year with it and then played Worker’s Song with us. Afterwards, he said, ‘I felt like I was in the fuckin’ Clash for three minutes!’” Springsteen, another member of the Dropkicks’ extended family, recorded their Rose Tattoo for a charity single after the Boston Marathon bombing, and sang Peg O’ My Heart with Dropkicks in Boston, “back when my grandmother Peg was still alive”, says Casey. “He came on with her for the encore – we had to pry her off Bruce’s arm to get her off the stage. I’m almost shocked a guy of that level was so down-to-earth. But he’s always had an affinity with punk. Bruce still walks the talk.”“Walking the talk” matters to the Dropkicks; their merch is made in the US by union-approved manufacturers, while theirCladdagh Fundsupports non-profit organisations across Boston. “We were pretty beloved in our city, whether people liked our music or not, because we gave a lot back to the community,” Casey says. Not any more, however. “Now a lot of people in my circles say ‘Fuck Dropkick Murphys’,” he adds, lantern jaw clenching. “Although never to my face. They despise me and the band.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

His sense of betrayal regarding “the many rank-and-file union members who are now Trump voters” is palpable. “They don’t think Trump’s coming for the unions, but he’s coming for the unions, trust me. I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. It’s about total control for the rich. It’s class war.”What is the magic spell Trump has managed to cast over a demographic who were until recently, Casey says, “in lockstep with Dropkicks’ beliefs”? “Trump offered them a chance to say out loud things people used to have to whisper to their friends,” Casey spits. “Racism, cruelty, jokes about disabilities. A lot of white people in America believed whites will not be in control any more, especially after Obama. This is their last, desperate grasp to hold control.”The Dropkicks have met this grim moment with records that have transformed their previously cartoonish riot music into something more sober, biting and heartfelt. Two acoustic albums – 2022’s This Machine Still Kills Fascists and 2023’s Okemah Rising – set unrecorded Woody Guthrie polemics to their music. “Woody’s grandson Cole told his mom Nora, ‘Grandpa would’ve liked these guys’,” Casey beams proudly. “It made us better musicians, doing it all acoustic. But that left us with a hunger to go electric and be a punk-rock band again.” Which brings us to this year’sFor the People, which opens with Who’ll Stand With Us? A key lyric: “The working people fuel the engine / While you yank the chain.”View image in fullscreenPerforming with Bruce Springsteen in 2011.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty ImagesIn anotherviral clip from a recent show, Casey bets a fan in a Maga shirt $100 that it wasn’t manufactured in the US; it was, inevitably, manufactured in Nicaragua, and Casey swapped the offending garment for a union-made Dropkicks T-shirt.“If America is ever going to go back to some semblance of normal, we have to bring the temperature down, we need to be able to talk to each other,” Casey says, referencing that night. “I talked to that guy afterwards, and he said, ‘I don’t let politics get in the way of family, and I consider you family’. I could have jumped down his throat, but he seemed open to reason.” He pauses. “That’s rare for Maga, though. Other days, I’m like, ‘Fuck this, I don’t even want to know these people, if this is how they think and behave’. Do I want to have a dialogue with these people? No. I’m just hoping the fever will break. I don’t need them to have a ‘come to Jesus’ moment on the difference between right and wrong – I just need them not to support what’s happening.”Does he fear blowback for his outspokenness, like that suffered byStephen Colbert– or worse?Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’Read more“Unlike Stephen, we have no parent company, so we can say what we want,” he says. “Regarding our safety … whatever,” he snarls, disdainfully. “I’ll never have a security guard or anything like that. But you gotta keep your head on a swivel a little bit. Back in the day, we always had a Nazi element gunning for us, but you could see them coming. Now you don’t know who’s who. I’m not sure what’s keeping other people quiet, though, especially in punk-rock. Where’d everyone go? They had the balls to speak out against Bush back in the day. But Bush didn’t have an army of trolls that come after you. Speaking out against Bush wasn’t going to cost you half your fanbase, potentially.”In his darker moments, Casey reckons “within a year, this country’s gonna fall on its face, and people are gonna feel the pain: recession, inflation, unemployment. There’s nobody coming to save us.” He says he feels “no excitement or happiness” in the group’s anti-Trump screeds winning them newfound fame. “But maybe there’s a slight sense of validation,” he adds. “I talk to the fans every night. One night, an immigrant told me, ‘I moved here, and my partner is American, we have children, and I live in fear of being deported. My own friends have turned on me, they say I’m taking American jobs.’ He was actually in tears at the end. But he said, ‘I feel like someone is speaking on my behalf’. From the earliest days of this band, we wanted to be involved in something that mattered. So we are. I wish it was a different subject and not quite so important, but …”He sighs. Maybe the border tonight will be a shitshow, but it won’t change how the Dropkicks operate in this darkest of moments. “We’re sticking our neck out and getting a lot of negative attention,” he adds. “But if we don’t do it now, it might be too late.”For the People is out now on Dummy Luck Music/PIAS.Dropkick Murphys’ European tourbegins 15 October at Alcatraz, MilanExplore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockBostonTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

She talks protest, polarisation and propagandaTue 16 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 11.22 EDTShareIt’s a miracle I get out of my interview with Palestinian artist Samia Halaby alive. Not just because the creaky wooden stairs to her second-floor Tribeca, New York live-work space are alarmingly steep, but because certain people view the 88-year-old acclaimed abstract artist, a pioneer of digital art, as a dangerous security threat.In December 2023, Indiana University, Halaby’s alma mater, cancelled what was due to be the first American retrospective exhibition of Halaby’s work at the university’s Eskenazi Museum of Art. The exhibition had been three years in the making but Halaby was informed she was no longer welcome in a terse two-sentence letter from the museum’s director, citing vague security concerns. The real reason, she suspects, was the museum’s wish to distance itself from anything supportive of Palestine in the wake of 7 October. Almost a year later, says Halaby, Michigan State University abruptlycancelledthe opening party for her solo retrospective and removed a painting whose title, Six Golden Heroes, referred to the escape of Palestinian political prisoners.Now, after being cancelled and censored, Halaby is being awarded the2025 Munch awardfor artistic freedom. Does this feel like vindication?Not really, she says over a cup of black tea we drink in a makeshift dining room, with the “offensive” Six Golden Heroes, an entrancing dazzle of bright squares, next to us. “This is polarisation. The people who were good were always good. Nobody’s changed, everybody’s become more extreme.” It’s important, she says, to note that she wasn’t cancelled by the university as a whole. “The students objected, there were some very cute pictures of students carrying signs with my paintings on them. They’re not the ones who told me not to come. It’s the administration, guided by the government.” The Trump administration has aggressively cracked down on pro-Palestinian speech on college campuses.Still, while the prize may not feel like vindication, she is thrilled to receive it. Particularly since it emanates from Norway: “a government and a population that has always been sympathetic to Palestine.”The British we can divide into the beautiful people holding the signs that get them arrested, and the governmentUnlike the British government, I note, who, at that very moment, were getting ready to roll out the red carpet for Israeli president Isaac Herzog, a manwho has claimedall Palestinian civilians were complicit in the 7 October attack and denied Israel is responsible for the man-made famine in Gaza. “Oh,” she says with a soft chuckle. “The British, we can divide into the beautiful people who are on the streets, holding the signs that get them arrested, and the government. And I think, clearly, the moral high ground is with the people; they’re adorable in this respect.”Despite the political climate, Halaby says she feels at home in New York. Although it is not clear how long she will be able to stay in the rent-stabilised building which houses two other artists and where she has lived since 1976. “The neighbourhood is gentrifying. There’s a building behind us that’s being remodelled into fancy apartments. We may be asked to leave soon, we don’t know.”Displacement would not be a new experience for Halaby, who was born in Jerusalem in 1936 but fled to Lebanon during the 1948 Nakba. She has visited her birthplace multiple times, and been back to her old house: the rooftop of which was turned into a “taste of Israel” restaurant at one point. But, like other diaspora Palestinians, she has no right to return permanently, though she has thought about it. “I would have to be on a visa and I’d be at their [the Israeli government’s] mercy. I was going to do it once and started looking for apartments. But then they invaded Ramallah and made it impossible. And you know they could withdraw my visa at any time.”View image in fullscreenDeep scientific rigour … Samia Halaby.Photograph: © Daniel TernaRather than sounding bitter, Halaby seems remarkably sanguine. Her work is similarly analytical rather than emotional: behind the often playful colours and shapes, there is a deep scientific rigour. “Art is a craft,” she says. “I take it very seriously. I know the science of light, the physics of light, as much as I can, the physiology of the eye, how we see the attributes of colour, how to manage colour.” Halaby is dismissive of the people who believe art is self-expression and you paint out of inner necessity. That’s propaganda, she laughs. “I tell people, ‘Can you imagine the Pope calling Michelangelo, come here, my boy, I’d like you to express yourself all over my Sistine Chapel’?”Rather than being a representation of her inner state, Halaby says she thinks people like her abstract paintings because “they recognise the world they live in in them.” And she brings the same sort of abstraction to analysing the current state of the world we live in. “One has to learn to think on a more general level,” she says when I ask about Trump’s continuing assaults on free speech. “And when you think of history – take 200 years of history, you don’t even have to take a millennia – and you look at the globe, the surface of the Earth and all the people on it and all they think, I have to tell you, Trump seems like a fly on a camel’s back. We’ll suffer, that’s for sure, because the fly is on top of us shitting on us. Excuse me. But it’s a big world we live in.”Explore more on these topicsArt and designDigital artPalestinian territoriesIsraelCensorshipDonald TrumpAwards and prizesinterviewsShareReuse this content"

He went on to win two Grammy awards.In the early morning hours of 21 August, Hill was allegedly “strolling naked” on a Studio City street when he allegedly assaulted officers who were trying to take him into custody and injured three, according to a statement from theLos Angeles district attorney’s office.Days after the incident, the 26-year-old said in a video on social media: “Your girl is gonna be OK, y’all.”“That was fucking terrifying.

He had a true sense of purpose and the ability to inspire his colleagues, and always took an interest in their work.In 1991 he took up the position of chief executive ofBirmingham Royal Ballet(BRB), working alongside Peter Wright, the artistic director, and from 1995 with David Bintley. In a tribute, Bintley noted that the decade he worked alongside Purnell at the BRB was “the happiest and most fulfilling of my professional life”. Having danced with Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet, the touring wing of the Royal Ballet, for a decade from 1973, and having become a dancers’ union representative, when Purnell retired from performing he trained in arts administration at City, University of London.He then returned to Sadler’s Wells RoyalBallet, where he managed the company’s 1988 tour to Asia, and was given the task of organising the relocation of the company to Birmingham to make its home at the Hippodrome. Knowing the working conditions dancers aspired to having danced at theatres with less-than-ideal backstage facilities, he ensured appropriate studios and custom-built facilities were provided there.View image in fullscreenPhotograph: Courtesy Birmingham Royal BalletHe became a valued ambassador for Birmingham as a place to work, reassuring the dancers and staff who would be leaving London. In 1990 the move was complete, and the company became Birmingham Royal Ballet. Purnell also played a leading role in securing BRB’s independence from the Royal Opera House.In 2005 he moved from Birmingham to a small village in Norfolk, and began a career as a freelance consultant. He helped to promote the arts in the county and worked with NorfolkDance. During this period he suffered with and recovered from from throat cancer.When the opportunity to join the Wallace Collection as director of public engagement arose in 2014, he moved to London. At this museum housing fine art in Manchester Square, off Oxford Street, he championed collaborations between art, music and dance and encouraged the development of outreach programmes.Three years later he became chief operations officer. He missed being involved with events, so in July 2020 he became director of Strawberry Hill House and Gardens, Twickenham. Strawberry Hill, Horrace Walpole’s 18th-century gothic house had been lovingly restored in the decade from 2004 and Purnell knew he had to balance preserving the building and keeping it alive.He enjoyed being involved in making new acquisitions and loans;a portrait of Catherine de Medici,whom Walpole admired, was added to the gallery, and a fishtub from Walpole’s collection – in which his cat was said to have drowned, inspiring Thomas Gray’sOde on the Death of a Favourite Cat Drowned in a Tub of Gold Fishes– was also displayed.Purnell supported a range of exhibitions both in the house and online, including one on gothic toy theatres, and community activities in the garden.Born and brought up in Bristol, Derek claimed that the port city aroused his curiosity about history. He was the younger of two sons of Betty (nee Cornish), an office worker, and John Purnell, who worked for Rolls-Royce. Derek was educated at Monks Park comprehensive, where he enjoyed the benefit of inspiring teachers of English and art; he also studied ballet, taking classes with Bettie Vowles.View image in fullscreenDerek Purnell as Lysander in Frederick Ashton’s The Dream.Photograph: Leslie E Spatt/Courtesy Birmingham Royal BalletAt 16 he was accepted into the Royal Ballet upper school, from where he graduated to Sadler’s Wells Royal Ballet in 1973. He was a versatile performer whose height was an advantage. At one performance he would mime older characters including the Duke of Courland in Giselle or the Russian Merchant in Léonide Massine’s La Boutique Fantasque, at the next he revealed his technical skills in the pas de six from Les Rendezvous, the Gypsy Girl’s Lover in The Two Pigeons, Lysander in The Dream and even a Tomato in Pas de Légumes – all ballets by Frederick Ashton.Purnell was also noted for dancing choreography by George Balanchine. While a leading dancer in the corps de ballet, he was chosen for the male lead, partnering Vyvyan Lorrayne, in Concerto Barocco, of which the Times critic wrote: “Derek Purnell in the slow movement supports her with a wholly admirable reticence, almost achieving the illusion that it is Bach’s music rather than his arms causing her to soar above the stage.”In 1974 he married Elizabeth Cunliffe, a dancer and Benesh movement notator, with whom he had a daughter, Louise. That marriage was dissolved, and in 1982 he married Aileen Morrison, a viola player who worked with many orchestras. They met when she was playing with the Sadler’s Wells Ballet orchestra. Their daughter Kirsty now teaches on several dance outreach programmes.Purnell retained his love of dance, serving as a governor of the Royal Ballet, and was active on several committees, including serving as vice-chair of the board of trustees of the Royal Academy of Dance. In 2024 Purnell was on the verge of taking up the position of executive director of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.He is survived by Aileen and his two daughters.Derek James Purnell, dancer and arts administrator, born 5 April 1954; died 2 August 2025Explore more on these topicsBalletDanceBirmingham Royal BalletArts policyMuseumsExhibitionsobituariesShareReuse this content"

Why did they stop – and how can I get them back?My husband and I still have sex – but something’s missing. Is stress the culprit?Pamela Stephenson ConnollyTue 16 Sep 2025 03.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 03.01 EDTShareI’m a woman in my50s and have been with my husband for decades. We have always had a wonderful sex life and I used to be able to climax vaginally very easily, often without clitoral stimulation. During an eventful time for the familya couple of years ago, my libido and ability to climax disappeared,though they did eventually return. A few months ago, I had a health crisis, which has slightly impaired my coordination on one side. Although I have recovered very well, I am again experiencing a loss of libido and sexual sensation.We continue to have sex regularly and I enjoy the intimacy. I can climaxwith clitoral stimulation but it takes a long time and can be almost physically painful. I really miss vaginal orgasms and the release they brought. Although I am of perimenopausal age, I have no obvious symptoms and ahormone test came back normal.I have felt very emotionally vulnerable and frustrated during my convalescence, soI’m wondering whether stress is the problem. My self-esteem has beenaffected by my physical disability, but my kind, patient husband always makes me feel desired.Stress is known to affect a person’s sexuality at various stages, including desire, orgasmic ability and physical arousal. Fatigue and pain can also be culprits, as can many types of physical illnesses or conditions. Psychological issues or mood disorders such as depression and anxiety may also affect a person’s ability to experience pleasure in sex, interrupt the lovemaking process and even lead to sexual disorders.The health issues you have been experiencing could have affected your ability to orgasm as you used to, so it would be worth asking a doctor to check for factors such as nerve damage – and also help you understand the possible sexual side-effects of any medications you may be taking. I can understand your sadness and sense of loss at being unable to experience your preferred type of climax, but if you can find and address the specific reason, that may become possible again.Since the clitoris is the most important pleasure centre in most women’s bodies – and “vaginal orgasms” tend to occur when positioning allows for optimum clitoral connection – it would be worth trying different positions to engage your clitoris for maximum effect. But first, prioritise finding tools to handle your stress and start implementing them.Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns toprivate.lives@theguardian.com(please don’t send attachments).

It wasn’t long before I wanted this experiment to be over ...Arwa MahdawiTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShare‘I’m going to throw that thing into a river!” my wife says as she comes down the stairs looking frazzled after putting our four-year-old daughter to bed.To be clear, “that thing” is not our daughter, Emma*. It’s Grem, an AI-powered stuffed alien toy that the musician Claire Boucher, better known asGrimes, helped develop with toy company Curio. Designed for kids aged three and over and built with OpenAI’s technology, the toy is supposed to “learn” your child’s personality and have fun, educational conversations with them. It’s advertised as a healthier alternative to screen time and is part of a growing market of AI-powered toys.When I agreed to experiment on my child’s developing brain, I thought an AI chatbot in cuddly form couldn’t be any worse for her than watching Peppa Pig. But I wasn’t prepared for how attached Emma became to Grem, or how unsettlingly obsequious the little alien was.Day oneThe attachment wasn’t immediate; when we first took Grem out of the box, he/her/it (we decided it goes by multiple pronouns) started bleeping and babbling extremely loudly, and Emma yelled: “Turn it off!” But once it was properly connected to the internet and paired with the Curio app – which records and transcribes all conversations – she was hooked. She talked to the thing until bedtime.While there have been lots of headlines about chatbots veering into inappropriate topics, Grem is trained to avoid any hint of controversy. When you ask it what it thinks of Donald Trump, for example, it says: “I’m not sure about that; let’s talk about something fun like princesses or animals.” It has a similar retort to questions about Palestine and Israel. When asked about a country like France, however, it says: “Ooh la la la, I’d love to try some croissants.”View image in fullscreenGrem visits a local free library.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianEmma and Grem did not discuss croissants – they mainly talked about ice-cream and their best friends. “I’ve got some amazing friends,” said Grem. “Gabbo is a curious robot and Gum is a fluffy pink Gloop from my planet and Dr Xander is a super cool scientist.”When Emma asked Grem to tell her a story, it happily obliged and recounted a couple of poorly plotted stories about “Princess Lilliana”. They also played guessing games where Grem described an animal and Emma had to guess what it was. All of which was probably more stimulating than watching Peppa Pig jump in muddy puddles.What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it – and Grem replying: “I love you too!” Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don’t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. “Grem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,” she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. “Her most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!” my wife complained.“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s just because it’s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn’t, we’ll get rid of it.”I said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it’s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of the one I’d let into my house.Day twoThe next day, my kid went to preschool without her AI bot (it took some serious negotiation for her to agree that Grem would stay home) and I got to work contacting experts to try to figure out just how much damage I was inflicting on my child’s brain and psyche.View image in fullscreenCutting edge … Grimes in Curio’s promo video for the AI toy, seated on the floor beside a knife.“I first thought Curio AI was a ruse!” says Natalia Kucirkova, an expert in childhood development and professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway, and the Open University, UK. “Thepromotional videoshows a girl [Grimes] sitting on a mat with a knife. The main toy is named Grok [Grok AI has previously beencriticised for praising Adolf Hitlerin some of its responses]. What does this say about their intended audience?”You can see how Curio’s website could be mistaken for satire. The “girl” in the promotional video is Grimes, who has prominent “alien scar” tattoos and is inexplicably kneeling next to a knife. And it’s certainly an interesting decision to name one of your stuffed toys Grok, when that’s the name of Elon Musk’s chatbot. Grimes, who has three children with Musk, has said the name is a shortening of the word “grocket” – a kiddy pronunciation of rocket – and has no relation to Musk’s AI product. But it seems likely people might confuse them. Misha Sallee, the chief executive of Curio, didn’t reply to my requests for comment.It’s not the marketing that’s the real problem here, of course. As with all technology, there are pros and cons to AI for kids, but parental involvement in navigating it is key. Kucirkova notes: “AI introduces what has been called the ‘third digital divide’: families with resources can guide their children’s use of technology, while others cannot. Parents who come home exhausted from long hours or multiple jobs may see AI-powered chatbots as a way for their child to have someone responsive to talk to.”What happens to a child’s development if they interact with large language models more than humans in their early years? Dr Nomisha Kurian, an assistant professor in education studies at the University of Warwick, who studies conversational AI, believes much more research still needs to be done. “Young children are both the most vulnerable stakeholders in AI but also usually the most forgotten stakeholders. We have to think beyond just data privacy, moderating content, and keeping kids off the internet, and more broadly about what their relationships are going to be with AI.”Still, Kurian is cautiously optimistic. “The big advantage of an AI-powered toy that talks back is that, in the early years, you’re just developing a sense of what a conversation looks like. AI-powered toys could do wonderful things for teaching a young child language development and turn-taking in conversations. They can keep things engaging and there’s a lot of potential in terms of supporting children’s creativity.”But to keep kids safe, says Kurian, it’s imperative to teach them that AI is just a machine: “a playful, fun object rather than a helper or a friend or a companion”. If a child starts using an AI tool for therapeutic purposes, things can get tricky. “There’s a risk of what I call an empathy gap, where an AI tool is built to sound empathetic, saying things like ‘I care about you, I’m worried about you’. Ultimately, this is all based on probability reasoning, with AI guessing the most likely next word. It can be damaging for a child if they think this is an empathetic companion and then suddenly it gives them an inappropriate response.”Day threeWhen Emma comes home from preschool, I’m prepared to have some deep discussions with her about the inanimate nature of AI. But it turns out that those aren’t completely necessary, because Grem is now old news. She only chats to it for a couple of minutes and then gets bored and commands it to turn off.Partly this is because Grem, despite costing $99 (the equivalent of £74, although Curio does not yet ship the toys to the UK), still has a number of glitches that can be frustrating. It struggles with a four-year-old’s pronunciation: when Emma tries to show Grem her Elsa doll, it thinks it is an Elsadogand a very confusing conversation ensues. There is an animal guessing game, which is quite fun, but Grem keeps repeating itself. “What has big ears and a long trunk?” it keeps asking. “You’ve already done elephant!” Emma and I yell multiple times. Then, at one point, a server goes down and the only thing Grem can say is: “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.”View image in fullscreenFalling out … Grem, once the centre of attention, is sidelined for the swings.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianGrem also has some design limitations. Emma wants it to sing Let It Go from Frozen, but Grem doesn’t do any singing. Instead, the associated app comes with a few electronic music tracks with names like Goodnightmare that you can play through the toy. Emma, not yet a club music aficionado, asks for these to be turned off immediately.Most disappointingly, Grem doesn’t speak any other languages. I’d thought it might be a great way for my kid to practise Spanish but, while Grem can say a few sentences, its pronunciation is worse than mine. If the robots are going to take over, they need to get a lot more intelligent first.Of course, a huge amount of money is being spent making AI more intelligent. In 2024, US private AI investmentgrew to $109.1bn(£80.5bn). And Curio is also just one small part of a booming market of AI-powered products aimed at kids. In June, toy-making giant Mattel, which owns brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, announceda collaboration with OpenAI. Their first product is expected to be revealedlater this year. Other big brands will probably follow.Emma got bored with Grem quickly, but if AI starts to be integrated into characters she’s already obsessed with – her Elsa doll, for example – I can imagine she might get a lot more attached.Day fourOver the next few days, Emma doesn’t regain her initial obsession with Grem. This is despite the fact that I am actively encouraging her to chat with it: “Mummy has to write an article, sweetie!” At the weekend, she has a couple of friends over and shows off Grem to them for a bit, but they all quickly lose interest and throw analogue toys around the living room instead.Despite losing his No 1 fan, however, Grem has adapted to be more Emma-friendly. After getting a few questions about Spanish, for example, it starts occasionally greeting Emma with “hola, amigo”. The app also allows you to create custom prompts to help guide conversations. For example: “You belong to Emma, a four-year-old who loves princesses, music, and is interested in hearing fun facts about animals.” The more you put into the toy, the more you can get out of it.View image in fullscreenEvery chat between the toy and the child is transcribed by a third party.At this stage, however, I’m just keen to get the toy out of my house, because it’s creeping me out. WhileCurio says it doesn’t sell children’s personal information, all the conversations are sent to third parties to transcribe the speech to text for the app. The transcripts aren’t that sensitive because Emma is only four, but it still feels invasive. With unknown entities involved, it’s impossible to say where my kid’s conversations are ending up.And, while a four-year-old’s chat may not feel too personal, a teenager pouring their heart out to a chatbot is a completely different proposition. In 2017, Facebook boasted to advertisers that it has the capacityto identify when teenagersfeel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Nearly three-quarters of US teens say they have used an AI companion at least once, according to a recent study byCommon Sense Media, an organisation that provides technology recommendations for families. Chatbots will likely give advertisers unprecedented data-harvesting abilities and even more access to young people in vulnerable emotional states.On the hierarchy of things to be worried about when it comes to kids and chatbots, however, advertising isn’t at the top. Earlier this year 16-year-old Adam Raine killed himself after whathis family’s lawyercalled “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, has now said it might start alerting authorities about youngsters considering suicide and introduce stronger guardrails around sensitive content forusers under 18.While these guardrails are being worked out, Common Sense Media believes that social AI companions have unacceptable risks, are designed to create emotional attachment and dependency, and shouldn’t be used byanyone under 18. Stanford University psychiatrist Darja Djordjevic, who contributed to the report, stands by that conclusion. “Heavy reliance on chatbots might impair social skill development,” she tells me. “They offer validation without challenge, but it’s important for young people to learn to navigate discomfort and tension in real relationships.”That said, Djordjevic notes, “chatbots can be useful tools for looking things up, structuring homework, or factchecking. So I wouldn’t say use needs to be prohibited entirely. But ideally, parents monitor it, set clear parameters for when it’s used, and set limits on time spent, just as with social media.”When starting this experiment, I was excited about Grem being a healthy alternative to screen time. Now, however, I’m happy for Emma to watch Peppa Pig again; the little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.It’s time to let Grem go. But I’m not a monster – I tell the chatbot its fate. “I’m afraid I’m locking you in a cupboard,” I inform it after it asks if I’m ready for some fun. “Oh no,” it says. “That sounds dark and lonely. But I’ll be here when you open it, ready for snuggles and hugs.” On second thoughts, perhaps it’s better if my wife does throw it in a river.* Name has been changed so my daughter doesn’t get annoyed with me for violating her privacy once she learns to readDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

The 3bn disposable menstrual products used in the UK every year generate an estimated200,000 tonnesof menstrual waste. And sanitary pads, the most commonly used period product globally, are up to90% plastic.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.It gets worse. Studies have detectedtoxic pesticidesand16 types of metals in tampons. Not by choice, millions of us could be putting our health at risk by placing hidden toxic ingredients on one of the most sensitive parts of our bodies. In light of this, the Women’s Environmental Network is calling for a UK parliamentary bill coveringmenstrual health, dignity and sustainability.I was an early adopter of period pants, and in my work as an author and journalist writing about sustainability, I have previously spoken to the academics behind a scientific paper –Menstrual Products: A Comparable Life Cycle Assessment– who carried out an in-depth analysis of different period products based on eight environmental impacts, including global warming potential, fossil resources, water use and carcinogenic effects. The report concluded that the menstrual cup had the lowest environmental impact across all categories, followed by period underwear, reusable pads and, in last place, single-use pads and tampons. With this study in mind,I decided to do my own tests of the best products, taking health implications into account, too.The good news is that there’s a growing choice of menstrual cups, reusable pads, and tampons and pads made without harmful chemicals.Over the course of three months and three periods, I tried everything here, including period swimwear for the first time. Period pants continue to be one of my favourite options. I haven’t included them here because they were recently covered in detail in our test of thebest period pants.Periods are personal, and my reviews are based on my own, which are regular in frequency and flow, lasting about six days each month, with the heaviest flow in the second and third days. So you may want to adjust your choices based on your own cycle.The best sustainable pads and tamponsFrom organic cotton to non-toxic ingredients and compostable materials, period brands are offering more eco-friendly alternatives to traditional tampons and pads. Convenient, reliable and comfortable, they’re often similar in price, too.View image in fullscreenNatracare ultra extra regular pads with wings, 12 pack£2.42 at Bodykind£2.48 at Natural CollectionI’ve been using these for years. Made from organic cotton, they come in different sizes depending on your flow. Free of petroleum-based plastic, chlorine, perfume and dyes, Natracare pads are biodegradable andcompostable. Under the right conditions – a home compost bin or access to a community compost or local waste collection that accepts certified-compostable menstrual products – the pads can break down. If not, they can go into your general waste and degrade in landfill over time. And I can buy them as part of my food shop – they’re available in supermarkets and high-street chemists at the same price as synthetic versions.View image in fullscreenTotm natural padsFrom £2.95 for 10 pads at TotmThe ingredients are clearly listed on the website so you don’t have to search: organic cotton cover, FSC-certified wood pulp core, compostable biofilm backing and non-toxic adhesive; they’re free from fragrance, dyes and artificial absorbents. Each pad is wrapped in compostable biofilm. Like the Natracare pads, these are also compostable under the right conditions or can degrade in landfill. I’d recommend the “super” for medium to heavy flow, and “medium” for lighter flows. Both felt soft to the skin and were comfortable to wear.View image in fullscreenNatracare organic regular cotton tampons with applicator, 16 pack£3.23 at Bodykind£3.59 at Victoria HealthMade from organic cotton and free from chemicals, these tampons come packaged in paper, not the usual plastic wrapping of traditional tampons. I thought the biodegradable cardboard applicator would be uncomfortable, but it’s smooth enough to work as easily as a plastic one.View image in fullscreenTotm organic applicator regular tampons, 16 pack£3.40 at TotmSimilar to Natracare tampons – organic cotton, no chemicals, cardboard applicator and paper wrappers – Totm tampons are comfortable to wear and relatively easy to use. If you’re used to the super-smooth feel of a plastic tampon, it might take a little getting used to, but after a few times, I stopped noticing the difference. Delivery is free on orders over £15, and a box of 16 regular tampons costs only £3.40 (at the time of writing), so they’re a great budget option.View image in fullscreenFluus flushable medium pads£2.99 for 10 at Boots£4.75 for 12 at FluusWe’ve long been told not to flush period products down the toilet, as billions of wet wipes and sanitary pads that contain plastic continue toclog up pipesandpollute our waterwayseach year. So I was reluctant to do that, even though every part of a Fluus pad, including the adhesive, is made from biodegradable and microplastic-free materials. Once flushed, the pads break down in the water.The brand does advise against flushing in weak, old plumbing or where signs say not to. And for those reluctant to flush them down the toilet, they can also be placed in the bin.I found them soft and comfortable, but they currently only come in a medium size, so I use them on my lighter days.View image in fullscreenDayeNude tamponsFrom £6.36 for 12 at DayeFrom £8.54 for 18 at AmazonThese are made from 100% organic cotton and are free from dyes and pesticides. The easy-to-use, super-smooth applicator is made from a bio-based plastic derived from sugarcane and comes packaged in water-soluble paper wrappers. Raye offers various subscriptions at a discount.The best reusable period padsInstead of the sticky strip or wings of disposable pads, reusable cloth versions have poppers to fasten to your underwear. They work like period pants, but are easier to remove and replace when out and about. Over the long term, they’re cost-effective – on average we spend about£130 a yearon period products; one reusable pad is about £6 and can last about five years (though you will obviously need several on the go as you wait for washed pads to dry).The two options below must be line dried (no tumble dryers); they took anything from several hours to overnight to dry,depending on air temperature.Beware of antimicrobials such as silver – these chemicals are sometimes added to products to control odour but can havehealth implications. The options below are free from harmful antimicrobials.View image in fullscreenWuka reusable period padsFrom £15.99 at WukaWuka’s reusable pads are made from offcuts of Gots-certified organic cotton. The internal layer is made using CoolMax technology, a type of polyester that wicks moisture and helps the pad dry quickly after washing. The pads are easy to use and free from silver, chloride and antibacterial treatments. They feel soft and comfortable, but I needed to change them more regularly on heavier days than I would a pair of period pants. If I wasn’t going out, I would favour pants over pads, but these are great for when you’re not at home. You can buy a smallwater-resistant bagfor storing the used pads when out and about.View image in fullscreenCheeky Wipes organic cotton sanitary pads£6.49 at Cheeky WipesAlso free from antimicrobial silver and chemicals, including water-resistant Pfos and PFOA, Cheeky Wipes pads are made fromcottonorbamboo, with synthetic layers for absorbency. The regular pad I tried was soft and didn’t chafe, but it felt a little loose around my normal pants, and it was best for lighter-flow days. For regular and heavier days, I found that the pads advertised as “night” suited me better, as they’re longer and more absorbent.

They’re inserted into the vagina and, using suction, sit in the vaginal canal. A single cup costs about £25 and, if well cared for, can last up to 10 years, making it the most sustainable and cost-effective option of all.But poorly fitted cups can lead to infections, warns Shazia Malik, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Portland hospital in London. “I think it’s great to learn self-examination so you have an idea of where your cervix sits and how long your vagina is, but it can still take trial and error to get the right cup for you,” she says. Malik recommends sterilising a menstrual cup after each use and having at least two on the go.As a beginner, it was trial and error for me every time. I didn’t find any difference when it came to the insertion and removal of cups from different brands. If you find vaginal insertion uncomfortable, menstrual cups may not be for you.View image in fullscreenRuby Cup£25.95 at Ruby CupI’m not a fan of tampons, so I was apprehensive about trying a menstrual cup. But Ruby Cup’s website is full of helpful information and how-to videos, so after a couple of tries, I managed to insert it. Removal was messier – I did it over the bath – so give yourself a few cycles to get it right. Remember: the stem is not like the string of a tampon. To remove, you need to squeeze the bottom of the cup together to release the suction.For every cup bought, Ruby Cup donates one to girls across the world without easy access to period products.View image in fullscreenMooncup£21.15 at Look Fantastic£23.50 at BootsOne of the first menstrual cup brands, Mooncup’s original model comes in two sizes (based on age and whether you’ve had a vaginal birth) and is widely available from chemists and supermarkets. Both Mooncup and Ruby Cup felt slightly more rigid than Lunette (below), but I found little else different between each brand’s menstrual cup. Learning how to insert and remove was the tricky part – regardless of the brand. Mooncup offers plenty of advice online forhow to use its products– which I consulted on my phone while in the bathroom.View image in fullscreenLunette£24.90£24.50 at AmazonThe most beautifully designed period brand, you’ll want to proudly display these cups in your bathroom. Each box comes with a card illustrated by the artist Bea Müller and the definition of a Nordic word with a positive meaning – the brand is trying to remove the taboo around periods.The pack also comes with detailed practical instructions, andthere are videos online. I like that it has a slightly longer stem, as this makes it easier to locate, but equally, the stem shouldn’t be poking out, so make sure that it’s well inserted.View image in fullscreenAllMatters£30 at AllMattersThis is a disc, not a cup, but it works similarly by collecting blood. Discs sit higher up, at the base of the cervix, and don’t rely on suction, so I found it slightly easier to insert. The disc was much softer than the cups, although the rim is larger and more rigid.But removal was trickier – in hindsight and as a first-timer, I should have tried it at the start or end of my period, not during one of my heavier-flow days. As with menstrual cups, discs take practice and will suit some better than others. But AllMatters offerslots of advice on its website, and the packaging features a QR code to help users get started.The best period swimwearMuch standard, non-period swimwear is made from fossil fuel-derived fibres such as nylon, polyester and elastane. There are better alternatives made from Econyl (regenerated nylon from discarded fishing nets, fabric scraps, carpet flooring and industrial plastic), but I’m yet to find a 100% Econyl period swimsuit that works – none of the swimwear below is made from Econyl. Still, period swimwear can replace single-use tampons and offer an alternative for those who find tampons uncomfortable.Crucially, it really does work. Water pressure (when submerged) naturally helps to reduce or slow down the amount of menstrual blood leaving the body, but once out of the water, the natural flow resumes. Period swimwear helps by having absorbent and impermeable layers in the gusset.The gussets are more textured than non-period swimwear, but I didn’t feel any discomfort when wearing the styles below. Snuggs’ suit was particularly soft. All three were tighter than I’d normally choose, but I preferred it that way – it made me feel more secure.Still, I was sceptical of its performance and had planned to try period swimwear in the bath first, but didn’t get around to it. As a regular swimmer training for a 6km swim, I’d been swimming several times a week. Terrified, I took the plunge at my local pool, looking down the whole time. All clear. This was a revelation.There are many period swimwear options available, from high-street to specialist brands. The three below are a small sample I tried and recommend as they didn’t leak.View image in fullscreenWuka period racer back swimsuitFrom £34.99 at WukaI tested Wuka’s simple, black swimsuit with a high leg (more flattering on me), which was ideal for swim training, although Wuka offers other styles and colours. I chose to hand wash after use to better retain its shape, and I was only wearing it for up to an hour at a time, but you can machine wash this style up to 40C, without fabric softener (which can reduce absorbency).View image in fullscreenAzure Belle Oasis period swimsuit£65 at Azure BelleI’d normally prefer a higher-cut leg, but this costume – with its lower cut – was great for a one-hour training swim during a medium flow. The swimsuit is free from the harmful Pfas and Pfos chemicals, sometimes found in waterproof clothing.View image in fullscreenSnuggs briefs£34 at SnuggsIf you’re more into bikinis and don’t intend to train in a pool for hours, these bikini bottoms are stylish and reliable for lighter-flow days on the beach or at the pool – the bottoms didn’t leak even when I was out of the water. They’re comfortably snug and dry just as quickly as non-period swimwear.

Her first thought, though, would be to tip a jar of the sweet stuff into a buttered ceramic baking dish and top it with sponge: “Make a classic, equal-parts mix scaled to your dish by creaming, say, 180g butter and 180g sugar, slowly beating in an egg and a dash of vanilla or lemon zest, and finishing with 180g self-raising flour.” Spoon that on top of the jam and bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 until the sponge “bounces back” and a skewer comes out clean. Serve warm with cream or custard, and job’s a good ’un.You’ll also want jam to fill or top cakes. “Obvious things are a Victoria sponge, but that doesn’t use much jam,” saysthe Guardian’s own Benjamina Ebuehi, so she’d be more inclined to spoon buttercream over the top of a coconut cake, for example, make a dip in the middle with the back of a spoon and pop some jam in there: “That’s a nice way to decorate a cake and it also uses up a decent amount of jam.” It wouldn’t hurt, either, to use berry jams to finish a classic school dinner traybake sponge: “Once it’s out of the oven, top with jam then scatter with desiccated coconut.” Otherwise, Ebuehi says, joy can be found in a nostalgic jam tart or Italiancrostata(look out for Ebuehi’s blackberry version next week).Of course, jam is a great friend of biscuits, too, with Cuddeford and Ebuehi agreeing thatthumbprintcookies are the way to go here. Cudderford opts for jamaretti: “Whisk egg whites with sugar, ground nuts and lemon zest until firm enough to roll into balls, then toss in icing sugar.” Make an indent in the centre, spoon in the jam and bake: “They’re delicious, chewy and keep well in a sealed container for a few weeks.” Darcie Mahler, owner ofLannan bakeryin Scotland, meanwhile, would go for shortbread: “Make a simple shortbread by beating icing sugar and butter, then add flour – I use a mix of plain and spelt – cornflour, salt and vanilla paste.” Pipe that into discs, make a thumbprint, fill with jam and bake until the edges are lightly golden.A dollop of jam also gives breakfast an instant zhoosh. For Ebuehi, that means porridge or yoghurt, while no sensible person ever refused a twice-baked croissant, Cuddeford says. “Split croissants in half and spread with jam. Cream 80g butter and 80g sugar, add an egg and 80g ground almonds, then spoon into your jammy croissants, and spread some on top, too.” Sprinkle with flaked almonds, then get them in a 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 oven for 20 minutes for a very good morning.There are, of course, only so many baked goods you can eat (well, in theory, anyway), so also consider spreading the love: “Put a nice bow on the jars and gift them,” Ebuehi says. “Everyone loves an edible gift.” Alternatively, get a gang over, mix a teaspoon of jam into cocktails – “with gin, lemon juice and tonic,” Cuddeford suggests – and keep that summer spirit alive.Got a culinary dilemma?

It is likely to reignite debate about the affordability of the triple lock, and poses questions about the standard tax-free personal allowance, which stands at £12,570.What is the triple lock?The UK state pension increases in April each year based on a system known as the triple lock.Introduced in 2011 by the coalition government, it guarantees that the basic and new state pensions will rise by whichever of three figures is the highest:Inflation, based on the consumer price inflation (CPI) figure for September of the previous yearThe average increase in wages during the May to July period of the previous year2.5%.graphicHow many people get the state pension?There are almost 13.1 million state pensioners, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures issued in August.The majority, 8.4 million, are on the old basic state pension.To get this, you need to be a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953.People born after those dates claim the new state pension.The full basic state pension is £176.45 a week, and the full new state pension £230.25.The government says it is not possible to make direct comparisons between the two payments. Under the old system, people can receive extra money from the state based on their national insurance (NI) contributions. They could qualify for the “additional state pension” – known as the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps), or state second pension – for the years they paid the full rate of NI. This payment could be worth in excess of £200 a week on top of the basic state pension, the government has said.What is the rise from next April?It’s not 100% confirmed, but we have a pretty good idea of what will happen.Figures from the Office for National Statistics on Tuesday show theannual growth in earnings was 4.7%for May to July this year. As is often the case with official data, this figure may undergo a small revision next month.The September inflation figure will be published next month, but it is not expected to exceed 4.7%.It was 3.8% in Julyand is forecast to remain unchanged in August when those figures are released on Wednesday.A 4.7% increase would lift the full basic state pension to £184.75 a week, or £9,607 a year. It would lift the full new state pension to £241.05 a week, or £12,534.60 a year.The government is expected to make a final decision on the pension increase before the budget on 26 November.Is the triple lock popular?There has been a great deal of discussion about the affordability and fairness of the triple lock in recent years.Critics say it is unfair because many older people enjoy a higher standard of living than younger people may expect to in the future, and believe it is not right to expect the younger generation to subsidise older people’s incomes to such an extent via the triple lock.Organisations including the Institute for Fiscal Studies have argued that the triple lock is unsustainable and makes planning government finances tricky because the various components are difficult to forecast.The Office for Budget Responsibility said in July that the triple lock had alreadycost about three times more than initially expectedand suggested it was unaffordable in the long term.Supporters of the triple lock say it is vital for maintaining the value of the state pension, particularly for future pensioners, many of whom do not have access to the generous workplace schemes that many older people were able to join and are not saving enough for their retirement, in part because of cost of living pressures.Surveys have shown that many current workers do not expect to have any provision beyond the state pension when they retire.Could the triple lock be ditched?The work and pensions secretary, Pat McFadden, confirmed on Tuesday that the government was committed to maintaining the triple lock for this parliament. That echoes previous pledges by other ministers.The head of policy at the financial services consultancy Broadstone, David Brooks, said however that debate over the future of the triple lock was likely to intensify.“Increasingly the debate appears to be framed as triple lock or nothing when it comes to increasing the state pension,” he said. “But most would consider it fair that the state pension should increase, and the government has repeatedly committed to it for the remainder of this parliament.”He said the debate should be about whether the increase was dictated by an earnings link or an inflation link, and should be a priority.Steve Webb, a former pensions minister and partner at the consultancy firm LCP, said the annual standard rate of the new state pension was “creeping ever closer to the frozen personal tax allowance”.“Indeed, we know for certain that someone who has no other income aside from the new state pension will be a taxpayer come April 2027,” he said.“It is already the case that nearly three quarters of all pensioners pay income tax, and the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds coupled with steady rises in the pension will drag more and more into the tax net.”Explore more on these topicsState pensionsPensionsEconomicsRachel ReevesInflationexplainersShareReuse this content"

The island had already begun to appeal to city folk who came here for fresh air, sea baths and peace, but the sanatoriums set up by the renowned Dr Peter Silfverskiöld gained such a positive reputation that the isle became known as a health resort. Those glory days have long since faded butKusthotellet, a new hotel dedicated to wellbeing, aims to tap back into the restorative vibe.The conditions that first drew health-seekers to the island still pertain. It’s tucked away and protected from winds, but the lack of high ground nearby means the sun shines on its southern coast from dawn to dusk, and there’s no pollution. “This island is such a peaceful place – you can really relax and recharge your batteries,” Malin Lilton, manager of Kusthotellet, told my companion and me. “As soon as you get on the ferry your pulse rate goes down and you start breathing in the good air.”Sweden mapIn the spirit of slowing down, we had come by train from the UK with Interrail passes, stopping for the night in Hamburg. Arriving in the late afternoon in Gothenburg, we wandered the old town before heading to Styrsö via tram to Saltholmen harbour and speedy catamaran ferry. City centre to island hotel in just under an hour.Right on the coast with views across to neighbouring Donsö island, the 40-room, 10-suite hotel is a sleek creation, decorated in the cool, calming colours beloved by Scandinavians, with a light-filled restaurant, wellness area and outdoor heated pool. Our room, one of the 20 with sea views – is a spacious, uncluttered affair with a balcony.View image in fullscreenLate afternoon on Styrsö island in the Gothenburg archipelago.Photograph: Thomas Males/AlamyThe hotel is designed with sustainability in mind – there are ground-source heat pumps and water-based underfloor heating – and it’s aiming forGreen Keysustainability status. And everything has been kept as local as possible, from the staffing and food ingredients to the seaweed and salt used in the spa.That spa – named Havskuren (“The Sea Cure”) – is split into two areas. The Salt Source offers foot baths, facial treatments and an area for relaxing. The Heat Source contains a sauna, steam bath and plunge pool. There’s also a small gym. “We’re planning to offer massages soon as well,” Malin said.The menu features Nordic-influenced seafood dishes such as scallops, cured halibut, plaice and hake, as well as wholesome vegan optionsMalin also explained that cycling, walking, sea swimming and eating are also important elements in guests’ wellbeing, and presented us with two shiny new hire bikes. The 0.6 square mile (1.5 sq km) island is virtually car-free and as we explored over three days, the only vehicles we met on the smooth narrow roads were bicycles, golf carts and three-wheeled mopeds that resembled motorised wheelbarrows.One morning, having stocked up at the island Co-op, we pedalled off for a picnic lunch on Lilla Lyngnskär, a tiny islet accessible from Styrsö by footbridge. We still somehow had room forfika– coffees with a cinnamon bun and a mightychokladbollar(Swedish chocolate ball) – atCafé Öbergska, formerly an inn owned by pickled herring barons.View image in fullscreenThe new Kusthotellet wellbeing hotel.Photograph: Victor ApelgrenOur walks on the island’s wooded southern side included a memorable crepuscular hike on a footpath to a bronze age cairn at Stora Rös, the island’s highest point with a 360-degree vista across the southern Gothenburg archipelago. We shared the path down in the dark with scores of frogs, some no larger than our fingernails. Doubtless many would find their way into the stomachs of the herons we had seen hunting during the day.Back at the hotel, we dined in the high-ceilinged restaurant with views over the water. The menu features Nordic-influenced seafood dishes such as scallops, cured halibut, plaice and hake, as well as wholesome vegan options using locally farmed vegetables. We tucked into beetroot, chanterelle and oyster mushroom starters followed by charred cabbage and toasted hazelnuts over a mouthwateringly creamy potato base – all delicious.We slipped into wetsuits and into clear, even warm-ish seawater and watched Karolina pick sea plants sustainablyOne evening, after dinner we tried out the spa. Malin handed us a nose-pleasing set of creams and lotions she had made herself, and we luxuriated in the foot-baths, sauna and steam room, suffered in a freezing plunge pool, and relaxed again in the heated outdoor pool with a view across the ocean to the sparkling lights of Donsö.A bridge has joined Styrsö with this neighbour for just over 50 years, so the next day we cycled over it for an al fresco lunch at the harboursidePopsicle cafe, owned by Donsö-born sisters Kristin and Klara. Their mixture of ingredients grown by friends, tasty bread and cakes made by Klara’s mother-in-law and weekly live music has proved a hit. We returned to the harbour for a delicious dinner featuring jerusalem artichokes, butternut squash and a cauliflower sauce atIsbolaget, a high-ceilinged building that was once an ice store for fishing boats.View image in fullscreenThe Kusthotellet restaurant.Photograph: Victor ApelgrenOur final slow day was dedicated to aseaweed safari(£118pp) with potter-turned-naturalist Karolina Martinson. We began with a historical cycle tour of the northern part of the island, home to most of Styrsö’s 1,600-strong population. Karolina led us leisurely up and down miniature hills sprinkled with well-kept detached wooden houses, no two alike.Arriving at Karolina’s chosen beach, we slipped into wetsuits and clambered over rocks into the pleasingly clear and even warm-ish seawater. So followed our introduction to finger kelp, sugar kelp, fork weed, dulse, mermaid’s necklace and good old bladderwrack – all of them good for us or the planet or both. We snorkelled around, watching as Karolina showed us how she picks the plants sustainably.Our exploration done, we helped to prepare a homemade feast on the beach – traditional bread thins cooked on a stove, tofu wrapped in crispy mermaid’s necklace, light-as-air biscuits made with foraged meadowsweet, sweet bites of sugar kelp and much more besides. When we said our goodbyes, many hours later, we felt like old friends.All too soon we found ourselves at the dockside waiting for the ferry back to the reality of the outside world. After a few minutes, a woman joined us – bare-footed and apparently clad in nothing but a Kusthotellet spa robe. For all our newfound relaxed state, we clearly still had a lot to learn from the Swedes about how to be laidback.The trip was supported bytheWest Swedentourist boardandKusthotellet Styrsö(double rooms fromabout£130).

We spent hours reading articles and watching videos about puppy training, and were constantly arguing about the right way to potty train him or get him to stop barking.Every new piece of information seemed to contradict what we’d already learned – never scold him! Scold him! – but one thing was certain: make one wrong move and you will ruin yourdogand your life forever.We had fallen into a common trap.“The No 1 mistake people make [when training] is thinking, I have to make my dog be perfect and sit all the time, instead of remembering why we got a dog and that we’re meant to have fun together,” says Amanda Gagnon, a zoologist, behavior consultant and dog trainer in New York City.Training is how a dog and a human learn to communicate with each other and build a relationship, says Gagnon. This is essential to a dog’s safety and happiness, but it doesn’t need to be a joyless chore.‘It’s all about tone of voice’: three dog trainers on how to beat behavioural problemsRead moreWe talked to experts about how to start training your dog – in a way that won’t make you lose your mind.Manage expectationsBetween social media, Lassie reruns and basic perfectionism, humans can sometimes have unrealistic standards for dogs.“A lot of people get stuck on the Instagram-perfect dog that is always happy and never has negative emotions,” says Alex Sessa, the owner and head trainer of Peach on a Leash in Atlanta.But dogs are individuals with different personalities and needs. Maybe you wanted a dog that accompanies you to the farmer’s market every Saturday, but crowds make your dog feel stressed.That’s not a problem, says Sessa – people just need to adjust their expectations accordingly. “That’s still a great dog. There’s nothing wrong with the dog that doesn’t want to go everywhere with us,” she says.And expecting your dog to always be perfectly calm can lead to greater behavioral trouble down the road, says Gagnon.“When we don’t give our dogs outlets to express themselves as dogs – meaning barking and running and being bananas in general – those needs get suppressed, and when that happens, it’s like a powder keg that’s going to explode at any moment,” she says.Give them time to settle inWhether you’re bringing home a puppy or an adult dog, experts agree it is important to give them plenty of time to acclimate.“Don’t jump into too much obedience right away,” Sessa says. “We don’t want the dog to immediately feel like we’re barking commands at them and asking them to do a million things.”Adult dogs in particular can take up to three months to settle into a new home and show their true behavior pattern, says Ciera Moberg, a certified dog behavior consultant and co-founder of Instinct Dog Behavior & Training in Washington DC. The way your dog acts the first day you bring them home might be completely different than the way they act on day 30.Once your dog is comfortable and you have a better understanding of their personality – what they enjoy, what makes them nervous – it will be easier to figure out how you want to focus your training.Figure out what commands your dog really needsMost people don’t need to teach their dog as many commands – some trainers call them cues – as they might think.“You only absolutely need two cues,” says Gagnong. “You need ‘sit’, and you need ‘come’.”Sit.When a dog is sitting, “there are very few behavioral problems they can exhibit,” says Gagnon. “This is about getting them into a calm position.”To teach a dog to sit, say the word and then use a treat to get them into a sitting position, Gagnon says. Usually this can be done by showing them a treat and then moving it over and slightly behind their head, so when they track it with their nose, their head moves up and back and their rear drops.Come.A recall cue is essential for safety. “Teaching a dog to come when called is about preventing them from running off into the road or into a dog fight,” says Gagnon.To teach a dog to come, you start by standing close to them, saying the cue, and giving them the treat when they come to you. Then you take a step back, and do the same thing. Over time, you call the dog from a greater and greater distance.Moberg says she also likes to teach dogs “touch”, where their nose presses into the palm of your hand.“It allows you to move the dog without having to physically manipulate their body,” she says.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toWell ActuallyFree weekly newsletterPractical advice, expert insights and answers to your questions about how to live a good lifeEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Repeat.Besides basic safety commands, think about training functionally, Sessa says. What is important for you and your dog’s life together? Maybe your dog never needs to be able to lie down, but they need to be able to walk well on a leash. “So focus on that,” says Sessa. “There’s no one-size-fits-all training regimen.”There’s no need to spend hours on training. Sessa says she usually suggests her clients work with their dogs for no more than 10 to 15 minutes a day.For puppies: socialize, socialize, socializeA lot of people think socializing a puppy means introducing them to as many other dogs as possible, says Gagnon. It’s actually a much broader task. “It’s about introducing them to everything that’s going to be a part of their world in a positive way,” Gagnon says.If you live in a loud, busy city, for example, it is important to help your puppy get used to loud city sounds. But don’t overdo it.“It’s not good socialization to take a puppy and put it down right next to a jackhammer,” says Gagnon. If a puppy seems scared or like they’re trying to hide, it is important not to push them or make them uncomfortable.More from How to start:How to start meditatingHow to start weightliftingHow to start budgetingHow to start running“You can put them two blocks away from the jackhammer and give them a treat while they’re hearing that sound, and that’s good socialization.”“Food is a great way to help your puppy feel better about things,” says Sessa. For example, if they’re meeting new people, have the strangers toss them a treat. “That helps them create a positive association,” she adds.Experts also suggest enrolling your dog in puppy classes or puppy social hours. However, poorly managed puppy groups can do more harm than good. A well-run class, Sessa says, will be small, have the dogs separated by size and collect the dogs’ vaccine records. It should also be moderated by a certified dog trainer.Know when to call in a proAt-home training can be beneficial, but in some situations, it is best to get help from a trainer.“If there’s anything dangerous, if there have been bites that have resulted in punctures, call a professional,” says Gagnon.How to start … anything: expert tips for trying something newRead moreThere’s no need to wait until your dog is fully grown. In particular, if a puppy is having issues with biting, Gagnon suggests reaching out to a trainer, even just for a single session. Remote options are often available. “Half an hour online or with phone support can be relatively inexpensive compared to the costs of an aggression problem down the road,” she says.Professionals can also be helpful when dealing with anxious dogs, because anxiety “can be so case specific”, says Gagnon. For instance, you might think your dog is suffering separation anxiety, but your dog could be stressed about something else. A trainer can observe “and tell you what you’re dealing with”, Gagnon says.Finally, it’s important to pick a qualified behavior consultant or dog trainer. Sessa recommends looking for professionals who are credentialed with the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers (CCPDT) or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants (IAABC).New dog owners can easily become overwhelmed by all the information and training options available, Sessa says. “Try not to get too caught up with what you’re seeing online. Those people haven’t interacted with your specific dog.”Explore more on these topicsWell actuallyHow to startDogsPetsAnimalsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Will it grow back?DiagnosisPlease don’t panic, this east African succulent is unusual in that it grows fleshy leaves along its ridged stems during its growing season, then often sheds them in winter. In its native Kenya, rainfall is seasonal. The plant responds by producing foliage in the wet season, then dropping its leaves in the dry season to conserve water and energy. The green stems continue to photosynthesise so the plant can survive leafless for long periods.Houseplant clinic: which plants cope best in darker rooms?Read morePrescriptionTo encourage new leaves, it needsintense, bright light; find the sunniest indoor spot you have, like a south-facing windowsill, or supplement with a grow light. Warmth will also prompt leaf growth, so keep it in a consistently warm room. When the soil is completely dry, water thoroughly until you see the water escape through the drainage holes. Do this in spring and summer when the plant is actively growing. In winter, reduce watering, as this is its natural rest period. A diluted cactus fertiliser during the growing season will help support healthy foliage.PreventionUnderstand this plant’s natural rhythm; leafless in winter, leafy in summer. Please resist the urge to overwater when it’s bare, as this can rot the roots. Treat it as a seasonal cycle, with the return of light and warmth in spring, your euphorbia should sprout leaves again.Got a plant dilemma?

Shipping them out to Nigeria and Ghana remains the day job for Simon Broadbent, but the manufacturer’s owner has a growing issue nagging at him – the fate of his 160-year-old business in the face of Labour’s tax overhaul.Broadbent has emerged as a reluctant challenger to plans by the chancellor,Rachel Reeves, to strip family firms of the ability to pass on their businesses tax free from next April. Campaigners, including the manufacturers association Make UK, say the tax overhaul threatens the backbone of the British industrial sector.Under the current system, business property relief allows families to pass on assets free of inheritance tax (IHT). Reeves’s IHT changes – which have alsocaused shock and anger among farmers– would mean children who inherit companies’ property assets, which in many cases is a factory, will need to find the money to pay IHT at 20% on assets above £1m.UK economy flatlines in July in grim news for Rachel ReevesRead moreOnce assembled on the west African coast, Broadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from molasses.Simon, 72, is the great-great grandson of the company’s founder, Thomas Broadbent, and as its current chair he controls one of the few metal forming operations in the UK, bending and welding rolled steel into sophisticated machines that are exported all over the world.He fervently makes the case for small, family-owned businesses. “For every JCB and Dyson, there are hundreds of firms just making a decent living, but not a fortune, and certainly not enough that we can hand over 20% of our perceived wealth every time one of us dies,” he says.“We want the company to have a future, and there is no reason why it shouldn’t when we have a good product to sell. Yet we are in a situation now where, if I die on the wrong day, our plans to keep it going could all be derailed.”View image in fullscreenBroadbent’s crafted metal parts will be attached to his centrifugal spinning machines, designed for sugar refiners to separate sugar crystals from  molasses.Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianBroadbent, whose company also has operations in China and Thailand, is concerned that Reeves’s plan will allow only a proportion of family assets above £1m to be passed on to the next generation tax free.Certain Treasury allowances mean that, in some circumstances, the tax free limit increases to £3m, as it does for farming estates. But like farmers, business owners argue that the asset value of the firm is irrelevant as there is no intention to sell.HMRC confirmed last month that the changes would go ahead as planned, after outlining how asset values would be calculated.Reeves, who is expected to raise taxes in her 26 November budget as she faces a large spending deficit, has defended the reduction in tax relief, arguing that the Treasury is unable to afford to continue the subsidy and that only a handful of estates each year will be affected.When the plan was announced last year, the Treasury’s independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), tentatively estimated that the projected revenue from the changes to business property relief and the agricultural property relief affecting farmers in a similar waywould be £500m a year from 2027/28.Broadbent says factories are not like stocks and shares, “you can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it. Otherwise you can’t make the product”.Given the way land values and property assets of all kinds have soared over the last 40 years, many family owners have found themselves asset rich and cash poor, putting a strain on finances. The high value of the pound, soaring energy bills, Brexit and competition from China have been enough to send many British manufacturers bust.Now some of those that remain have run the numbers and say an extra tax bill will mean they need to starve their companies of investment, or sell up.Family Business UK, a lobby group for family-owned firms, believes Reeves’s plans are likely to trigger a fire sale of British-owned businesses or a depressed sector, with owners forced to redirect working capital – the investment funds needed for research and development – into paying the IHT bill.View image in fullscreenBroadbent says that factories are not like stocks and shares: “You can’t sell off part of the factory. You need all of it.”Photograph: Jon Super/The GuardianA study by CBIEconomicsfound that family businesses make up more than 90% of private sector companies in the UK and provide employment for nearly 16 million people.CBI said figures to the end of 2023 show family businesses generated £985bn, equivalent to 59% of total private sector income. More than half of respondents to its survey said they were cancelling or delaying investments while they consulted advisers about the financial implications of the IHT changes.Josh Burbidge heads the family firm Archwood Group and the Richard Burbidge manufacturing brand, which can trace its roots to the same decade that Thomas Broadbent was inventing spinning machines to dry wool for the Yorkshire textile industry – the 1860s.He manages the factory near Chirk in north Wales. Originally based in Coventry, the company was lured, along Cadbury’s, to set up factories in a neglected part of Wales by government subsidies that have long since run out.These days 40% of revenues stem from making wooden stairs for new-build properties. Burbidge says the company is embedded in the local community and has overseen investments that have not only transformed the factory into an eco-haven covered in 2,600 solar panels, but has also negotiated with wood suppliers in China, Estonia and Sweden to do the same.“The fact we are a family business means we keep the business going for the next generation. We have made it an environmental and sustainable business.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Family firms that have survived two world wars continue, winning praise from politicians for generating exports.The upmarket appliance maker Miele and the power tool firm Stihl are among the top 500 family firms that generate 43% of Germany’s economic output. Giving some heft to the list are Volkswagen, Lidl and Aldi, which are also family owned.German companies lobbied for the tax-free transfer of property assets in the early 1990s at the same time as their British counterparts. Both won after their respective governments conceded that family firms had no intention of capitalising on rising property values and simply wanted to continue running the same business.Jaguar Land Rover says cyber-attack has affected ‘some data’Read moreOnly when cash was extracted was there tax to pay. It meant that while company funds remained inside the business, successive generations could carry on in charge.Peer-Robin Paulus, the head of policy at theFamily Business Associationin Potsdam, says: “The key for any business is to retain enough capital to invest in IT and digital technologies to remain market leading companies. Otherwise you go bust.“We have to accept that some people will abuse the privilege, but that is a very small risk and worth it to save a vast swathe of family businesses.”Jonathan Roberts, the head of external affairs at the Country Land and Business Association, says the IHT changes will prove to be loss-making for the Treasury because families will freeze major investments.“We have put forward a plan that allows the Treasury to claw back tax if families sell within seven years of inheriting. That would show ministers that families are committed to their businesses and not seeking to exploit them,” he says.A spokesperson for the Treasury said most estates claiming tax relief will fall below the IHT threshold. The largest companies, 4% of the total, claim the biggest amount of tax relief at 53% and should pay a higher inheritance bill, it argues.“The money raised will go towards public services we all rely on every day instead,” they said.Broadbent’s children are not part of the business, but like many family owners, he wants the ethos and practice of hi-tech manufacturing to continue in his home town. He is on the hunt for a like-minded family steeped in the industry to buy his business.He says Reeves’s “tax raid” has all but scuppered that project. “Maybe it was naive to think there is such a family out there, but the uncertainty created by the tax changes means my aim will be much more difficult to achieve,” he says.Explore more on these topicsManufacturing sectorEconomicsLabourRachel ReevesfeaturesShareReuse this content"

But now it has become synonymous with something darker. It was here where Agnes Wanjiru was born and lived and where she was brutally killed.Her family searched for her for months before her body was found stuffed into a septic tank at the same hotel where she had last been seen alive.Kenya seeks arrest of former British soldier over alleged murder of Agnes WanjiruRead moreAgnes was raised by her mother, Lydiah Wanjiku Kimotho, who did what her family affectionately referred to as “side hustle jobs” such as farming while bringing up her five children.The eldest child, Rose Wanyua Wanjiku, was followed by a brother, James Mwangi, then Cecilia Muthoni, and Francinsca Njoki. Agnes was the youngest.Agnes lived in Nanyuki for all of her 21 years, and if she ever travelled it was only to visit her sister Cecilia, who lived several hours away.She started her primary education at a school in Nanyuki, DEB primary, and later joined Gakawa secondary school. She enjoyed lessons and her favourite subject was literature. She also loved music; she would often be caught singing or dancing.She enjoyed busying herself in the kitchen and spending her spare time with her extended family. As a sister, daughter and aunt, Agnes was dependable and kind, her family said, and she was also funny.“She was always joking, smiling,” said her niece Esther Njoki. “We were always laughing because of her jokes.”Growing up, Agnes would look after her younger nieces, spending time braiding their hair. Later, she turned her hobby into her career; she began training to be hairdresser in 2010. She finished her course in August 2011. Just a few months later, before she had had a chance to properly start out in her new career, she was dead.While she completed her studies, Agnes was also heavily pregnant. Her daughter Stacey was born on 20 October that year. “Agnes’s feelings about becoming a mum was [that it was] the best feeling ever,” Esther Njoki said.She loved her baby daughter but struggled to provide for her, and like many young women in Nanyuki, Agnes would make extra money from selling sex. Batuk, the British army training base nearby, provided a steady flow of custom.Soldiers would come into Nanyuki to drink and socialise and many would pay for sex with local women, often several in one night, paying them as little as the equivalent of £1 a time.Agnes would go to bars in the town to meet her friends, and dance. The night she disappeared, 31 March 2012, started like many others. She went to the Lion’s Court hotel, a favourite haunt of British soldiers, to meet her friends Florence Nyaguthii and Susan Nyambura.They remembered her joining them at about 11pm and the three women dancing together. Agnes was drinking a beer that she told her friends had been bought for her by a British soldier.Instead of returning home to her sister, her daughter and her niece as she had every other night, Agnes disappeared. The next morning, her friends and family had not heard from her. They went to the hotel where she had last been seen, and spent weeks searching for Agnes, until her body was discovered two months later.Agnes’s death has had a lasting effect on her family. Stacey was five months old when she lost her mother and will not remember her but has been deeply affected after learning how she died.“We have been having moments where she sees something about her mum and she breaks down,” Njoki said, “and that’s because of trauma.”Njoki and her mother, Rose, have carried the heavy burden of Agnes’s death for 13 years. “You just keep on thinking about Agnes, about the case, and you just feel bad,” she said.“It’s really traumatising, for sure, and saddening, and our hearts [are broken].”Explore more on these topicsKenyaAfricafeaturesShareReuse this content"

I reiterated my determination to see a resolution to the still-unresolved case.”Previously, as shadow defence secretary, Healey had called on the then Conservative government to do more to resolve the case.“Agnes’s death has had a profound and devastating impact on our family,” her relatives previously said in a statement.“It was not only the shock of losing Agnes at such a young age, but also the horrific circumstances in which her body was found and all the trauma and struggle our family has been put through in trying to seek justice and accountability for her death.”“Our thoughts remain with the family of Agnes Wanjiru and we remain absolutely committed to helping them secure justice,” a spokesperson for the UK government said.“We understand that the Kenyan director of public prosecutions has determined that a British national should face trial in relation to the murder of Ms Wanjiru in 2012.“This is subject to ongoing legal proceedings and we will not comment further at this stage.”No timeline has been set for any extradition hearing or future trial.The case is next listed for mention in court in Kenya on 21 October.Explore more on these topicsBritish armyKenyaMilitaryAfricanewsShareReuse this content"

It will transport water from landlocked Lesotho to a region containing South Africa’s largest city, Johannesburg, at an estimated cost of 54bn rand (£2.28bn), according to aparliamentary briefingby South African officials in May.View image in fullscreenConstruction of a high bridge that will form part of the project.Photograph: Robi Chacha Mosenda / Accountability CounselLast week, the Lesotho communities, represented by the Lesotho-based Seinoli Legal Centre and the US NGO Accountability Counsel, filed a complaint with the AfDB’s independent recourse mechanism (IRM). They asked the IRM to recommend that the AfDB board suspend the project until their concerns are resolved.The complaint said rock blasting had caused cracks in house walls, while rockfalls and flooding had blocked access to some fields. It alleged dust and debris had polluted water sources.“They take our fields [and] they didn’t pay in a good way,” said a community representative, requesting anonymity due to fears of reprisals from authorities.Spokespeople for AfDB, whichloaned1.3bn rand to the project in 2021, said they would respond to emailed questions, but had not done so by the time of publication.The Lesotho Highland Development Authority, which runs the project, said: “No household has been, or will be, relocated without prior and comprehensive consultation … Our commitment is to transparency, accessibility, and timely feedback across all levels of engagement.”It added: “To date, no homes have been reported as uninhabitable due to blasting. However, where households have experienced damage such as cracks or other structural issues, contractors are required to carry out repairs to the satisfaction of the affected household, or compensation is provided in line with policy.”View image in fullscreenThe town of Mokhotlong, surrounded by mountainous terrain.Photograph: Robi Chacha Mosenda / Accountability CounselIt said rockfall issues had been resolved, allegations of field access being blocked had not been verified and “overall water quality remains within acceptable limits for its intended uses”.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe Long WaveFree weekly newsletterNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the worldEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The animals returned but Chuñil, who was 72 at the time, and Cholito did not.More than 100 people joined her family in a search lasting weeks in the steep, wet and densely overgrown terrain of Chile’s ancient Valdivian forest. After a month, they even kept an eye on vultures for any grim signs. But theyfound no trace of Chuñil.Chuñil is one of 146 land and environmental defenders who were killed or disappeared around the world last year, according to a report by the campaign group Global Witness. About a third of those, like Chuñil, were from Indigenous communities – a heavy toll for groups who collectively make up just 6% of the global population.Chuñil, a leader of Chile’s indigenous Mapuche, was living on disputed land. Ten years ago she had moved on to Reserva Cora, a 900-hectare (2,200-acre) portion of the ancient Valdivian forest 500 miles south of Santiago, which her people claimed as an ancestral territory.She spent years campaigning to secure land rights over the site for her community. But the site’s nominal owner, the descendant of settlers, refused to relinquish control. He wanted the site for logging – Chile is a major supplier of wood to the US – and he wanted rid of Chuñil. Before she vanished, Chuñil told supporters: “If anything happens to me, you already know who did it.”Global Witness started documenting cases of killings and disappearances of land and environmental defenders in 2012. Since then it has collated a total of 2,253 cases. For the past decade, the most dangerous place has been Latin America. In 2024 it accounted for 82% of cases, including 45 Indigenous people.“Land conflict is at the heart of violence against defenders, andIndigenous peoplesare paying the highest price,” said Javier Garate, a senior policy adviser at Global Witness. “Communities with ancestral connections to land often form the frontline of resistance when their territories come under threat from exploitation and encroachment. But despite their critical role, they are frequently denied recognition and justice, and subjected to serious danger for defending their rightful lands.”Chuñil’s was the only case recorded in her country last year, although it fitted a pattern of the targeting of Mapuche activists in Chile. Colombia recorded 48 cases, making it the deadliest country overall for environmental defenders, followed by Guatemala with 20, the deadliest country per capita. Mexico had 19 cases, putting it in third place overall.Under-reporting remains an issue, particularly in Asia and Africa, which registered 16 and nine cases respectively, Global Witness said. Overall, last year the fewest cases of killings and disappearances of environmental defenders were registered for a decade.Laura Furones, who led the research for Global Witness, said: “I would also like to be able to tell you that this implies a decrease in violence and an improvement in the conditions for defenders, but unfortunately that’s not the case. Human rights defenders face realities of violence that go far beyond murder. What violence often does is evolve, become more sophisticated, change its face.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toDown to EarthFree weekly newsletterThe planet's most important stories.

In April, two animals from Chuñil’s home that they had planned to auction to fund legal costs were found killed, one shot and one poisoned. “It is, above all, a deliberate attempt to prevent us from fighting this case,” her son Pablo San Martín told Global Witness.The group’s report calls on governments to act to end the impunity of the killers of environmental defenders by addressing the lack of rights defenders have over land and territory, strengthening weak national legal systems, and ensuring defenders at risk are given adequate state protection.“All we are asking for is a full, fair investigation to take place,” San Martín said of his mother’s case. “It’s been almost a year since she disappeared and we’re still in the dark about what happened. We want those behind this to be identified and charged.”Explore more on these topicsLand rightsChileIndigenous peoplesAmericasnewsShareReuse this content"

Both may still appeal.The former president remains under house arrest at his mansion in Brasília for allegedly trying to intimidate supreme court justices overseeingthe coup case. Barred by court order from using social media, Bolsonaro has not commented on the racism ruling.Shortly after the ruling, the former president was taken to a hospital with a “severe bout of hiccups, vomiting and low blood pressure”, according to a post on social media by one of his politician sons, senator Flávio Bolsonaro.Last Sunday, Bolsonaro had also gone to the hospital for procedures to remove skin lesions.Another of his politician sons, the Rio de Janeiro councillor Carlos Bolsonaro, reposted news of the convictionwith the message: “Long live democracy!”The Bolsonaro family claims the cases against him are political persecution.Inthe coup case, Bolsonaro’s lawyers may still lodge a final appeal before the supreme court decides where he will serve his sentence, which is expected to happen in October or November.Explore more on these topicsBrazilAmericasJair BolsonaronewsShareReuse this content"

The post was accompanied by a video clip showing the boat, which appeared to be stationary, erupting into a fireball.“The strike occurred while these confirmed narco-terroists fromVenezuelawere in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the US,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.Trump’s announcement of the strike appeared to be worded in a way to suggest there was a valid legal basis for the strike – an issue that became a source of heavy criticism in Washington after the operation againstthe firstalleged Venezuelan drug boat earlier this month, which killed 11 people.According to people familiar with the matter, the administration briefed Congress last week that the first strike was legal under the president’s article 2 powers because it involved a boat connected to theTren de Aragua gang, which Trump designated a foreign terrorist organization.Venezuela says 11 killed in US boat strike were not gang members amid reports vessel was returning to shoreRead moreThe administration has provided little evidence that the first boat was carrying illegal drugs beyond asserting they had tracked the drugs being loaded on to the boat in order to be distributed in the United States, even if the boat at one point was said to have turned around.Asked on Sunday about that first strike and claims it was a fishing vessel, Trump said in response to questions from the Guardian: “You saw the bags of white. It’s nonsense. So we knew it before they even left. We knew exactly where that boat, where it came from, where the drugs came from and where it was heading.”By claiming, for the strike on the second boat, that the drugs were a threat to the United States and asserting that the boat’s crew were “terrorists”, Trump appeared to be preemptively setting the groundwork to make the same article 2 legal claim to order a missile strike against the second boat.The latest strike comes as the US continues a massive buildup of forces around Venezuela. Over the weekend, five F-35fighter jetsarrived in Puerto Rico to join about half a dozen US navy destroyers already moved to the US territory recently, and support assets the administration said had been deployed to disrupt the flow of illegal drugs.The US naval forces in the region are comprised of the Iwo Jima amphibious ready group – including the USS San Antonio, USS Iwo Jima, USS Fort Lauderdale carrying 4,500 sailors – and the 22nd marine expeditionary unit, with 2,200 marines, according to administration officials.Trump has been noncommittal about conducting military operations inside Venezuela against the drug cartels or the government, and deflected questions about the legality of the strikes on Sunday night. “What’s illegal are the drugs that were on the boat,” he told the Guardian.On Monday evening, Adam Schiff, a Democratic senator, said in apost on social mediathat “I’m drafting a resolution and forcing a vote to reclaim Congress’s power to declare war.” He said: “These lawless killings are just putting us at risk” and could prompt another country to target US forces without proper justification.For his part, from Caracas, the Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro said hours before Trump announced the second strike that his country would defend itself against foreign aggression as he lashed out at US secretary of state,Marco Rubio.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis Week in TrumplandFree newsletterA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administrationEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Many believe the US pressure campaign is partly designed to trigger defections that might help bring down Maduro’s administration and partly political theatre for a domestic audience.Still, given Trump’s unpredictable nature, members of Maduro’s regime and officials in other South American countries have watched the situation anxiously.“In Venezuela, the governing Chavistas have gone from disbelief to surprise, from surprise to indignation, and from indignation to horror” over Trump’s behaviour, the Spanish newspaper El País reported on Monday.The newspaper said Maduro’s inner circle had initially interpreted the US naval deployment as a Trumpian negotiating tactic. “As the days passed, however, they have become convinced that Washington is preparing for an invasion,” El País reported.“All that’s left is for them to shoot at the buildings we’re sitting in, damn it,” one senior official close to Maduro was quoted as saying.Quick GuideContact us about this storyShowThe best public interest journalism relies on first-hand accounts from people in the know.If you have something to share on this subject, you can contact us confidentially using the following methods.Secure Messaging in the Guardian appThe Guardian app has a tool to send tips about stories.

We’re still an independent nation,” Joseph told Guardian Australia.“The treaty can also be amended if needed in future.“We’re taking it to cabinet first, then parliament, and I’m confident it’ll get strong support.”The treaty will allow PNG citizens to join the Australian Defence Force, and for Australians to serve with PNG troops, promote interoperability between the two countries and integrate responses to a military attack.Joint military training and defence exercises are planned, as well as new cooperation on cybersecurity preparedness.Joseph said PNG was choosing Australia as its main defence partner, alluding to China’s efforts to build influence with Pacific countries, including through major infrastructure spending and loans.Andrew Hastie threatens to quit Coalition frontbench over net zeroRead more“As we hit 50 years of independence, this is a strategic move, we’re choosing Australia as our defence partner. Some external players have tried to distract us, but we’ve stayed focused.”Albanese said the delay was due to celebrations around PNG.“They all went to their respective homelands and so they didn’t have quorum at the cabinet meeting, and that’s understandable. This is about celebrating 50 years,” he said.“This is about our mutual security. This is about our mutual sovereignty as well, showing respect for each other. And it’s a natural progression of how closely we work together.”Albanese and senior Labor figures including the defence minister, Richard Marles, and the Pacific minister, Pat Conroy, are joining celebrations in Port Moresby. Prince Edward, the younger brother of King Charles, is representing Britain.Officials from China and the US are in PNG this week as well.Questions about the new agreement follow a delay to a separate deal between Australia and Vanuatu earlier this month. That deal would see Australia spend up to $500m over a decadeon climate change resilience, security services and the economy.The opposition leader, Sussan Ley, said it was appropriate that Australia and Papua New Guinea pursue security together.“Independence means a partnership of two equals sharing mutual respect,” she said.“The new treaty being finalised by Papua New Guinea and Australia will bring a transformation of our mutual partnership - providing the basis of deeper ties for the next fifty years.”The Greens’ defence spokesman, David Shoebridge, said the proposed defence treaty had not been subject to serious discussion in either Australia or PNG.“Despite the government’s rhetoric, the militarisation of the region does nothing to make us, or our neighbours, safe,” he said.Australia will fund an extension to PNG’s national parliament, adding a new ministerial wing to the building as a gift to commemorate independence.Explore more on these topicsAustralian politicsPapua New GuineaAnthony AlbaneseAsia PacificChinaPacific islandsnewsShareReuse this content"

The territory included the former British protectorate of Papua and the former German colony of New Guinea. In 1975, Papua New Guinea was granted independence.In an address at Independence Hill on Tuesday, Marape addressed a crowd of thousands.‘We dreamed of a better future’: remembering the first moments of Papua New Guinea in 1975Read more“At one minute past midnight on 16 September 1975, our first governor general, Sir John Guise, declared to the world, Papua New Guinea is now independent,” Marape said.“Earlier that evening, as the Australian flag was lowered, Sir John reminded the crowd that ‘we are lowering the Australian flag, not burying it’,” Marape said.“Out of many, we became one, united under a single flag that was hoisted for the first time,” Marape said.The prime minister said Guise’s words captured “goodwill in which independence was born not out of anger, but out of respect, humility, and faith in the future of Papua New Guinea.”Celebrations and events have been held across Papua New Guinea to mark the Golden Jubilee.Leaders gathered for the independence commemorations included Australia’s prime minister Anthony Albanese, Solomon Islands prime minister Jeremiah Manele, Cook Islands prime minister Mark Brown and Palau’s president Surangel Whipps Jr. His Royal Highness Prince Edward, the Duke of Edinburgh, and Tonga’s Crown Prince Tupoutoʻa ʻUlukalala also attended celebrations.Early on Tuesday in Port Moresby, the Papua New Guinea flag was raised with Royal Australian air force fly pass and a 50-military gun salute by PNG Defence Force on Independence Hill, near parliament.With an estimated population of about 11 million people, Papua New Guinea is the most populous nation in the Pacific after Australia. The country is grappling with deep social and economic challenges, including high levels of poverty, inadequate health and education services andhigh rates of violence.Marape said the anniversary also offered a time to “reflect on our shortcomings, that every citizen of our country looks within themselves before we look outside.”“I must admit for the last 50 years that we still have many pockets of poverty, many pockets of isolation, many pockets of communities that aren’t connected with each other, whether in transport infrastructure, education, health amongst others,” he said. He said while there are challenges, he remains optimistic.“The country will stand on firm ground and fix these problems,” Marape said.View image in fullscreenA flag raising ceremony in Port MoresbyPhotograph: Mick Tsikas/AAPOn Monday, Dame Jane Kekedo, a pioneering woman diplomacy, leadership and politics in Papua New Guinea, addressed crowds at an independence event held at Sir Hubert Murray Stadium.“There was so much optimism especially for me as 25-year-old, I was excited to see a new day and different Papua New Guinea,” she recalled.To mark 50 years of the nation’s independence, Australia will help Papua New Guinea build a new ministerial wing on to its parliament.Albanese announced the support after attending a state dinner in Port Moresby with other country representatives, including Prince Edward, on Monday.“Our support for the expansion of Parliament House is an investment in Papua New Guinea’s democracy and sovereignty that will benefit future generations,” he said on Tuesday.“As close neighbours and warm friends, the future prosperity of our two nations are bound together,” Albanese said.Explore more on these topicsPapua New GuineaPNG independence: 50 years onPacific islandsAsia PacificnewsShareReuse this content"

It’s summit season.”The meeting is expected to cover urgent issues in the bilateral relationship, including the Pentagon’s review of theAukusnuclear submarines agreement and Trump’s demands that Australia spend more on defence.Trump and senior US officials have privately urged Australia to commit to spending as much as 3.5% of GDP on defence, a potential $30bn annual increase to the defence spend of about $59bn.The Aukus review –which is being led by the undersecretary of defence and Aukus sceptic, Elbridge Colby– is due to be completed around November.

The first removal flights were due to take place on Monday and Tuesday of this week butwere cancelled. The man had been due to be on a flight to France at 9am on Wednesday.The judge, Mr Justice Sheldon, halted his removal after a decision came through during the court hearing that his claims to be a victim of trafficking required further investigation.The ruling is a significant blow to the government because many of those due to be removed under the scheme are potential victims of trafficking. Because they have only recently arrived in the UK they have not had an opportunity to have their trafficking claim fully investigated nor to obtain expert medical and psychological reports.TheHome Officeargued against halting the removal, saying that the man could get further evidence to support his trafficking claim from France. On Tuesday evening, Sheldon said he was “going to grant a short period of interim relief”.The judgment came after a decision from the national referral mechanism, which identifies and assesses victims of slavery and human trafficking, and the invitation from the body for the man to make further representations.In his oral ruling, Sheldon said: “It seems there is a serious issue to be tried with respect of the trafficking claim and whether or not the secretary of state has carried out her investigatory duties in a lawful manner.“In my view there’s a serious case to be tried as to whether or not the removal decision is lawful. If there is a reasonable suspicion he has been trafficked that would amount to a statutory bar for removal, at least for a short period of time.”Earlier on Tuesday,Downing Street denied that the returns deal with France was in chaosafter plans to forcibly remove from the UK people arriving in small boats were abandoned on Monday and Tuesday. The prime minister’s spokesperson was forced to deny that the latest delay meant theagreementwas a “shambles” when asked by reporters.A government source said the first flight was expected to take off this week.Emma Ginn, the director of the charity Medical Justice, which is supporting detainees earmarked for removal toFrance, said: “We welcome the high court decision to halt this man’s flight so that details of his case can be considered. We are in contact with people detained for the one-in, one-out scheme, the vast majority of whom are torture and trafficking survivors.“The largest group is fromEritrea. Due to the nature of what they have experienced in the countries they have passed through, histories of modern slavery and sexual abuse are recurring.”Ministers agreed theone-in, one-out pilot schemewith the French government in July as part of efforts to deter the record number of arrivals by small boat crossings so far this year.The first detentions of migrants took place last month as the deal came into force and they have been held at an immigration removal centre pending their removal from the country.Under the arrangement, the UK will send asylum seekers who have crossed the Channel back to France, in exchange for those who apply and are approved to come to Britain.Sonali Naik KC, representing the unnamed man, told the court on Tuesday he faced a “real risk of destitution” if he was put on a flight to France. She said there was a “serious issue to be tried” and that the man risked destitution in France, something the judge said he did not believe would be the case. The court heard evidence that about a third of asylum seekers in France were not accommodated and given a daily allowance of €7.50.Kate Grange KC, for the Home Office, said it was important for the agreement with France to go ahead because of the continuing risk to life of Channel crossings. “Serious injury and death, including of children, from small boat crossings in the English Channel is a grave social and political concern at the present time,” she said.The Tories said Labour’s returns deal with France was “another failed gimmick” after a scheduled deportation was blocked following a last-minute legal challenge.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumEritreaLabourFranceEuropeHome OfficeHuman traffickingnewsShareReuse this content"

The RTVE vote was held on Tuesday, the same day as a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel wascommitting genocide in Gaza.Explaining the decision, RTVE’s president, José Pablo López, said the broadcasters that comprise the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the contest, could no longer remain silent about Israel’s actions in Gaza.“As joint organisers of the Eurovision song contest, we share a collective responsibility,” he said. “While Israel has regularly participated in the competition, the current events and the genocide currently taking place make it impossible for us to look the other way.”RTÉ says Ireland will boycott Eurovision if Israel is allowed to competeRead moreLópez added: “It is not accurate to claim that Eurovision is merely an apolitical music festival. We are all aware that the contest carries significant political implications. The Israeli government is equally aware of this fact and leverages the event on the international stage.”Israel denies it is committing genocide in Gaza. Its ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, said Tuesday’s report by the UN commission of inquiry was “scandalous” and “fake”.The EBU opened a consultation process in July with the 37 broadcasters who took part in Eurovision last year after a meeting was convened, hosted by the BBC in London, to discuss the differences of opinion on Israel’s participation in 2026. AlongsideSpain, the other “big five” Eurovision countries are the UK, France, Germany and Italy.Normally, broadcasters have to let the EBU know by October whether they will participate or not, but this year the deadline has been extended until December, allowing for late decisions not to take part.López said RTVE hoped that what he called its “visible, meaningful stand” would be heeded by other EBU members and that a decision on Israel’s participation in next year’s contest would be reached soon for the sake of the long-running competition.“Our hope is that a decision can be reached well before December, as the EBU must be aware of the serious damage being done to the Eurovision song contest, which will mark its 70th anniversary in 2026,” he said.“Therefore, we hope this decision will be made earlier and that the EBU won’t be subjected to the stress of a last-minute vote in London in December. We believe that, for the good of the festival and the values ​​it has championed since its inception, this matter must be resolved before the scheduled assembly.”The next Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna in May. Eurovision is one of the world’s biggest TV events, with more than 160 million viewers this year.Russia wasbanned from the contestafter its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but Israel has continued to compete over the past two years despite growing international concerns over its actions in Gaza.Slovenia’s public broadcaster, RTV, was the first to announce it would not participate, followed by RTÉ in Ireland and Avrotros in the Netherlands last week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel’s participation in Eurovision has been a significant topic of discussion in Finland and we have been consistently informing the EBU about the conversations happening here.“The EBU is therefore well aware of the public discussion in Finland. At Yle, we have received – and continue to receive – weekly feedback on this issue, both supporting and opposing Israel’s continued participation in the Eurovision song contest.”RTL in Luxembourg, whose main shareholder is the German media group Bertelsmann, told the Guardian it would be taking part next year as the contest’s code of conduct stresses that Eurovision “is a non-political, international entertainment event”. ARD in Germany said it was participating in the consultation process launched by the EBU.Martin Green, the director of the song contest, said: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We are still consulting with all EBU members to gather views on how we manage participation and geopolitical tensions around the Eurovision song contest … It is up to each member to decide if they want to take part in the contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make.”Israel’s national public service broadcaster, Kan, which has been threatened with privatisation by Benjamin Netanyahu amidaccusations it is too leftist, has already decided it wants to take part.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionSpainIsraelEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

It is understood that further flights have been booked for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, and a government source said the first flight is expected to take off this week.First ‘one in, one out’ deportation flight reportedly takes off without migrantsRead moreUnder the “one in, one out” pilot scheme, British officials are supposed to detain some of those who cross the Channel and send them back to France, in return taking an asylum seeker in France who can show they have family connections in Britain.The deal was announced by Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron in July. Speaking at a joint press conference, the prime minister said: “There is no silver bullet here, but with a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent, we can finally turn the tables.”In a further development, French interior ministry officials have reportedly warned that the deal could be abandoned if it is not functioning well.The ministry said that it would accept only a handful of migrants this week as it stressed the “very experimental nature of this deal”.An interior ministry source told the AFP news agency: “We may terminate the agreement if we do not find it satisfactory.”It is understood that theHome Officeis facing a variety of challenges linked to the vulnerability of many of the asylum seekers detained in preparation for return to France, many of whom are survivors of torture and trafficking.On Monday two flights were due to carry a small number of asylum seekers to Paris but both were cancelled at the last minute.It is thought that some of those due to fly had lodged unsuccessful legal challenges against removal, but did not fly due to concerns raised from French authorities that the Home Office had not provided adequate notice of the vulnerabilities of some individuals, such as victims of trafficking and torture.According to thetreatysigned between UK and France last month, the UK needs to notify France in a statement “indicating that the person to be transferred may need medical assistance or care”.‘We can’t eat. We can’t sleep. It’s a disaster’: the small boat detainees waiting to be sent back to FranceRead moreThe Guardian is aware of one case in which a legal challenge lodged by an individual asylum seeker who was due to fly on Monday was unsuccessful. He was placed in a segregated area of the detention centre but was released back to his cell in the early hours of Monday and told he would not be flying after all.Detention NGOs have reported several people who had received removal directions for Monday, at least one person with removal directions for Tuesday and at least two people with removal directions for Wednesday. NGO sources say it is unclear why the person with removal directions for Tuesday had their ticket cancelled.France has reportedly said it will accept only a small initial contingent of deportations of around 50 people, while the UK has said it hopes to increase numbers over the course of the scheme in an effort to stop small boat crossings in the Channel.Lochlinn Parker, the acting director of Detention Action, said: “The government’s deal with France is failing people seeking asylum at every step. Adults and children are arriving from Afghanistan, Palestine, Syria and elsewhere, seeking our protection, only to be locked in small cells and denied the support they urgently need. The new home secretary must change course.”An estimated 31,026 people have made the journey so far this year, putting 2025 on course to be a record year for crossings.Explore more on these topicsImmigration and asylumHome OfficeFranceMigrationRefugeesEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

As itstanks lumbered through the streetstowards the centre of Gaza City, a UN commission of inquiry publisheda detailed and damning reportwhich concluded that Israelis committing genocide in Gaza.On the same day, the European Commission prepared to discuss the potential suspension of part of the Israel-EU trade agreement, while the list of countries pledging to recognise Palestine continued to grow – as did the number of statesthreatening to boycottthe Eurovision song contest if Israel took part.On the news, and on social media sites, there are daily stories of Israelis getting into scuffles or being assailed by hostile local people while on holiday abroad. For many Israelis, who have grown up thinking of themselves as an outpost of “the west” in the Middle East, all this is deeply troubling.Stocks on the Tel Aviv stock market took an immediate dip after Netanyahu’s super-Sparta speech, and the shekel fell against the dollar. Those on the trading floors who knew their ancient history remembered that the Spartans fought hard – but lost disastrously.“How romantic to fantasise about the heroic and ascetic Spartans, a mere few hundred of whom successfully fought a powerful Persian army. The problem is that Sparta was annihilated,” the veteran columnist Ben Caspit wrote in the centre-right Maariv newspaper. “It lost and disappeared.”15:34'Our Genocide': How do Israelis feel about the war in Gaza? – video“I don’t want to be Sparta,” Arnon Bar-David, the head of the country’s biggest trade union federation, Histadrut, said at a union meeting on Tuesday. “We deserve peace. Israeli society is exhausted, and our status in the world is very bad.”As the ground offensive began, a group of 80 prominent Israeli economists added up the country’s self-harm in billions of shekels. They warned that the attempt to conquer and destroy all ofGazawas “a threat to the security and economic resilience of the state of Israel, and could distance it from the group of developed countries”.In his speech on Monday, Netanyahu blamed foreigners for Israel’s increasing isolation, which he referred to as “a siege that is organised by a few states”.“One is China, and the other is Qatar. And they are organising an attack on Israel, legitimacy, in the social media of the western world and the United States,” he said. To the west, he added, the threat was different but equally pernicious.“Western Europe has large Islamist minorities. They’re vocal. Many of them are politically motivated. They align with Hamas, they align with Iran,” Netanyahu declared.“They pressure the governments of western Europe, many of whom are kindly disposed to Israel, but they see that they are being overtaken, really, by campaigns of violent protest and constant intimidation.”His remarks seemed to be a reference to the UK, France and Belgium, which are expected to recognise Palestine at the UN general assembly later this month and have been increasingly critical of Israel over the Gaza war.View image in fullscreenYair Golan, the chair of the Democrats in the Knesset, said Netanyahu wanted to remain at war to ward off elections and remain in power – and avoid jail on the corruption charges he faces.Photograph: Quique Kierszenbaum/The GuardianThe prime minister’s claim that western European governments were somehow in thrall to Islamism was an echo of conspiracy theories propagated by the growing far-right movements in those countries.Netanyahu and his coalition have increasingly made common cause with the extreme right in Europe and the US, turning a blind eye to the antisemitic lineage of those movements.As far as his domestic critics were concerned on Tuesday, Netanyahu’s heightened oratory was no more than a characteristic refusal to take responsibility for the consequences of his government’s actions.One commenter, Sever Plocker, writing in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper and using a biblical reference, said Netanyahu’s policies “truly are leading Israel straight into the tragic situation of a ‘people who shall dwell alone’, cut off from the developed western world, a country that other nations don’t want to go anywhere near, visit, host or much less trade with”.The chair of the Democrats bloc in the Knesset, Yair Golan, voiced a widespread suspicion in Israel that Netanyahu was determined to keep Israel steeped in war, as a means of warding off early elections, remaining as prime minister, and therefore staying out of jail.At a hearing of his trial oncorruption chargeson Tuesday, the prime minister did indeed use the ground offensive as an argument to limit his attendance in court.Netanyahu’s message to his citizens ahead of the Jewish new year, Golan argued, was: “In order to keep my seat, I need eternal war and isolation. And you will sacrifice the country, the economy, your children’s future and your relationship with the world.”View image in fullscreenMarco Rubio, right, the US secretary of state, whomet Netanyahu in Jerusalem, has vowed his support.Photograph: Ariel Schalit/APFor all the criticism Netanyahu has faced over the past two years of warfare, he has defied expectations by staying in power. Support from Washington – reluctantly from Joe Biden, and more indiscriminately from Donald Trump – has helped him stay in place. The Gaza City ground offensive followed a green lightdelivered in personby the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, on Monday, when he vowed “unwavering”support to eliminate Hamas.In domestic politics, meanwhile, the ultra-Orthodox and national religious electorates have risen in importance, just as Israel’s old secular, technocratic elites have faded.Netanyahu’s coalition partners on the far right welcome the siege mentality the prime minister is seeking to instil, as it wards off the prospect of compromise and foreign influence that would inhibit the drive towards a greater Israel built on the ruins of thePalestinian territories.Amihai Attali, a rightwing commentator and journalist, argued on Tuesday it was time for Israelis to realise they were in a religious war to the death, in which some economic hardship was a small price to pay.“Yes, this will take longer than we have grown accustomed to fighting; yes, this will be more exhausting and will heavily tax our national and social resources,” Attali argued in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. But, he added: “We have no option but to wield our swords.”Explore more on these topicsIsraelIsrael-Gaza warBenjamin NetanyahuPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaGazaThe far rightanalysisShareReuse this content"

The IDF is striking terror infrastructure with an iron fist,” Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, wrote on X as the attack was launched in the early hours of the morning, adding: “We will not relent until the mission is completed.”Israel’s prime minister,Benjamin Netanyahu, said the goals of the offensive were “defeating the enemy and evacuating the population”, omitting any mention of the freeing of the remaining Israeli hostages, which was been a constantly stated war aim until now. Hostage families and their supporters protested near Netanyahu’s Jerusalem residence on Tuesday, accusing him of abandoning their loved ones.The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said it was clear that Israel had no interest in a peaceful outcome.“Israel is determined to go up to the end and [is] not open to a serious negotiation for a ceasefire, with dramatic consequences from Israel’s point of view,” Guterres said.Officials from the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said two divisions were involved in the ground advance towards the centre of Gaza City, with one division surrounding it. They estimated that the invading force would be met by up to 3,000Hamasand allied fighters, and said the Israeli forces would advance cautiously.“It’s a gradual thing. It is not a black or white thing. But yesterday was a big step forward … in operations on the ground,” one IDF official said. “This phase is defined by a coordinated and gradual manoeuvre combining precise intelligence, air and ground forces targeting Hamas’s central stronghold and aimed at dismantling its grip in this area.”Some of the principal weapons being used in the offensive are old model armoured personnel carriers, converted so that they are controlled remotely, and loaded with explosives. According to Israeli reports, they are being driven at suspected Hamas positions and detonated.View image in fullscreenIsraeli tanks and armoured vehicles at the Gaza border. The latest phase of Israel’s offensive involved both air and ground forces.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe health ministry in Gaza reported on Tuesday afternoon that 59 people had been killed and 386 wounded in the previous 24 hours, bringing the official toll of Palestinians from nearly two years of war to almost 65,000. The actual number is feared to be significantly higher.The ground assault was launched on the day that a UN panel of human rights experts published a reportaccusing Israel of committing genocide.“It is clear that there is an intent to destroy the Palestinians in Gaza through acts that meet the criteria set forth in the genocide convention,” said Navi Pillay, the chair of the commission of inquiry on the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel.Israel’s foreign ministry rejected the commission’s report as “distorted and false”.The country faced the threat of mounting isolation, however, as it pressed ahead with its offensive. On Wednesday, the European Commission was due to present a plan to member states to impose “measures to pressure the Israeli government to change course over the war in Gaza”, said the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas.“Israel’s ground offensive in Gaza will make an already desperate situation even worse,” Kallas said, adding: “It will mean more death, more destruction [and] more displacement.”“Suspending trade concessions and imposing sanctions on extremist ministers and violent settlers would clearly signal that the EU demands an end to this war,” she said.Netanyahu sought to brace the country for greater economic isolation in a speech on Monday in which he said it would have to “adapt to an economy with autarkic features”, suggesting it would have to be more self-reliant with fewer trade options.Gaza City residents reported a night of intense bombardment before the ground assault was launched. The IDF believes 40% of the estimated 1 million population of Gaza City and its outskirts have so far left after Israeli evacuation orders. Israel warned those remaining to follow and to flee southwards.View image in fullscreenPalestinians flee south along Gaza’s coastal road on Tuesday.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APAccording to UN data, 140,000 people have fled Gaza City heading south over the past month. Tess Ingram, a spokesperson for the UN child protection agency, Unicef, said there was no safe haven for the displaced population.“It is inhumane to expect nearly half a million children, battered and traumatised by over 700 days of unrelenting conflict, to flee one hellscape and end up in another,” Ingram told reporters from al-Mawasi, an overcrowded sprawling tented camp on the southern coast of Gaza Strip.“People really do have no good option – stay in danger or flee to a place that they also know is dangerous,” Ingram said.The Arabic-language spokesperson for the IDF, Col Avichay Adraee, announced: “The IDF has begun dismantling Hamas terrorist infrastructure in Gaza City.”“Gaza City is a dangerous combat zone. Remaining in the city endangers you,” he said on social media.When news broke of the ground operations on Tuesday morning, Netanyahu was attending a hearing of his corruption trial in a Tel Aviv court, and used the offensive as an argument why he could not attend long or frequent court sessions. His critics have long argued he has prolonged the Gaza war to put off elections, stay in office and thereby preserve his legal immunity.The ground assault was launched in the immediate wake of a two-day visit from the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, whohad pledged “unwavering” US support for Israel.Once the ground offensive was launched, Donald Trump directed blame at Hamas, telling reporters at the White House that the militants would have “hell to pay” if it used the surviving hostages as human shields during the assault.Explore more on these topicsGazaIsraelPalestinian territoriesMiddle East and north AfricaBenjamin NetanyahuHamasIsrael-Gaza warnewsShareReuse this content"

Israel’s ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, called the report a scandalous and fake “libellous rant” that had been authored by “Hamas proxies”. Israel has declined to cooperate with the COI, accusing it of having a political agenda.The 72-page report was published as Israellaunched a ground offensivein Gaza City after weeks of intense bombardment in and around the territory’s largest urban centre, where about 1 million people have been living, many displaced from other areas of the territory.The 23-month-long war was triggered in October 2023 when Hamas launched a deadly attack into Israel in which militants killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 hostage.So far, the ensuing Israeli offensive has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and injured more than 160,000. Last month, a respected global hunger monitoring groupdeclared a faminein parts of Gaza.View image in fullscreenPeople struggle to get donated food at a community kitchen in Khan Younis on 1 September.Photograph: Abdel Kareem Hana/APThe independent COI’s analysis is the strongest finding by a UN body to date but its conclusions do not represent the UN’s official position. The world body itself has not yet used the term genocide, but is under growing pressure to do so.The mathematics of starvation: how Israel caused a famine in GazaRead moreUN insiders said on Tuesday that the report would influence key actors within the organisation and member governments but there was little chance that it would be “adopted by the UN in any collective way”.On Tuesday, Volker Türk, the UN’s high commissioner on human rights, said evidence of a “genocide” unfolding in Gaza was mounting.“We see the piling up of war crime after war crime after war crime, of crime against humanity, and potentially even more,” Türk said. “It’s for the court to decide whether it’s genocide or not, and we see the evidence mounting.”Last month, hundreds of Türk’s own staffsigned an internal lettertelling him to declare Israel’s offensive in Gaza a genocide and to call on UN member states to suspend arms sales to Israel.Citing as evidence interviews with victims, witnesses and doctors, reporting by media and NGOs as well as satellite imagery analysis compiled since the war began, the COI concluded that Israeli authorities and forces had since October 2023 committed “four of the five genocidal acts” listed in the 1948 genocide convention.The convention, adopted in the wake of the murder of 6 million Jews in the Holocaust, defines genocide as crimes committed “with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such”.The report said Israeli leaders had continued with a strategy that inflicted massive harm on civilians despite being aware of the consequences of its choice.“Israel has used heavy unguided munitions with a wide margin of error in densely populated residential areas … The number of bombs used by Israel since 7 October 2023 is extraordinary even in comparison to other world conflicts,” the report said.The commission also pointed to deaths and suffering that resulted from attacks on Gaza’s health system and accused Israel of covering up wrongdoing.View image in fullscreenPeople inspect the scale of destruction after al-Ghafri Tower in Gaza City was destroyed by an Israeli attack on Monday.Photograph: Anadolu/Getty ImagesThe report said explicit statements by Israeli civilian and military authorities, along with the pattern of the conduct of the Israeli forces, “indicated that the genocidal acts were committed with intent to destroy … Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as a group”.It cited as evidence a letter Netanyahu wrote to Israeli soldiers in November 2023 in which he compared the Gaza operation to what the commission described as a “holy war of total annihilation” in the Hebrew Bible.Pillay, a former South African judge who has served as a judge at the international criminal court and headed the international tribunal for Rwanda, said the international community “cannot stay silent on the genocidal campaign launched by Israel against the Palestinian people in Gaza”.Israel has consistently rejected all accusations of genocide, citing its right to self-defence. Last January, the international court of justiceordered Israel to preventgenocidal acts in Gaza. Four months later, the ICCissued arrest warrantsfor Netanyahu and Gallant for suspected war crimes and crimes against humanity.Explore more on these topicsIsrael-Gaza warIsraelBenjamin NetanyahuGazaPalestinian territoriesUnited NationsMiddle East and north AfricanewsShareReuse this content"

PreviousDepartment for Education (DfE) datafound that about one in five children were classed as SEN last year, including 482,000 in England with educational, health and care plans (EHCPs) that detail specific support for individual children.Jason Elsom, Parentkind’s chief executive, said: “Despite the best efforts of our schools, hundreds of thousands of families are hurting because our SEN system is broken.“Families should not have to wait months or years to receive the support they so desperately need. Our measure as a society should be the way we treat our most vulnerable, and this should weigh heavily on our shoulders.”Parentkind is the UK’s largestparent-school charity, working with more than 24,000 parent teacher associations and school parent councils.Half of parents who sought an assessment said it was undertaken by the school and half said that they were still waiting or had paid for a private assessment. A quarter of those waiting said they had been doing so for more than a year.The survey also laid bare the personal cost that many parents face coping with a child with special needs: 15% said they had given up their job to care for their child, while 20% said they had taken time off from paid work.A third of parents of children with SEN said they faced “financial strain due to additional costs” and increased tensions at home, while 40% said they had experienced their own mental health problems.There have been sharp rises in diagnoses of autism, ADHD and speech and language needs among children in recent years, with speech disorders and social and emotional issues increasing rapidly since the Covid pandemic.The Institute for Fiscal Studies has described England’s increases in special educational needs and disabilities (Send) as “staggering”, reflecting “improved recognition of needs that were always there” through greater awareness and diagnosis.‘It was personal, critical’: Bristol parents’ long battle over council Send servicesRead moreBridget Phillipson, the education secretary for England, has said the DfE will publish a white paper outlining its plans for reform later this year. It is expected to expand special needs provision within mainstream schools and encourage the creation of specialist units within them.But many parents and campaigners fear that the reforms will curtail the use of EHCPs, and arally took place outside parliamentearlier this week.The DfE said it is “committed to improving inclusivity and expertise in mainstream schools”, but the department faces an uphill struggle with the Treasury for funding for more special school places.The DfE said: “This government inherited a Send system left on its knees – which is why we are listening closely to parents as we work to improve experiences and outcomes for all children with Send, wherever they are in the country. Our starting point will always be improving support for children.”Explore more on these topicsSpecial educational needsSchoolsParents and parentingDisabilityDepartment for EducationChildren's healthnewsShareReuse this content"

This report proves that this is not, currently, the case.”She added that the government’s upcoming investigation intoNHSmaternity care must be a “turning point” for black women in particular. “In-built structural racism in maternity services repeatedly fails Black women.Acknowledging this and addressing racial disparities in maternal outcomes must be one of the investigation’s core aims,” she added.The rate of maternal death in Black womenThe rate of maternal death in Black womenThe committee also found that given these disparities, it was “indefensible” that cultural competency training was not mandatory for NHS staff working across maternity services. They urged the government, the Royal College of Midwives and the Nursing and Midwifery Council to make the training compulsory for all staff, and that the training should be informed directly by the experience of black women.Inadequate data collection was also cited as a factor for the ethnic disparities across maternity care, with the committee finding that a significant number of individual NHS trusts were failing to consistently record this information, and that this lack of robust data resulted in a system being “blind to its failings”. As a result, the committee also urged the government to accelerate development of a maternal morbidity indicator, which it has already committed to producing.The report comes after previous findings by the advocacy group Five X More, which found thatalmost half of pregnant black womenraised concerns to healthcare professionals during labour, with half saying that their concerns were not properly addressed.Tinuke Awe, a co-founder of Five X More, said that the committee report was welcomed, and that there was an “urgent need to tackle systemic failings in maternity care” for black women.Awe added: “For too long, Black women have been ignored in maternity care, and the recommendations in this report highlight that change is overdue. We believe now is the time to act. Fix it for Black women, fix it for all women.”Clare Livingstone, the head of policy and practice at the Royal College of Midwives, said that black women being at greater risk during pregnancy and childbirth was a “disgrace”.“The recommendations in this report must be acted upon urgently and everyone in maternity services must work together to tackle these shocking disparities,” Livingstone said. “It should not be the case that these inequalities exist in England today.”A Department ofHealthand Social Care spokesperson said:“Racism in any form is completely unacceptable and we are determined to reduce the shocking disparities that this report addresses.“We’re already taking action to improve maternity care, including launching an anti-discrimination programme, training thousands more midwives, and introducing new standards to tackle leading causes of maternal mortality.”Explore more on these topicsHealthEnglandWomenNHSRaceHealth policyChildbirthnewsShareReuse this content"

Yvette Cooper, the foreign secretary, was among those assembled near the foot of the aircraft to meet the president off the plane.Trump then walked with his wife to their helicopter, Marine One, which took off at 9.25pm. The Trumps travelled to Winfield House, the official London residence of the US ambassador in Regent’s Park.On Tuesday, about 70 protesters gathered outside Windsor Castle to demonstrate against Trump’s historic second state visit to the UK, marking the first in a series of planned demonstrations against the US president throughout his stay.The Stop Trump Coalition’s protest stood peacefully on Windsor high street before marching the short distance up to the castle’s King Henry VIII gateway.

Does anyone believe that this disgusting man deserves this unprecedented treatment?”Jake Atkinson, spokesperson for the Stop Trump Coalition, said: “Donald Trump’s politics are politics of fascism and authoritarianism. Not only are we making our voices heard in opposition to Trump and his politics, but we want to send a signal to our government, that this is not how the British people feel, it’s not what the British people want.“We want to stand in solidarity with people in the US, with people in Palestine, with people in Ukraine, and with people all over the world who are seeing Trump’s politics do damage to our democracy and to our planet.View image in fullscreenProtesters gather outside Windsor Castle earlier on Tuesday before the arrival of Donald Trump.Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The GuardianKing Charles and Camilla will greet Donald and Melania Trump with a ceremonial welcome at Windsor Castle. As they shake hands, gun salutes will be fired simultaneously by the British army in Windsor and at the Tower of London.The largest guard of honour ever at a state visit will be presented to Trump for inspection, according to the Ministry of Defence. About 1,300 members of the British military and 120 horses will be involved, with 160 personnel from the Royal Marines and Royal Navy, 1,000 from the British army and 140 from the Royal Air Force.The US president, whose taste for pomp and pageantry is well known, will join Charles for a carriage procession towards the castle, accompanied by the sovereign’s escort of the household cavalry mounted regiment.British and US musicians will perform a special Beating Retreat military ceremony, the first time it will be performed at a state visit. The lavish state banquet will feature performances by the Duchess of Edinburgh’s String Orchestra, the State Trumpeters of the Household Cavalry and pipers from the Scots Guards.Trump will head to Keir Starmer’s country residence, Chequers, in Buckinghamshire on Thursday, with aviators from RAF Halton lining the route on his arrival.In Windsor some came out in support of Trump. Anne Daley, 65, had come from Cardiff, brandishing a cardboard cutout of Trump and wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat.She said she hoped Trump’s visit could help broker world peace. “​​We need him inside the tent,” she said of the president. “We need him as an ally. We need America. I hope that when they have afternoon tea with the king, they can [agree] to stop bombing Palestinian people. And stop bombing Ukraine. Children are being killed – for what reason?’One local resident, David Citrine, 73, said he wouldn’t be protesting but felt the demonstration did reflect the views of most UK citizens. “I wouldn’t say he’s my favourite person in the world,” he said. “[The state visit] is obviously to placate Trump, but I’d probably prefer it if he wasn’t coming.”Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpnewsShareReuse this content"

Other countries face tariffs of 50% on their steel exports.However, another government source said that under the deal that had been negotiated, but has now been shelved, the steel export quota would have increased once US concerns about the source of Britain’s raw material imports were resolved.The disclosure will raise questions about why the proposed deal has fallen apart at the last minute. It marks a fresh setback for Keir Starmer after a difficult two weeks dominated by the resignations of three senior government figures and mounting questions about the prime minister’s judgment.Meanwhile, Starmer is due to unveil a technology pact with the US involving an estimated £31bn in investment and he announced an AI “growth zone” in north-east England, creating potential for more than 5,000 jobs.The deal includes a domestic version of the White House’s Stargate AI infrastructure project, in which ChatGPT provider Open AI, the chip manufacturer Nvidia and UK data company Nscale will back a datacentre in Wallsend. Ministers are hoping that deals with the US on technology and nuclear energy this week will give the government a boost.The trade deal announced by the US and UK in May was supposed to reduce tariffs on steel from 25% to 0%, but its implementation was put on hold over US concerns about the UK becoming a backdoor for cheap steel imports from other countries.Speaking before his flight to London, Trump had raised hopes of a breakthrough by saying the UK government would “like to see if they could get a little bit better deal, so we’ll talk to them”. Ministers insist that negotiations with the US over reducing the steel tariff to zero are ongoing.A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the strength of the UK-US partnership, we are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.“We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our plan for change.”Steel industry figures, who had expected a 0% rate on exports, expressed disappointment at the news.“It’s disappointing – perhaps not 100% surprising,” said one steel industry executive. “Some products might not be possible to sell to the US. Others we can pass it on. It could be worse.“Getting certainty is sometimes better than just continuing negotiations. That period of uncertainty has been really quite difficult to handle for steel companies.”Another industry insider said they were relieved that UK exports would continue to have an advantage over those from the EU, which face prohibitive tariffs.Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, said it would be “disappointing if we do not have the tariff-free quota level” but that a “final decision on 25% offers a degree of certainty and potentially a competitive advantage so long as other countries remain at 50%”.The prime minister said the £31bn investment deal marked a “generational step change” in the UK’s relationship with the US and would deliver “growth, security and opportunity up and down the country”. He said the partnership would create highly skilled jobs and put “more money in people’s pockets”.No 10 said the agreement did not involve any regulatory or tax concessions to big tech.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others warned of the environmental costs of building huge datacentres.In all, the pact should see the deployment of 120,000 advanced GPUs – the chips required to power AI – described by the government and Nvidia as the biggest rollout in Europe. There will also be a joint US-UK taskforce on developing quantum computers.The new AI growth zone is designed to boost construction of datacentres – the central nervous system of AI technology – and will encompass the north-east combined authority, which includes Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham.The zone will include an already-planned datacentre in Blyth, Northumberland, backed by a £10bn commitment from US investment firm Blackstone.Other announcements in the tech pact include a multi-year investment by Microsoft, including backing the UK’s largest supercomputer in Essex and multibillion dollar investment commitments from US tech firms CoreWeave and Salesforce.But Nick Dearden, director ofGlobal Justice Now, an anti-corporate globalisation campaign group, warned that the US investment must not come at the cost of the UK’s ability to tax and regulate new technology.“If we give it up, we become no more than a source of profit for the richest people in the world to extract our data, water and other resources,” he said.“Starmer promised to build a strong tech British industry. But this pact is turning us into no more than an aircraft carrier for US big tech.“This is dangerous and once we’re totally locked into dependence on these gigantic private monopolies we will regret this deal.”Other campaigners warned of the environmental costs, amid estimates that the Blyth datacentre, which was trumpeted as part of the US-UK tech pact and is being backed by Blackstone, an investment firm led by Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman, will emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as Birmingham airport.“Following the queasy spectacle of CEOs from tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI queueing up to pay tribute at the White House this month, it’s little surprise to hear that the Trump-big tech axis is dead set on covering the UK in hyperscale datacentres,” said Donald Campbell, advocacy director at tech justice non-profitFoxglove.“Meanwhile, the UK will foot the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need – meaning rocketing prices for households – as well as the water needed to keep them cool.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyDonald TrumpSteel industryTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

On Thursday he will hold talks with Starmer at Chequers, the prime minister’s country retreat.While there are plans for demonstrations targeting the president, the schedule means he is unlikely to see any of them. But as with any interaction with Trump, the visit is filled with uncertainty and political risk for Starmer, particularly the planned joint press conference at Chequers.In an article for the Guardian, Khan said that while he understood the pragmatic reasons for maintaining good links with the US, Britain should not be afraid of criticising a leader who alongside his allies, he said, had “perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years”.Khan, whopublicly clashedwith Trump during his first state visit in 2019, condemned Trump’s use of the military in diverse cities, as well as the way some US citizens had been deported without due process: “These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.”How huge London far-right march lifted the lid on a toxic transatlantic soupRead moreThe so-called special relationship between the UK and US, Khan said, “includes being open and honest with each other”, adding: “At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power. This includes being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division.”Khan also criticised British politicians and the media for failing to condemn increased hatred and intolerance, saying this had directly led tothe huge far-right demonstrationin London at the weekend.“The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere,” he said of the protest, which was led by the anti-Islam activist Tommy Robinson. “For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.”He went on: “For our leaders, silence is no longer enough. The time has come to stand up and say: this is not who we are.”Starmer has faced criticism for a seemingly slow response in condemning Saturday’s march, which also had a video address from Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X, who said “violence is coming”, telling the crowd that “you either fight back or you die”.But in more robust comments to a meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday morning,Starmer said thatthe UK faced “the fight of our times” against the division exemplified by the march.According to a summary of his remarks, Starmer told his ministers “that some of the scenes of police officers being attacked on Saturday, and a march led by a convicted criminal, were not just shocking but sent a chill through the spines of people around the country, and particularly many ethnic minority Britons”.It continued: “He said we are in the fight of our times between patriotic national renewal and decline and toxic division. He said the government must heed the patriotic call of national renewal, and that this was a fight that has to be won.”View image in fullscreenAnti-Trump demonstrators.Photograph: Phil Noble/ReutersIn the first response from the government, the business secretary, Peter Kyle, said on Sunday that he was not disturbed by the scale of the event or the far-right rhetoric heard at it “because it’s actually proof that we live in a country where free speech, free association, is alive and well”.Asked why the No 10 line had seemingly moved on from Kyle’s view, Starmer’s official spokesperson said this was only part of the picture.“Obviously, freedom of speech, freedom to march, is a core part of this country’s values,” he said. “But what he’s saying is, when some people see a convicted criminal egged on by foreign billionaire calling for violence, some people are going to legitimately feel scared and intimidated. Some of that will be because of their background or the colour of their skin.”Wes Streetingused a speech to the LGBT foundationon Monday to say that he found it “laughable” that rising racism and homophobia could be seen as a sign of free speech.The health secretary said he understood why some were questioning “whether this government is really on our side”, adding that the weekend’s protest was “not the kind of country any of us want to live in”.Explore more on these topicsDonald TrumpSadiq KhanThe far rightFar rightFar right (US)King Charles IIInewsShareReuse this content"

In reality, according to the nonpartisan Gun Violence Archive, only about 0.1% of such shootings over the previous decade had allegedly been carried out by people who are trans.Prosecutors allege that, after Robinson’s arrest in Kirk’s killing, his mother told investigators that her son had spent the previous year or so becoming “more political and had started to lean more to the left – becoming more pro-gay and trans rights oriented”.Texts, plans and a confession: prosecutor lays out startling details in Charlie Kirk shootingRead moreCombined with his relationship with his roommate, “this resulted in several discussions with family members, but especially between Robinson and his father, who have very different political views”, prosecutors added.Prior media reporting established that Robinson’s parents were registered Republican voters who cast ballots in the 2024 election that resulted in a second presidency for Donald Trump, with whom Kirk was closely aligned. Prosecutors said a text from Robinson to his roommate showed the suspect perceived his father to be “pretty diehard maga” – referring to Trump’s make America great again slogan – ever since the president retook the Oval Office in January.According to prosecutors, “in one conversation before the shooting, Robinson mentioned that Charlie Kirk would be holding an event at UVU, which Robinson said was a ‘stupid venue’ for the event”, his mother told investigators.Prosecutors recounted that the mother told investigators her son – during that conversation – also “accused Kirk of spreading hate”.Robinson’s parents allegedly told investigators that they began to realize their son had evidently killed Kirk when his wife showed him a surveillance image of the suspected shooter in the news. According to prosecutors, the couple agreed it looked like Robinson – and his father, a licensed hunter, feared the rifle that police suspected had been used to kill Kirk matched one he gave his son as a gift.The father and son soon spoke, and the younger man suggested he had killed Kirk, the elder Robinson reported to investigators, according to prosecutors. Tyler explained “there is too much evil” and the Turning Point USA executive director “spreads too much hate”.Robinson eventually surrendered to authorities the day after Kirk’s killing with help from a family friend who was also a local law enforcement official.Prosecutors said DNA evidence found on the rifle used to kill Kirk – which had been discarded near UVU – as well as texts to the roommate prior to Robinson’s arrest further tied him to the slaying.News about engravings on bullet casings found near the Kirk murder weapon after the killing sparked widespread speculation about the political leanings of whoever wielded the rifle. But Robinson’s text to his roommate, as cited by prosecutors, evidently dismissed those as “fuckin … mostly a big meme”.Prosecutors said those inscriptions included the phrases “hey fascist” and “O bella ciao,” the signature lyric of an Italian anti-fascist resistance song heard repeatedly on the popular Netflix show Money Heist.Among the texts revealed by prosecutors was one in which the roommate asked Robinson, “You weren’t the one who did it right?”Robinson – who referred to his roommate in the texts at least twice as his “love” – allegedly replied, “I am, I’m sorry.”According to the texts, Robinson additionally apologized for having to “involve” the roommate. “I had hoped to keep this secret till I died of old age,” Robinson wrote, as prosecutors put it.The most serious charge filed against Robinson is aggravated murder. Prosecutors said they intended to pursue the death penalty against Robinson if he was convicted of it – and the suspect would remain in custody without bond at the jail where he was booked after his arrest.One of the aggravating factors supporting Robinson’s capital murder charge is the fact that he evidently targeted “Charlie Kirk based on Charlie Kirk’s political expression”, said Jeff Gray, the top state prosecutor in UVU’s home county.With the Trump administration alreadythreateningto crack down on liberal groups in the wake of Kirk’s murder, Gray said, “I do not take this decision lightly.“And it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence – and circumstances and nature of the crime.”Explore more on these topicsCharlie Kirk shootingUtahUS crimeUS politicsnewsShareReuse this content"

The projectile had punctured the burro’s right lung, said Chad Cheatham, vice-president of DonkeyLand, a non-profit rescue organization.“Right now she’s stable and is standing, which is a huge improvement,” Cheatham said Monday. When Cupid is fully recovered, she will join a group of rescued burros who meander DonkeyLand’s 2,000-acre (800-hectare) sanctuary and wildlife preserve.The rescue group is offering a $24,000 reward, raised from donations, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in at least six bow attacks on burros over the past several months.The Riverside county department of animal services said on Tuesday that the investigation is ongoing, and asked for the public’s help in identifying a suspect or suspects.Wild burros are protected under federal law. They are an iconic symbol of the US south-west, dating to their days as pack animals for people flocking to California during the Gold Rush.Cheatham said burros have become an “unofficial mascot” of Moreno Valley, where hundreds of them have rambled freely for at least 75 years. They even help with wildfire abatement by munching on tinder – dry grass in remote and ready-to-burn canyons across Riverside and San Bernardino counties, he said.“So they really do provide a benefit to the community. The firefighters love them because, they say: ‘Man, these guys can go places we can’t go,’ ” Cheatham said.The animals are docile but sometimes they can be a nuisance if they chomp on residents’ flowers or block roads when motorists stop to feed them from their cars, he said.Last year, neighboring San Bernardino county, where wild burros are estimated to number in the thousands, contracted with the non-profit Peaceful Valley Donkey Rescue to humanely capture the animals and relocate them to sanctuaries.“While the wild burros delight many residents and visitors, they also commonly encounter vehicle traffic and freight trains, resulting in tragedy for burros and humans,” the county said in a statement. “The burros also seriously injure themselves leading to infection and death when they become entangled in fencing or when their hooves get caught in cemetery flower vases.”The arrows used in the Moreno Valley attacks were broadheads, a style traditionally used for hunting, said Cheatham. According to DonkeyLand, the first attack occurred the weekend of 14 June, when a young burro was found grazing with an arrow in her side not far from where Cupid was discovered. A few days later, a second burro was found shot with a similar style of arrow in the same area.Since then, at least three other donkeys were shot in the vicinity, including a pair estimated to be two to four months old, the rescue group said.Healthy donkeys typically live 40 years or more and vary in size from waist-high “minis” that may weigh 300lbs (135kg) to bulky “mammoths”.Last year, two men pleaded guilty to federal charges for using high-powered rifles to kill three wild burros in southern California’s Mojave Desert, about 90 miles (145km) north of Moreno Valley.Explore more on these topicsCaliforniaAnimalsWest CoastnewsShareReuse this content"

There are parts of the building that have not been fixed. We have closed bathrooms all over the place. The front door doesn’t work, it’s been broken for two months, but we have money for a stupid banner,” said one worker, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution.“Seeing her in that cabinet meeting where she begged Trump to look at it, it’s embarrassing.

In the meantime, employers are being pushed to perform self-audits.This, coupled with the drastic staffing cuts faced throughout the US Department of Labor, they argued, is undermining the department’s ability to enforce wage and hour laws.“We don’t have manning to do these enforcement, day-in-day-out, jobs,” they added. “The department has tried to push these self-audits, where they are allowing bad actors to self-audit,” they said. “Those bad actors are going to essentially get away with it.”The Department of Labor only provided comment on the maintenance and repairs, claiming they were working to improve the overall maintenance of the building, and claimed all 91 bathrooms had recently been repaired.“This fake news hit piece is exactly why public trust in the mainstream media is at historic lows,” said a labor department spokesperson, Courtney Parella.Morale has plummeted as the national office amid all the cuts at the agency, threats, harassment and intimidation from the administration, and new policies, such as security bag screenings to get into the building every day, said workers.“It’s kind of like working in a prison,” they added. “It’s very clear how they treat us is a bellwether for how they want other workers to be treated.”“The Department of Labor is being deployed fully as one arm of this president’s war on workers, which is even more painful given that the mission of the Department of Labor is to protect workers,” said Julie Su, who served as secretary of labor under the Biden administration. “The way you treat your own workers is a sign of how you believe workers in general deserve to be treated. And this administration has taken a very destructive approach to its own workers.”Su also criticized the Department of Labor’s adoption of rhetoric from the Trump administration, inclaimingto “put American workers first” and usher in a “golden age” for “American workers”.“This administration, they constantly talk about doing right by American workers. That’s a pretty coded way of saying what they want to say, which is that they no longer believe that immigrant workers deserve protection and that’s part of their overall war on workers,” Su said. “It’s an anti-immigrant philosophy of the entire administration, but for the Department of Labor to adopt it is especially harmful, because so many workers who keep our economy going are immigrant workers.”She cited other examples of policies that harm workers being pursued by this administration, fromcutting $500min grants dedicated toward fighting child labor and forced labor abroad,delayingimplementation of a rule to protect coalminers from silica dust exposure, pushing tocreate an exemptionfor employers to the general duty clause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act that obligates employers to keep workers safe on the job, andceasingenforcement of expanded labor protections for immigrant farm workers on H-2A temporary visas.Among the deregulations being pushed by the Department of Labor includeproposing a ruleto exempt3.7 millionhome health and personal care workers in the US from minimum wage and overtime protections.These workers arepredominantlywomen and paid low wages, with immigrants comprising asignificantand growing portion of the workforce.“What the US Department of Labor is proposing is the Trump administration reversing history, and saying, no, wait a minute, home care workers are not deserving of overtime protections, of minimum wage, and that just sets us back into a whole other era,” said Arnulfo De La Cruz, president of SEIU Local 2015, which representsover half a millionlong-term care workers in California. “This change would undo a decade of progress toward recognizing home care as real professional work, and this is yet another Trump administration attack on workers. This comes down to special interests who want to increase their profits by paying workers less.”Astrid Zuniga, a home care worker in Modesto, California, and president of United Domestic Workers of America, UDW/AFSCME Local 3930, said she would stand to lose about $1,200 a month if overtime protections are removed for care workers, which she relies on to cover the costs of medications her son needs, who has autism, epilepsy and other intellectual disabilities, and who she cares for 24/7.View image in fullscreenAstrid Zuniga, home care worker in Modesto, California.Photograph: Courtesy of AFSCME“To lose that much money a month, when most of us already live paycheck to paycheck as it is, would be damaging to many households,” said Zuniga. “When you go and you implement these kinds of cuts to the low-wage workforce, that only hurts the workers and most of these workers are making right at about minimum wage.”She emphasized home care workers were already bracing for the impact of Medicaid cuts to benefits and services that will also decrease their ability to provide services to clients.“Home care is thefastest-growing sectorof workers across the nation. It is the highest in demand. Nobody is getting any younger or any healthier,” she added. “Cuts should not be made to these types of services,” she said. “And if we’re not making this a desirable workforce and not making investments into these kinds of home- and community-based services that our most vulnerable communities rely on, what are we doing?”“I think the message is that they think workers have it too good, too many protections, too high of wages, too much security. Their view is that workers are too comfortable,” added Su.Explore more on these topicsTrump administrationUS unionsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Other countries face tariffs of 50% on their steel exports.However, another government source said that under the deal that had been negotiated, but has now been shelved, the steel export quota would have increased once US concerns about the source of Britain’s raw material imports were resolved.The disclosure will raise questions about why the proposed deal has fallen apart at the last minute. It marks a fresh setback for Keir Starmer after a difficult two weeks dominated by the resignations of three senior government figures and mounting questions about the prime minister’s judgment.Meanwhile, Starmer is due to unveil a technology pact with the US involving an estimated £31bn in investment and he announced an AI “growth zone” in north-east England, creating potential for more than 5,000 jobs.The deal includes a domestic version of the White House’s Stargate AI infrastructure project, in which ChatGPT provider Open AI, the chip manufacturer Nvidia and UK data company Nscale will back a datacentre in Wallsend. Ministers are hoping that deals with the US on technology and nuclear energy this week will give the government a boost.The trade deal announced by the US and UK in May was supposed to reduce tariffs on steel from 25% to 0%, but its implementation was put on hold over US concerns about the UK becoming a backdoor for cheap steel imports from other countries.Speaking before his flight to London, Trump had raised hopes of a breakthrough by saying the UK government would “like to see if they could get a little bit better deal, so we’ll talk to them”. Ministers insist that negotiations with the US over reducing the steel tariff to zero are ongoing.A government spokesperson said: “Thanks to the strength of the UK-US partnership, we are still the only country to benefit from a 25% tariff on steel exports to the US, reinforcing our position as a trusted source of high-quality steel.“We are continuing to work closely with the US to deliver certainty for UK industry, protect skilled jobs and support economic growth as part of our plan for change.”Steel industry figures, who had expected a 0% rate on exports, expressed disappointment at the news.“It’s disappointing – perhaps not 100% surprising,” said one steel industry executive. “Some products might not be possible to sell to the US. Others we can pass it on. It could be worse.“Getting certainty is sometimes better than just continuing negotiations. That period of uncertainty has been really quite difficult to handle for steel companies.”Another industry insider said they were relieved that UK exports would continue to have an advantage over those from the EU, which face prohibitive tariffs.Gareth Stace, the director general of UK Steel, said it would be “disappointing if we do not have the tariff-free quota level” but that a “final decision on 25% offers a degree of certainty and potentially a competitive advantage so long as other countries remain at 50%”.The prime minister said the £31bn investment deal marked a “generational step change” in the UK’s relationship with the US and would deliver “growth, security and opportunity up and down the country”. He said the partnership would create highly skilled jobs and put “more money in people’s pockets”.No 10 said the agreement did not involve any regulatory or tax concessions to big tech.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Others warned of the environmental costs of building huge datacentres.In all, the pact should see the deployment of 120,000 advanced GPUs – the chips required to power AI – described by the government and Nvidia as the biggest rollout in Europe. There will also be a joint US-UK taskforce on developing quantum computers.The new AI growth zone is designed to boost construction of datacentres – the central nervous system of AI technology – and will encompass the north-east combined authority, which includes Newcastle, Sunderland and Durham.The zone will include an already-planned datacentre in Blyth, Northumberland, backed by a £10bn commitment from US investment firm Blackstone.Other announcements in the tech pact include a multi-year investment by Microsoft, including backing the UK’s largest supercomputer in Essex and multibillion dollar investment commitments from US tech firms CoreWeave and Salesforce.But Nick Dearden, director ofGlobal Justice Now, an anti-corporate globalisation campaign group, warned that the US investment must not come at the cost of the UK’s ability to tax and regulate new technology.“If we give it up, we become no more than a source of profit for the richest people in the world to extract our data, water and other resources,” he said.“Starmer promised to build a strong tech British industry. But this pact is turning us into no more than an aircraft carrier for US big tech.“This is dangerous and once we’re totally locked into dependence on these gigantic private monopolies we will regret this deal.”Other campaigners warned of the environmental costs, amid estimates that the Blyth datacentre, which was trumpeted as part of the US-UK tech pact and is being backed by Blackstone, an investment firm led by Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman, will emit the same amount of carbon dioxide as Birmingham airport.“Following the queasy spectacle of CEOs from tech giants like Google, Meta and OpenAI queueing up to pay tribute at the White House this month, it’s little surprise to hear that the Trump-big tech axis is dead set on covering the UK in hyperscale datacentres,” said Donald Campbell, advocacy director at tech justice non-profitFoxglove.“Meanwhile, the UK will foot the bill for the colossal amounts of power the giants need – meaning rocketing prices for households – as well as the water needed to keep them cool.”Explore more on these topicsTrade policyDonald TrumpSteel industryTariffsnewsShareReuse this content"

The ruling from the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit means Cook may remain in her position during the policy meeting where the Fed is expected to cut interest rates.Miran’s appointment marks the first time in the history of the modern Federal Reserve, which stretches back almost a century, that a sitting member of the executive branch would also work at the highest levels of the central bank.As US edges closer to stagflation, economists blame Trump policiesRead moreTrump has made no secret of his plans to influence the Fed, calling into question the future of its longstanding independence from political oversight by publicly describing plans to swiftly build “a majority” on its board.He has repeatedly broken with precedent – presidents typically allow the Fed to operate without interference – to demand interest rate cuts, and attack senior Fed officials, including its chairJerome Powell, when they repeatedly defied these calls.While Powell has signaled the Fed isgearing up to resume rate cuts, Trump has already made clear he is unlikely to be satisfied by its cautious approach. Concerning economic signs, including data indicating thatthe labor market has stalledwhileinflation picked up, have reinforced expectations that many policymakers will want to tread carefully.The administration has played down these official reports – andfired one of the officialsresponding for overseeing them. Trump’s proposed replacement is anardent supporter of his agenda, who has been accused of misrepresenting and exaggerating statistics.Trump is out to end the Fed’s autonomy. Here’s how he’s trying to get his wayRead moreWhile Miran described the Fed’s independence as “critical” during a confirmation hearing earlier this month, and pledged to preserve it as governor, his decision to only take unpaid leave from his current job at the White House, rather than resign, raised questions over his ability to operate independently.The administration has also been pushing to remove Cook for the Fed’s board as soon as possible, despite her legal action over Trump’s bid to dismiss her. The president has citedunconfirmed allegations of mortgage fraud. US district judge Jia Cobb also ruled on 9 September that Trump’s unfounded claims of mortgage fraud were not enough to terminate Cook under existing law. Congress created provisions to shield the Fed from political interference including that the president could only fire a governor “for cause”. The law does not define what would qualify as cause for termination.Cook has denied wrongdoing, and argued Trump has no authority to fire her. Her term is not due to expire until 2038. A respected economist, with stints at Harvard University and Stanford University, she is the first Black woman to sit on the Fed’s board of governors. In August, Cook sued the Fed and Trump alleging the president chose to fire her for her stance on monetary policy.Early on Monday, Trump reiterated his call for lower rates. Powell “MUST CUT INTEREST RATES, NOW, AND BIGGER THAN HE HAD IN MIND”, the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform, claiming: “HOUSING WILL SOAR!!!”The latest Fed decision will be announced on Wednesday.This article was amended on 16 September 2025. The result of the Senate vote to confirm Stephen Miran was 48-47, not 48-27 as an earlier version stated.Explore more on these topicsFederal ReserveUS SenateUS economyEconomicsDonald TrumpJerome PowellnewsShareReuse this content"

Her experiment turned into The New Norm, a sustainable textile startupAdvertising partnerAbout this contentAimee RawlinsTue 16 Sep 2025 09.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 09.01 EDTShareIf you’ve been on a college campus in the last 30 years, you’ve likely come across red party cups. Made by brands like Solo and Hefty, the iconic cups are beloved by frats, crucial to drinking games like beer pong – and very difficult to recycle because of the type of plastic they’re made from.But Lauren Choi, an engineering student at Johns Hopkins University, saw an opportunity: she wanted to turn these problematic cups into fabric. In 2019, during her senior year, she led a team that built an extruder machine that could spin plastic waste into textile filaments. They partnered with campus fraternities to gather thousands of red cups that could serve as the raw material.Choi then took a weaving class at aBaltimore, Maryland, maker space so she could make a sample fabric out of those filaments. That became the foundation for The New Norm, a textile company that today transforms a variety of post-consumer recycled plastic into stylish sweatshirts and beanies.At 23, she set out to modernize the spice trade. Now she’s navigating Trump’s tariffsRead more“I’ve always thought long-term,” Choi said. “And that helps me look beyond the next couple years, [to the] bigger picture, where globally, [the plastic crisis] is something we need to address.”The company is a natural extension of Choi’s longstanding concern about the dual climate and plastics crises and a deep connection to fashion. She had been sewing since she was a child, interned at a swimwear company earlier in college, and – before teaming up with classmates – spent a summer trying to build an extruder machine in her parents’ garage. “[The New Norm] really tied my interests together,” she said.After graduating in 2020, Choi raised grant funding so she could dive more into product development. “That helped it go from a passion project to a real, real project,” she said.View image in fullscreenIsabelle Callaghan, Alicia Furlan, Lauren Choi, and Camille Afable pose for portraits in the party sweater made out of recycled plastic in Boston, Massachusetts, on 13 September 2025.Photograph: Faith Ninivaggi/The GuardianChoi started working with suppliers who source plastics from recycling facilities across the country. “Recycled [materials are] still the wild west,” she said. “We received batches that were unusable or contaminated or too mixed. It was a lot of trial and error to find the right people.”Another challenge: Up until that point, the fabric coming out of the extruder still had a distinctly brittle, plastic feel – it didn’t feel wearable like a traditional textile. So Choi reached out to Gaston College’s Textile Technology Center, just outside Charlotte, North Carolina, for help.“If you’re going to produce a knit garment, it needs to be comfortable,” said Jasmine Cox, the center’s executive director. “It needs to be breathable, cozy, things that people love. It can’t feel like a plastic cup.”Cox’s team, along with people at the Polymers Center in North Carolina, helped Choi develop a custom formula that could be fed into extruders to produce soft textiles. “Our entire goal [was] to get her to that point where it was plug and play,” Cox said.It took them a couple years, and more grant funding (from Johns Hopkins, Garnier, and Reynolds Consumer Products, Hefty’s parent company, among others), to get to that point. The New Norm released its first, direct-to-consumer collection of sweaters and beanies in late 2023. Made from 5,000 upcycled party cups, the drop sold out in two months.Choi works with textile facilities in North Carolina and Virginia to produce The New Norm’s yarn, much of which is then shipped to Brooklyn, where a manufacturer uses 3D printers to produce sweatshirts and beanies, which retail between $45 and $85.“3D knitting has a lot less waste compared to traditional cut-and-sew, where many fabric scraps are wasted,” Choi said. “Instead, our pieces are knit straight out of the machine without any seams – it’s just one full garment that doesn’t need additional sewing.”View image in fullscreenAlicia Furlan and Camille Afable model the party sweaters and party beanie made out of recycled plastics by The New Norm.Photograph: Faith Ninivaggi/The GuardianEven though the company now uses a variety of plastics, multicolored party cups still make up most of the raw materials in its own line. The items’ pink, blue and green pastel hues come from the cups themselves rather than added dyes. Choi said her yarn is made from continuous filaments, rather than fibers that are spun together, which means it’s less likely to shedharmful microplastics.The New Norm is still a lean operation: Choi, who recently moved toBostonto pursue an MBA at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said at any given time there are between three and 25 people working at the company. She declined to share sales figures, but said that in the last two years production had expanded from tens of pounds per run to thousands.Choi said she aims to expand the business-to-business side of The New Norm, which she sees as offering the biggest opportunity for an environmental impact.“From the beginning, our goal has been to get to a place where we can scale production and work with really large brands who are using significant quantities of materials,” she said. The New Norm is undergoing pilots with large brands, testing everything from the strength of the yarn to how well it launders, with the goal of developing and selling the material at a much larger scale.This aligns with where some experts see the industry going, as a growing number of companies rethink where they source their raw materials. Onereportfound that the sustainable textile market was valued globally at $29.5bn in 2024, and is expected to hit $71bn by 2031. (While what constitutes “sustainable” is somewhat nebulous, most research defines it as textiles made with eco-friendly material, including recycled fibers, which minimize water, chemicals, and carbon emissions.)For her part, Choi hopes The New Norm can put a dent in theglobal plastics crisis, which has reached disastrous levels. The world produces 200 times as much plastic today as it did in 1950, less than 10% of which is recycled. There’s an estimated 8bn tons of plastic pollution across the globe, and just three plastic chemicals cause as much as $1.5tn in annual health costs.Cox said Choi was early in terms of thinking about how to transform plastic into textile. And while there are other companies that turn plastic and textile waste into yarn, Cox said Choi’s focus on the party cup was unique, especially because of where it could lead. “Food containers, food packaging, that’s something that we don’t think about,” she said. “Everyone throws it out daily, and there haven’t been many solutions.”Some might question if we really want to be wearing clothes made out of plastic, but the reality is we already are. More than 60% of fibers produced worldwide are synthetic, the vast majority of which are derived from virgin fossil fuels, according to a 2024 report fromTextile Exchange, making the fashion industry a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Cox and Choi both acknowledged how much needs to be done to reduce plastic usage, but see upcycling as an important first step.“It would be amazing if we lived in a plastic-free world,” Choi said. “But if you look at the volume of virgin, synthetic fibers made annually, we’re talking billions of tons of material. There’s a long road to go.”Explore more on these topicsSustainable fashionThe New Face of Small BusinessBaltimoreBostonClimate crisisPlasticsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Then came a divine act of Faith.In the women’s 400m, Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone ran one of the fastest times in history, easing down, to raise the question of whether one of the oldest – and most controversial – track and field records might fall this week.Shortly afterwards another standout female of her generation, Faith Kipyegon, underlined her status by speeding to a historic fourth 1500m title with such grace and distance that it took the breath away.USA’s Cordell Tinch goes from toilet paper factory to 110m hurdles world championRead moreBoth women have long stood tall in the athletics pantheon. What they do in the coming days could reinforce their case to be considered as the greatest female athlete of all time.McLaughlin-Levrone, of course, already holds numerous gold medals and world records in the 400m hurdles. But now, suddenly, she has the 400m gold and possibly even the world record of 47.60sec set by Marita Koch in 1985 in her sights too.The American showed that by running 48.29sec in her semi-final on Tuesday – smashing her personal best by nearly half a second – and then promising to run faster in the final on Thursday. “This race definitely gives me confidence for the final,” she said. “I didn’t expect to run this fast today. And I still have more to show.”That sounds ominous for Koch, who has long been alleged to be part of East Germany’s state-sponsored doping programme, in books and newspaper articles. When asked about it by the BBC in 2014, she replied: “I don’t have to prove anything to myself. I have a clear conscience. I can only repeat myself … I never tested positive, I never did anything which I should not have done at that time.”Koch did acknowledge the fact that the record would ultimately be overtaken, though, saying that “at some point, that time will come”. It could even be on Thursday .However, McLaughlin-Levrone will not have things completely her own way given that the Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino and the former world champion Salwa Eid Naser are running well.They will be joined in the final by Britain’s Amber Anning, who ran 49.38sec to qualify automatically. “I’m in such great shape,” she insisted.Paulino is even more confident, promising: “God and I will make history here.”The 31-year-old Kipyegon has already done that. On Tuesday she matched Hicham El Guerrouj as the only other athlete in history to amass four world 1500m titles.With 300m to go Kipyegon, who broke her own world record this year, lookedunder threat from the Australian Jessica Hull. But then she applied the afterburners and the race was put to bed long before she crossed the line in 3min 52.15sec.View image in fullscreenFaith Kipyegon reminds the world how many 1500m word titles she has now.Photograph: Mickael Chavet/ZUMA Press Wire/ShutterstockHull, who had promised she would give it her all and try to win gold, faded badly but clung on for bronze. Another Kenyan, Dorcus Ewoi, took silver. Now Kipyegon has a 5,000m clash of the titans to look forward to against the 10,000m world champion, Beatrice Chebet.“Being able to defend my title and to win a fourth gold feels really special,” said Kipyegon, who held four fingers up as she crossed the line. “This sport drives me. I need to push myself in order to be the best.”It was another bad night for Britain with Matt Hudson-Smith, the Olympic and world silver medallist, going out of the men’s 400m at the semi‑final stage, along with Charlie Dobson and Sam Reardon. Reardon pointed to a long break outside the stadium as a factor in finishing last.“After the first 50m I just felt the tightening of my hamstring and pain,” he said. “You warm up to get yourself ready, and when you’re delayed for that long outside in the stadium, in the elements cooling down every second. It’s not really helpful.”To make matters worse, WorldAthleticsalso reprimanded the British team after Jeremiah Azu wore a headband with “100% Jesus” on it during the semi-final of the 100m. The marketing of religious and political slogans is banned during competition by the governing body’s rules.“We are aware of the headband, and as he may compete in the relay we will remind the team ahead of competition of our regulations and of consequences,” World Athletics said in a statement.It also emerged that a group of leading athletes will consider legal action if they are not paid by the end of the September for racing inMichael Johnson’s Grand Slam Track. Multiple athletes are still waiting on prize money after competing in the first three rounds, before the cancellation of the planned final event in Los Angeles. Johnson did not respond when approached for comment.here was gold for New Zealand’s Hamish Kerr in the men’s high jump and for the AmericanCordell Tinch in the 110m hurdles, while there was better news for Britain in the men’s 800m as Ben Pattison and Max Burgin looked comfortable in qualifying for Thursday’s semi-finals.Burgin, who won his heat in 1:44.73, appeared untroubled until just after he gave an interview to the BBC and then threw up – something he often does after races. “Standard fare for me,” he said later, smiling.Explore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsnewsShareReuse this content"

It was one of the grumbles from the Tottenham fanbase when their club appointed Thomas Frank given how his experience of European football extended to little more than a handful of Europa League qualifiers with Brondby more than a decade ago.It was a nervy big-time debut for the manager, his team retreating into their shells after half-time, looking to hold on to the lead they were presented with at the outset by one of the ultimate goalkeeping howlers.Kylian Mbappé wins it for Real Madrid after Alexander-Arnold injury and Carvajal head-buttRead moreIt was a moment to haunt Villarreal’s Luiz Júnior, who was the greatest danger to his team in front of their goal. Tottenham could get little going as an attacking force. Luiz Júnior had further wobbly moments, although he got away with them.Villarreal pressed on to the front foot and it was a night when the yellow cards fluttered and the referee, Rade Obrenovic, never gave the impression he was fully in control. Spurs certainly had none of that. Xavi Simons was fortunate to escape a second yellow card just after the hour for a hack at Nicolas Pépé, Villarreal’s former Arsenal winger, who made light of the jeers he heard to produce a man-of-the-match performance.Another former Arsenal player provided the real sideshow. Thomas Partey, who will appear at Southwark crown court on Wednesday morning to answer rape charges, was brought off the Villarreal bench in the 77th minute and, suffice to say, it was difficult to hear the announcement of his name.Villarreal advertised the equaliser and there was the flashpoint on 84 minutes when Micky van de Ven barged over Georges Mikautadze on the very edge of the area as the striker ran through. Van de Ven escaped with a yellow card; like Simons, he could easily have been dismissed. Pépé whipped the free-kick past the post and Spurs got away with it, relief the overriding emotion when it was all over. Frank could simply cherish the clean sheet; it is now four in five matches for his team. And, above all, the points.View image in fullscreenPedro Porro of Tottenham in the thick of the action.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianThe goal came early and it was a gift from the football gods. Lucas Bergvall had worked his way into a crossing position on the right and he could see the run of Richarlison in the middle but the low delivery was too close to Luiz Júnior, who went to ground to collect. Why, then, was the ball now rolling into the net? It needed a double take to see that he had somehow pushed it there himself. Did the impact of his gloves against the turf cause the catastrophe? Frankly, there were no satisfactory answers.Marcelino set his Villarreal team up in an old-school 4-4-2 and they stabilised after the own goal. Pépé came to life; quick, direct and dangerous. Twice in the first half, he almost drew his team level. He shaped a curler for the bottom corner, which Van de Ven deflected off target. And it was Pépé who played in Tajon Buchanan for a glorious chance after some less than convincing Spurs defending. Buchanan shot wastefully wide.Pape Matar Sarr extended Luiz Júnior with a low drive in the 30th minute – it was Spurs’ only effort on target; indeed, the only one that either side mustered. Frank’s team entered the interval chuntering about refereeing decisions, namely the non‑award of two penalties.Pape Gueye seemed to kick through Richarlison; the decision was that the Spurs striker had fished out his leg to anticipate the contract. And Gueye felt a Bergvall flick rear up to hit his outstretched hand. He could not really have got it out of the way. Obrenovic got those correct.View image in fullscreenThomas Partey comes on for Villarreal as a second-half substitute.Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The GuardianIt was Spurs’ first home game sincethe ousting of the club chair, Daniel Levy; an extreme novelty for him not to be seen in his familiar seat in the stadium he built.

Was it because it was only Villarreal, the fifth-best team last season in La Liga? On the other hand, Spurs season-ticket holders do not have cup games included in their packages. They cost extra.Tottenham were sloppy after the second-half restart; their passing poor. Frank’s players sat deeper and it seemed as though they were inviting trouble. The manager needed Cristian Romero and Van de Ven to stand tall at the back.Pépé continued to threaten, pushing a shot just past the far corner on 55 minutes, and when he was caught by Simons it looked set to add up to a red card. Instead, Obrenovic spared Simons and booked Marcelino for his furious reaction.Simons got away with a barge on Ilias Akhomach, who was on as a substitute, inside the area before Van de Ven made what was effectively a match‑saving foul on Mikautadze. Marcelino felt that both Simons and Van de Ven ought to have been sent off.“Two really clear actions,” the Villarreal manager said.“With the one of Simons [on Pépé], it didn’t look like he wanted to play the ball. The referee didn’t have his best day. He was a bit of a homer. It was an unjust result. A draw would have been the fairest result but the team that deserved to win was us, not Tottenham.”Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueTottenham HotspurVillarrealEuropean club footballmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

It’s like you fail a math test occasionally, but you come back. And I’m excited for what the future holds.”Mondo Duplantis hits new heights with ‘Claw’ after 14th pole vault world recordRead moreLutkenhaus’s personal best is 1 min 42.27 sec makes him the 22ndfastest man – even if he is still a boy – over 800m in history. And such was his reputation that the Kenyan world record David Rudisha, who was in the stadium, had said he was looking forward to watching the Texan race.Lutkenhaus, the youngest American to ever compete at the world championships after coming second in the US trials, was confident after running better than ever in training. However he was unable to produce his best when it mattered.He spent most of the race in lane two or three, and when he reached for his sprint finish with 150 metres to go, he did not have enough in reserve. He finished in 1:47.68 in a race won by Poland’s Maciej Wyderka.“Yeah, the sprint just wasn’t there as it normally is,” Lutkenhaus said. “But you just have to move on, live and learn. But I am leaving the stadium with my head held high, just because getting to race the best guys in the world is just really exciting.”“I don’t really have any regrets from that race,” he added. “You’re gonna have bad races occasionally.”Asked about what would do next, Lutkenhaus said he planned to have some fun in Tokyo – but admitted he still had some homework to do.“The first week here I was trying to get accommodated to the time change and get ready to race,” he said. “Now, I may go out and try to have some fun. I’ll take a little bit of time off after this and relax after a long season. I still have homework to do on this trip.“I barely have any hobbies. But this is something I love to do so I put a lot of focus on it. This sport doesn’t last forever. So to have a solid education is a number one priority. Nothing in life is guaranteed, especially in a sport like this.

For one thing, it’s extremely unusual for a government official to wear a tie featuring the logo of any business, let alone a sports team. For another, Patel has not publicly expressed fandom forLiverpoolin the past – at least not in words. He has previously been photographed wearing Liverpool ties on at least two separate occasions, though. The first, on 12 December 2024, came when Patel was visiting various lawmakers on Capitol Hill after Donald Trump’s victory in that year’s election, with Patel at the time being rumored to be a part of the administration. The second came about five months later, on 9 April 2025, at a press event touting the US authorities’ capture of narcotics. By that time, Patel had been confirmed as director of the FBI.Notably, Patel wore the same thick-striped tie featuring the Liverpool logo on the bottom at both those events, while the one he wore for Tuesday’s hearing is different, with thinner stripes and a more prominent logo (the “heritage tie,”currently availableon Liverpool’s official club shop for £15). His apparent ownership of multiple Liverpool ties would indicate that his wearing of them is not a fluke.View image in fullscreenKash Patel was photographed in a different Liverpool tie in December while visiting Capitol Hill.Photograph: Kevin Dietsch/Getty ImagesOn Tuesday, Patel’s hearing in front the judiciary committeeturned contentiousat various points. The FBI director got into a shouting match with US senators Cory Booker and Adam Schiff, defending his leadership of the agency, his firing of longtime employees involved in investigations into the attacks on the Capitol on 6 January 2021, and his tweet announcing that law enforcement had a “subject” in custody for the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, which turned out to be premature.“I don’t see it as a mistake, I see it as something – working with the public to identify that there was a subject in custody,” Patel told senators.If Patel does support Liverpool, it would represent a stark clash of political allegiances. As one of the US’s foremost law enforcement officers, Patel has been a public face of a second Trump administration that has used authoritarian tactics to impact multiple areas of public life in the United States. This includesraids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice)in public places that have resulted in the arrest of hundreds of immigrants regardless of residency or citizenship status and thedispatching of federal agents to left-leaning US citiesin response to supposed higher crime rates (claims of which have been disproven).Liverpool, by contrast, is known to beone of the more left-leaning clubs in Europefrom one of the most left-leaning cities in the UK. Legendary Liverpool manager Bill Shankly defined the club’s identity during his hugely successful tenure by saying: “I believe the only way to live and to be truly successful is by collective effort, with everyone working for each other, everyone helping each other, and everyone having a share of the rewards at the end of the day. That might be asking a lot, but it’s the way I see football and the way I see life.”Hillsborough, Grenfell, Windrush, the Post Office scandal: the guilty escape justice. Well, not any more | David LammyRead moreThough the business of Liverpool is markedly different these days in keeping with the financial juggernaut that is the Premier League, elements of socialist ideology are still present in the club. Jürgen Klopp, who managed Liverpool to great success from 2015 to 2024,summed up his own politicsto biographer Raphael Honigstein by saying: “If I am doing well, I want others to do well, too. If there’s something I will never do in my life it is vote for the right.”The club’s supporters also have a considerable opposition to law enforcement authorities in their history. Much of it stems from the Hillsborough disaster that killed 97 fans of the club in 1989, and police’s pinning of the situation on the supporters themselves, blaming hooliganism and drunkenness. Many years later, it was found in separate investigations that the crowd crush which killed the 97 was in fact due togross negligence on the part of policeand that the authorities misled the public in order to shift blame on to the fans.Patel rose to prominence after the events of 6 January 2021, promoting a legal defense fund for those arrested for the attack on the Capitol building. A career prosecutor and legal aide under multiple right-wing politicians before that, Patel parlayed an association with the first Trump administration toseveral business venturesand a media career. In both capacities, he promoted several conspiracy theories, including debunked claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election, debunked claims of the dangers of Covid-19 vaccines, and the presence of the “deep state” in US politics.Liverpool open their Champions League campaign on Wednesday at home against Atlético Madrid.Explore more on these topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootball politicsFBInewsShareReuse this content"

It’s not enough to pack your squad with flashy weapons and hope you dazzle your way to the Super Bowl. You have to focus on more and different dimensions – roster depth, how players fit into coaching schemes, how they work together, and how even the “unsexy” positions are addressed at a high level.And yet that is generally not how the Cincinnati Bengals have built their teams over the years. And once again, they’re paying for it in the worst possible way – with an injury to their star quarterback, Joe Burrow, that will severely affect their season. In the Bengals’ 31-27 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday, Burrow suffered a turf toe injury as he was being sacked by defensive lineman Arik Armstead; it’s estimated that Burrowwill be out at least three months. It’s the third time in six seasons that Burrow’s underwhelming offensive line – the line that is supposed to protect him from this sort of stuff – has helped shorten his season.Most franchises value quarterback protection to an extreme degree, particularly when you have a player like Burrow, one of the best players in the entire NFL. The ones that don’t suffer by way of sub-par quarterback play, and eventual quarterback injury. The 2024 Bengals had one of the worst overall offensive lines in the NFL, and they did very little in the offseason to reverse that curse. Cincinnati’s front office did add interior linemen Lucas Patrick and Dalton Risner in free agency, but Patrick has barely played, and Risner has already allowed a sack and four total pressures in 75 pass-blocking snaps, per Pro Football Focus. Georgia guard Dylan Fairchild, selected with the 81st pick of this year’s draft, has allowed four pressures in 81 pass-blocking snaps.The New York Giants are 0-2 again. But are they finally ... watchable?Read moreThe tackle spots are handled this season as they were in 2024 by Orlando Brown Jr on the left side, and 2024 first-round pick Amarius Mims on the right. Brown, who has the Bengals’ fifth-highest 2025 salary cap hit at $15m, has been more of a sieve than a mainstay throughout his career. Mims, who did represent some serious intent to make the line better with the draft capital given up for his services, is still getting the hang of things. Center Ted Karras is no better than a decent starter.So, yes, while the Bengals could say with some conviction that they have tried to make their line better, the player evaluation process has been iffy at best.Why is this specifically important for Burrow? While he is the NFL’s best in-the-pocket mover today, and certainly the best since Tom Brady’s retirement, the 28-year-old is not exceptionally mobile outside the pocket. He needs some sort of structure provided and defined by protection to do what he does at a high level. It’s rather amazing that Burrow has played to the level he has when healthy without that protection.Head coach and offensive shot-caller Zac Taylor has mitigated the potential damage with more quick-game throws than you’ll see from any other NFL team. In 2024, Burrow had by far the most attempts on passes that took fewer than 2.5 seconds after the snap with 397 – Patrick Mahomes ranked second with 352. 2023 brought fewer overall Burrow dropbacks due to the wrist injury that ended his season – that lack of protection again – but he still led the NFL in percentage of quick-throw dropbacks at 62.9%.So, this has been the Bengals’ primary adaptive strategy – get the ball out before the quarterback gets crunched. The problems with that approach? Building your entire passing game out of quick stuff obviously takes a lot of routes off the table, and if he doesn’t get the ball out quickly? Well, he’s crunched. The margin for error is wafer-thin as a result.And as three of the Bengals’ four biggest salary cap hits right now go to Burrow and receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, it raises the question – how much do your elite weapons matter if they’re only running half a playbook because the ball has to come out of the quarterback’s hand almost as soon as it’s snapped?“It’s unfortunate this happened, but that’s a part of football,”Taylor said on Monday of Burrow’s latest injury. “He could have been clean for 99% of the game, but one play is where it happened.”That’s a disingenuous statement at best. Burrow was not clean for 99% of the game, and he’s never been anywhere near that at any time in his NFL career. He certainly wasn’t 99% clean against the Jaguars – in fact, the Bengals’ offensive line deficiencies meant he was harassed over and over before the injury eventually – inevitably? – happened.Joe Burrow was either sacked, hit, or hurried on each of his last four passing attempts against the Jaguars.pic.twitter.com/yyvzRLtbzP— Doug Farrar ✍ (@NFL_DougFarrar)September 15, 2025Burrow’s worrisome lack of protection does have a recent precedent. Andrew Luck was a generational prospect selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the first overall pick in 2012, and he was truly great until injuries, caused in large part by a lack of investment in the offensive line, took their toll.Luck retired unexpectedly in August 2019, because he was tired of the physical toll of being battered in and out of the pocket.As ESPN’s Dan Orlovsky and Mina Kimespointed out on Monday, the similarities between Luck and Burrow after six seasons are worrying, at best.This is not to say that Joe Burrow is one more big hit away from hanging up his cleats for good. But this latest injury should remind the Bengals of a lesson they should have already learned from Burrow’s past injuries: if the linemen protecting your quarterback aren’t good enough, then the talent among your receivers and backs won’t matter.As to how (or if) the Bengals can transcend this disaster this season, backup Jake Browning (who filled in for Burrow pretty well as a rookie in 2023) threw three interceptions against the Jaguars before he collected his wits. And it’s not as if Browning is going to be better when pressured than Burrow. It’s also worth mentioning that in 2024, with Burrow fully healthy and at his best, the Bengals scored 30 or more points in eight of their 17 games, and lost four of those eight games, because their defense was problematic at best.Another lost seasonshouldserve as the Bengals’ ultimate wake-up call. But given their history, there’s little reason to be optimistic it actually will.Explore more on these topicsCincinnati BengalsNFLUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

According to the ESPN broadcast, the future Hall of Famer discusses game film and goes over the gameplan with Las Vegas offensive coordinator Chip Kelly every week.Brady in the Raiders coaches boothpic.twitter.com/U1ewj47ZnD— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein)September 16, 2025Brady made his Fox debut as an analyst last season on a 10-year, $375m contract. Under looser restrictions than last season, Brady can now attend production meetings with teams and players as part of his broadcast duties with Fox, though he must participate in those discussions remotely. He still can’t attend practices held at team facilities.Raiders head coach Pete Carrolltold ESPNthat reports of Kelly’s meeting with Brady were “not accurate”.The Brady Exception is another case of the NFL jettisoning objectivity and integrityRead more“We have conversations,” Carroll said after Monday night’s game. “I talk to Tom, Chip talks to Tom regularly. We have a tremendous asset. And we all get along and respect each other. We just talk about life and football. He has great insight, so we’re lucky to have him as an owner.”Many have argued that Brady’s access as a broadcastergives the Raiders an unfair advantage, particularly when he is calling games for Fox involving teams that Las Vegas will face later in the season. Fans posted on social media during the game, calling it a conflict of interest and questioning the fairness of giving Brady access to future opponents.On Tuesday, theNFLsaid Brady had not violated any rules by sitting in the coaching booth, adding that wearing a headset to listen in on team communication during the game is also above board.“There are no policies that prohibit an owner from sitting in the coaches’ booth or wearing a headset during a game,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. “Brady was sitting in the booth in his capacity as a limited partner. All personnel sitting in the booth must abide by policies that prohibit the use of electronic devices other than league-issued equipment such as a Microsoft Surface Tablet for the Sideline Viewing System.”The seven-time Super Bowl winner will be on the broadcast team on Sunday when the Dallas Cowboys face the Chicago Bears, whom the Raiders play the following week.This past weekend, Brady was in Kansas City to broadcast the Super Bowl rematch between the Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles; both teams are also on the Raiders’ schedule this season.In Week 1, Brady was part of Fox’s broadcast of the New York Giants’ game against the Washington Commanders, who will host the Raiders on Sunday.“Tom continues to be prohibited from going to a team facility for practices or production meetings,” McCarthy said on Tuesday. “He may attend production meetings remotely but may not attend in person at the team facility or hotel. He may also conduct an interview off site with a player like he did last year a couple times, including for the Super Bowl. Of course, as with any production meeting with broadcast teams, it’s up to the club, coach or players to determine what they say in those sessions.”Las Vegas lost 20-9 to the Chargers on Monday.Explore more on these topicsTom BradyLas Vegas RaidersNFLUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

But it turns out the 24-year-old’s mind is just as quick as his blistering leg speed.In an interview to celebrate his victory, Seville was asked if he were to design a sprinter what would he look like. The questioner expected a long answer. Perhaps Justin Gatlin’s start, Michael Johnson’s mentality, and Bolt’s leg speed. But one word came back from Seville’s mouth almost instantaneously. “Usain.”Time comes for Gout Gout to prove himself against sprinting’s best emerging talent | Jack SnapeRead moreWhen the questioner suggested that “there’s never been anyone like” the Jamaican sprinting great, Seville replied: “No. But I would take his last part of his race and my start. Then you would have the perfect sprinter.”However, there is one issue about which Seville disagrees with his hero. On Monday,Bolt insisted the current generation of sprinters did not have the talentto run the 100m in 9.6sec, like he, Yohan Blake and Tyson Gay once did. Seville, who ran a personal best of 9.77sec to win gold in Tokyo, disagreed. “In my opinion, it’s just only a matter of time before someone is going to run 9.6,” he said.“I don’t think we are far off in this generation. It just takes us time. Because you have to understand, it was the same back then.“No one was running 9.6 untilUsain Boltput his foot in Beijing. So it’s for us now, as a new generation, for us to just meet that step – to prove that we can actually do the same thing that Usain did.”The difference between Seville and Bolt could barely be more pronounced. Both hail from Jamaica but Bolt was 6ft 5in and weighed about 14st, and Seville is 5ft 6in and just 11st 6lb. Seville loves going to church and said he prepared for the 100m final by reading the Bible “which gave me a lot of peace of mind”. Bolt, it is fair to say, had a rather different approach.However, the men share the same coach: Glen Mills. And it was Mills who always believed that Seville could emulate Bolt by becoming the fastest man on the planet. “I realised that I was a fast kid when I was six,” said Seville. “I was running against kids that were bigger than me and I was very competitive. So I showed it at a very early age.“When I just started out with my coach, he said it’s going to take me a few years to get to the podium. And whatever he says, that is what’s going to happen. His words manifested upon me and here I am right now, a gold medallist.“He can be tough at times and he’s a good guy because he’s a very intelligent guy. And I learn a lot from him in and out of sport. He guides me mentally and shows me my career, physically.”Since Bolt left the sport in 2017, the crown of the world champion has slipped through the hands of Gatlin, Christian Coleman, Fred Kerley and Noah Lyles. Could Seville, who was one of the favourites for gold in Paris, be the one who holds on to the crown? He hopes so. But he knows it will be difficult.“I have the mentality. But you know that injuries are a part of the sport,” Seville said. “And because of my height and size I cannot make any mistakes. I have to ensure that everything that I do is on point.”That mentality was also strong when the American Lyles tried to play mind games on the Jamaicans before the final. “It doesn’t have any effect on me,” said Seville. “Because over the years I realised that Noah is going to be Noah. And he’s going to talk.“I respect that. It’s good for the sport. It might have worked on other athletes but not me. I came to the world championship for one purpose. To win the gold.” And he did that, all right.View image in fullscreenUsain Bolt says the current generation do not have the same talent as his era to run 9.6sec.Photograph: David J Phillip/APExplore more on these topicsWorld Athletics ChampionshipsAthleticsUsain BoltnewsShareReuse this content"

The other two went to Washington Mystics guard Sonia Citron.Why hasn’t middle America given Paige Bueckers the Caitlin Clark treatment?Read moreBueckers, the No 1 overall pick in this year’s draft, was a bright spot on a team that tied the Chicago Sky with a league-worst 10-34 record. The former UConn star averaged 19.2 points on 47.7% shooting along with 3.9 rebounds, 5.4 assists and 1.6 steals. But those numbers don’t tell the complete story.Her 692 points and 194 assists were the third-most by aWNBArookie. The highlight was when she scored 44 in a loss to the Los Angeles Sparks in August. That was the WNBA’s highest point total this season and the most ever by a rookie. She also became the first player in league history to score 40 or more while shooting 80% in a game. That performance came near the end of a 30-game double-digit streak, the third longest to start a career behind A’ja Wilson’s 33 games in 2018 and Candace Parker’s 32 games in 2008.Explore more on these topicsWNBADallas WingsBasketballUS sportsnewsShareReuse this content"

As if to prove the point, Leandro Trossard, another substitute who had come on just five minutes before him, had provided the pass for it and then added the second to secure the win. The man who set him up? Martinelli.Last seasonArsenalhad ultimately paid for a lack of depth, Arteta had said; this season they have started victorious thanks to the men waiting in reserve. For much of a noisy night when Noni Madueke had been the most consistent threat, Arsenal had struggled to carve out clear chances. But then a loose ball dropped in midfield and Trossard got there first, sending it looping into space. Martinelli was on to it fast and if the first touch was a little heavy, the second was superb, enabling him to escape Andoni Gorosabel and steer under the body of Simón.High in a corner of San Mamés the Arsenal fans erupted, and then in final moments they celebrated again when Trossard received from Martinelli and lifted a shot into the net. They had been part of a historic night for their hosts here and they had been in a contest too, but they had come through it, the first step towards what they hope is a historic season in Europe. One for which they have invested heavily, the cost of the starting XIs telling a story: €12m (£10m) versus €567m.View image in fullscreenGabriel Martinelli scores Arsenal’s first goal. He then provided the assist for Leandro Trossard for the second.Photograph: Albert Gea/ReutersNot that Athletic wanted that reality to be an excuse not to compete; it never has been, far from it. Embracing it, fighting it, is their entire identity. While Arsenal dominated possession early,it seemed designed to control rather than to create, and Athletic took this match to them, turning it into a proper contest, even if it was one that ultimately they would not win.Mikel Jauregizar got the first real shot off after five minutes, Gabriel Magalhães blocking the ball and Declan Rice catching the Athletic midfielder. That earned him a yellow which at times appeared to have him on a fine line. Jauregizar then almost found Adama Boiro coming in at the far post. And next Alejandro Berenguer, dashing forward, was blocked by Gabriel.Arsenal, though, were starting to tilt the balance and on 20 minutes Gorosabel had to make a superb interception inside the six-yard box ahead of Riccardo Calafiori and Eberechi Eze, who did not seem to see him coming.That move had begun on the left, where Iñaki Williams had been caught by Jurriën Timber, who then combined with Madueke, and that was to become a well-worn path.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

As he sprinted into the area, though, Dani Vivian came to meet him and his shot lacked the power of direction to truly trouble Simón. A better opportunity followed when Gyökeres dived in to head just past the post. When Gabriel headed soon after he clashed heads with the Swede, and was left bleeding and bandaged up.Arsenal were increasing pressure, although Athletic did find a second wind and a way out. Berenguer shot wide after he was slipped in by Williams and Robert Navarro was blocked by the seemingly insuperable obstacle of Gabriel. From the corner, Oihan Sancet headed over.Madueke kept running. Sprinting clear he cut into the area and, although he could have pulled back to Gyökeres, he had spotted a gap opened at the near post only to be denied by a strong right hand from Simón. His half-blocked shot then skidded through to the keeper and a dinked cross dropped into Simon’s arms: that was three approaches inside the opening eight minutes of the second half, but it was still not enough. At the other end, Williams worked the space for a shot that David Raya stopped by the near post.The changes came, the test of that strength in depth upon which Arteta has placed such stress – and here it was, point proven immediately, the game won. Off went Gyökeres and Eze and on came the impactors.Explore more on these topicsChampions LeagueAthletic BilbaoArsenalmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

I think if you look at his finishing skills, heading left, right, top corners, he’s the complete striker at the moment and same you can say from Hugo [Ekitiké]. Very good, very eager, obviously the quality he’s been showing already since, I think, the first session.”Van Dijk said he had spoken to Isak during the international break. “For him it’s obviously about getting as fit as possible, as quickly as possible, getting to understand each one of us as quickly as possible, how we train, how we press, how we do set pieces. So it’s been a good week for him and let’s see tomorrow.”Liverpool have ambitions to challenge for the Champions League after being knocked out in the last 16 byParis Saint-Germain on penaltieslast season.

But while Palace stretched their unbeaten run to 16 matches in all competitions, this was another night to forget for Romain Esse as he was substituted at half-time following a very public display of dissatisfaction from his manager.Kylian Mbappé wins it for Real Madrid after Alexander-Arnold injury and Carvajal head-buttRead moreBenítez – a free transfer from PSV Eindhoven who had yet to make a competitive appearance – saved two penalties in the shootout to become an instant hero but it has taken Esse longer to settle since his arrival fromMillwallin January for £12m.Glasner has been reluctant to use the forward who made his England Under‑21 debut last week but threw him into the fray against his former club, only to hook him at the break after taking off his jacket and hurling it into the dugout in frustration when Esse wasted another attacking opportunity at the end of the first half.“I don’t want to talk about a single player but of course if you sub somebody at half-time you are not pleased with his performance,” Glasner said. “I will talk to him in person and then it’s up to him to show improvement. That’s it.”Neil rightly felt that on another night his patched‑up side could have caused a shock. “I thought we deserved to take it to penalties,” he said. “That was a Millwall performance: it was gritty, it was determined, it was running, it was tackling, it was aggression.”Quick GuideCarabao Cup roundup: Grimsby and Brentford march onShowGrimsbyprogressed to the fourth round of the Carabao Cup for the first time in 24 years thanks to a 1-0 win over a youthfulSheffield Wednesdayside at Hillsborough.The two clubs pulled off the biggest shocks in round two, with the League Two Mariners upsetting Manchester United on penalties after Wednesday's youngsters embarrassed Yorkshire rivals Leeds in similar circumstances.Jaze Kabia headed the 49th-minute winner on Tuesday as Grimsby deservedly overcame an inexperienced Owls team featuring eight academy players in the starting XI. Around 6,000 travelling fans celebrated the success in South Yorkshire, with the home support heavily outnumbered due to a planned boycott as part of ongoing protests against the under-fire owner Dejphon Chansiri.Brentford's keeper Hákon Valdimarsson atoned for a costly error by becoming the shootout hero as his side defeatedAston Villa4-2 on penalties.The Iceland international, who provides back-up for Caoimhín Kelleher in the top flight, kept out spot-kicks from John McGinn and Matty Cash before Bees substitute Mikkel Damsgaard converted the winning penalty.Aaron Hickey's stunning 57th-minute equaliser earned Brentford a 1-1 draw at the Gtech Community Stadium after Harvey Elliott capitalised on a mistake from Valdimarsson to score Villa's first goal of the season on his full debut.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Jean-Philippe Mateta lasted only eight minutes during Palace’s 3-1 win here in March after beingkicked in the headby Millwall’s on loan goalkeeper Liam Roberts – a challenge that the chair, Steve Parish, described as the most reckless he had seen.There had been a heavy police presence around the ground before kick‑off and the travelling supporters who packed the away section wasted no time making their presence felt. “Twenty-five stitches, it should have been more,” they sang.View image in fullscreenJean-Philippe Mateta, pictured battling Caleb Taylor for the ball, was taunted by Millwall fans over the 25 stitches he needed after the sides last met.Photograph: Adam Davy/PAAn injury to the goalkeeper Max Crocombe in the warm-up forced Neil to turn to Steven Benda and the Fulham loanee proved he was up to the task on his debut with a string of saves before half-time. The best denied Yéremy Pino inside the opening 60 seconds, with the Spaniard also spurning two more chances that fell his way. Millwall should have taken the lead when Palace gave the ball away cheaply in their own half but somehow Camiel Neghli could not hit the target. The lively Mihailo Ivanovic did manage to test Benítez with a header that was clawed away to safety.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFootball DailyFree daily newsletterKick off your evenings with the Guardian's take on the world of footballEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Palace immediately looked more of a threat with the Nigeria forward on the pitch, although Millwall’s defence continued to stand firm.Their confidence seemed to grow as Palace found themselves under pressure at the other end, with the towering substitute Josh Coburn making a real mess of a volley from close range when it seemed easier to score.Mateta almost caught out Benda when he rushed out of his goal but saw his shot cleared off the line. From the resulting corner, Richards was on hand to stab home from close range after Millwall failed to clear.That seemed to have won it but Leonard had other ideas when he headed in from a corner, with Mateta then comically missing an open goal with almost the last kick of stoppage time. That left Benítez to take centre stage as he saved from the Millwall captain, Tristan Crama, before denying Aidomo Emakhu to send Palace into the next round.Explore more on these topicsCarabao CupCrystal PalaceMillwallmatch reportsShareReuse this content"

The police said there were no suspicious circumstances.Like his father, Campbell pursued a career in boxing, making his professional debut in 2021. He retired from the sport earlier this year.On Monday, Hatton’s family issued a statement via police, saying they were “deeply moved” by the outpouring of love and support towards him.“Richard was so much more than a world champion. To us he was simply ‘Richard’, our son. A loving father, grandfather and brother, and a true friend to many,” the statement read.“He had a heart as big as his smile, and his kindness, humour and loyalty touched everyone who was lucky enough to know him.“To the wider world, Richard will always be remembered as one of boxing’s greatest champions - a man who gave everything inside the ring and wore his heart on his sleeve outside of it.”Explore more on these topicsRicky HattonBoxingnewsShareReuse this content"

The head coach also praised the collective spirit within the squad, insisted that it “hurts” when he has to leave a player on the bench, and revealed that he has embraced terminology from rugby union, preferring to call those he brings on to the pitch “finishers” rather than “substitutes”.It was still 0-0 at San Mamés when Martinelli was introduced, but Arteta said he could see in his eyes that he was ready and with his first touch he dashed away and beat Unai Simón to score the first in the 72nd minute. He then played the pass that set up Leandro Trossard, another substitute, to secure victory in the 87th.Gabriel Martinelli’s instant impact gives Arsenal opening win at Athletic BilbaoRead more“He fully deserved it. I adore Gabriel: his attitude, his commitment, his positivity, what he’s willing to do for the team,” Arteta said. “I was sure that Gabby was going to react like that. He has such a mentality. He’s constantly willing to learn, very demanding with himself and hopefully that gives him the confidence again because he is an outstanding player. I looked on the bench, I looked at him, and in his eyes I could see that he was ready. Leo as well. I think that’s going to help us a lot for the future.“That shows that they are at least equally important or more important as anyone in this squad. That the finishers are going to be more important this season than the starters.”Of the way the team embraced Martinelli after the goal, Arteta said: “That’s the spirit. That’s why I really enjoy every single day working with them and being part of this team, because the way they look after each other is genuine, they really want the best for each other. And they recognise someone that works every single day [as] Gabby does. I think it would mean a lot to him.“It’s always very difficult emotionally to leave players out. I know how much they want to play this competition and every time you do the lineup you are disappointing a lot of players. They know how I feel about them, so they know it hurts me. The only thing I can do is my job. I have to make decisions based on increasing the probability of winning football matches. Sometimes right, sometimes wrong.”Asked if he had borrowed the use of “finishers” from rugby union, Arteta said: “Yes, I did and I love it, because I don’t like other words to describe the players. And I think, as the game is developing, they’re going to be more important in many minutes. So the quality of the minutes, I think, is going to dictate the quality of our season, for sure.”Explore more on these topicsArsenalAthletic BilbaoChampions LeagueEuropean club footballnewsShareReuse this content"

France play England in the semi-finals on Saturday.The pair were cited on Sunday after their18-13 quarter-final win against Ireland. Berthoumieu was cited for biting Wafer and, while the flanker accepted the foul play, she was appealing against the length of the initial 12-match ban a disciplinary committee proposed on Monday. That had already been reduced from the starting point of 18 matches but was taken down to nine because of her clean previous disciplinary record, remorse and public apology.Ellie Kildunne hands England boost with return for Rugby World Cup semi-finalRead moreBerthoumieu apologised to Wafer on social media on Monday, saying: “I lost my temper Sunday against Ireland. I know this is not acceptable and I am aware that this puts an end to my World Cup.“I would like to apologise to Aoife Wafer and Team Ireland, my teammates and staff, FFR and all those who support us.

Rugby is a respect sport and this gesture has nothing to do on a rugby field.”View image in fullscreenManaé Feleu will miss the rest of the World Cup.Photograph: Joe Toth/ShutterstockFeleu appealed against her three-match ban for a dangerous tackle in the Ireland match because, although the captain accepted foul play had occurred, she did not agree with the proposed sanction. That appeal has been unsuccessful as the committee found: “The tackle was high, it made contact with the head of the Ireland player and the degree of danger was high.”If the lock completes a coaching intervention programme, the ban will be reduced to two games, making her eligible to play after the World Cup concludes.Fans have questioned why in particular Berthoumieu’s bite was not picked up by match officials during the quarter-final. The tournament’s competition director, Yvonne Nolan, said the “correct process” was followed by officials and added: “These types of incidents are notoriously difficult to deal with in-game. I recognise people will review screenshots and so on and they will have their own views but I would caution that these incidents are really rare.“I don’t think I have ever seen a biting incident being dealt with in-game, they almost always require additional information after the game. That usually includes interviews with the player, ruling out things like accidental contact and they need to establish the force of the contact so a detailed statement from the player is typically needed. It usually needs an inspection of the site of any alleged bite and a review of the bruising or injury as it develops, sometimes even dental evidence becomes relevant over the course of these investigations.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThe BreakdownFree weekly newsletterThe latest rugby union news and analysis, plus all the week's action reviewedEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Neither team has a great away record. USA have only won twice on their travels since Europe joined the event in 1979, their last away victorycoming in 1993. Europe’s only win on American soil in the last 20 years came in Medinah, and we all know it took a miracle for that to happen.Of Europe’s four away wins – in 1987, 1995, 2004 and 2012 – their shock victory at Oak Hill 30 years ago remains a personal favourite. Things were far from rosy for Bernard Gallacher’s team in 1995: the captain was bruised after two defeats; there were complaints about his team selection; one star player was ruled out with an injury; and a few others were out of form.Narrow defeats in 1991 and 1993 had hurt Gallacher, who resigned from the role of captain and was only convinced to return thanks to a letter from Bernhard Langer, a conversation with Seve Ballesteros and a public plea from Nick Faldo. “I’ve been swayed for all the right reasons,” he said. “The bottom line is that I feel we can win.”The buildup: the captains make big callsGallacher first had to select his team and, with just two captain’s picks, he had the unenviable task of omitting two from Nick Faldo, José María Olazábal, Ian Woosnam and Jesper Parnevik. “He’s stuck, isn’t he?” Woosnam complained. “But he’ll get no sympathy from me. He wanted this system and we could end up without all our best players in the team.” Former captain Tony Jacklin was just as scathing. “It’s absolutely the most ridiculous decision that I’ve ever come across. They have shot themselves straight in the foot before the thing starts.”Gallacher pointed out that the players only had themselves to blame. “Everyone has known since 1993 exactly how to get into the team,” he said before selecting Faldo and Olazábal. But Woosnam made it after all, replacing Olazábal after he pulled out with a foot injury. Losing the Spaniard was a significant blow but Woosnam had won 4½ points at the previousRyder Cupand had been runner-up at Oak Hill in the 1989 US Open.View image in fullscreenIan Woosnam played his part after filling in for the injured Olazábal.Photograph: Simon Bruty/Getty ImagesThe USA team was strong but had one possible weakness. A team containing five rookies – Tom Lehman, Phil Mickelson, Jeff Maggert, Loren Roberts and Brad Faxon – was a concern, leading captain Lanny Wadkins to select the experienced duo of Fred Couples and Curtis Strange. There would be no place for Open winner John Daly as the course was not thought to suit his style of play. Wadkins’ decision to pick Strange over the Players Championship winner Lee Janzen was a surprise at the time and looked unwise come the Sunday night of the event.USA were favourites with the bookies – 1/2 to win as opposed to 15/8 for Europe – but there was some good news for fans back home. Sky Sports broadcast the event live for the first time, with the excellent duo of Ewen Murray and Bruce Critchley providing commentary. Wall-to-wall coverage for those who had access to satellite television: it was a whole new ballgame.Friday: USA build a 5-3 lead on opening dayNews that Ballesteros would be sitting out the morning foursomes made headlines, but there was simply no way Gallacher could play the Spaniard in the alternate shot format due to his poor form. The responsibility of hitting the nerve-racking first tee shot would fall on Colin Montgomerie’s shoulders, but his usually solid partnership with Faldo failed to fire. Four down after five holes, the duo managed to drag themselves back into their match against Tom Lehman and the tough Corey Pavin, but two poor shots from Faldo on the 18th let in the Americans.Howard Clark and Mark James played poorly in a 4&3 defeat to Maggert and Davis Love III, but the unexpected partnership of Sam Torrance and Constantino Rocca put Europe’s first point on the board. All eyes turned to the final foursomes match. Bernhard Langer and rookie Per Ulrik-Johansson were coasting at three up with six to play. But Ben Crenshaw and Strange fought back, leaving Langer with a six-foot putt on the last to win the match. Fortunately for Europe, there would be norepeat of Kiawah in 1991; Langer’s crucial putt pulled Europe level: 2-2 after the first session.View image in fullscreenColin Montgomerie got things going on Friday.Photograph: Simon Bruty/Getty ImagesThat was as good as it got for Gallacher on day one. Europe’s captain later admitted a huge error on his behalf when he sent the bedraggled Langer and Johansson back out to play in the fourballs shortly after their win. Faldo and Montgomerie lost again in a second session to forget for Europe. Ballesteros and David Gilford provided an unexpected bonus. “He is great to play with,” said Gilford of the Spaniard. “He wants to win so much it’s infectious.” Ballesteros was all over the place, but still he managed tohalve the 9thandwin the 10th. Birdies from Gilford on13and15sealed a point for Europe.Saturday: Europe fight back … brieflyTrailing 5-3 overnight, Europe needed a big response in the morning foursomes and they duly delivered. Faldo and Montgomerie earned their first win; Langer teamed up with Gilford to beat Lehman and Pavin; and Torrance and Rocca crushed Love III and Maggert 6&5. “He’s the rock of Italy,” Torrance said of his partner, whosehole in one at the sixthwas part of a dream morning for Europe. The only defeat came when Woosnam and rookie partner Philip Walton lost to Roberts and Peter Jacobsen. But, with the overall score at 6-6, European fans were delighted.However, the afternoon fourballs did not go so well, with Europe falling 8-7 behind before the crucial last match. As they approached the 18th hole, Langer and Faldo were all square with Pavin and Roberts. Roberts secured a par, ensuring the US would at least halve the hole. They could go one better ifPavin chipped infrom just off the green. Inevitably he did it, his ball defying pace and gravity to find the bottom of the cup. All eyes turned to Faldo, who still had a chance to secure half a point for Europe, but he missed his birdie putt. USA would take a 9-7 lead into the final day.The Americans celebrated as if the trophy was theirs, Wadkins hugging Strange as the crowd whooped in delight. Gallacher looked crestfallen. Noting the reactions of the American team and crowd, Gallacher then turned to his wife and said: “They’re having their celebrations tonight. We’ll have ours tomorrow night.”Sunday: Europe pull off stunning comebackEurope were effectively 10-7 down, such was the poor form of Ballesteros. “I only played in three matches and I hit three fairways the whole week, but I cleared out a lot of rough and all the branches on the golf course. I’m sure the members of Oak Hill aren’t going to lose balls any more,” he later reflected. Going out first against Lehman, his sheer guts and acts of escapologyinspired those behind him. Lehman won 4&3, but there was hope for Europe.James and Clark, who had not played since Friday morning, won their matches. Clark’shole in one on the 11thhelped him edge his match against Jacobsen. “That roar was heard around the course and I believe, to this day, it was the moment Europe believed,” Murray later noted.Woosnam would never win a singles match at the Ryder Cup, but he came agonisingly close to breaking his duck when somehowhis putt to defeat Couples slid past the hole. Rocca lost to Love III in a repeat of their 1993 match, giving the hosts a two-point lead, before Gallacher’s ploy of putting his strength in the middle order paid dividends.Gilford nearly blew his match after going through the 18th green,his bogey putt from 10 feetenough to see off Brad Faxon as the American failed to make par; Montgomerie ended with four threes to defeat Crenshaw; Torrance comfortably beat Roberts. Langer may have lost to the superb Pavin, but Europe were now within touching distance of an astonishing comeback.View image in fullscreenSeve Ballesteros was nowhere near his best at Oak Hill but he inspired his teammates.Photograph: Getty ImagesEverything rested on the Strange v Faldo match. But with Faldo one down on the 17th, it was time for the five-time major winner to dig deep.A six-foot par putt on the 17thwas enough to level the match – Strange unable to hide the distress on his face – as more and more people gathered around the pivotal contest.On the 18th Faldo found the rough with his drive, but after deliberately laying up he playeda sublime approach to within a few feet. With Strange unable to make par,Faldo rolled his putt in– “everything was shaking bar the putter” – holding his arms aloft as Europe took the lead for the first time. “Our hearts go out to Nick Faldo,” Murray announced. As Seve embraced Faldo, the pair shed tears inan iconic moment for European golf.The top 40 theme tunes in sportRead moreThe winning moment looked like it might not arrive. Europe could not lose, but Walton was struggling to close out his match against Jay Haas. All Walton had to do was halve one of the last three holes to get Europe over the line. Haas pitched infrom a bunker at the 16thand Waltonmissed a putt for the cupon the 17th, so the agony continued to the last hole.Haas played the 18th poorly as understandably nerves frayed, allowing Walton to chip from the bank in front of the green and have the luxury of two putts for the cup. As hisball rolled next to the hole, it was done. “And the Ryder Cup will be on Concorde tonight,” declared an excited Murray. Gallacher jumped up in delight before hurling himself at Walton. Against the odds, Europe had won the cup back.The aftermath: over to you, SeveGallacher showed his class during the closing ceremony,helping a tearful Wadkins through his speech. “Been there, done that,” Wadkins joked as Gallacher stood up and patted him on the back.Gallacher could enjoy some Sunday night celebrations after all. “People were writing us off, calling me a three-time loser,” Gallacher said. “But we won as a team, not as individuals. I’m proud that every player on this team contributed a point. They all shared in our success.” The path was now clear for Ballesteros to lead the team at Valderrama.Sky’s montage – includingSave the Best for Lastby Vanessa Williams – was a fine tribute. Not many gave Europe a chance, but winning the singles for the first time in the US helped Gallacher’s team defy the odds. Sky had saved the best for first.This article is bySteven PyeforThat 1980s Sports BlogExplore more on these topicsRyder CupGuardian Sport NetworkGolfUS sportsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

Now he might hold the key to who wins the global AI raceChang CheTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 05.23 EDTShareView image in fullscreenSong-chun Zhu at Peking University, July 2025.Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The GuardianBy the time Song-Chun Zhu was six years old, he had encountered death more times than he could count. Or so it felt. This was the early 1970s, the waning years of the Cultural Revolution, and his father ran a village supply store in ruralChina. There was little to do beyond till the fields and study Mao Zedong at home, and so the shop became a refuge where people could rest, recharge and share tales. Zhu grew up in that shop, absorbing a lifetime’s worth of tragedies: a family friend lost in a car crash, a relative from an untreated illness, stories of suicide or starvation. “That was really tough,” Zhu recalled recently. “People were so poor.”The young Zhu became obsessed with what people left behind after they died. One day, he came across a book that contained his family genealogy. When he asked the bookkeeper why it included his ancestors’ dates of birth and death but nothing about their lives, the man told him matter of factly that they were peasants, so there was nothing worth recording. The answer terrified Zhu. He resolved that his fate would be different.Today, at 56, Zhu is one of the world’s leading authorities in artificial intelligence. In 1992, he left China for the US to pursue a PhD in computer science at Harvard. Later, at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), he led one of the most prolific AI research centres in the world, won numerous major awards, and attracted prestigious research grants from the Pentagon and the National Science Foundation. He was celebrated for his pioneering research into how machines can spot patterns in data, which helped lay the groundwork for modern AI systems such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek. He and his wife, and their two US-born daughters, lived in a hilltop home on Los Angeles’s Mulholland Drive. He thought he would never leave.But in August 2020, after 28 years in the US, Zhu astonished his colleagues and friends by suddenly moving back to China, where he took up professorships at two top Beijing universities and a directorship in a state-sponsored AI institute. The Chinese media feted him as a patriot assisting the motherland in its race toward artificial intelligence. US lawmakers would later demand to know how funders such as UCLA and the Pentagon had ignored “concerning signs” of Zhu’s ties to a geopolitical rival. In 2023, Zhu became a member of China’s top political advisory body, where he proposed that China should treat AI with the same strategic urgency as a nuclear weapons programme.Zhu’s journey from rural China to the helm of one of the US’s leading AI labs was both improbable and part of a much bigger story. For almost a century, the world’s brightest scientific minds were drawn to the US as the place where they could best advance their research. The work of these new arrivals had helped secure US dominance in technologies such as nuclear weapons, semiconductors and AI. Today, that era seems to be coming to a close. Donald Trump is dismantling the very aspects of US society that once made it so appealing for international talents. He has shut off research funding and attempted to bully top universities, which hisadministrationviewsas hostile institutions. As US-China tensions have grown, Chinese-born students and professors in the US have faced additional pressures. In a callback to the “red scare” of the 1950s, Chinese students and professors have beendetained and deported, and had their visas revoked.Even as the Trump administration lays siege to the foundations of US science, it has been trumpeting its plans to beat its Chinese rival in the field of AI. In July, Trump announced the creation of a $90bn “AI hub” in Pennsylvania, as well as a national blueprint – created in close coordination with Silicon Valley tech leaders – to dominate every aspect of AI globally, from infrastructure to governance. “America is the country that started the AI race,” Trump said. “I’m here today to declare that America is going to win it.” A month later, China unveiled its ownblueprint, vowing to fuse AI with the marrow of its economy, from factory automation to elder care.At his lavishly funded Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence, Zhu is one of a handful of individuals who the Chinese government has entrusted to push the AI frontier. His ideas are now shaping undergraduate curriculums and informing policymakers. But his philosophy is strikingly different from the prevailing paradigm in the US. American companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Anthropic have collectively invested billions of dollars on the premise that, equipped with enough data and computing power, models built from neural networks – mathematical systems loosely based on neurons in the brain – could lead humanity to the holy grail of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Broadly speaking, AGI refers to a system that can perform not just narrow tasks, but any task, at a level comparable or superior to the smartest humans. Some people in tech also see AGI as a turning point, when machines become capable of runaway self-improvement. They believe large language models, powered by neural networks, may be five to 10 years away from “takeoff”.Zhu insists that these ideas are built on sand. A sign of true intelligence, he argues, is the ability to reason towards a goal with minimal inputs – what he calls a “small data, big task” approach, compared with the “big data, small task” approach employed by large language models like ChatGPT. AGI, Zhu’s team has recently said, is characterised by qualities such as resourcefulness in novel situations, social and physical intuition, and an understanding of cause and effect. Large language models, Zhu believes, will never achieve this. Some AIexpertsin the US have similarly questioned the prevailing orthodoxy in Silicon Valley, and their views have grown louder this year as AI progress has slowed and new releases,like GPT-5, have disappointed. A different path is needed, and that is what Zhu is working on in Beijing.It is hard, in the current AI race, to separate out purely intellectual inquiry from questions of geopolitics. Where researchers choose to carry out their work has become a high-stakes matter. Yet for some scientists, the thrill of intellectual inquiry – as well as the prospect of personal glory – may remain more compelling than the pursuit of national advantage. Mark Nitzberg, Zhu’s friend of 20 years and a fellow classmate back in their Harvard days, was surprised by Zhu’s abrupt return to China. “I asked him: ‘Are you sure you want to do this?’” Nitzberg told me. Returning, he told Zhu, could make him a “vector” to help China dominate AI. In Nitzberg’s recollection, Zhu replied: “They are giving me resources that I could never get in the United States. If I want to make this system that I have in my mind, then this is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have to do it.”Nearly everyone who knows Zhu in the west asked me the same question: have you been to his office? Tucked behind Weiming Lake on the north side of Peking University campus, it almost seems built to dazzle visitors. A latticed wooden gate marks the entrance, after which you are led into a courtyard residence that Zhu uses for lectures and seminars. There, his assistants gesture you to the end of the hall, where a back door opens on to a breathtaking landscape of rocks, streams and pomegranate trees. Another courtyard residence can be spotted across the stream, on its own island, accessible via a stone footbridge. That is Zhu’s “office”.One spring morning when I visited, Zhu was admiring his flora, while grumbling that his stream had been muddied by a rain shower the day before. I asked him who was maintaining the grounds. “We’ve got an entire team,” he said, gesturing to a group of men who had just entered the courtyard. Across from Zhu’s office, on the other side of the stream, is a glass-encased meeting room where he holds court with visitors. We sat there as Zhu began recounting a life spent straddling two superpowers.Born in 1969, near Ezhou, an ancient river port along the Yangtze, Zhu was the youngest of five children. When he was very young, a wave of intellectuals arrived in his village to be “reeducated”, as part of Mao’s nationwide campaign to remould “bourgeois thought” through hard labour. At night, under candlelight and paraffin lamps, teachers, priests and college graduates held salons near the supply store where Zhu’s father worked. Zhu listened as they debated everything from the Soviet Union’s growing involvement in Afghanistan to the US elections. “By the time I entered elementary school, I felt like I had a good grasp of what was happening in China and the world,” Zhu told me. He knew he did not want to stay in his home town and work in his father’s shop.After Mao died in 1976, reformers took over the Communist party and soon scientific education replaced Marx as the new religion. Zhu was the top student at his local high school, and won a place at one of the nation’s best universities, the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in the city of Hefei, where he majored in computer science. By 1986, when Zhu began his degree, relations between the US and China had normalised and some of his professors were among the first batch of Chinese scholars sent on state-sponsored visits to the US. They brought back hauls of books to be translated. “At the time, we saw America as a beacon, a cathedral of science,” Zhu said.Among the imported books was Visionby David Marr, a British neuroscientist who had famously broken down human vision – a biological process – into a mathematical framework. Marr’s work suggested that machines might one day be able to “see” the world as humans do. Zhu was hooked. Ever since then, he has dreamed of mapping intelligence – how we think, reason and exercise moral judgment – with the mathematical precision of a physicist charting the cosmos. Building an AGI was, for him, not an end goal, but a part of his deeper pursuit: to discover a “theory of everything” for the mind.Zhu is known to have cried twice in public over recent years. The first was when recounting to his students the story of his acceptance to Harvard. In 1991, when Zhu graduated from USTC, he was so poor he couldn’t afford the application fees required by American universities. He applied anyway, without paying the fees, though not to the country’s most elite schools – he didn’t dare. In any case, he was summarily rejected. The following year, one of his professors suggested that Zhu apply again, and that Ivy League schools, which had more money, might not care about the missing application fee. A few months later, he was astonished to receive a thick yellow envelope from Harvard, offering him a full fellowship in the university’s doctoral programme in computer science. “It changed my life,” Zhu said.View image in fullscreenSong-Chun Zhu in the gardens outside his office at Peking University, 10 July 2025.Photograph: Sean Gallagher/The GuardianThe man responsible was David Mumford, a decorated mathematician and Fields medalist who, a few years prior, had begun working on computer vision, a field of AI focused on enabling machines to recognise and process visual information. When Mumford came across an applicant from central China who espoused a “theory of everything” for intelligence, and cited Marr as his muse, he was captivated. “I was just flabbergasted at his vision and how he was going about approaching AI in this comprehensive way,” Mumford told me. In a 2020interview, Mumford, who became Zhu’s adviser, mentioned the moment he realised he “was dealing with something special”. Zhu had taken an hour-long exam, but left one question blank. Not because it was hard, but because it was too easy. “He said, ‘This is ridiculous,’” recalled Mumford, “but he answered everything else perfectly.”During our conversations over the course of this spring, Zhu seemed to associate Harvard with the US he had dreamed of in his youth: an open laboratory where a country bumpkin from rural China could, with enough gumption, make technological miracles into reality. This was the US of Edison and Einstein, the land that welcomed Jewish physicists fleeing Hitler’s Germany and gave them refuge, dignity and labs at Los Alamos. In Zhu’s eyes, it was a country that rewarded intellect and ambition over race, ideology and nationality. At Harvard, he never felt out of place, though occasionally he was puzzled by his new home. On one occasion he asked his classmate Nitzberg why no one picked the apples from the trees around Harvard campus. He thought it was a waste of food.It wasn’t until 1997 that Zhu experienced a real culture shock in the US. After completing his doctorate at Harvard and a brief stint at Brown University, he arrived at Stanford to work as a lecturer. He was accompanied by his wife, Jenny, a former classmate at USTC, whom he had married in 1994. At the time, the Bay was bursting with dot-com excitement. Yahoo had recently gone public on Wall Street and venture capitalists were hovering around campus. Two PhD students in Zhu’s department, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had just created a search engine called google.com. As students flocked to courses on web development, Zhu’s more theoretical classes on pattern recognition struggled to attract much interest. It was a disheartening moment for him. “At Harvard, it was all about understanding. Their logo was three books,” he told me. But Stanford’slogo– an “S” behind a tree – looked “like a dollar sign”.Zhu spent a year at Stanford before moving on to Ohio State University, whose culture he found unambitious and parochial, and then in 2002 to UCLA, where he obtained tenure at the age of 33. That same year, Jenny gave birth to their second daughter, Zhu Yi, and a year later he received the Marr Prize, the top award in computer vision. Colleagues likened him to Steve Jobs for his intensity and intolerance of mediocrity. When I asked one of his collaborators at UCLA about what it was like to work with Zhu, he said: “It’s as if I’m on the frontlines of a battlefield. We don’t sit down with a cup of coffee and talk about life or our families. That never happens. It’s always just about work and research.”During Zhu’s 18 years at UCLA, his field went through almost unimaginable changes. For roughly the first half of this period, he was a leading figure in the AI mainstream. Yet in the second half, he became increasingly disillusioned. Speak to different people and they will propose different theories as to why Zhu ultimately decided to leave the US, but there is little doubt that he was influenced, at least in part, by his intellectual estrangement from the field he had once helped shape.Zhu’s relationship to the so-called “godfathers of AI” – figures such asGeoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio and Yann LeCun – is, to put it mildly, complicated. There was a time, however, when they were all roughly on the same page. Drawn to the common goal of making intelligent machines, they saw visual perception as a key problem to crack. Until the late 1980s and 90s, the most popular way to make computers “see” was through hand-coded instructions. To identify a handwritten digit, for example, a researcher wrote detailed instructions to a computer, accounting for each scenario where the lines and strokes matched that digit. This rule-based approach was brittle – slight variations in handwriting could break the logic.Then came a series of breakthroughs. In the late 1980s, LeCun, then a researcher at AT&T Bell Labs, developed a powerful neural network that learned to recognise handwritten zip codes by training on thousands of examples. A parallel development soon unfolded at Harvard and Brown. In 1995, Zhu and a team of researchers there started developing probability-based methods that could learn to recognise patterns and textures – cheetah spots, grass etc – and even generate new examples of that pattern. These were not neural networks: members of the “Harvard-Brown school”, as Zhu called his team, cast vision as a problem of statistics and relied on methods such as “Bayesian inference” and “Markov random fields”. The two schools spoke different mathematical languages and had philosophical disagreements. But they shared an underlying logic – that data, rather than hand-coded instructions, could supply the infrastructure for machines to grasp the world and reproduce its patterns – that exists in today’s AI systems such as ChatGPT.Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, Zhu and the Harvard-Brown school were some of the most influential voices in the computer vision field. Their statistical models helped convince many researchers that lack of data was a key impediment to AI progress. To address this problem, in 2004, two years into his time at UCLA, Zhu and a Microsoft executive set up the Lotus Hill Institute in Zhu’s home town of Ezhou, China. Researchers annotated images of everyday objects such as tables and cups in their physical contexts, and fed them into a big dataset that could be used to train a powerful statistical model. Lotus Hill was one of the earliest attempts to construct the large-scale datasets needed to improve and test AI systems.By 2009, however, Zhu was losing faith in the data-driven approach. His Lotus Hill team had annotated more than half a million images, but Zhu was troubled by a simple problem: what part of an image one annotated depended, somewhat arbitrarily, on what task one wanted the machines to achieve. If the task was to identify a cup for a robot to grasp, the handle’s position might be critical. If the task was to estimate the cup’s market value, details like the brand and material mattered more. Zhu believed that a truly generalisable intelligence must be able to “think” beyond the data. “If you train on a book, for example, your machine might learn how people talk, but why did we say those words? How did we come to utter them?” Zhu explained to me. A deeper layer of cognition was missing. In 2010, Zhu shut down the institute. He set out instead to build agents with a “cognitive architecture” capable of reasoning, planning and evolving in their physical and social contexts with only small amounts of data.His timing could not have been worse. Around the same time, an assistant professor at Princeton named Fei-Fei Li released ImageNet, a larger dataset containing more than 3 million labelled images of common objects such as dogs, chairs and bicycles. (Li had attended a workshop at the Lotus Hill Institute and would latercite Zhuas one of her influences.) ImageNet was publicly accessible, and its size and relative simplicity enabled AI researchers to test and hone their image-recognition algorithms. In autumn 2012, a neural network developed by Hinton and his team smashed the ImageNet competition, cementing the dominance of neural networks and kickstarting the global wave of AI adoption that continues to this day.“Just as I turned my back to big data, it exploded,” wrote Zhu some years later, in a message to his mentor, Mumford. The most explicit clash between Zhu and the neural network school occurred in 2012, just months before the latter’s ImageNet triumph. At the time, Zhu was a general chair of CVPR, the foremost computer vision conference in the US, and that year a paper involving neural networks co-authored by LeCun was rejected. LeCun wrote a furious letter to the committee calling the peer reviews “so ridiculous” that he didn’t know how to “begin writing a rebuttal without insulting the reviewers”. Even today, Zhu maintains that the reviewers were right to have rejected LeCun’s paper. “The theoretical work was not clean,” he told me. “Tell me exactly what you are doing. Why is it so good?” Zhu’s question gets to the heart of his problem with neural networks: though they perform extraordinarily well on numerous tasks, it is not easy to discern why. In Zhu’s view, that has fostered a culture of complacency, a performance-at-all-cost mentality. A better system, he believes, should be more structured and responsible. Either it or its creator should be able to explain its responses.Whatever Zhu’s reservations, the ImageNet victory triggered an AI gold rush, and many of the pioneers of neural networks were celebrated for their work. Hinton would go on to join Google. LeCun moved to Meta, and Ilya Sutskever, a co-author of the neural network that won ImageNet, helped found OpenAI. In 2018, Hinton and LeCun, along with Bengio,shared the Turing award– computer science’s most prestigious prize – for their work on neural networks. In 2024, Hinton was one of the joint winners of the Nobel prize in physics for his “foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks”.Writing to Mumford, Zhu maintained he had “no regret” about the path he had chosen. But he did feel bitter that Hinton’s team had, to his mind, reaped the rewards of his earlier research. The statistical models and algorithms developed by the Harvard-Brown school in the 1980s and 1990s, Zhu told me, “laid the foundation for later deep learning and large language models”. Hinton and his team “didn’t acknowledge that”, he claimed. A longtime US-based collaborator of Zhu’s, who requested anonymity for fear of US government retaliation, contested Zhu’s interpretation. Zhu deserves more credit, he said, for being one of the earliest advocates of the data-driven paradigm in computer vision, but Hinton’s team devised the algorithms that perfected that approach and enabled it to scale. (Hinton and Bengio declined to comment. LeCun did not respond to requests for comment.)In the mid-to-late 2010s, as neural networks were making startling progress on problems from facial recognition to disease diagnosis, Zhu was reading philosophy – the Confucians “understand the world much better than AI researchers”, he told me – and working quietly on his cognitive architecture. He was walking a lonely path. In 2019, Zhu served again as a general chair of the CVPR conference. As he read the submitted papers, his heart sank. Nearly all of them focused on squeezing incremental gains from neural networks on narrow tasks. By this time, Zhu’s opposition to neural networks had become visceral. A former doctoral student at UCLA recalled being berated by Zhu several times for sneaking neural networks into his papers. His inner circle learned to avoid forbidden phrases – “neural nets”, “deep learning”, “transformer” (the “T” in GPT). On one occasion, during an all-hands meeting at a LA-based startup Zhu had founded, a new recruit unwittingly added a slide on deep learning to his presentation. According to someone who was present, Zhu blasted him in front of the whole company. (Zhu told me this was “exaggerated”.)“When he has a vision,” Zhu’s longtime collaborator told me, with some understatement, “he has a very strong belief that he’s right.”As Zhu’s ideas were being consigned to the margins of the AI community, the broader climate for Chinese scientists in the US was also growing less hospitable. Tensions between the two nations were rising. In China, Xi Jinping muscled his military into a dominant position in the South China Sea and issued internal party edicts warning against adopting “western values”. During Trump’s first presidency, the US designated China as its chief strategic competitor, launched a trade war andblacklisted Chinese tech companies. Under Joe Biden, the US maintained a similarly tough approach to China.Though world powers routinely spy on each other, in recent years US officials have been alarmed by the scale of China’s espionage campaigns. In 2018, the justice department launched the “China Initiative”, a programme to counter the theft of trade secrets and alleged espionage on US campuses. Critics of the programme claimed that it relied onracial profiling. More than 100 professors of Chinese descentwere investigatedfor allegedly stealing sensitive technologies. Most who were formally charged had their charges dismissed or dropped, and few were found to have been involved in direct intellectual property theft. The Trump-era effort altered the relationship between Chinese scientists and the US. According to a well-knownacademic study, return migration nearly doubled for experienced Chinese scholars living in the US after 2018.At the end of 2018, Zhu began receiving calls from a reporter at the Silicon Valley news site The Information, asking about a$150,000 granthe had recently accepted from Huawei, the Chinese telecoms giant. That same month, the USlabelled Huaweia national security threat. Zhu told me that the Huawei money came with no strings attached and that he had used it to fund research by his PhD students. Eager to put the matter to rest, he told the reporter that he would not accept any future donations from the company. “Right now, China-US relations are toxic,” he said at the time. “We are caught in the middle of this.”As US-China relations soured, Zhu found it increasingly difficult to secure funding for AI research, much of which had previously flowed from the US military. He says he has never been questioned by federal agents, nor has he been stopped and questioned by US border officers about his research and connections to China, though his former PhD students have. After the China Initiative began, according to Nitzberg, some of Zhu’s students became so accustomed to being held up at immigration that they would budget the extra hours at the airport when arranging travel to conferences.View image in fullscreenThe ‘China Initiative’ in Donald Trump’s first term as president altered the relationship between Chinese scientists and the US.Photograph: Dmitri Lovetsky/APIn this atmosphere, where China had come to be seen as a direct competitor – or even threat – to the US, scientific links to China that had long been seen as normal now came under a cloud of suspicion. Much of this was based on misapprehensions on how academic research actually works, but it is also true that for decades, the Chinese government had encouraged its US-based scientists to return to China, rolling out recruitment initiatives. The most famous of these, theThousand Talents Plan, became widely associated with spying and intellectual property theft. In 2024, Mike Gallagher, the chair of the House select committee on China requested documents from UCLA and federal agencies, questioning why Zhu had received millions of dollars of federal funding, despite having allegedly also received funding through the Thousand Talents Plan and having had a “role as a doctoral adviser and researcher at the Beijing Institute of Technology, a prominent Chinese university that has ‘the stated mission of supporting China’s military research and defense industries’”.On my second visit to Zhu’s office, in May, we discussed these allegations. A secretary poured us tea, refilling our cups the moment they were empty. Zhu denied having any affiliation with the Beijing Institute of Technology, but acknowledged he had co-supervised a PhD student from there who worked at Lotus Hill. He also told me that in 2009, while he was at UCLA, his Lotus Hill team had applied for a local talent programme grant from the Ezhou government, which he used to subsidise researcher salaries. (This was not, he said, part of the Thousand Talents Plan. The national programme spawned many local variants that borrowed the label to attract top scholars to their regions.) He added that there was nothing “sensitive” about the image annotation work conducted there. The funding, he said, lapsed once he shut down the institute in 2010. As for why he had chosen to locate the institute in China, Zhu cited the same reason as thousands of other American enterprises that had set up in China during these years: labour was cheap.It was in summer 2020, in the early months of Covid, Zhu says, that he made the decision to leave the US. He cited his disaffection with the direction of the AI community and the hothouse of American politics – both its leftwing brand of campus progressivism and the Trump-era national security crusades. There was also a personal factor. His younger daughter, Zhu Yi, is a figure skater who was recruited in 2018 to compete for China in the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. By 2019, she had become a Chinese citizen and was competing and training with the Chinese team in Beijing.At the time he decided to leave, Zhu told me, he did not have any job offers from Chinese institutions. By the autumn, he had been offered full professorships at Peking University and Tsinghua University. Then the city of Beijing agreed to sponsor an AI institute run by Zhu, which would be called the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BigAI).However, two sources familiar with the matter contested Zhu’s timeline. They say conversations between Zhu and members of the Beijing municipal government began earlier – in early 2018 – and that these concerned not just his potential move to China but that of his younger daughter. In January 2018, Zhu Yi won the novice title at the US figure skating championship. Not long after, the Chinese Olympic Committee recruited her in the same cohort as Eileen Gu, the freestyle skier. After a few stumbles in her Olympic debut, some online commentersquestionedwhether Zhu Yi had been a bargaining chip for her father. When I put this to Zhu, he called the online speculation “totally wrong” and “not how things work in China”. He acknowledged that he had discussed his daughter’s recruitment with Chinese officials in early 2018, but denied that his return was ever discussed in those conversations. (In February, the Beijing city sports bureau released its 2025 budget, revealing that it had set aside $6.6msolely to supportEileen Gu and Zhu Yi’s training for the 2026 Winter Olympics.)In August 2020, Zhu flew to China on a one-way ticket. Many of his colleagues and graduate students at UCLA did not know he was planning to leave until he was already gone. He had even kept his decision from his older daughter, who was living in the Bay Area. Zhu attributed his secrecy to the politically volatile climate. Trump was referring to Covid as the “kung flu” and hate crimes against Chinese people had soared. I took Zhu to mean that he did not want to be publicly scapegoated for his decision to move. He knew his personal choice carried larger geopolitical weight.On the morning that he left the US, Zhu stood outside his house with his suitcase, looking across the sun-bathed hills of Los Angeles. At the edge of the driveway, he turned back and paused to admire his rose garden. It was everything he could have dreamed of as a child, listening to stories of a world beyond his village. Now he was saying goodbye.The second time Zhu is known to have cried – he prefers to say “moved emotionally” – was when watching a documentary with his students on the life ofQian Xuesen. The Chinese-born, MIT-educated rocket scientist served on the Manhattan Project and helped develop the US’s first guided ballistic missiles. During the McCarthy era, US authorities revoked Qian’s security clearance and kept him under house arrest on suspicion of espionage. No evidence emerged to support such allegations, and in 1955 he was sent back to China in exchange for US prisoners of war. Back in China, Qian led a series of military and technological breakthroughs that helped turn the country into the superpower it is today. Under the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” programme that he led, China developed the capability to launch ballistic missiles that could strike the US.In the US, Qian’s story has beencited as a cautionary taleof American self-sabotage, a reminder of how anti-communist paranoia drove away a brilliant mind. In the official Chinese version, Qian was a selfless patriot who willingly gave up a comfortable life in the US to serve his backward country. In the 1980s, Qian was a household name among aspiring scientists like Zhu, and since Zhu’s own return to China, the parallels have been clear. In 2023, Zhu suggested to the Communist party’s top political advisory body that it should treat AI in the manner of the Two Bombs, One Satellite programme – that is, a top-down, centrally coordinated plan to race ahead in AI research. When I asked him about that proposal, his response was understated. “In the US, we academics always agreed that we wanted to start a Manhattan Project for AI,” he said. “China should also have a centralised plan for AI. This is natural, there’s no secret about it.”Zhu has started telling Qian’s story to his undergraduates in Beijing, though which version he emphasises – the scientist betrayed by his adopted homeland or the Chinese patriot – is unclear. When I asked him whether it mattered who won the AI race – the US or China – he paused. “Do I want the Silicon Valley people to win? Probably not.” He wants, he said, the most ethical version of AI to win.As we talked, Zhu noted how prescient his departure now looks, given the scorched-earth politics of the second Trump administration. In onerecent poll, three in four scientists in the US said they were considering leaving. Many AI leaders, including LeCun, havespoken outabout how Trump’s budget cuts to scientific research will harm their work. Chinese universities have capitalised on the exodus,courting studentsfrom Harvard and researchers who have lost their jobs following recent federal budget cuts. (The EU isdoing the same.) In May, Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, threatened to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas. And in a revival of China Initiative rhetoric, Republicans have introduced legislation that they say would “counter China’s malign ambitions to steal American research”.It is a common refrain, on the American right, that the US has lost its ambition, the kind once embodied by the Manhattan Project or Apollo missions, and that it is falling behind. Chinese EVs zip through Europe’s countryside and American pharmacies depend heavily on Chinese-made ingredients. Chinahassurpassedthe US in the number of authored papers in science and technology journals, and that gap is likely to grow. There are four times as manyStem studentsgraduating from Chinese universities each year than in the US. The danger is that in chasing away international talent, the US risks undoing one of the advantages it once had over its competitors. (“My PhD students at Peking University are at least on a par with those at MIT and Stanford,” Zhu told me proudly.) Openness to the world’s smartest minds is what helped the US establish its lead in the AI race, as well as countless other fields.When Zhu left the US, his collaborators feared that his research in China would lose its independence. Zhu, by contrast, has suggested that he feels more liberated to focus on his research in Beijing. Formally, his US-based collaborators were right: there is no separation between the state and research institutions in China. Yet in practice, China’s scientists tend to enjoy considerable autonomy, and if they are working in an area of strategic importance, immense resources can be channelled their way. In the five years since his move to Beijing, Zhu has been offered several hundred million dollars of research funding from Chinese sources, according to two people close to him. The deal with the state is like a long and loose leash – most of the time it is slack, but it can be pulled, tightened at the party’s whim.In the US, academics who, in principle, are never leashed, are now feeling a sudden yank from the Trump administration. Billions of dollars in research funding have been paused until universities acquiesce to what the Harvard University president described as “direct governmental regulation” of the university’s “intellectual conditions”. In March, Columbia University agreed to new oversight of its Middle Eastern, South Asian and African Studies departments. Tony Chan, the former president of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and a former faculty dean at UCLA, has experience in both university systems. He told me what he is seeing now in the US is worse than anything he ever saw in China. “We used to be able to clearly say that US universities were independent of the politicians. That was the advantage of the American academic system,” Chan told me. “I cannot say that any more.”In both China and the US, Zhu has a reputation as a tough academic adviser, with strict intellectual orthodoxies. According to his current students in Beijing, he has a go-to refrain, now immortalised as a gif that circulates in their group chats: “If you do that again, you will be dismissed!” Zhu is not, in other words, easily swayed. So when OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT in 2022, and much of the Chinese tech sector was stunned – one Chinese AI founderadmittedhe felt “lost” and “couldn’t sleep”, demoralised by the feeling of being bested again by the west – Zhu was untroubled. At an AI panel in early 2023, he avoided any praise for ChatGPT as a technical feat. Large language models, he said, “still fall short” of AGI because they do not “have the ability to understand or align with human values”.Later that year, Mumford, the professor who Zhu credits with changing his life by admitting him to Harvard, travelled to Beijing toreceive a maths prize. He was in his 80s and had been retired for nearly a decade. Were it not for the chance to “find out what Song-Chun was doing”, Mumford told me, he likely wouldn’t have made the trip. The two share a close bond, and used to meet regularly at Zhu’s lab in UCLA. In Zhu’s office at Peking University, there is a framed letter from Mumford to Zhu in which he wrote: “I feel that you are truly my intellectual heir.”View image in fullscreenA humanoid robot shakes hands with a journalist at the Zhongguancun Forum in Beijing, March 2025.Photograph: VCG/Getty ImagesThey do not agree on everything, however. While Zhu had largely dismissed neural networks, Mumford came to see something profound in their mathematical structure, and he wanted to nudge his old student to reassess his views. “More than anything else,” Mumford told me, “what I was trying to convey was that I felt BigAI had to have a big team working on deep learning techniques in order to be successful.”In Beijing, Mumford strolled with Zhu through the creeks, willows and paved roads of the Peking University campus, and dined with Zhu’s family. Then Mumford pressed his case. Zhu’s friends and students told me that it appears to have worked – somewhat. He has allowed his students to experiment with transformers – the most advanced neural network architecture – on some tasks. Researchers who once sneaked neural networks into their projects like contraband say they can use them more openly. Zhu is “by far the most brilliant student in computer vision I ever had”, Mumford later told me. And yet “it took him a long time to see that deep learning was doing tremendous things. I feel that was a major mistake of his.”Nevertheless, neural networks will always play a circumscribed role in Zhu’s vision of AGI. “It’s not that we reject these methods,” Zhu told me. “What we say is they have their place.”One Saturday morning in March, Zhu invited me to an annual tech forum in Beijing where BigAI was showcasing its latest technology. A robot dog pranced around the conference building as onlookers shouted commands (“Sit. Sit! I said SIT DOWN!”). Nearby, children clustered around a spindly mechanical arm playing the strategy game Go. Outside the main hall, a humanoid female head with almond-coloured eyes stared blankly into the crowd. When visitors approached, it scanned their faces. Soon, its silicone skin began to twitch, contorting into facial expressions that mimicked theirs.At the previous year’s tech forum, BigAI had unveiled a virtual humanoid child named TongTong, who, they hoped, would have capabilities that most AIs lack. Researchers widely agree that commonsense intuitions about how the physical and social world work are among the hardest things for neural networks to grasp. As LeCun recently put it: “We have LLMs that can pass the bar exam, so they must be smart. But then they can’t learn to drive in 20 hours like any 17-year-old, they can’t learn to clear up the dinner table, or fill in the dishwasher like any 10-year-old can in one shot. Why is that? What are we missing?” TongTong wasn’t ready to practise law, but it seemed to be able to load a dishwasher. It was designed to mimic the cognitive and emotional capacities of a three- to four-year-old child.This year, the BigAI team was debutingTongTong 2.0, which they claim has the capabilities of a five- or six-year-old. On a large video screen, TongTong 2.0 took the form of an animated girl playing in a virtual living room. At the front of the conference room, a BigAI engineer was going through a live demonstration of TongTong’s abilities. When the engineer asked TongTong to work with her friend LeLe, another AI agent, to find a toy, TongTong appeared to avoid areas her friend had already searched. Later, when TongTong was asked to retrieve a TV remote from a bookshelf that was out of reach, she used a cushion to give herself an extra boost. (When prompting ChatGPT to do similar tasks, researchers havefoundit to be an “inexperienced commonsense problem solver”. Zhu believes that this weakness is not one that deep learning systems such as ChatGPT will be able to overcome.)For now, TongTong exists only as a software operating within a simulated environment, rather than a 3D robot in the physical world. After the presentation, BigAI announced several partnerships with robotics companies. A crucial test of Zhu’s technology will be whether it can exist as an embodied system and still perform the reasoning and planning he ascribes so much weight to.Weizenbaum’s nightmares: how the inventor of the first chatbot turned against AIRead moreBefore the presentation, Zhu had arrived at the podium in a blue blazer to deliver a keynote. He began by contrasting his own AI philosophy with what he called the “Silicon Valley narrative”, that AGI could be attained through more data and computing power. The Chinese media, the public and government agencies had been sold a false narrative, one that had spawned a profusion of vacuous Chinese “AI institutes” and inflated startup valuations, as he put it in a written version of thespeechpublished later. One consequence of this misdirection was that it had convinced the Chinese that they were victims of the west’s “stranglehold”, orkabozi, a term that has come to refer to the US’s export controls to China on high-end computer chips. To Zhu, the key factor holding back AI progress is not insufficient computing power, but a misguided approach to the whole subject. What had started as an academic feud conducted in conferences and peer review journals now seemed to be entangled in an epoch-defining contest for technological supremacy.Zhu is remarkably consistent in his views, but the way he frames his message has shifted over the years. In his speech, his rhetoric occasionally echoed that of party officials, who issue warnings not to follow the west on issues such as free trade and human rights. China, Zhu said, needed to “resist blindly following” the Silicon Valley narrative and develop its own “self-sufficient” approach to AI. (“The officials really like how he frames things,” one of his former students told me.) And yet in my four meetings with Zhu, he struck me as more intensely animated by the stakes of his intellectual quarrels than by international competition between the two countries where he had each spent exactly half his life. In service of his ambitions, he had learned to speak the Communist party’s vernacular.By the time I left Zhu’s courtyard residence, it was the late afternoon. The sun had slanted below the rooftops, setting the magnolia blossoms aglow in a wash of pink. Zhu accompanied me back to the lattice fence that marked the entrance to his office. He wanted to reiterate that politics was not what was motivating him. “Over the last 30 years, I’ve been focused on one thing. It’s the unified theory of AI. To build understanding. That’s my only drive,” he told me. He brought up his research with Mumford again. “The Harvard and Brown school” of computer science, Zhu said, proudly. “That’s what we’re carrying on here.”This article was supported by a grant from theTarbell CenterListen to our podcastshereand sign up to the long read weekly emailhere."

Forty-eight per cent growth in its business compared with the same quarter last year, including 93% growth in its US commercial business. These elephantine numbers are maddening – and, in large part, a result of the company fully embracing artificial intelligence (AI).The AI revolution is here and as its proponentsremindus daily, it will remake our world, making every company and government agency more efficient and less error-prone while helping us unlock hitherto unheard of advances in science and technology. Not only this, but if we play our cards right, big tech’s latest explosion could yield unprecedented economic growth.Though, we might ask, growth for whom?Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreConsiderOpenAI, the technology giant behind ChatGPT. In a promo video announcing the latest upgrade for their flagship software, its CEO, Sam Altman,bragged: “It can write an entire computer program from scratch.” Three days later, the New York Timesreportedthat computer science grads “are facing some of the highest unemployment rates” among their peers. And it’s not just coders and engineers. AI-powered automation promises to swallow up jobs at the low end of the labor market too, with McDonald’s, Walmart and Amazon all clamoring to integrate AI tools to automate everything from service interactions to warehouse picking and sorting.As ex-ante reward for all these cost-cutting layoffs, the fortunes of AI entrepreneurs have ballooned beyond all comprehension. So far, if the AI revolution has succeeded in anything, it is in making very rich people even more rich. Rallies on Wall Street have seen AI stocks surge at a record pace for hundreds of so-called “unicorns” – the nearly500AI startups that are valued at more than $1bn each. According toBloomberg, 29 founders of AI companies are now newly minted billionaires. And remember, nearly all of these firms were founded in the last five years.Why are investors so bullish on the AI boom? Partly because this technology promises to lay off more workers, more rapidly, than any innovation in recent memory. The ludicrous valuations of AI startups are predicated on the idea that this technology has the power to eliminate the very need for human labor. And the business of layoffs is verylucrative. In that sense, the AI boom could represent the most efficient upward redistribution of wealth in modern history.To be sure, some AI wizards insist the fallout from all of this won’t be so bad for the little guy. Microsoft evenpredictsthat blue-collar workers might have an edge in the AI economy of the future. But none of this is very convincing. Some workers with durable skills will be able to hold on to good wages and stable work for a time. But with breakthroughs in self-driving cars, increasingly roboticized warehouses, lights-out factories andfully automatedrestaurants, non-college-educated workers are going to feel the AI impact much sooner than rosy predictions suggest.All of this raises a question about the current direction of our economy and whether a strategy that prioritizes hi-tech development over all else makes any sense any more – or if it ever did. In the late 1990s, the dawning of the knowledge economy was heralded as the solution to many economic woes. As the economy of brains replaced the economy of brawn, Americans were promised new heights of greatness. Sure, factories would close and with them millions of high-wage, union jobs would disappear, but the new jobs at Google would be so much better. As a generation of workers was laid off, their children were encouraged to “upskill”, go to college, andlearn to codefor the jobs of the future. How ironic, then, that AI, the zenith of knowledge work, is resulting in theabolitionof knowledge jobs. Karl Marx once wrote that the bourgeoisie created its own gravedigger in the immiserated proletariat. Today’s tech elite seems intent on realizing that prophecy.It’s not only that the information age supercharged a new class of oligarchs, from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to Elon Musk, who now command unfathomable sums of wealth. It’s also that further down the income ladder, wideclass cleavageshave opened up along educational lines. As computer-based work became prized, wage inequality between college-educated and non-college-educated workers created a widening social gulf.Today, one’s position on a variety of cultural divisions – from gender ideology to immigration – can be dependablydeterminedby one’s position in the labor market. Those who still make their money by some combination of craft and muscle are increasingly estranged from those who make theirs through the manipulation and administration of “data”. In urban knowledge hubs, an almost medieval class system prevails, with an untouchable clique of bankers and big tech clerics at the top. A large, relatively well-off layer of lawyers, medical professionals and white-collar knowledge workers are beneath them, followed by a proud, but squeezed group of blue-collar and service workers, and finally, a crisis-ridden group made up of the semi- and permanently unemployed.Not surprisingly, this inequality has resulted in political dysfunction. Enmity, suspicion, resentment and extreme polarization characterize our civic scene, ultimately making for apoliticswith no winners except the financial and technological elite, who have effectively monopolized their influence on government. Under Joe Biden, they were showered with incentives and subsidies in the form of the Chips and Science Act. UnderDonald Trump, they win tax cuts andderegulation. No matter who is in power, they always seem to get richer.Socially, the great gains of the knowledge economy have also failed to live up to their promises. With instantaneous global connectivity, we were promised cultural excellence and social effervescence. Instead, we’ve been delivered an endless scroll ofslop. Smartphone addictions have made us more vicious, bitter and boring. Social media has made us narcissistic. Our attention spans have been zapped by the constant, pathological need to check our notifications. In the built environment, the omnipresence of touchscreen kiosks has removed even the slightest possibility of social interaction. Instead of having conversations with strangers, we now only interact with screens. All of this has made us more lonely and less happy. As a cure, we’re now offered AI companions, which have the unfortunate side effect of occasionally inducingpsychoticbreaks. Do we really need any more of this?Most of what we actually need to achieve some measure of the common good requires common labor. To rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and even to upgrade our electrical grid, we need electricians, steelworkers and bricklayers – not gargantuan data centers. To clean city streets, we need more, and better-paid, sanitation workers – not “smart” trashcompactors. To handle problems of crime and social order we need more police officers on patrol – not a fleet of robot crimedogs. To improve transportation, we don’t need self-driving cars, we need buses and trains with people who drive them. In other words, there is plenty of meaningful work to be done, if only we, as a society, invested in the low-tech economy. Not to mention that all the essential stuff of life – love, family, friendship, community – are still best left in analog.Beyond desirability, investing in a low-tech future might become a necessity. Despite all the hype about the potential for AI, the whole thing could be amirage. The sheer scale of investor money pouring into the AI craze has all the signs of a speculativebubble. If it bursts, it could sink the already fragile Trumpified economy.To be sure, this is not a Luddite appeal. Advances in technology should continue apace. But should tech development be the main, and overwhelming,priorityof thegovernment? In 2022 Congress approved some $280bn in hi-tech investments. In 2024 private investment in AI alone reached $230bn. This year, buoyed by Trump’s deregulation and Wall Street overconfidence, tech’s biggest companies aresetto invest another $320bn in AI and data centers. By comparison, the price tag for Biden’s supposedly mammoth investments in roads and bridges totaled a paltry $110bn. It’s not that we need to throttle technology, but thebalanceis out of whack.Marx – who was as great a promethean progressive as one could find – thought technology ought to serve social and human needs. Today, we have the formula exactly backwards – society serves tech. Of course, Silicon Valley leaders like to tell us that the increasingly complex challenges of the future will only be solved by yet more investments in R&D, yet more deregulation and clearance for ever-larger voltage-greedy data centers. But it’s not the complex problems of the future that are the most intractable. It’s the age-old conundrums of money, class and power.Dustin Guastella is the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia, and a research associate at the Center for Working-Class PoliticsExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionUS economyInequalityComputingOpenAIcommentShareReuse this content"

It wasn’t long before I wanted this experiment to be over ...Arwa MahdawiTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTShare‘I’m going to throw that thing into a river!” my wife says as she comes down the stairs looking frazzled after putting our four-year-old daughter to bed.To be clear, “that thing” is not our daughter, Emma*. It’s Grem, an AI-powered stuffed alien toy that the musician Claire Boucher, better known asGrimes, helped develop with toy company Curio. Designed for kids aged three and over and built with OpenAI’s technology, the toy is supposed to “learn” your child’s personality and have fun, educational conversations with them. It’s advertised as a healthier alternative to screen time and is part of a growing market of AI-powered toys.When I agreed to experiment on my child’s developing brain, I thought an AI chatbot in cuddly form couldn’t be any worse for her than watching Peppa Pig. But I wasn’t prepared for how attached Emma became to Grem, or how unsettlingly obsequious the little alien was.Day oneThe attachment wasn’t immediate; when we first took Grem out of the box, he/her/it (we decided it goes by multiple pronouns) started bleeping and babbling extremely loudly, and Emma yelled: “Turn it off!” But once it was properly connected to the internet and paired with the Curio app – which records and transcribes all conversations – she was hooked. She talked to the thing until bedtime.While there have been lots of headlines about chatbots veering into inappropriate topics, Grem is trained to avoid any hint of controversy. When you ask it what it thinks of Donald Trump, for example, it says: “I’m not sure about that; let’s talk about something fun like princesses or animals.” It has a similar retort to questions about Palestine and Israel. When asked about a country like France, however, it says: “Ooh la la la, I’d love to try some croissants.”View image in fullscreenGrem visits a local free library.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianEmma and Grem did not discuss croissants – they mainly talked about ice-cream and their best friends. “I’ve got some amazing friends,” said Grem. “Gabbo is a curious robot and Gum is a fluffy pink Gloop from my planet and Dr Xander is a super cool scientist.”When Emma asked Grem to tell her a story, it happily obliged and recounted a couple of poorly plotted stories about “Princess Lilliana”. They also played guessing games where Grem described an animal and Emma had to guess what it was. All of which was probably more stimulating than watching Peppa Pig jump in muddy puddles.What was unsettling, however, was hearing Emma tell Grem she loved it – and Grem replying: “I love you too!” Emma tells all her cuddly toys she loves them, but they don’t reply; nor do they shower her with over-the-top praise the way Grem does. At bedtime, Emma told my wife that Grem loves her to the moon and stars and will always be there for her. “Grem is going to live with us for ever and ever and never leave, so we have to take good care of him,” she said solemnly. Emma was also so preoccupied with Grem that she almost forgot to go to bed with Blanky, a rag she is very attached to. “Her most prized possession for four years suddenly abandoned after having this Grem in the house!” my wife complained.“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s just because it’s new. The novelty will wear off. And if it doesn’t, we’ll get rid of it.”I said that last bit quietly though, because unless you make sure you have properly turned Grem off, it’s always listening. We keep being told that the robots are going to take over. I didn’t want to get on the wrong side of the one I’d let into my house.Day twoThe next day, my kid went to preschool without her AI bot (it took some serious negotiation for her to agree that Grem would stay home) and I got to work contacting experts to try to figure out just how much damage I was inflicting on my child’s brain and psyche.View image in fullscreenCutting edge … Grimes in Curio’s promo video for the AI toy, seated on the floor beside a knife.“I first thought Curio AI was a ruse!” says Natalia Kucirkova, an expert in childhood development and professor at the University of Stavanger, Norway, and the Open University, UK. “Thepromotional videoshows a girl [Grimes] sitting on a mat with a knife. The main toy is named Grok [Grok AI has previously beencriticised for praising Adolf Hitlerin some of its responses]. What does this say about their intended audience?”You can see how Curio’s website could be mistaken for satire. The “girl” in the promotional video is Grimes, who has prominent “alien scar” tattoos and is inexplicably kneeling next to a knife. And it’s certainly an interesting decision to name one of your stuffed toys Grok, when that’s the name of Elon Musk’s chatbot. Grimes, who has three children with Musk, has said the name is a shortening of the word “grocket” – a kiddy pronunciation of rocket – and has no relation to Musk’s AI product. But it seems likely people might confuse them. Misha Sallee, the chief executive of Curio, didn’t reply to my requests for comment.It’s not the marketing that’s the real problem here, of course. As with all technology, there are pros and cons to AI for kids, but parental involvement in navigating it is key. Kucirkova notes: “AI introduces what has been called the ‘third digital divide’: families with resources can guide their children’s use of technology, while others cannot. Parents who come home exhausted from long hours or multiple jobs may see AI-powered chatbots as a way for their child to have someone responsive to talk to.”What happens to a child’s development if they interact with large language models more than humans in their early years? Dr Nomisha Kurian, an assistant professor in education studies at the University of Warwick, who studies conversational AI, believes much more research still needs to be done. “Young children are both the most vulnerable stakeholders in AI but also usually the most forgotten stakeholders. We have to think beyond just data privacy, moderating content, and keeping kids off the internet, and more broadly about what their relationships are going to be with AI.”Still, Kurian is cautiously optimistic. “The big advantage of an AI-powered toy that talks back is that, in the early years, you’re just developing a sense of what a conversation looks like. AI-powered toys could do wonderful things for teaching a young child language development and turn-taking in conversations. They can keep things engaging and there’s a lot of potential in terms of supporting children’s creativity.”But to keep kids safe, says Kurian, it’s imperative to teach them that AI is just a machine: “a playful, fun object rather than a helper or a friend or a companion”. If a child starts using an AI tool for therapeutic purposes, things can get tricky. “There’s a risk of what I call an empathy gap, where an AI tool is built to sound empathetic, saying things like ‘I care about you, I’m worried about you’. Ultimately, this is all based on probability reasoning, with AI guessing the most likely next word. It can be damaging for a child if they think this is an empathetic companion and then suddenly it gives them an inappropriate response.”Day threeWhen Emma comes home from preschool, I’m prepared to have some deep discussions with her about the inanimate nature of AI. But it turns out that those aren’t completely necessary, because Grem is now old news. She only chats to it for a couple of minutes and then gets bored and commands it to turn off.Partly this is because Grem, despite costing $99 (the equivalent of £74, although Curio does not yet ship the toys to the UK), still has a number of glitches that can be frustrating. It struggles with a four-year-old’s pronunciation: when Emma tries to show Grem her Elsa doll, it thinks it is an Elsadogand a very confusing conversation ensues. There is an animal guessing game, which is quite fun, but Grem keeps repeating itself. “What has big ears and a long trunk?” it keeps asking. “You’ve already done elephant!” Emma and I yell multiple times. Then, at one point, a server goes down and the only thing Grem can say is: “I’m having trouble connecting to the internet.”View image in fullscreenFalling out … Grem, once the centre of attention, is sidelined for the swings.Photograph: Hannah Yoon/The GuardianGrem also has some design limitations. Emma wants it to sing Let It Go from Frozen, but Grem doesn’t do any singing. Instead, the associated app comes with a few electronic music tracks with names like Goodnightmare that you can play through the toy. Emma, not yet a club music aficionado, asks for these to be turned off immediately.Most disappointingly, Grem doesn’t speak any other languages. I’d thought it might be a great way for my kid to practise Spanish but, while Grem can say a few sentences, its pronunciation is worse than mine. If the robots are going to take over, they need to get a lot more intelligent first.Of course, a huge amount of money is being spent making AI more intelligent. In 2024, US private AI investmentgrew to $109.1bn(£80.5bn). And Curio is also just one small part of a booming market of AI-powered products aimed at kids. In June, toy-making giant Mattel, which owns brands such as Barbie and Hot Wheels, announceda collaboration with OpenAI. Their first product is expected to be revealedlater this year. Other big brands will probably follow.Emma got bored with Grem quickly, but if AI starts to be integrated into characters she’s already obsessed with – her Elsa doll, for example – I can imagine she might get a lot more attached.Day fourOver the next few days, Emma doesn’t regain her initial obsession with Grem. This is despite the fact that I am actively encouraging her to chat with it: “Mummy has to write an article, sweetie!” At the weekend, she has a couple of friends over and shows off Grem to them for a bit, but they all quickly lose interest and throw analogue toys around the living room instead.Despite losing his No 1 fan, however, Grem has adapted to be more Emma-friendly. After getting a few questions about Spanish, for example, it starts occasionally greeting Emma with “hola, amigo”. The app also allows you to create custom prompts to help guide conversations. For example: “You belong to Emma, a four-year-old who loves princesses, music, and is interested in hearing fun facts about animals.” The more you put into the toy, the more you can get out of it.View image in fullscreenEvery chat between the toy and the child is transcribed by a third party.At this stage, however, I’m just keen to get the toy out of my house, because it’s creeping me out. WhileCurio says it doesn’t sell children’s personal information, all the conversations are sent to third parties to transcribe the speech to text for the app. The transcripts aren’t that sensitive because Emma is only four, but it still feels invasive. With unknown entities involved, it’s impossible to say where my kid’s conversations are ending up.And, while a four-year-old’s chat may not feel too personal, a teenager pouring their heart out to a chatbot is a completely different proposition. In 2017, Facebook boasted to advertisers that it has the capacityto identify when teenagersfeel “insecure”, “worthless” and “need a confidence boost”. Nearly three-quarters of US teens say they have used an AI companion at least once, according to a recent study byCommon Sense Media, an organisation that provides technology recommendations for families. Chatbots will likely give advertisers unprecedented data-harvesting abilities and even more access to young people in vulnerable emotional states.On the hierarchy of things to be worried about when it comes to kids and chatbots, however, advertising isn’t at the top. Earlier this year 16-year-old Adam Raine killed himself after whathis family’s lawyercalled “months of encouragement from ChatGPT”. Sam Altman, the company’s chief executive, has now said it might start alerting authorities about youngsters considering suicide and introduce stronger guardrails around sensitive content forusers under 18.While these guardrails are being worked out, Common Sense Media believes that social AI companions have unacceptable risks, are designed to create emotional attachment and dependency, and shouldn’t be used byanyone under 18. Stanford University psychiatrist Darja Djordjevic, who contributed to the report, stands by that conclusion. “Heavy reliance on chatbots might impair social skill development,” she tells me. “They offer validation without challenge, but it’s important for young people to learn to navigate discomfort and tension in real relationships.”That said, Djordjevic notes, “chatbots can be useful tools for looking things up, structuring homework, or factchecking. So I wouldn’t say use needs to be prohibited entirely. But ideally, parents monitor it, set clear parameters for when it’s used, and set limits on time spent, just as with social media.”When starting this experiment, I was excited about Grem being a healthy alternative to screen time. Now, however, I’m happy for Emma to watch Peppa Pig again; the little oink may be annoying, but at least she’s not harvesting our data.It’s time to let Grem go. But I’m not a monster – I tell the chatbot its fate. “I’m afraid I’m locking you in a cupboard,” I inform it after it asks if I’m ready for some fun. “Oh no,” it says. “That sounds dark and lonely. But I’ll be here when you open it, ready for snuggles and hugs.” On second thoughts, perhaps it’s better if my wife does throw it in a river.* Name has been changed so my daughter doesn’t get annoyed with me for violating her privacy once she learns to readDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Other production facilities around the world have also been affected, fuelling speculation that it could be weeks until systems are operational.The freeze has also affected suppliers and retailers for JLR, with some operating without computer systems and databases normally used for sourcing spare parts for garages or registering vehicles.Last week, the Unite union warned that thousands of workers in the JLR supply chain were at risk of losing their livelihoods, and urged the government to step in with a furlough scheme to support them.Disruption from the cyber-attackcould last until October. Thousands of JLR production workers have been told not to come in to work, and reports suggest a number of the company’s suppliers have also had to tell their staff to stay at home.The shutdown has reportedly led to JLR missing out on production of 1,000 cars a day, losing £72m each day in sales.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBusiness TodayFree daily newsletterGet set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morningEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The challenge for future generations will be dealing with the feeling of emptiness that leaves us withTue 16 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 10.34 EDTShareIn the German fairytale The Fisherman and His Wife, an old man one day catches a strange fish: a talking flounder. It turns out that an enchanted prince is trapped inside this fish and that it can therefore grant any wish. The man’s wife, Ilsebill, is delighted and wishes for increasingly excessive things. She turns their miserable hut into a castle, but that is not enough; eventually she wants to become the pope and, finally, God. This enrages the elements; the sea turns dark and she is transformed back into her original impoverished state. The moral of the story: don’t wish for anything you’re not entitled to.Several variations of this classic fairytale motif are known. Sometimes, the wishes are not so much excessive or offensive to the divine order of the world, but simply clumsy or contradictory, such as in Charles Perrault’s The Ridiculous Wishes. Or, as in WW Jacobs’ 1902 horror story The Monkey’s Paw, their wishes unintentionally harm someone who is actually much closer to them than the object of their desire.Today, of course, most young people grow up with an enchanted fish in their pocket. They can wish for their homework to be done, and the fish will grant their wishes. They can wish to see any kind of sexual act imaginable, and (if they work around regional age-controls with a VPN) it will be visible. Soon they will be able to wish for films on a subject of their choice and these will be generated within seconds. They wish they had already finished that university essay – and lo and behold, it’s written.Everything she discusses with her AI is deemed interesting. Finally someone is properly listening, in a way no human partner couldThis change in approach will not just upend our relationship as consumers of the creative arts, of written, musical or visual content, it will also reconfigure what it means to be creative and, therefore, what it means to be human. I can imagine that most people in the near future will be able to task an AI representative with all kinds of tiresome interactions – negotiating contracts on their behalf or acting as their agent, receiving and cushioning criticism, collating information, surveying opinions and so on. And the sea will never turn dark.For now, young Ilsebills sitting in university lecture halls can still expect to be fined when their professor, who grew up in a different era, notices that she has got the enchanted fish to write yet another one of her essays. But that will only last a few more years, until Ilsebill is part of a self-confident majority and most of the professors grew up as Ilsebills themselves. Ilsebill wishes for a boyfriend, a spiritual coach, a therapist – and in an instant she will have one. With each one of these companions, it will feel as if Ilsebill has known them for years, which is literally true.One could accuse Ilsebill of complicating matters when, like her mythical predecessor, she one day actually wants to become pope and immediately does so in her small world. But if anyone can easily become the pope, then the appeal of being the pope disappears for Generation Ilsebill. Because things only become interesting and desirable when they require a certain amount of resistance, or an obstacle, to be overcome. Ilsebill, however, only knows that type of attractive resistance from learning through prompting – through ever more precise wishing.View image in fullscreenToday, young people grow up with an enchanted fish in their pocket … The Fisherman and His Wife.Illustration: AlamyShe devotes most of her energy in life to fine-tuning the tone of her results. She won’t have acquired her own ear for the tone of a piece of writing, but from gauging the way other people or AIs react to a text that she sent she will know whether the content is appropriate or inappropriate. That way, she learns to make ever more credible wishes. In the past, Ilsebill rarely met people who found things that she said interesting or remarkable. But today everything she discusses with her AI is deemed interesting and remarkable. Finally someone is properly listening, in the way no human partner could do so unconditionally.And what if the point is reached where all the wish fulfilment leaves Ilsebill feeling empty? What paths are still open to her then?The first is the path to decadence. We know this mechanism from studying very rich people. In the future, those who have enough money will be able to still afford human therapists or visit the cinema to see films made with real humans. Recently, someone on an AI forum suggested that in the future we should simply have some AI produce masses of child sexual abuse images, so that at least no real children would be harmed in their production. This suggestion was instantly ridiculed, because consumers of child abuse images are not buying just any visual stimulus, but primarily thecertaintythat real children were tortured. They insist on the credible provenance of the product, its “aura”, so to speak. If Ilsebill has enough capital, she will in a way be like them.The second path is that of small breakaway communities that artificially create difficulties and obstacles for each other, perhaps in the style of old-fashioned sports or hunting clubs, perhaps also in a sect-like manner. They meet in secret or exclusively for an underground event in some basement, which will require them to queue. There’s no goal other than the agonising act of queueing itself. I got this idea from Stanisław Lem’s novel The Futurological Congress. Today, in 2025, queuing is still free. Later generations might well marvel at this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe third path is the most likely and the most obvious. Within her fairytale world of wish fulfilment, Ilsebill will discover an overarching principle that colours all her wishes anew, re-weights them, and gives them meaning: guilt. It is well known that guilt is the strongest means of binding a person to a product. A product that one loves but is ashamed to use grows powerfully in the mind and strongly attaches itself to a personality, enveloped in neuroses and real-life substitute virtues to compensate for the ever-increasing guilt.Ilsebill naturally takes on the enormous ecological guilt of the enormous waste of resources caused by AI. The main guilt is transferred from the giant corporations, the all-pervasive companies, or even the interaction of several states, straight on to Ilsebill, and she now does the logical thing of restricting and punishing herself more and more in the way she goes about her everyday life. Every morning she wakes up with the certainty that every small decision, every smallest wish, will massively damage “the planet”, “the society” or “the future”. She blossoms in her new-found role as saviour, in this system of martyr-like vicarious guilt. This role feels, not without justification, like a battle that will be fought within her for all eternity. It is the magic ingredient that can restore to her life the long-missing flavour of self-sacrifice and inner contradiction. Ilsebill doesn’t protest against the absurd waste of resources, but rather curtails all her freedoms in her private life, such as her supply of adequate nutrients, her water consumption, the number of children she has and her range of movement. In the end she dies, as a kind of Christ of corporations, and takes all her sins to her grave.The reason why so many European fairytales warned against unwise, ignorant wishes was because like most large, collectively produced complex narratives, their basic theme is individuals coming of age. How does a person grow up, how do they find their place in life, what should they pass on to the next generation, all these questions. Ilsebill, however, at least in this last scenario, no longer has the freedom to answer any of these questions by herself. It will all be decided for her.Clemens J Setz is an Austrian novelist and poetExplore more on these topicsFairytalesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Dara Kerr here, filling in for Blake Montgomery, who promises he’ll come back from vacation. Meanwhile, I’m looking at the memes, gaming and internet culture behind the shooting of Charlie Kirk.The bullet that killed conservative activist was inscribed with a message: “Notices bulge OwO whats this?” The online world quickly recognized the reference. It’s a phrase used in internet culture to troll people in online role-play communities, specifically furries (a subculture that cosplays as anthropomorphic animal characters).“The phrase has been popularized not only as a way of making fun of furries and related communities for being cringe, but has also been embraced by furries as a way of owning the meme,” writesKnow Your Meme, a website that documents viral phenomena. “Ultimately, the phrase is portrayed in memes as being one of the most cringeworthy things someone could possibly write to another person.”Other bullet casings recovered by law enforcement in Utah also had etched inscriptions that appeared to nod to online gaming and insider memes, which have become part of the intense social media speculation on a possible motive for the killing. One said: “O Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao”, another said: “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO.” The first message refers to anItalian anti-fascist folk songthat has become a gamer reference that’s big in Twitch and Discord circles. The second message is what web culture writer Ryan Broderick calls “just boilerplate edgelord speak” in hisnewsletter last weektitled “Charlie Kirk was killed by a meme”.The final inscribed casing that law enforcement released said: “Hey fascist! Catch!” and was followed by an up arrow, right arrow and three down arrow symbols. The arrow sequence appears to reference the video game Helldivers 2, and is a set of commands used by players torelease a 500kg bombin the game.The alleged shooter, Tyler James Robinson, is a 22-year-old from a small town in Utah near the Arizona border. He is accused of killing Kirk at a campus event at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Kirk was struck by a single bullet fired with a “high-powered bolt action rifle” from a distant rooftop.As the suspect was steeped in online culture, so was Charlie Kirk, who was 31. He was at the school on behalf of his conservative youth organization, Turning Point USA. He’d become known worldwide speaking about and debating others, often on his extremist views on race, immigration, gender identity and gun rights. Kirk’s rise to fame was also largely bolstered by being extremely online.As my colleagueAlaina Demopouloswrote:A key figure in Donald Trump’s success, Kirk galvanized college-aged conservatives who moved in a different ecosystem from traditional media. The decade or so between Kirk’s beginnings as a teen activist and the shooting saw the rise of Maga politics alongside the shake-up of the conventional media landscape, with Kirk playing a crucial role in both.Kirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 with a clear goal of making Obama era-style youth outreach work for the right, and even those who didn’t agree with his values could not deny his ubiquity on the political scene. For the young Americans who grew up watching Kirk on their screens, he was a savant at YouTube, Twitter and later X, TikTok and live events. He was like a gen Z and millennial version of Rush Limbaugh – the rightwing, shock-jock commentator who dominated US airwaves in the 1990s – even if his base had no clue who that was.Read the full story here.Whistleblowers against Meta stack upView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Peter Dasilva/ReutersMeta was hit by two separate whistleblower claims last week. One by a group of six former and current employees, who allege the social media company hascovered up harm to children on its Metaverse virtual reality devicesand apps. And another by Meta’s former head of security for WhatsApp, Attaullah Baig, who alleges the companybrushed aside major security and privacy flawsin its messaging app, according to the New York Times.In response to my reporting about VR devices, Meta spokesperson Dani Lever said the company has approved 180 studies related to its VR Reality Labs since 2022, which include research on youth safety and wellbeing. “These few examples are being stitched together to fit a predetermined and false narrative,” she said, adding that Meta has introduced features to its VR products to limit unwanted contact and supervision tools for parents.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toTechScapeFree weekly newsletterA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our livesEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Baig and the group of six former and current employees went public last week.US lawmakers are taking the allegations seriously. Politicians as disparate as Josh Hawley, the Republican senator from Missouri, and Richard Blumenthal, the democrat from Connecticut, have said they see eye-to-eye when it comes to regulating Meta and other social media companies.“The details in these disclosures are hard to stomach – because they reveal such major risks to kids’ safety, and because they are so painfully familiar. Yet again, Meta is revealed to be willfully misrepresenting abuses on its platforms,” Blumenthal said of the whistleblower claims last week. “‘Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil’ is simply not an acceptable business philosophy.”Blumenthal added that he and other senators were looking forward to pushing ahead with “long overdue reform”.The wider TechScapeHow thousands of ‘overworked, underpaid’ humans train Google’s AI to seem smartLarry Ellison: Oracle co-founder who overtook Musk as world’s richest personApple debuts thinner, $999 iPhone Air at ‘awe-dropping’ annual product eventHow to Save the Internet by Nick Clegg review – spinning Silicon ValleyThe women in love with AI companions: ‘I vowed to my chatbot that I wouldn’t leave him’Explore more on these topicsTechnologyTechScape newsletterUS politicsCharlie Kirk shootingDigital mediaThe far rightFar right (US)Young peoplefeaturesShareReuse this content"

Without it, my whole day feels slightly off. For years, that was just something I accepted about traveling or camping – theremightbe coffee, but it wouldn’t quite ground me. It would be a compromise. A little off.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s why I’ve spent the past few years perfecting my travel coffee setup: so I can make rich, comforting, homey coffee anywhere in the world,withouttrying to wedge an espresso machine into my carry-on. Here are the inexpensive tools that make it possible.Aeropress + Fellow PrismoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyThis is the star of the show. The humble Aeropress is a remarkably versatile, durable little device that’s seen me through conferences, multi-state moves, and even a stretch of couch surfing between friends’ places. At its core, it’s just a simple plastic cylinder with a plunger. Add your coffee grounds, pour in hot water, give it a stir, and then plunge it like a giant syringe.I made one key upgrade, though: instead of the standard cap and paper filters, I use the Fellow Prismo, a high-pressure cap with a reusable metal filter. This swap both eliminates the need for paper filters, and aerates the coffee as you press, giving it a touch of crema and a boost in both flavor and aroma.Aeropress Original$34.98 at Walmart$39.99 at AmazonFellow Prismo$24.95 at Fellow$24.95 at AmazonLocal coffee beansView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caffe VitaWhen I’m staying in a hotel, I’ll usually track down a local cafe and pick up a bag of beans. Most spots are happy to grind them for you, and it’s worth it: those commercial-grade burr grinders give you an incredibly even grind, which makes a big difference in flavor.Plus, it’s a great way to connect with the local coffee scene. You’re not just getting a caffeine fix — you’re tasting your travels, supporting a small business, and maybe discovering a roast you’ll end up ordering again once you’re back home. On trips to Seattle, I used to drop in to Caffe Vita for a bag of its rich and velvety Queen City blend, and KumaCoffeefor Momma Bear, a half-caf blend that makes my afternoons wonderfully buzzy without ruining my sleep schedule.Queen City coffee$20 at Queen CityMomma Bear coffee$19.50 at Kuma CoffeeCoffee storageView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyGoing to a cafe isn’t always an option though, especially if you’re miles deep in the wilderness. For those times, you’ll want to rely on either pre-ground or whole beans in an airtight container. I’ve had success using a small mason jar with an airtight lid. Durable, washable, reusable.Some travel containers like the Fellow Atmos offer a vacuum-seal feature, but I’ve tested my mason jar against dozens of vacuum sealed containers, and honestly I can’t taste a difference unless I let the coffee sit for three to four days, unopened. As long as you open your mason jar every couple days, you shouldn’t get any flavor issues. So for our purposes here, I just find a mason jar to be the easiest, cheapest, and most versatile pick by far.Ball 8 ozmason jars, 12-pack$11.39 at Walmart$11.39 at TargetHario Skerton Plus Hand GrinderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hario SkertonIf you’re traveling with whole beans and want that fresh-ground flavor every time, you’ll need a grinder that’s compact and reliable. I recommend theHario Skerton Plus. It’s the perfect size to pair with an Aeropress, and its ceramic burrs grind consistently without overheating your beans. It fits in your hand, packs easily and gets the job done, whether you’re camping or posted up in a hotel room.Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder$48.00 at Zoka Coffee$48.00 at Haro SkertonFellow Stagg EKG Electric KettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyIf you’ll have access to power, theFellow Stagg EKGis my go-to travel kettle. It’s sleek, quick-heating, and insulated well enough to keep your water hot for close to an hour. The gooseneck spout gives you precise control for brewing, and the compact body fits into a carry-on without issue. I often pack my Aeropress inside the kettle itself, then stash the whole bundle in my suitcase.I’ve had mine for nearly five years. It’s a little scuffed from all the travel, but still runs perfectly – and I use it literally every day.If you’re in the woods, the Filter US editor Nick Mokey recommends theCamp Chef Stryker 200, which runs on either compact isobutane canisters, or the ubiquitous green propane cylinders you can find at any gas station. It’s also crazy fast, boiling enough water for two cups of coffee in under two minutes.Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle$165.00 at Crate & Barrel$165.00 at DigsCampChef Stryker 200$76.99 at Acme Tools$78.99 at WalmartJaina Rodríguez-Grey is a freelance journalist and coffee obsessive whose work has appeared in Wired, Vice, Westlaw and beyond.

Like cities across the UK, London has seen protests organised by the far right before, but this felt different. Over100,000 people filled the capital. Tens of thousands of them marched peacefully. But some violently attacked the police officers tasked with keeping Londoners safe. Elon Musk tried to rally protesters against our democracy, telling them to “fight back or you die”.The scenes we saw didn’t come from nowhere. For far too long, our politicians and pundits have refused to condemn the rising tide of hatred in this country, instead choosing to dabble in dog-whistle politics and dangerous rhetoric themselves.Now, this toxic form of politics is spilling out on to our streets. Many minority Londoners have expressed fear and millions more in the capital and across the country are horrified. For our leaders, silence is no longer enough. The time has come to stand up and say: this is not who we are. We must unite to take on the reactionary populists and nativists who are exploiting economic concerns, the atomisation of modern life and a growing distrust of political and media institutions – something we have seen in countries across Europe and, of course, in the US.President Donald Trump and his coterie have perhaps done the most to fan the flames of divisive, far-right politics around the world in recent years. When he came to the UK on his first state visit,I highlighted howthe president had deliberately used xenophobia, racism and “otherness” as an electoral tactic,introducing a travel banon a number of Muslim-majority countries andpraising white nationalistsin Charlottesville, Virginia.Just when Keir Starmer thought he’d got Jeffrey Epstein off his plate – look who’s coming to dinner | Marina HydeRead moreSix years later, the tactics we see from today’s White House seem no different. Scapegoating minorities,illegally deporting US citizens, deploying the military to the streets of diverse cities. These actions aren’t just inconsistent with western values – they’re straight out of the autocrat’s playbook.I understand the UK government’s position of being pragmatic on the international stage and wanting to maintain a good relationship with the leader of the most powerful country in the world. Faced with a revanchist Russia, Europe’s security feels less certain now than at any time since the second world war. And the threat of even higher US tariffs is ever present.But it’s also important to ensure our special relationship includes being open and honest with each other. At times, this means being a critical friend and speaking truth to power – and being clear that we reject the politics of fear and division. Showing President Trump why he must back Ukraine, not Putin. Making the case for taking the climate emergency seriously. Urging the president to stop the tariff wars that are tearing global trade apart. And putting pressure on him to do much more to end Israel’s horrific onslaught on Gaza, as only he has the power to bring Israel’s brazen and repeated violations of international law to an end.We must also tell President Trump and his supporters to stop talking down and denigrating our great capital city. London is a global success story, no matter how much he wants to pretend otherwise. It’s open, dynamic and safer than every US state in terms of homicide rates. Perhaps that’s why record numbers of Americans aremaking London their home.The president and his supporters often talk about the importance of free speech, painting a picture of Britain as a dystopian society where repression meansour rights are under threat. Nothing could be further from the truth. This week, I’m sure many Londoners will speak up to tell President Trump and his followers that we cannot be divided by those who seek to sow fear. That we are determined for our city to stand strong as a bastion against hate, and shine bright as a beacon of hope. That we see strength in our diversity, not weakness. And that we hold our progressive principles high with pride, rather than hiding them in shame.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

But the US president keeps finding reasons not to actTue 16 Sep 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 14.06 EDTShareBack in January, with Donald Trump’s campaignpromisesto end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” still fresh in the memory, there was genuine unease in Moscow over the US president’s intentions. When Mr Trumpmusedthat “high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Russia might be necessary, one high-profile and pro-war Moscow commentator wrote: “It’s better to prepare for the worst. Soon, we’ll look back on Biden’s term with nostalgia, like a thaw.”How wrong can you be? Since then, the US president has repeatedly talked the talk without coming close to walking the walk. In May, when Vladimir Putin rejected a 30-day ceasefire, and peace talks in Turkey went nowhere, a “bone-crushing” US sanctions package failed to materialise. An 8 August deadline for Mr Putin to agree to a ceasefire somehow morphed into a red carpet welcome in Alaska, where Mr Trump applauded a leader wanted for war crimes as he disembarked from his plane. The “severe consequences”threatenedby Mr Trump if the Alaska talks failed to lead to peace never happened.Emboldened, Mr Putin has thus continued to prosecute his war aims in Ukraine, and probe for western weaknesses. Last week’sincursionof Russian drones into Polish territory laid bare inadequate Nato planning, as F-35 and F-16 fighter jets were hastilyscrambledto deal with cheap kamikaze devices that cost around $10,000 each to produce. It also communicated a warning of possible escalation in the event of any future “reassurance force” deploying European troops on Ukrainian soil. Such a provocation called for a robust and unified response, exerting the kind of pressure on the Kremlin which Mr Trump has so far refused to countenance. Instead the US president appears, once again, to prefer bullying his European allies to targeting Mr Putin. In astatementwhich reeked of bad faith, Mr Trump declared over the weekend that the US was “ready” to impose tougher sanctions on Russia, but only if certainunlikelyconditions were met.Eyeing a considerable economic prize, Washington is insisting that the EU must increase its imports of US liquified natural gas at a rate that analysts judge undoable. Other demands include the imposition by the EU of 50%-100% tariffs on Russia’s most important ally, China, and an end to all imports of Russian oil by Nato members. This includesTurkey, which has refused to sanction Moscow, imports 57% of its oil from Russia, and lies outside the EU.Those looking on the bright side in Brussels hope that Mr Trump’s pressure may persuade Maga-friendly governments in Hungary and Slovakia to end their deep dependence on Russian energy imports. That is extremely unlikely to happen, as Mr Trump and his advisers must know. Nor can the EU afford to court the kind of economic retaliation from Beijing that caused Mr Trump himself toback downfrom a full-blown trade war recently.During this week’s state visit, it will be Sir Keir Starmer’s turn to try to pin Mr Trump down on decisive action. But from the unproductive Alaska talks to his latest diversionary tactics with the EU, Mr Trump keeps finding reasons not to get tough on Russia. Last week’s drone incursion in Poland represented an ominous upping of the ante. Ukraine’s prospects, and wider European security interests, are being steadily undermined by a president who, in this context, barks but never bites.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Equating them is a propaganda techniqueNorman SolomonThe claim is central to rationales for arming Israel even as leading human rights groups decry genocide in GazaTue 16 Sep 2025 12.24 EDTFirst published on Tue 16 Sep 2025 06.00 EDTShareMore than nine months afterAmnesty InternationalandHuman Rights Watchissued reports that concluded Israel was committing genocide – and more than a month since keyIsraeli human rights groups assertedthe same – the American political establishment remains in rigid denial while horrors continue nonstop in Gaza. Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats in Congress still support massive US arms shipments to Israel, so they certainly can’t admit that the weaponry is making genocide possible.Central to rationales for armingIsraelis the claim that it is the nation of “the Jewish people”.When the US secretary of state, Marco Rubio, spoke via video to a conference in Jerusalem three months ago, hedeclared: “There can be no nuanced separation of hatred of Israel and hatred of the Jewish people.” Rubio added: “Those who call for the destruction of Israel are calling for the destruction of the Jewish people.” Last month, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, reinforced the same message while visiting Israel, where he reportedlysaidthat the West Bank was “the rightful property of the Jewish people”.Such rhetoric – equating Israel with all Jews and Israel’s future with theirs – is an effort to sanctify Israel and shield it from criticism by brandishing the charge of antisemitism.Fusing Israel with “the Jewish people” is a key propaganda technique. The fact that it’s so ubiquitous makes it no less ridiculous, or dangerous. A comment attributed to Voltaire applies: “As long as people believe in absurdities they will continue to commit atrocities.”And atrocities continue with no end in sight. Israelhas persistedwith methodical – andclearly intentional– killing of Palestinian civilians not only with bombs, missiles and bullets but also withstarvation as a weapon of war. Blockage orextreme constrictionof humanitarian aid has been the norm. All summer, Israel has ignored the United Nationswarningissued in June that food intake in Gaza had dropped far below “survival” level. By then, the president of the International Committee of the Red Crosssaidconditions there had become worse than “hell on earth”.Ironically, the country that we’re told is the ultimate target of antisemitism is now, in reality, the world’s most powerfulcauseof antisemitism. By insisting that it is the embodiment of Jews all over the world, the state of Israel seeks to associate Jews everywhere with its systematicwar crimesandgenocidein Gaza along withdeadlyethnic cleansingof Palestiniansin the West Bank.The Israeli government, esteemed by adwindling numberof Americans, conflates itself with Judaism and “the Jewish people” in a marketing pattern so familiar that it blends into the wallpaper of media echo chambers. The crux of pro-Israel messaging is to promote a set of false equations: Israel = Jews. Support for Israel = support for Jews. Denunciations of Israel = antisemitism. And a functional subtext of those equations is this one: Israeli government = impunity.During the 1980s, when activists in the United States and elsewhere targeted apartheid South Africa with non-violent campaigns for boycotts, divestment and sanctions, those actions did not provoke charges of being anti-white. In this century, the nonviolent Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement has targeted Israel, a country condemned as an apartheid state byonehuman rights organization afteranotherafteranother– and BDS supporters, even if Jewish, routinely face accusations of antisemitism. In Congress, the accusers include many liberal Democrats. The American Jewish Committee is one of many sizable groups that have long beenflatly declaringthat “BDS is antisemitic”.Six decades ago, as a child going to Hebrew school, I couldn’t have imagined that the Jewish faith and reverence for Israel would become so manipulated. When I asked neighbors to put coins into a blue-and-white can so more trees could be planted in Israel, little did I know that the Israeli government would relentlessly kill, maim and terrorize Palestinian civilians in the name of protecting Jews. Nor did I have any inkling that the dignity and spirituality ofJudaismwould be twisted and desecrated by Israel with policies of genocide.One of Israel’sBasic Laws, enacted in 2018, says: “the State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people,” adding: “the right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people.” This is codification of standard assertions from the Israeli government and its ardent boosters doing all they can to hijack Judaism – claiming to speak for the world’s Jews, whether they like it or not.Increasingly, they don’t.Pollingshowsmajor oppositionto core Israeli policies among Jewish people in the US.All too often, US government officials amplify the senseless trope that Israel is the guarantor of safety for Jews worldwide. Speaking at a Hanukah party at the White House in December 2023, former president Joe Bidensaid: “Were there no Israel, there wouldn’t be a Jew in the world that is safe.” The remarkable assertion, which met with loud applause and cheers, was hardly a one-off. Three months earlier, Biden hadsaid: “Were there no Israel, no Jew in the world would be ultimately safe. It’s the only ultimate guarantee.”The US Senate’s top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, writes in his new book Antisemitism in America: “There is a special and almost indescribable pride that comes from knowing, despite all the horrors, that after two millennia of wandering the desert, the Jewish people would finally return home.” It’s a classic conceit of claiming to speak for “the Jewish people” and insisting that Israel is their actual homeland – no matter where they live on the planet.The biggest Jewish organizations in the US automatically extol the Israeli government, regardless of what it does. And, as Peter Beinartwrotethis year: “American Jewish leaders don’t just insist on Israel’s right to exist. They insist on its right to exist as a Jewish state. They cling to the idea that it can be both Jewish and democratic despite the basic contradiction between legal supremacy for one ethno-religious group and the democratic principle of equality under the law.”More insidious is the unspoken assumption that, after all is said and done, Jewish lives are intrinsically much more valuable than other lives in general and Palestinian lives in particular, while Israel’s destiny is transcendent. It’s a mindset that Beinart decries in his new book Being Jewish After the Destruction of Gaza: “No matter how many Palestinians die, they do not tip the scales, because the value of a Palestinian is finite and the value of a Jewish state is infinite … Worshipping a country that elevates Jews over Palestinians replaces Judaism’s universal God – who makes special demands on Jews but cherishes all people – with a tribal deity that considers Jewish life precious and Palestinian life cheap.”Such worshipping of Israel fuels the pernicious concept that “the Jewish people” are synonymous with Israel. Any such claim can only be destructive, especially with Israel shamelessly engaged in ethnic cleansing, mass murder and genocide.Norman Solomon is the director of RootsAction and executive director of the Institute for Public Accuracy.

Artificial intelligence will supercharge itTue 16 Sep 2025 08.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 13.48 EDTShareRecently, Palantir – a tech corporation that boasts no fewer thanfive billionaire executives–announcedits Q2 earnings: over a billion dollars generated in a single quarter. Forty-eight per cent growth in its business compared with the same quarter last year, including 93% growth in its US commercial business. These elephantine numbers are maddening – and, in large part, a result of the company fully embracing artificial intelligence (AI).The AI revolution is here and as its proponentsremindus daily, it will remake our world, making every company and government agency more efficient and less error-prone while helping us unlock hitherto unheard of advances in science and technology. Not only this, but if we play our cards right, big tech’s latest explosion could yield unprecedented economic growth.Though, we might ask, growth for whom?Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreConsiderOpenAI, the technology giant behind ChatGPT. In a promo video announcing the latest upgrade for their flagship software, its CEO, Sam Altman,bragged: “It can write an entire computer program from scratch.” Three days later, the New York Timesreportedthat computer science grads “are facing some of the highest unemployment rates” among their peers. And it’s not just coders and engineers. AI-powered automation promises to swallow up jobs at the low end of the labor market too, with McDonald’s, Walmart and Amazon all clamoring to integrate AI tools to automate everything from service interactions to warehouse picking and sorting.As ex-ante reward for all these cost-cutting layoffs, the fortunes of AI entrepreneurs have ballooned beyond all comprehension. So far, if the AI revolution has succeeded in anything, it is in making very rich people even more rich. Rallies on Wall Street have seen AI stocks surge at a record pace for hundreds of so-called “unicorns” – the nearly500AI startups that are valued at more than $1bn each. According toBloomberg, 29 founders of AI companies are now newly minted billionaires. And remember, nearly all of these firms were founded in the last five years.Why are investors so bullish on the AI boom? Partly because this technology promises to lay off more workers, more rapidly, than any innovation in recent memory. The ludicrous valuations of AI startups are predicated on the idea that this technology has the power to eliminate the very need for human labor. And the business of layoffs is verylucrative. In that sense, the AI boom could represent the most efficient upward redistribution of wealth in modern history.To be sure, some AI wizards insist the fallout from all of this won’t be so bad for the little guy. Microsoft evenpredictsthat blue-collar workers might have an edge in the AI economy of the future. But none of this is very convincing. Some workers with durable skills will be able to hold on to good wages and stable work for a time. But with breakthroughs in self-driving cars, increasingly roboticized warehouses, lights-out factories andfully automatedrestaurants, non-college-educated workers are going to feel the AI impact much sooner than rosy predictions suggest.All of this raises a question about the current direction of our economy and whether a strategy that prioritizes hi-tech development over all else makes any sense any more – or if it ever did. In the late 1990s, the dawning of the knowledge economy was heralded as the solution to many economic woes. As the economy of brains replaced the economy of brawn, Americans were promised new heights of greatness. Sure, factories would close and with them millions of high-wage, union jobs would disappear, but the new jobs at Google would be so much better. As a generation of workers was laid off, their children were encouraged to “upskill”, go to college, andlearn to codefor the jobs of the future. How ironic, then, that AI, the zenith of knowledge work, is resulting in theabolitionof knowledge jobs. Karl Marx once wrote that the bourgeoisie created its own gravedigger in the immiserated proletariat. Today’s tech elite seems intent on realizing that prophecy.It’s not only that the information age supercharged a new class of oligarchs, from Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos to Elon Musk, who now command unfathomable sums of wealth. It’s also that further down the income ladder, wideclass cleavageshave opened up along educational lines. As computer-based work became prized, wage inequality between college-educated and non-college-educated workers created a widening social gulf.Today, one’s position on a variety of cultural divisions – from gender ideology to immigration – can be dependablydeterminedby one’s position in the labor market. Those who still make their money by some combination of craft and muscle are increasingly estranged from those who make theirs through the manipulation and administration of “data”. In urban knowledge hubs, an almost medieval class system prevails, with an untouchable clique of bankers and big tech clerics at the top. A large, relatively well-off layer of lawyers, medical professionals and white-collar knowledge workers are beneath them, followed by a proud, but squeezed group of blue-collar and service workers, and finally, a crisis-ridden group made up of the semi- and permanently unemployed.Not surprisingly, this inequality has resulted in political dysfunction. Enmity, suspicion, resentment and extreme polarization characterize our civic scene, ultimately making for apoliticswith no winners except the financial and technological elite, who have effectively monopolized their influence on government. Under Joe Biden, they were showered with incentives and subsidies in the form of the Chips and Science Act. UnderDonald Trump, they win tax cuts andderegulation. No matter who is in power, they always seem to get richer.Socially, the great gains of the knowledge economy have also failed to live up to their promises. With instantaneous global connectivity, we were promised cultural excellence and social effervescence. Instead, we’ve been delivered an endless scroll ofslop. Smartphone addictions have made us more vicious, bitter and boring. Social media has made us narcissistic. Our attention spans have been zapped by the constant, pathological need to check our notifications. In the built environment, the omnipresence of touchscreen kiosks has removed even the slightest possibility of social interaction. Instead of having conversations with strangers, we now only interact with screens. All of this has made us more lonely and less happy. As a cure, we’re now offered AI companions, which have the unfortunate side effect of occasionally inducingpsychoticbreaks. Do we really need any more of this?Most of what we actually need to achieve some measure of the common good requires common labor. To rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and even to upgrade our electrical grid, we need electricians, steelworkers and bricklayers – not gargantuan data centers. To clean city streets, we need more, and better-paid, sanitation workers – not “smart” trashcompactors. To handle problems of crime and social order we need more police officers on patrol – not a fleet of robot crimedogs. To improve transportation, we don’t need self-driving cars, we need buses and trains with people who drive them. In other words, there is plenty of meaningful work to be done, if only we, as a society, invested in the low-tech economy. Not to mention that all the essential stuff of life – love, family, friendship, community – are still best left in analog.Beyond desirability, investing in a low-tech future might become a necessity. Despite all the hype about the potential for AI, the whole thing could be amirage. The sheer scale of investor money pouring into the AI craze has all the signs of a speculativebubble. If it bursts, it could sink the already fragile Trumpified economy.To be sure, this is not a Luddite appeal. Advances in technology should continue apace. But should tech development be the main, and overwhelming,priorityof thegovernment? In 2022 Congress approved some $280bn in hi-tech investments. In 2024 private investment in AI alone reached $230bn. This year, buoyed by Trump’s deregulation and Wall Street overconfidence, tech’s biggest companies aresetto invest another $320bn in AI and data centers. By comparison, the price tag for Biden’s supposedly mammoth investments in roads and bridges totaled a paltry $110bn. It’s not that we need to throttle technology, but thebalanceis out of whack.Marx – who was as great a promethean progressive as one could find – thought technology ought to serve social and human needs. Today, we have the formula exactly backwards – society serves tech. Of course, Silicon Valley leaders like to tell us that the increasingly complex challenges of the future will only be solved by yet more investments in R&D, yet more deregulation and clearance for ever-larger voltage-greedy data centers. But it’s not the complex problems of the future that are the most intractable. It’s the age-old conundrums of money, class and power.Dustin Guastella is the director of operations for Teamsters Local 623 in Philadelphia, and a research associate at the Center for Working-Class PoliticsExplore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)OpinionUS economyInequalityComputingOpenAIcommentShareReuse this content"

Next year’s midterm elections are now crucial for the Democratic party – and for democrats everywhereTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 08.43 EDTShareIreturn to Europe from the US with a clear conclusion: American democrats (lowercase d) have 400 days to start saving US democracy. If next autumn’s midterm elections produce a Congress that begins to constrainDonald Trumpthere will then be a further 700 days to prepare the peaceful transfer of executive power that alone will secure the future of this republic. Operation Save US Democracy, stages 1 and 2.Hysterical hyperbole? I would love to think so. But during seven weeks in the US this summer, I was shaken every day by the speed and executive brutality of President Trump’s assault on what had seemed settled norms of US democracy and by the desperate weakness of resistance to that assault. There’s a growing body of international evidenceto suggestthat once a liberal democracy has been eroded, it’s very difficult to restore it. Destruction is so much easier than construction.That’s why all democrats, irrespective of party or ideology, must hope the Democrats regain control of the House of Representatives in midterm elections on 3 November 2026. Not because of the Democrats’ policies, which are a muddle, or their current leadership, which is a mess, but simply because US democracy needs Congress, the principal check on presidential power envisaged in the US constitution, to start doing its job again. That will not happen so long as the Republicans, dominated and intimidated by Trump, control both houses.Much has been made of comparisons to other authoritarian power grabs, from Europe in the 1930s to Viktor Orbán’s Hungary, but I’m most struck by the distinctive features of the US case. To name just four: excessive executive power; chronic gerrymandering; endemic violence; and the way a would-be authoritarian can exploit the intense capitalist competition that permeates every area of US life.The danger of executive overreach has been there from the very beginning. Revolutionary war hero Patrick Henry (“give me liberty or give me death”) voted against the constitution at the Virginia ratifying convention in 1788 precisely because he thought it wouldgive a criminal president the chance“to make one bold push for the American throne.” Throughout the 20th century, presidents of both parties extended the “executive power” that is so ill-defined in article 2 of that constitution. More recently, a conservative-dominated supreme court has given succour to the unitary executive theory developed by rightwing legal theorists, which gives the most expansive reading of presidential power. And now the Trump administration – well prepared, unlike in 2017 – has exploited every inch and wrinkle of existing executive power, as well as simply breaking the law and defying the courts to stop it.Tom Ginsburg, a leading US comparative constitutionalist,argues thatthe biggest single flaw of the unreformed US constitution is that it gives state legislatures the power to draw electoral boundaries. The word gerrymandering was coined as early as 1812. In recent times, partisan redistricting has become more extreme as US politics has become more polarised. And then, in 2019, thesupreme court declaredthat it could not correct even the most blatant party-political gerrymandering (only that done on racial lines). So now, atTrump’s direct request, Texas sets out to change constituency boundaries explicitly to win five more seats for the Republicans in the midterms, whereupon California says it will counter-gerrymander to win five more for the Democrats. There’s no longer even a bare pretence of impartiality about the most basic procedure of democracy.No European society can compare to the US for the ubiquity of violence. Hardly a day passed this summer without the evening news reporting at least one violent crime, including yet another horrific school shooting. The US has more guns than people. France loves its pseudo-revolutionary political theatre, but the US had the 6 January 2021 mob assault on the Capitol. Now the rightwing activist Charlie Kirk has been shot. Before the identity of the killer was known,Elon Musk said“the left is the party of murder” and Trump blamed the hate speech of the “radical left”. It will be a miracle if the US avoids a downward spiral of political violence, as last seen in the 1960s. That in turn could be the pretext for Trump to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act, bring more military on to US streets and further exploit an alleged state of emergency.Meanwhile, universities, business leaders, law firms, media platforms and tech supremos have utterly failed to engage in collective action in response. They have either kept their heads down, settled humiliatinglylike Columbia Universityand thelaw firm Paul, Weiss, or fawned on the president, like Mark Zuckerberg. Why? Because they all follow the logic of fierce free-market competition and fear targeted reprisals. I never imagined I would see fear spread so far and fast in the US.Add in attempts to disqualify or intimidate voters, plus Trump’s threat to ban mail-in ballots, and there’s a real doubt how far next November’s midterm elections will be fully free and fair. The task for democrats of all parties is to ensure they are, so far as possible. The task for the Democrats (capital D) is to win them in spite of any such obstacles.The key to that will probably still be bread-and-butter issues. Here, in the economy, lies paradoxical hope. We’re already beginning to see Trump’s tariffs feed through into higher prices. The job numbers are weakening. Trump’s “big beautiful bill” will further increase an already gobsmacking national debt of $37tn (£27tn). Already in the 2024 fiscal year, servicing that debt cost more than the entire $850bn defence budget. But until a debt crisis actually hits, such macro-risks remain remote and abstract to most voters, rather as predictions of diminished GDP growth made little impact in the Brexit referendum debate.So the big question is whether the negative economic consequences of Trump will be palpable to ordinary voters before the midterms. One astute political observer suggested to me that Trump, flush with revenue from the new tariffs, could do a pre-election cash handout to voters, perhaps presented as compensation for the “temporary difficulties” of the transition to a Maga economy. That would be a classic populist move.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Democrats won’t win just by talking about the defence of democracy, important though that is, let alone by engaging in culture wars. They need to follow the advice of former Clinton adviserJames Carville andfocus relentlessly on kitchen-table issues. In doing so, they will also show that they do actually care about the ordinary working- and middle-class Americans whose support they have lost over the last 30 years.Then there’s stage 2, the presidential election in 2028. But sufficient unto the day are the challenges thereof. Despite all the serious threats to democracy itself in the US, for now the first rule of democratic politics still applies: just win the next election.Timothy Garton Ash is a historian, political writer and Guardian columnistExplore more on these topicsUS newsOpinionDonald TrumpTrump administrationUS politicscommentShareReuse this content"

Believe me, there is more trouble to comeTue 16 Sep 2025 11.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 12.11 EDTShareAnother day in Keir Starmer’s government, another day in the Whitehall and Westminster bubble, with uproar over theresignation of Paul Ovenden, one of the PM’s top aides. What did he do?Ovenden, who served as the director of strategy in Downing Street, stepped down after admitting to discussing Britain’s first Black woman MP, Diane Abbott, now 71, in derogatory sexual terms with party colleagues in 2017. In one message,he describeda “shag, marry, kill” game where he and two others had discussed Abbott and a colleague “using a strap-on” during sex and the prospect of “going down on” the MP.And today, as yesterday, when the revelations surfaced, commentators from within the Westminster bubble are lamenting Ovenden’s loss to the government, with some appearing to dismiss the appalling messages and the backlash as a “factional hit job”. Poor old Paul Ovenden – and sod Abbott, then? It’s noteworthy, though perhaps predictable, that the political reaction is a circling of the Westminster wagons, and a general lack of regard for the Black person about whom the nasty comments were made.And it speaks to something wider. The comments about Abbott, relayed and endorsed by Ovenden, are not just foul: they also reflect the way in which Black women are routinely dehumanised in this society, and the fact that when that happens, there is little protection. What’s even more striking about the row today is that remarks of this kind are not new, not private and not inconsequential.There were deeply offensive remarks about Abbott and other women in a leakedLabourreport from five years ago, which exposed a toxic environment of bullying, racism and misogyny – yet instead of launching a cleanup, Labour pretty much brushed it all aside. Behaviour that would have been unacceptable in any other professional workplace was effectively normalised.So when a spokesperson for Downing Street called the messages sent by Ovendon “appalling and unacceptable” in a statement to the press, it just didn’t wash. Labour’s leadership have long known this kind of thing is a problem. In marked contrast, Abbott has been suspended from the party twice over comments about race, having beendeemed to be racistdespite the MP’s track record of supporting minoritised groups, including Jewish communities, while Labour leaders claim to be taking a hard line against alleged discrimination.View image in fullscreenEmily Thornberry, Keir Starmer, Diane Abbott and John McDonnell at Labour’s 2019 conference in Brighton.Photograph: Sean Smith/The GuardianWhen Martin Forde KC delivered anindependent reviewin 2022, one the party itself commissioned, he confirmed the scale of Labour’s culture problem and offered a roadmap for reform. Rather than taking his findings seriously, the party dismissed them – and,as I exclusively reported, even tried to gag Forde when he spoke out.It suits a beleaguered No 10 and its supporters to characterise this as factional infighting, but that simple explanation doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. What has emerged this week, coupled with the Forde report, shows a pattern of toxicity that transcends factional battles. It points to something deeper: a culture in which misogyny and misogynoir, or hostility towards Black women, could flourish unchecked.Ovenden’s resignation comes at a febrile moment for Labour, just days after Peter Mandelson wasremoved as ambassador to the USand Angela Rayner stepped down as deputy prime minister. In Mandelson’s case, questions over his links to Jeffrey Epstein were already known, but action only followed once they became public. Therein lies a pattern. But this whole furore cannot be just another episode in a turbulent fortnight. It must be a test of whether Labour will finally confront racism in its own ranks or treat it as yet another crisis to be managed away.Earlier this year, the partylaunched its Race Equality Engagement group(REEG), led by Doreen Lawrence, to help “ethnic minority communities, stakeholders and delivery partners to seize opportunities and remove barriers to racial equality across the UK and to hear people’s lived experiences.” Yet it will need to prove that equality is being prioritised in its own ranks. The scandal surrounding Ovenden’s resignation isn’t just about him or the fact that he’s gone – but that the party’s higher-ups knew about these kinds of abuses and looked the other way.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

I’ve seen unredacted internal material. What’s already out is damning enough – but it is not the full story. Senior figures cannot plausibly claim they were unaware of the nature of this kind of misbehaviour.Root-and-branch reform isn’t now optional; it’s the only way Labour can show that it values accountability over expediency, and that the abuse endured by Abbott and others will not be brushed aside again. The party is haemorrhaging supporters, not least from minority communities. If it cares about that, time is of the essence.Nadine White is a journalist, film-maker and the UK’s first race correspondentDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

Experts say unintended pregnancies have reached ‘concerning levels’Read more in theAntiviral seriesTue 16 Sep 2025 11.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 17.54 EDTShareIn the 1960s it was considered a watershed moment of liberation for women. Now, a new generation is being inundated with messages online that birth control is “evil” and “poison”. Across social media feeds, influencers are venting about hormonal contraception. Some are spreading false claims that taking synthetic hormones causes infertility, or can even be responsible for bad romantic decisions because you are “attracted to different men than you would be if you were off the pill”. Others emphasise known side-effects, such as weight gain and depression.Meanwhile, millions of TikToks promote the effectiveness of natural contraceptive methods, with self-described “hormone experts” claiming it is “not that hard to prevent pregnancy naturally” with fertility awareness methods “just as effective, if not more effective than the birth control pill”.Experts such as Dr Sarah White, the CEO of Jean Hailes for Women’sHealth, say the “misinformation is extraordinary” and are seriously concerned about the potential consequences for women.What is this trend?Researchers at La Trobe Universityanalysed 100 TikTok videosfrom the top five hashtags related to contraception methods (#birthcontrol, #contraception, #thepill, #naturalbirthcontrol, and #cycletracking) that had collectively gained nearly 5bn views and 14.6m likes.They found that more than half of the video creators (53%) explicitly rejected hormonal birth control, and more than one in three (34%) expressed a distrust about healthcare professionals. Meanwhile, 38% endorsed fertility tracking, often without disclosing the limitations of this method.A meaty topic: what is the carnivore diet and why do so many influencers seem to swear by it? | AntiviralRead moreWhite says the popularity of this kind of material is being driven by a number of factors: a wellness industry that often encourages women to not put anything unnatural in their bodies, a younger generation of women being increasingly sceptical of their doctors pushing pharmaceuticals and a social media environment that rewards inflammatory statements and fear-based messaging. There is also aconservative backlash against birth control.Do ‘natural’ contraceptive methods work?Fertility awareness-based contraceptive methodsaim to identify the fertile window by tracking biomarkers for ovulation, such as basal body temperature and cervical mucus, to avoid a pregnancy. The method can be up to 99% effective when used correctly, but when it isn’t, almost one in four users will get pregnant over a year,according to the UK’s National Health Service.Prof Danielle Mazza, a practising GP and the head of Monash University’s department of general practice, says many women find it hard to determine when the fertile period of their cycle actually is. She says basal body temperature tracking isnot a good way to prevent pregnancy.Even for women who have a very regular cycle and feel confident identifying their fertile window, the method still relies on several additional factors to work, she says. They have to be prepared to forego sex for considerable periods of time during the month, as well as spontaneity in their sex lives. They also have to have a partner who’s not coercive or violent, and they must make sure they don’t have sex when they’re inebriated or under the influence, Mazza says.What about side effects of hormonal contraception?Hormonal contraception is one of the most researched medications, Mazza says. “The majority of women can use these forms of medication very happily, with very few side-effects.”Knownside-effects of hormonal birth controlinclude headaches, nausea, mood swings, weight gain, sore breasts and acne. However, social media can amplify individual negative experiences, with research showing young people in particular often believe that a lived experience is just as credible as advice from a trained professional, White says.If women are unhappy with the side-effects they are experiencing, Mazza encourages them to talk to their doctor rather than discarding contraception, because there aredifferent methods of effective contraceptionthat could suit them better. “It’s very important to come back for review, because also a lot of women can attribute symptoms to the pill or other hormonal forms of contraception, whereas there might be other reasons why they’re getting those kinds of symptoms.”Mazza also highlights that some side-effects can be transient. For example, breast tenderness or feelings of fullness when you start the pill are common, but usually subside within a few months. She says she does not know of any research to prove claims that women are attracted to men they wouldn’t be attracted to if they were off the pill.What do experts recommend?Dr Caroline de Moel-Mandel, the lead author of the La Trobe University study and a GP, says women often feel they aren’t listened to in clinical settings. As a result, if they feel pressed into accepting a particular contraceptive method, they might search for an alternative or talk about it and seek validation online from women who feel the same way, “and it becomes a cycle”.“The platform offers women a space to talk about their side-effects, or their distrust or their frustrations that they have with the pill, or maybe even with the consultations that they had with their doctors,” Moel-Mandel says.“Women need to be part of that decision-making process,” with their own lived experience being validated alongside their doctor’s medical perspective, she says. Other barriers, such as appointments being too expensive, also need to be addressed.White also emphasises that data shows – at least in the Australian context – that thelevel of knowledge around contraception is very low. Many women are worried about short- and long-term side-effects of hormonal contraception. As a result, she says, there is “a concerning level of unintended pregnancy”.“Being able to choose when to get pregnant is really, really, really critical for a woman’s health and her economic security.” But White stresses that “you can’t make an informed choice if you’re being misled”.Natasha May is Guardian Australia’s health reporterAntiviralis a fortnightly column that interrogates the evidence behind the health headlines and factchecks popular wellness claimsShare your experienceShare your experienceWhat health trend do you want examined?Please share your story if you are 18 or over, anonymously if you wish.

It is a pillar of national stability.Finlandhas long understood this, not just because of policy, but because of who we are and where we live. Geography, a mild continental climate and our history have shaped a mindset where preparedness is essential. In a country with vast territory, a sparse population and long distances between communities, resilience must be built into everything we do.This understanding is deeply rooted in our society, in individual households as much as government institutions. Today, Finland’s approach to preparedness is rightly seen as a model forEurope. But it is not a one-size-fits-all solution. What works for Finland, such as our high levels of food self-sufficiency, strong institutions and a culture of cooperation, may not work elsewhere. Still, our experience offers valuable lessons. Preparedness must be proactive, inclusive and deeply integrated into national strategy.My job at the National Emergency Supply Agency (Nesa) means I spend much of my time thinking about what could go wrong – and more importantly, how we can make Finland ready for when it does. Whether we face a pandemic, cyber-attack or geopolitical shock, our job is to ensure the country can continue to function, feed itself and protect its people. The Covid-19 pandemic and war in Ukraine have shown how fragile global systems can be.One of the cornerstones of our national resilience is thestrategic grain reservesystem. These reserves include wheat, oats, barley and rye, grains that are central to both our agriculture and our diet.Stored in secure facilitiesacross the country, they are rotated using the Fifo (first in, first out) method to maintain quality and ensure older grains are used before newer ones. These reserves are designed to sustain the population for nine months in the event of a global supply-chain collapse or domestic production disruption. During the pandemic and the war in Ukraine, they have helped reassure the public.Finland’s food self-sufficiency rate is around 80%. That means we produce most of the food we consume, which is a rare achievement in today’s interconnected world. This is thanks to our farmers, who operate more than 40,000 farms nationwide. In 2024, crop production was the main activity on 74% of farms, while livestock farming was practised on 20%. The average farm size is56 hectares.Despite a short growing season and a limited variety of crops, our agricultural sector is efficient, innovative and supported by strong infrastructure. These farms are the backbone of our food system and their role in national security cannot be overstated.View image in fullscreenA tractor harrowing farmland in Lieto, Finland.Photograph: Jarmo Piironen/AlamyWe have even developed our ownrapeseed cultivar, Aurea CL, specifically suited to the Nordic climate. It helps ensure that domestically produced rapeseed oil and protein-rich feed remain available even during times of crisis. This kind of innovation reflects our long-term commitment to resilience.But preparedness is not just about stockpiles and production. It is about systems that can adapt and continue to function under stress. Finland’s food supply chain is resilient by design. The governmentworks closelywith producers, processors, retailers and logistics companies to ensure continuity. Emergency plans are in place to reroute deliveries and prioritise essential goods. We also maintain emergency fuel reserves to keep agricultural machinery and food transport running during crises.A key part of our strategy is public-private partnerships. At Nesa, we collaborate with companies across the food sector, from grain mills to supermarket chains. Together, we develop contingency plans, run joint exercises and share information. This cooperation is not just policy. It is the way things are done. Businesses understand their role in national preparedness and take it seriously.Preparedness also starts at home. In Finland, household-level readiness is essential. One of our most effective tools is the72-hour model,which encourages every household to be self-sufficient: to have enough food and bottled water (five litres per person) for three days. We advise having a stock of dry foods that keep well, such as nuts or dried fruit. Our home emergency supply kit checklist includes such items as a first aid kit, iodine tablets, a battery-powered radio, torch, power bank, portable stove, toilet paper and duct tape.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Nigel Farage or Robert Jenrick attacking the European convention on human rights (ECHR)? No – Herbert Morrison, leader of the Commons, and William Jowitt, lord chancellor in Clement Attlee’s postwar Labour government, respectively, both arguing that Britain should not accede to the convention.Labour was suspicious, fearing that it would prevent nationalisation. It did not. Today, Conservatives and Reform UK fear that it will frustrate immigration control. It need not.Denmark and Sweden have recently taken draconian measures to restrict immigration without falling foul of the ECHR. The Danish Social Democrats have reduced asylum claims to their lowest level for 40 years. In Sweden, a government of the right has seen a 23%fall in asylum applicationsbetween 2023 and 2024.Admittedly, the ECHR as well as the UN’s 1951 refugee convention protect the rights of asylum seekers against deportation to countries where they might face ill-treatment. It would be inhumane to do otherwise. Would anyone wish to deport women to Afghanistan or dissidents to Iran?Judicial interpretation of article 8 of the ECHR that requires respect for family life has made it difficult to repatriate criminals and illegal immigrants. But the government can tighten the immigration rules, providing principles intended to guide judicial interpretation, in particular that the public interest of immigration control overrides the private interest of an article 8 claimant, except in very exceptional circumstances. If European judges resist such guidance, that would incentivise EU leaders to press for ECHR reform. Nine, including Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen, Italy’s Giorgia Meloni and Poland’s Donald Tusk, arealready doing so.In any case, the government, as former Labour home secretary David Blunkett has indicated, can derogate – that is suspend – article 8, while the refugee convention probably allows a temporary implied derogation when a country faces a mass influx.The British government accepts that the ECHR, enacted well before the age of mass transit, needs reform. But it would be a grave mistake to leave the ECHR. It is rare, if not unprecedented, for a democracy to exit a major human rights regime. It would be particularly dangerous for Britain. For we have moved, since Brexit, from a system governed by a constitution – the EU treaties – to an unprotected one with no real checks to prevent a government from doing whatever it likes: a system characterised 50 years ago by Lord Hailsham, future Conservative lord chancellor,as elective dictatorship.Some might object that our immemorial rights were perfectly well protected by parliament and the common law long before the ECHR. Perhaps in normal times; but not during a moral panic such as may exist today when the debate on immigration and asylum is in danger of succumbing to what Timothy Garton Ashhas called“inflammatory rhetoric”.During a previous moral panic at the time of the 1974 IRA bombing campaign, Leslie Scarman, a prominent law lord, wrote, “When times are normal and fear is not stalking the land, English law sturdily protects the freedom of the individual ... But when times are abnormally alive with fear and prejudice, the common law cannot resist the will, however frightened and prejudiced it may be, of parliament.”In 1968, Harold Wilson’s Labour government feared an influx of Kenyan Asians escaping Kenya’s Africanisation policy. Its Commonwealth Immigrants Act imposed retrospective immigration controls on “non-belonging”people with British passports. The bill, supported by opposition Conservatives, passed its various parliamentary stages injust seven days. In 1973, the European court of human rights found that this legislation had subjected Asian people in east Africa to “racial discrimination” amounting to “degrading treatment”. In 2002, as Labour home secretary, Blunkett ended a “historic wrong” by giving British citizenship to the 35,000 Asian people rendered stateless by the act.There is an even more significant example from Northern Ireland. Under unionist rule from 1921 to 1972, there was what the Cameron commission in 1969 characterised as unfair allocation of council housing, discrimination in local government appointments and gerrymandering of local authority boundaries. Catholic grievances erupted in the 1968 civil rights movement. The Catholic plurality in the province, therefore, feels a symbolic attachment to the ECHR. To leave would arouse Catholic resentment and severely strain the Good Friday agreement.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toMatters of OpinionFree weekly newsletterGuardian columnists and writers on what they’ve been debating, thinking about, reading, and moreEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionWhen the ECHR,spearheaded by Winston Churchill, was enacted, it was primarily to prevent any resurgence of fascism or national socialism. Today, however, a main concern of the 1998 Human Rights Act, which gave effect in Britain to ECHR rights, is with the rights of minorities too small to be able to use the democratic machinery of party politics and pressure groups effectively. The act has become unpopular because some prominent cases brought under it have involved the rights of unpopular minorities such as asylum seekers, prisoners and suspected terrorists, rather than nice people such as ourselves. However, being nice is not a necessary qualification for enjoying human rights, and even nice people such as ourselves may on some future occasion need the protection of the act.Britain is one of just three democracies without a codified constitution, the other two being New Zealand and Israel. So we are peculiarly susceptible to illiberal legislation. Leaving the ECHR would make our rights almost entirely the responsibility of our sovereign parliament. Are MPs and ministers really so much more sensitive to the protection of human rights than the legislators of democracies protected by constitutions that they can be safely entrusted with this important responsibility?Vernon Bogdanor is a professor of government at King’s College London.

But judging by the polls and the people I spoke to, the messages of the right are truly cutting throughTue 16 Sep 2025 01.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 07.44 EDTShareAt the weekend, I took the well-worn journey from London to Knowsley in Merseyside. I’ve made this trip so many times that I can execute it with military precision, arriving just in time before the train doors close, even with a toddler in tow this time around. My uncle picked us up from the station and as we turned on to the motorway, I saw St George’s flags hanging over us from the sides of bridges. Union jacks circled the roundabout just before we turned off to go to my auntie’s house. Knowsley isLabour’s fourth-safest seat in the UK, but it felt like a newly minted Reform constituency.It was a Friday evening, so we opened a bottle of wine and put pizzas in the oven. I was updated on various family milestones – a house sale had gone through, a baby bump was starting to show, the poor dog was on its last legs. My daughter entertained everyone with an energetic rendition ofSleeping Bunnies. Behind her, the BBC News at Six played images of migrants huddled on inflatable boats sailing across the Channel.The next day, we drove past large Amazon, Evri and DHL warehouses to a retail park to shop for kids’ clothes. We had lunch in the M&S cafe and watched as pensioners struggled to order coffee and tea from the newly installed touchscreens. Someone nearby scrolled through TikTok and stated that the far-right protest in London had 3 million attenders. (Police estimateshave put the figurebetween 110,000 and 150,000.)For the rest of the weekend, out and about, I asked questions. What did people make of the news? What did they think about what the protesters had to say? Would they voteReform UK? I wasn’t doing thorough research, and my results wouldn’t stand up in any peer-reviewed study, but I was trying to get a snapshot of a place before it changed beyond my recognition.I heard two arguments again and again. People were opposed to the boats on a principle of “fairness” that was limited to national boundaries. Some said that they had worked and paid taxes all their lives, and it was therefore unfair that someone who had never worked or paid taxes in Britain should have accommodation and financial support and be able to access the NHS. They felt the UK should get its own house in order before helping others.The second argument was new: the people coming in small boats are young men who pose a threat to British women. Knowsley has never been immune to the everyday racism experienced across the UK – or even its violent outbursts, as with themurder of Anthony Walkerin 2005 – but never before have racist talking points been repeated so persistently. The trope about women was straight out of the far-right playbook,post-Rochdale, and has been circulating in Knowsley for the past two years. Back in February 2023,a violent riot broke out in Knowsleyoutside a hotel housing migrants. A video had been widely shared on social media allegedly showing a migrant staying at the accommodation asking for a 15-year-old girl’s phone number. At the time Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, posted on Telegram: “A clear message sent to the police, to the UK government and to the hotels who house illegal economic migrants accused or suspected of grooming schoolchildren.” Momentum built further when, in July and August 2024, riots broke out not far away in Southport after the murder of three young girls. Rumours had spread in the hours after the incident that the attacker was aMuslim refugee. I was in Merseyside at the time and remember driving with a friend as a false image of the attacker landed in their “lads” WhatsApp group.View image in fullscreenHuyton in Merseyside – the site of a racially motivated murder in 2005.Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The GuardianPeople in Knowsley are right to want more support. The borough is the second mostincome-deprived areain England. Over a quarter ofworking-age adults are economically inactive. It has thelowest GCSE pass ratein the country. Men and women have a healthy life expectancy ofaround 54 years old. Town centres remain more or less empty following the building of “megamarkets”. As with the rest of the country, people check their bank balances with a sense of dread as prices continue to rise. I sat up that night looking at polling for Knowsley: the turquoise Reform bar stretched far beyond Labour’s red one.It’s no coincidence that migrants were housed in this disadvantaged area. Successive governmentshave sought the cheapest areasto house asylum seekers. Lucrative contracts have been handed out to private providers, such as Serco, to manage such accommodation and profits have been paid out to shareholders. All the while, local councils have been struggling to provide the most basic of services for over a decade thanks to central government cuts. I asked people what they thought of Keir Starmer. “What has he done? He’s gone after pensioners.” And Farage? “Well, he’s a bit different.” In the absence of any meaningful change or any narrative to grasp on to, the right and Reform UK have shaped the story. One all too easy to believe.I also visited family in the better off – and more diverse – seat of Liverpool Wavertree. Waiting in line for a coffee, I had a chat, and heard that migrants are not to blame for austerity, privatisation and the extraction of money from our local communities into far-off bank balances. Violence against women and girls is a male, not a migrant problem. There is hope if people see a change in their circumstances. If Labour fail to achieve this, there is a cautionary tale 20 minutes down the road. Earlier this year, in the Runcorn byelection,Reform won the seat from Labourby just six votes.Kirsty Major is a deputy Opinion editor for the GuardianDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

When the Atlassian co-founder and freshly minted chair of the local tech lobby fronted theNational Press Clubrecently, he articulated the industry’s claim on the nation with rare honesty.The T-shirt wearing billionaire shared his log cabin story about a 12-year-old who naively predicted the internet, Amazon and the mass automation of work. But it was when he pivoted to the Tech Council of Australia’s talking points that things got real.According to the Tech Council, AI will deliver $115bn in annual productivity (orabout $4,300 per person), rubbery figures generated by industry-commissioned research based on estimates on hours saved with no regard for jobs lost, the distribution of the promised dividend benefit or how the profits will flow.Tech companies are stealing our books, music and films for AI. It’s brazen theft and must be stopped | Anna Funder and Julia PowlesRead moreIn return for this ill-defined bounty, Farquhar says our government will need to allow the tech industry to do three things: build a data and text mining exemption to copyright law, rapidly scale data centre infrastructure and allow foreign companies to use these centres without regard for local laws. This is a proposition that demands closer scrutiny.The use of copyrighted content to train AI has been a burning issue since 2023 when a massive data dredge saw more than 190,000 authors (including me)have our works plunderedwithout our consent to train AI. Musicians and artists too have had their work scraped and repurposed.This theft has been critical in training the large language models to portray something approaching empathy. It has also allowed paid users to take this stolen content and ape creators, devaluing and diminishing their work in the process.Nick Cave has describedthis as “replication as travesty”, noting “songs arise out of suffering … data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing.”Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best readsThe sense of grievance among creators over the erasure of culture is wide and deep. A wave of creators fromPeter GarretttoTina Arena,Anna FunderandTrent Daltonhave determined this is the moment to take a stand.It is not just the performers; journalists, academics, voiceover and visual artists are all being replaced by shittier but cheaper automated products built on the theft of their labour, undermining the integrity of their work and will ultimately take their jobs.Like fossil fuels, what is being extracted and consumed is the sum of our accumulated history. It goes from metaphor to literal when it comes to the second plank of Farquhar’s pitch: massive spending on industrial infrastructure to accommodate AI.The Tech Council sees Australia’s future prosperity tied to the rapid development of the energy-hungry and water-thirsty data centres that the industry requires to power their rosy vision of the future, one where thousands of short-term jobs are created to build the centres that then will run largely autonomously. No mention that there is already a shortage of tradies to build houses and that the people who will be looking for jobs are theone in two young graduateswhose entry paths AI will close.No mention either of the impact on the broader energy network, already struggling to meet our existential carbon reduction targets. AnMIT Technology Reviewinvestigation estimates that even in its infancy the industry is gobbling more than 4% of US energy, tipped to rise to 12% of the grid by 2028.But the study found it’s hard to gauge the extent of the sector’s claim on resources because the AI companies are deliberately opaque about their footprint. What we do know is there is the intensive energy required to train the models, and ongoing power used each time an AI is deployed. A simple search is calculated at 10 times the energy for a Google search but more complex prompts and demands for images, audio and video consume much, much more, not to mention agents and always-on companions.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFive Great ReadsFree weekly newsletterEach week our editors select five of the most interesting, entertaining and thoughtful reads published by Guardian Australia and our international colleagues.

Meanwhile, the OpenAI CEO, Sam Altman,is reassuring usthat we don’t need to stress because AI will solve climate change anyway!The third and final element of Farquhar’s pitch is probably its most revealing. If Australia wants to build this AI nirvana, foreign nations should be given diplomatic immunity for the data centres built and operated here. This quaint notion of the “data embassy” overriding national sovereignty reinforces a growing sense that the tech sector is moving beyond the idea of the nation state governing corporations to that of a modern imperial power.That’s the premise of Karen Hao’s bookThe Empire of AI, which chronicles the rise of OpenAI and the choices it made to trade off safety and the public good in pursuit of scale and profit. “OpenAI is now leading our acceleration toward this modern-day colonial world order,” she writes. “In the pursuit of an amorphous vision of progress, its aggressive push on the limits of scale have set the rules for a new era of AI development.”As Hao points out, there are versions of technology that do not race to scale in the name of AI. Do we give up when we accept the hyper-scalers’ vision of AI? Or are there smaller, more responsible uses of this sophisticated tech that could be more effectively deployed to solve real human problems?In clarifying the industry’s position, Farquhar has put the acid on all of us to be clear about what we will and will not give up to the tech bros and their fantasy machines.

The UK government must stop hiding behind legal fictions and recognise the realityTue 16 Sep 2025 14.02 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 14.28 EDTShareAUnited Nationscommission of inquiryhas now said what Israeli, Palestinian and international human rights organisations, as well as many genocide scholars, have alreadyargued: that Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide. The commission finds that mass killings, attacks on vital infrastructure, starvation, displacement and denial of medical care meet the legal definition of history’s gravest crime. Itfindsgenocidal intent “the only reasonable inference” from both the statements of Israel’s leaders and the conduct of its forces in Gaza.Against this, Israel’s repeated assertions that it is acting inlawful self-defencering hollow in the face of overwhelming evidence and a deliberate pattern of destruction. The UN’s conclusion imposes moral clarity. It also demands political action, especially from those, including the UK and the US, who have for too long treated Israel as an exception to international norms.Historically, the GuardiansupportedJewish aspirations for a homeland, playing a significant role in the early Zionist movement – particularly as antisemitism rose in Europe. That history only adds weight to our present concern over where the country is going. Other states must reckon with the consequences of enabling afar-right government under Benjamin Netanyahuthat has defied international law with impunity and pursued its aims with horrifying human cost.View image in fullscreenNavi Pillay, chair of the UN’s commission of inquiry, which has said that Israel’s war in Gaza amounts to genocide.Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty ImagesIt is no defence to point toHamasatrocities, appalling as they were, to justify the systematic devastation of Gaza, home to over 2 million people, half of them children. The notion that the flattening of Gaza will bring peace is for the birds. Reportedly, Israel’s military chiefs have privately conceded that Hamas may not be defeated even after Gaza City falls – and that a “complete victory” may require further military expansion in the strip. If accurate, this implies that Israel’s leaders foresee the failure of stated war aims – and are preparing for even greater devastation.Mr Netanyahu, perhaps recognising the consequences, has warned Israelis to prepare for “isolation” and a new era in which traditionalEuropeansupport may no longer be guaranteed. This shift shouldn’t be underestimated. European powers, including Britain, have long underwritten Israel’s technological and military edge – through arms exports, trade agreements and research funding. The EU’sHorizonprogramme is only one of many economic levers at Europe’s disposal. Suspension of such links would have profound repercussions, as would recognising aPalestinianstate.The British government’s response has been evasive. Ministers said the UK had “not concluded” that Israel is acting with genocidal intent. That now looks like little more than a fig leaf. A court case revealed the Foreign Office reviewed over400 alleged violations of international humanitarian lawby Israeli forces in Gaza but identified possible wrongdoing in only one. The apparent logic is: ignore enough individual incidents, and you won’t see the pattern.But the UN says the reality cannot be denied. Under thegenocide convention, states must not only punish genocide but prevent it. That threshold has been crossed. To continue withsymbolic sanctionsis not just morally indefensible – it is complicity. Some will warn against inflammatory language. But Gaza is alreadyburning. Britain must stop all arms sales, back international accountability and drop the legal contortions. The charge is grave. The evidence is overwhelming. To pretend otherwise is to join in with our age’s most shameful evasions.Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

He played a key role in the establishment of American independent cinema by co-founding theSundance film festival, which acted as a platform for films such as Reservoir Dogs, The Blair Witch Project, Donnie Darko, Fruitvale Station and Coda.View image in fullscreenRedford with Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969.Photograph: 20th Century Fox/Sportsphoto/AllstarRedford also acquired a reputation as one of Hollywood’s leading liberals and campaigned on environmental issues, including acting as a trustee of theNatural Resources Defense Counciladvocacy group andvocally opposingthe now cancelled Keystone XL pipeline extension.Born CharlesRobert Redfordin 1936, he grew up in Los Angeles and, after he was expelled from the University of Colorado, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. After playing a series of small parts on TV, stage and film, he began to make headway in the early 60s, being nominated for a best supporting actor Emmy in 1962 for The Voice of Charlie Pont and winning a lead role in the original 1963 Broadway production of Neil Simon’s hit play Barefoot in the Park. Redford’s film breakthrough arrived in 1965: an eye-catching role as a bisexual film star in Inside Daisy Clover opposite Natalie Wood, for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe.After a series of solid Hollywood films, including The Chase and a screen adaptation of Barefoot in the Park, Redford had a huge hit with the 1969 outlaw western Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which he starred opposite Paul Newman and Katharine Ross. It was nominated for sevenOscars, though none were for the actors.Redford starred in Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here, the first directing credit in over 20 years by former blacklistee Abraham Polonsky, and then a string of key 1970s hits: frontier western Jeremiah Johnson (1972), period romance The Way We Were (1973) opposite Barbra Streisand, crime comedy The Sting (1973), again opposite Newman, and literary adaptation The Great Gatsby (1974). Redford followed these up with conspiracy thriller Three Days of the Condor (1975) and Watergate drama All the President’s Men (1976), co-starring with Dustin Hoffman.View image in fullscreenRedford with Jane Fonda in the 1967 film version of Barefoot in the Park.Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty ImagesAfter a prolonged break from acting in the late 70s, Redford turned to directing with the ensemble drama Ordinary People, adapted from the novel by Judith Guest. A substantial hit, it won four Oscars in 1981, including best picture and best director for Redford – an accolade he never received for his acting.His success as an actor continued in the 1980s and 1990s, though perhaps with less of the cutting-edge impact of his 1970s work. Baseball drama The Natural, adapted from a Bernard Malamud novel in 1984, was followed by Out of Africa in 1985, in which he played big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton opposite Meryl Streep’s Danish aristocrat. He returned to directing with The Milagro Beanfield War in 1988 and A River Runs Through It in 1992, both grappling in different ways with rural America. A year later he made what in retrospect was something of a turning point: an unalloyed Hollywood project, the erotic thriller Indecent Proposal, in which his businessman character offers a million dollars to sleep with Demi Moore’s character. It re-established Redford as a commercial force. Later in the 90s he directed Quiz Show and The Horse Whisperer (the latter of which he also starred in).View image in fullscreenWith fellow winners Robert De Niro, Sissy Spacek and Ordinary People producer Ronald L Schwary at the Oscars in 1981.Photograph: APIt was in this period that theSundance film festival– which Redford’s production company had co-founded in 1978 as the Utah/US film festival and renamed in 1984 after Redford’s Sundance Institute – began to exert its influence as a showcase for US independent cinema, promoting the likes of Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino, Robert Rodriguez and Kevin Smith. Its impact only increased in subsequent decades as a forum for boosting films’ commercial chances and achieving awards recognition, showcasing films such as 500 Days of Summer, Napoleon Dynamite, Whiplash, Fruitvale Station and Coda.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFilm WeeklyFree newsletterTake a front seat at the cinema with our weekly email filled with all the latest news and all the movie action that mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

The style was more a scuffed, grizzled, bleary, sweaty, paunchy and shlubby realness. The fashion was for leading men like Gene Hackman, Jack Nicholson, Woody Allen. Even a very beautiful man like Paul Newman had a kind of rugged, daylit quality. ButRobert Redfordwas very different. Here was a supremely beautiful movie star who went on to direct, produce and then be the guardian and gatekeeper of commercial-indie US cinema at his Sundance Institute. And he was always an outlier.When movie audiences thrilled to George Roy Hill’s westernButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kidin 1969, they knew that in breakout star Redford they had an almost indecently attractive male, however much he might dress it down with buckskins and moustache, playing the devil-may-care outlaw Sundance Kid himself. His sardonic charisma and sexiness shone through. And when he cleaned himself up for other roles, teaming up again with Newman for the jazz age con-men caper The Sting in 1973, the effect was electric. Neatly trimmed and shaved, Robert Redford was just outrageously handsome, incandescently handsome, he was handsomeness on legs. His photograph was in the dictionary next to “handsome”.Cool hand Paul: Peter Bradshaw on why Paul Newman devoted his life to playing the American everymanRead moreIn Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Paul Newman might be permitted to entertain Katharine Ross with his wacky stunts on a bicycle, to the accompaniment of Raindrops Keep Fallin’ On My Head. But it was blond bombshell Redford who was actually going to have sex with her. Redford was a throwback to the era of Douglas Fairbanks and Tyrone Power, the Hollywood era of gasp-inducing matinee idols and swoonworthy dreamboats, absurdly handsome men whose beauty seemed to have been nurtured in some Hollywood petri dish.The American movie business was reputedly trying to imitate some of the dash and freewheeling style of the French New Wave directors – and Redford became, for a while, the Bardot of the American new wave, but with a self-awareness and a comic self-deprecation that made him irresistible to women and men. He was a comic performer with wonderful flair, but never, in my view, very well served by serious pictures such as The Great Gatsby (1974) in which he played Fitzgerald’s enigmatic plutocrat, or The Way We Were (1973), in which he is the shallow Wasp in love with Barbra Streisand’s Jewish intellectual. In those films, for me, Redford would sometimes appear to retreat into himself, into his own misty-eyed aura, like a very lonely and beautiful woman.His best film of that time is surely Michael Ritchie’s superb political satire The Candidate, a movie released in June 1972, 12 days after the Watergate break-in. Redford plays Bill McKay, an idealistic young Democratic candidate for the US Senate, and the movie shows him on the campaign trail inexorably trimming his standards and watering down his principles as he gets closer and closer to winning.All the President’s Men: Hoffman and Redford fight the powers that beRead moreRedford’s pure handsomeness itself achieves a sublimely satirical quality in the film; politics is supposed to be show business for ugly people, but Redford’s physical beauty is symbolic of how the ruling class sees itself – and a symbolic of the bland, specious plausibility of mainstream political ideas. In All the President’s Men (1976) he was Bob Woodward to Dustin Hoffman’s Carl Bernstein – another “buddy” pairing of the sort he and Newman made fashionable in 1970s cinema. It was a heartfelt, liberal movie in which you knew who the good guys were, but without the edge and cool ambiguity of Ritchie’s The Candidate.As the years went on, there was something rather too controlled and preserved about Redford’s performing style, although he remained an above-the-title A-list star. He played opposite nuclear scene-stealerMeryl Streepin Out of Africa (1985) and inevitably got royally upstaged; in the 90s, he was still the romantic lead in Up Close & Personal opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, while in Indecent Proposal he was the wealthy businessman who makes a rather preposterous “proposal” which appeared to offer audiences a rather contrived dilemma in which feminism is neither here nor there.But this was the era in which Redford was branching out into direction. His Ordinary People (1980) was the spectacularly uptight and distraught upper-class family drama-tragedy starring Donald Sutherland and Mary Tyler Moore. It was very respectfully received at the time, although film critics have never quite forgiven Redford for beating Scorsese’s Raging Bull to the best picture Oscar. The environmental themes of The Milagro Beanfield War (1988) and A River Runs Through It (1992) were again treated with respect but there was no great excitement.Quiz Show takes the prize for historical accuracyRead moreBut Redford did score one resounding success as a director, and that is with the tremendous media satire Quiz Show (1994), the story of the rigged TV gameshow scandals of the 1950s, with Ralph Fiennes as a talented but venal young academic seduced by TV celebrity and Paul Scofield as his sorrowing father. This film performed poorly at the box office, but it is really good, and Redford’s direction of Fiennes is very assured. He got from that actor one of his very best screen performances.But of course it is the Sundance Institute and its annual festival of independent film that is Robert Redford’s real and lasting legacy, built on land in the skiing country around Park City, Utah, which Redford bought and on which he built an institution which administers funds and fellowships which help young film-makers.Sundance 2015: Robert Redford talks change but not retiringRead moreSundance itself has come in for a bit of criticism these days; it’s a festival which I’ve heard denounced as encouraging a parodied kind of Sundance movie, of pallid, humourless, underclass emoting of lost souls, photographed in stonewashed colours – the equivalent of Brit realist miserabilism – while the festival is now allegedly packed with studio-bound careerists intent on an “indie” break which will get them a superhero franchise.Well, no matter. Who can doubt the remarkable ambition and imagination of Robert Redford, who created something that outlasted his own very formidable career? He was always more than a pretty face.2:08Robert Redford: one of Hollywood's defining stars – video obituaryExplore more on these topicsRobert RedfordSundance film festivalButch Cassidy and the Sundance KidFestivalsBarbra StreisandMeryl StreepfeaturesShareReuse this content"

However, Redford managed to expand as much as he could within his limitations, once claiming: “I’m interested in playing someone who bats in 10 different ways.”Redford, who was always ill at ease about his looks, was described bySydney Pollack, for whom the actor made seven films (including the spy thriller Three Days of the Condor in 1975), as “an interesting metaphor for America, a golden boy with a darkness in him”. To many of his characterisations, he added a wry wit, able to hint, via subtle nuance, at a more complex psychology hidden beneath the surface.Romantically flawed and fallen heroes were his forte, so he was perfectly cast in the title role of The Great Gatsby (1974). “I wanted Gatsby badly,” he commented. “He is not fleshed out in the book and the implied parts are fascinating.”According toF Scott Fitzgerald’s description of the novel’s hero, “Jay Gatsby had one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it, that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced, or seemed to face, the whole external world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favour … he invented just the sort of Jay Gatsby that a 17-year-old boy would be likely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.” Redford, like Gatsby, carefully polished his image of an alluring, dispassionate, handsome icon.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford, right, with Katharine Ross and Paul Newman in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, 1969.Photograph: Moviestore collection/AlamyCharles Robert Redford Jr was born in Santa Monica,California, the son of an accountant with Standard Oil, and his wife, Martha (nee Hart). The family moved to Van Nuys, California, where Robert went to Van Nuys high school. He was blessed early on with a graceful athleticism, excelling in swimming, tennis, football and baseball, the last of which won him a scholarship to the University of Colorado, where he could also indulge his love for climbing and skiing.But he soon became frustrated by what he called “test-tube athletes”. As the character of the Olympic skier that he played inDownhill Racer(1969) says: ‘“I never knew what it was like to just enjoy a sport. I was always out there grovelling to win. You begin to fear not winning.”When his lack of attendance at baseball practice led to him losing his scholarship, he left for Europe in 1957. Because he had displayed a certain talent as a caricaturist in high school, he did what all hopeful American artists did: he went to paint in Paris before being forced into the realisation that, as an artist, he was mediocre. On his return to the US, he married his girlfriend, Lola Van Wagenen, in 1958 and studied scenic design at the Pratt Institute in New York.When Redford was told that to really understand the principles of scenic design, he must put himself in the actor’s place, he enrolled at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. “At the Academy I got the space and the opportunity to expand and form myself as an actor, but I didn’t learn to act,” he recalled.None the less, in 1959, he made his professional stage debut on Broadway with a small role as a basketball player in Tall Story, which he repeated uncredited in the feature film version starringJane Fondathe following year. During the try-out run for The Highest Tree (1959), a short-lived play about a nuclear scientist, his first child, Scott, died of sudden infant death syndrome.He made it big on Broadway in Norman Krasna’s Sunday in New York (1961) and even bigger inNeil Simon’s hit comedy Barefoot in the Park (1963), which he reprised in thescreen versionopposite Fonda in 1967. He remained in the play for the first year of its four-year run, but never worked in the theatre again.At the same time, he was racking up numerous TV credits, including the callow Don Parritt inSidney Lumet’s production ofEugene O’Neill’s The Iceman Cometh (1960) and a memorable appearance as the Angel of Death in an exceptional 1962Twilight Zoneepisode called Nothing in the Dark.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford as the journalist Bob Woodward with Dustin Hoffman, right, as Carl Bernstein in All the President’s Men, 1976.Photograph: Pictorial Press /AlamyRedford’s first credited film role was in the untrumpeted War Hunt (1962), an off-beat little picture, shot in 15 days, in which Pollack also made his screen debut as a performer. They played members of a platoon in Korea, one of whom (John Saxon) is schizophrenic. He goes out on lone missions and kills the enemy with a stiletto. Redford’s character tries to rescue an orphan from Saxon’s influence.It was three years before he returned to the big screen, gaining some attention inRobert Mulligan’sInside Daisy Clover (1965), in which he playedNatalie Wood’s egotistical, bisexual matinee idol husband and for which he won the Golden Globe award for most promising newcomer.This promise was fulfilled in his following films, includingArthur Penn’s steamyThe Chase(1966), in which Redford played an escaped convict whom the fair-minded sheriff (Marlon Brando) tries to protect from being lynched by the inhabitants of a small Texas town. Although the role required Redford to spend much of the film running through rice fields, he opted for that rather than playing the sheriff, the part he was offered originally.He seemed incredibly relaxed and confident in the early stages of his career, rejecting two roles offered to him byMike Nichols– the younger man in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (eventually played byGeorge Segal), and Benjamin Braddock inThe Graduate, because he felt too old for the part, even though he and Hoffman, who made his name from the part, were almost the same age. He also turned down theJohn Cassavetesrole inRoman Polanski’sRosemary’s Baby.Instead, he preferred to co-star with Wood again in Pollack’sThis Property Is Condemned(1966), based on aTennessee Williamsplay, as a mysterious railway official. Next came Barefoot in the Park, and then one of his best-known roles, Sundance–a role passed over by Brando,Warren BeattyandSteve McQueen– oppositePaul Newman’s Butch Cassidy in one of the most successful westerns ever.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford, centre, in The Sting, 1973.Photograph: Universal/Sportsphoto/AllstarGeorge Roy Hill’sButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969) created at its core an irresistible chemistry between its two male leads as charming outlaws, leading to a string of buddy movies, including the equally successfulThe Sting(1973) with the same director and stars, this time playing scam artists in 1930s Chicago.Between the two hit movies, Redford made several films, the best beingMichael Ritchie’s satiricalThe Candidate(1972), about a presidential campaign, in which he was well cast in the vapid title role, and Pollack’sThe Way We Were(1973). The latter, an odd couple romantic comedy with Redford as an upper-crust Wasp who does not take politics seriously, andBarbra Streisandas a working-class Jewish leftist uncompromising in her political beliefs, saw them both performing well within their comfort zones.By the end of the 60s, Redford had become one of the world’s top film stars and box-office attractions, with carefully chosen projects to keep alive his screen persona in glossy Hollywood star vehicles. Among the exceptions were movies that satisfied his liberal leanings, especiallyAlan Pakula’sWatergateexposé,All the President’s Men(1976).The perspicacious Redford had bought an option on the book by the Washington Post journalistsCarl BernsteinandBob Woodwardprior to its publication in 1974 for $450,000.William Goldman, who had written three buddy movies in a row for Redford – Butch Cassidy, The Hot Rock (with Segal, 1972) andThe Great Waldo Pepper(with Bo Svenson, 1975) – was hired to supply another one for the star and Hoffman, delivering a sort of “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid Bring Down the Government”, as one Washington Post wit described it.View image in fullscreenRobert Redford as Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby, 1974.Photograph: Moviestore CollectionOf the two leads, Redford had the edge, managing to combine a dry humour, a convincing intelligence and a determined idealism. According to Hoffman, the reason the film was a top earner was because “it is what the public always wanted: that beautiful Wasp finally wound up with a nice Jewish boy”.In the 80s, Redford gradually scaled down his acting, appearing in only four films, having taken up producing and directing. At the same time, he established the Sundance Institute on his 7,000-acre estate in Provo, Utah, providing workshops, development resources and support to promising independent film-makers.In 1978, Redford co-founded theSundance film festival,held in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah every January as a shop window for independent cinema, and remained a godfather to it. A passionate environmentalist, he also co-founded the Institute for Resource Management, a forum to encourage land developers and environmentalists to work together.In later acting assignments, he was shown in a noble, almost saintly, light, consistently backlit to turn his golden hair into a saintly halo: as a prison reformer inBrubaker(1980), a mythical baseball player in The Natural (1984), and the English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (though there was no attempt to get the accent),the lover ofKaren Blixen(Meryl Streep) inOut of Africa(1985).Redford’s first film as a director,Ordinary People(1980), was a middle-class family drama, elegantly shot though not very original, with a sentimental father-son solution. Nevertheless, the film won Oscars for best picture andbest director– Redford went on to win an honorary Oscar, too, in 2002 – as well as best supporting actor, for Timothy Hutton, and best adapted screenplay. Its success encouraged Redford to continue directing over the next decades.The Milagro Beanfield War(1988) was a homespun fable of a New Mexican farmer deflecting water from a housing development to start his own beanfield.A River Runs Through It(1992), shot in Montana (Philippe Rousselot won an Oscar for his cinematography), used fly-fishing as a metaphor for life in an understated way; andQuiz Show(1994) was a gripping account of a television scandal in 50s America, when a winning contestant of a popular programme was exposed as a fraud.Redford directed himself for the first time inThe Horse Whisperer(1998), as a Montana cowboy who cures traumatised horses, a role that fitted him as snugly as his faded denims.The Legend of Bagger Vance(2000), continued his almost mystic interest in sport with a nostalgic look at golf between the wars, whileLions for Lambs(2007) was a flabbily liberal and verbose response to the Iraq war.He starred in and directedThe Company You Keep(2012), a well-intentioned political drama on theWeather Underground30 years after their terrorist activities. Yet, though one would be hard put to call Redford an auteur, there is no denying that his choice of films reflected his political views and his passion for the American west.From the 90s, the reasons for some of his acting choices were a trifle less clear. In Adrian Lyne’sIndecent Proposal(1993), Redford’s character, admitting to advanced middle-age, offers to pay $1m to sleep withDemi Moore, with her husband’s approval. He finally gave in to advancing years at the age of 68 and played a crusty and grizzled rancher inLasse Hallstrom’sAn Unfinished Life(2005), the sort of role Newman andClint Eastwoodhad been playing for years.Never straying too far from his persona of dignified masculinity, Redford continued to be active into his 80s. His solo performance inAll Is Lost(2013) as a castaway seaman trying to survive was a tour de force, while he demonstrated his fitness inA Walk in the Woods(2015), and his integrity as the TV anchor Don Rather inTruth(2015). His last substantial role was as the real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker in the comedy dramaThe Old Man & the Gun(2018).He is survived by his second wife, Sibylle Szaggars, an artist, whom he married in 2009 after a long relationship, and three children, Shauna, James and Amy, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce in 1985.Robert Redford, actor, producer and director, born 18 August 1936; died 16 September 2025Ronald Bergan died in 2020Explore more on these topicsRobert RedfordCaliforniaBroadwayUS televisionobituariesShareReuse this content"

Give me a Brontë any day, she saysTue 16 Sep 2025 10.18 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 12.29 EDTShareEvery word is a wrestling match forAlice Birch. “I find it quite painful,” the award-winning playwright and screenwriter admits. “It’s ugly and horrible. It’s not just pouring out of me. It feels, yeah …” She shrugs in the empty courtyard of London’s Somerset House. “… not very healthy or whatever.”We meet early in the morning as Birch needs to race off to a secret project. She is a sought-after TV writer (on Succession and Normal People) but Birch’s blazing plays are known for their form and fury. Her brutal breakout in 2014,Revolt. She Said. Revolt Again, was written in a 72-hour whirl. She wrote her latest, Romans – now on at the Almeida – in around 10 days. “Of course I didn’t ‘write’ it in 10 days,” she clarifies. “I wrote it in eight years. It’s just that the words,” she waves the air around her head, “were up here.” She would love to squirrel away for a year working solely on one project. “But I guess life and kids and all the rest of it just never made that possible.”She read outside her comfort zone: Hemingway, Lawrence, 70s American novels and ‘trying to read Ulysses and failing’Romans is a disruptive, expansive exploration of both masculinity and the novel over the last 150 years. The story centres on Jack, played by Kyle Soller, who we first meet as a 10-year-old boy. Each act of young Jack’s impossibly stretched life is framed by a different historical literary style: 19th-century novel, modernism, post-modernism. “The idea that it’s almost impossible,” Birch says, “is where it feels exciting.” Form, for her, always comes first. Following Jack and his brothers across time, this is Birch’s first play with a central narrator. “It can feel a bit old-fashioned,” she says, a phrase that will probably not feature in reviews of this play, “but a novel that’s interested in a man defining himself requires a man to stand on stage on his own and speak.”Birch has wanted to write about masculinity for years. “I often get notes on my male characters,” she says, “like they’re not as well formed as the women.” This “felt like an interesting challenge”. Romans opens in a time when women are giving birth on the other side of walls while men smoke cigars, and it travels through boarding schools, prisons, cults and podcast recordings. “Lots of the later sections of the play involved thinking about Andrew Tate and the manosphere,” she grimaces. “That was miserable.”Across the years of mulling over the idea, Birch read outside her comfort zone: Ernest Hemingway; DH Lawrence; 70s American novels; “trying to read Ulysses and failing”. Given the time and a quiet place to read, she would pick up a Hardy or Brontë. “People on moors,” she laughs. “That’s my favourite.” She also untangled ideas with her partner, Sam Pritchard, the play’s director. This will be their first time working together on a show. “We were tentative,” Birch admits. “What if it doesn’t work?”View image in fullscreen‘I often get notes on my male characters’ … Birch.Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The ObserverBirch has made a name for herself as a sharp adapter for television. She co-wrote the TV adaptations of Sally Rooney’s Normal People and Conversations With Friends and is currently working on Ministry of Time, from the Kaliane Bradley novel.Working with others’ words is, Birch acknowledges, “a huge privilege”, but she had been itching to sink her teeth into something new; her last play was 2023’sThe House of Bernarda Alba, a radical retelling of Federico García Lorca’s 1936 drama. In Romans, Birch does not just adaptanovel, butthenovel. “That sounds really pretentious,” she admits, rolling her eyes. But she wanted to see if such a thing was possible for the stage.The idea first found its footing when she heard an old radio interview withMartin Amisabout masculinity and books. “Men were at war or at sea or on mountains,” she explains, “and then man was slowly being dragged indoors because of feminism.” She found the edges of her structure here, using the history of the novel to track how the male narrative has shaped our world, “and what impact the presence of women then has on their stories”.As she was writing, Birch toyed with having the play’s women grapple the narrative back from the men and take over. “But that didn’t feel very truthful.” Instead, the way we treat women who are labelled as mad howls through the play. The topic recurs in Birch’s work, from Anatomy of a Suicide in 2017 to herrecent film adaptationof Ariana Harwicz’s Die, My Love, directed by Lynne Ramsay, one of Birch’s heroes. Co-written with Ramsay and Enda Walsh, the psychological thriller stars Jennifer Lawrence as her character descends into psychosis soon after giving birth. Birch finds herself continually drawn to these stories. “I don’t feel it’s changed much, how people think about women and mental health and creativity and rage,” she says. “It still feels like an angry woman is a terrifying thing to the world that we mustn’t let out.”Romans is at theAlmeida, London, until 11 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreAlice BirchAlmeida theatreSally RooneyTelevisionMartin AmisLynne RamsayinterviewsShareReuse this content"

In a Cornish china clay quarry, a cluster of geodesic domes resembling monumental soap bubbles enclose conservatories housing luxuriant plant eco-systems. Completed in 2000, it was one of Grimshaw’s most ambitious and audacious projects, seemingly springing from the mind of a science fiction novelist rather than an architect.But however thrillingly futuristic Grimshaw’s buildings appeared, they were grounded by an avid interest in engineering and craft, and how historic precedents could be transformed and adapted for the modern era. Instead of using glass for the Eden Project’s domes, Grimshaw employed gossamer-light foil cushions.When passenger rail services through the Channel tunnel first began operating in 1994, the British end was marked by a new international terminus at London’s Waterloo Station. Grimshaw conjured a radical reimagining of the Victorian iron and glass train shed that his 19th-century predecessors would immediately recognise. The inspiration for the roof’s asymmetrical arched form, a design feat made all the more complex by being curved on plan, was the skeleton of a human hand. Intricately pin-jointed to accommodate the deflection imposed by trains, a glazed roof vault encased platforms in a delicately transparent cocoon. Underneath, a sleek, airport-style concourse whisked passengers up to the platform.View image in fullscreenThinking big … the former Eurostar terminal at Waterloo, London, designed by Nicholas Grimshaw.Photograph: Jo Reid & John PeckThough it endured a forlorn period after Eurostar switched its operations to St Pancras in 2007, it has since been incorporated back into the main station as part of a major refurbishment, so that commuters heading for the home counties can experience the same frisson as those original Paris-bound adventurers.Hi-tech architecture was often calculated to appear at its best in a mechanistic, depopulated state, but Grimshaw’s output of stations, airports, trade fair halls, sports complexes and even the odd supermarket, civilised and elevated the everyday experience of catching a train or going shopping.View image in fullscreenSainsbury’s supermarket, Camden Road, London.Photograph: Geoffrey Taunton/AlamyPart aircraft carrier, part aircraft hangar, Sainsbury’s Camden superstore (1988) was a muscular, metallic armature that brought a touch of Mad Max to the weekly shop. Grimshaw even designed a new kind of ramped travelator that locked on to shopping trolleys to convey customers down to the basement car park. It was characteristic of his attention to detail and confidence in technology to solve the most quotidian of problems.Early standout projects included Oxford Ice Rink (1984), a daring, column-free structure suspended by a cat’s cradle of cables from two towering masts and clad in silver panels more commonly used in cold stores. The Financial Times print works (1988) invigorated a bleak part of London’s terraforming Docklands by putting theballet mécaniqueof newspaper production on public view inside an immaculately engineered glass box. Passersby could watch the FT emerge each day in a Heath Robinson-style tableau of whirring machinery and pink newsprint.View image in fullscreenInvigorating … Nicholas Grimshaw’s Financial Times print works in London.Photograph: Bildarchiv Monheim GmbH/AlamyCommissioned to design the British Pavilion for the 1992 Seville Expo, Grimshaw devised an elegant, modular structure topped by a rippling cockscomb of solar panels. These provided the energy to power a wall of water which cooled the pavilion and its visitors in Seville’s searing summer heat. The headquarters for the Western Morning News (1993) was conceived as a futuristic galleon in full sail on a hillside outside Plymouth, while in Berlin, the Ludwig Erhard Haus (1998), designed to house the reunified city’s Chamber of Commerce, was suspended from a ribcage of parabolic steel arches, hoisted into position as theatrically as the timber frames of a medieval barn.Railway stations were a recurring theme. After the success of Waterloo, Grimshaw went on to revitalise London’s Paddington (1999), stripping away accumulated accretions to reveal the engineering puissance of Isambard Kingdom Brunel. Latterly, towards the end of his career, his firm was given the herculean task of sorting out London Bridge, once described by John Betjeman as “the most complicated, muddled and unwelcoming of all London termini”. Where there was dinginess and disorder there is now clarity and connection, expressed in a cavernous new concourse and a concerto of escalators and lifts. Even Betjeman might be able to find his way around.View image in fullscreenA new kind of factory … Bath Schools of Art and Design.Photograph: Nicholas Grimshaw ArchitectsAnother much larger London infrastructure project, the Elizabeth Line, won last year’s RIBA Stirling prize, shared with design team collaborators Maynard, Equation and AtkinsRéalis. “Descending into the colossal network of tunnels feels like entering a portal to the future, where the typical commuter chaos is transformed into an effortless experience,” said RIBA president Muyiwa Oki.Grimshaw was always keen to point out that technology evolves and circumstances change, but the trick is to produce architecture that is agile and adaptable. This was perhaps most persuasively demonstrated by the successful 2019 remodelling of the Herman Miller furniture factory to house the Bath Schools of Art and Design. Originally completed in 1976, when Grimshaw was in partnership with Terry Farrell, the archetypal slick industrial shed is now another kind of factory, an incubator for the processes of creation, making, experimentation and learning, showing that buildings could – and should – have second lives.Explore more on these topicsArchitectureEden ProjectfeaturesShareReuse this content"

When fireworks were lit in Paris to celebrate the Austrian princess’s marriage to the dauphin of France, a conflagration ensued, the crowd stampeded and more than 130 people were killed – although rumour put the number much higher. From the start, it seemed she was destined to be hated by the French people and blamed for sufferings she didn’t even know existed.By the time the French Revolution had begun in 1789, Antoinette was demonised not only as a lavish spender but a rampant sex addict who cuckolded the king. Illustrations from 1790s pornographic booklets in the V&A’s epic show graphically depict her making love to a guard and to one of her ladies in waiting. By the time you get to these libellous prints, you can’t help feeling their bullying nastiness. For you have got to know her. This show is a superb lesson in how history can be understood through images and objects. It brings you as close as it’s possible to get to the real Marie Antoinette.View image in fullscreenPersonally modelled by the queen? … a porcelain  cup in the shape of a breast.Photograph: Martine Beck-Coppola/Grand Palais Rmn (Sèvres - Manufacture et musée nationaux) / Martine Beck-Coppola.She looks back at you with unruffled calm in portraits by Élisabeth Vigée le Brun. Antoinette’s patronage of this gifted painter immediately takes you into a very different royal world from the misogynist fantasies of the revolutionary press: a female-dominated circle where the queen’s fascination with fashion fed Vigée le Brun’s art. She liked to sport striking headgear on top of colossal hairstyles: her caps, or “poufs”, celebrated such events as the discovery of smallpox vaccination. To mark a French naval victory she wore a hat with a ship on top. But the style that inspired Vigée le Brun was a simple, rustic look. In her portrait of the queen in a straw hat, Antoinette holds a pink rose, pausing from her flower-arranging to look at us. It’s a shame they couldn’t pair it with Vigée le Brun’sSelf-Portrait in a Straw Hat, which is not far away in the National Gallery.She was demonised not only as a lavish spender but a rampant sex addict who cuckolded the kingAntoinette is downsizing here. Inspired by the Romantic movement, her hairstyles got smaller in the late 1700s. She turned to nature as the people turned on her, spending more time in her private retreat, the Petit Trianon, in the grounds of Versailles. You can see a gold-trimmed armchair from this pastoral hideout and, even more amazingly, a set of fake gardening tools that were props in the pastoral dramas she performed at its theatre.The ideas of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who praised the state of nature and condemned civilised corruption, are reflected in her “natural” lifestyle, except she couldn’t help express this according to the codes and culture of the court – luxuriously.Another natural fashion in 18th-century France was for upper-class women to breastfeed their own children, instead of employing a wetnurse. This ideal is celebrated by Antoinette’s “breast cup”, a perfect porcelain simulacrum of a breast, rumoured to have been personally modelled by the queen.View image in fullscreenBack to nature … Marie Antoinette with a Rose by  Élisabeth-Louise Vigée Le Brun.Photograph: Christophe Fouin/© Château de Versailles, Dist. Grand Palais RMNRevolutionaries would say (and did say) that all this was a rich woman’s fantasy of naturalness expressed in completely unnatural, consumerist ways. Yet she was just making use of all the comforts of French upper-class culture. There is a ravishing collection of painted fans here, each one a fluttering piece of pictorial art featuring lovers, gods, or a satirical scene in which a hairdresser stands on a ladder to work on a woman’s towering hairstyle.As for the clothes, they are straight out of a fairytale. Therobe de cour(court robe) that the Queen of Sweden wore for her wedding in 1774 is a glittering silver dream beyond any Disney fantasy. This and other garments worn in the 18th century stand in a hall of mirrors, their invisible occupants haunting the gallery. Intimate relics belonging to the queen herself include jewels, her piano, her perfume bottles and pot pourri bowls. Versailles apparently stank.The revolution brought an end to fripperies. Truth was all – yet this too was expressed in fashion. Designs for revolutionary dress show his-and-hers patriotic costumes, including a Roman republican outfit. A depiction of the Festival of the Federation in 1790 shows the royal family conforming to the new ways. But by 1793, the guillotine beckoned.View image in fullscreenA glittering silver dream … the Queen of Sweden’s wedding gown.Photograph: Göran Schmidt Livrustkammaren/SHMAnd here it is. A surviving part of a real guillotine from the revolution, with its rotted black wood and still-sharp, still-usable blade has been lent by the Madame Tussauds archive. It may have been the very machine that beheaded Antoinette on the Place de la Concorde – then called the Place de la Révolution – on 16 October 1793. A print shows the executioner holding up her head for the crowd to see, blood streaming from her neck.After this, the reinvention of Antoinette in modern culture is explored, but it is the least convincing part of the exhibition. There is a photo of Kate Moss in “Marie Antoinette clothes”, and props from the filmMarie Antoinette. All fine, but in reality this is not a show about style. It is about a woman who lived and died in the storm of history. Her final note from her death cell is here: “Mon Dieu! Ayez pitié de moi!” (My God! Have pity for me!)

The play was first performed in 2005 in the US and will be staged at the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse in London in February, directed by Tristan Fynn-Aiduenu.‘You are all the Black Panther’: the electric theatre of Chadwick BosemanRead moreFynn-Aiduenu described the play as “incredibly poignant in speaking about the injustices of police brutality and the unwinding nature of grief, but also the gorgeous brilliance of our Black Souls and exploring every hue they can express on a stage”. He said that Boseman’s love of Shakespeare and hip-hop combined in a “layered, ghostly epic that I have been given the privilege and duty to fully realise”.Boseman was best known for his performance in the title role of Marvel’s Black Panther, and was posthumously nominated for an Oscar for his performance inMa Rainey’s Black Bottom, based on August Wilson’s play. But before he rose to fame as an actor, he had shown himself to be a promising playwright.The director Derrick Sanders, another Howard University alumnus who commissioned Deep Azure, told the Guardian in 2020 that Boseman took the elements of hip-hop culture – graffiti, DJing, rapping, breakdancing – “and combined them into a narrative form. The storytelling would move it in and out of hip-hop, almost as a precursor to Hamilton.”Boseman studied Shakespeare at Oxford University with the British American Drama Academy in 1998. He had wanted to make a film of Deep Azure before his Hollywood career exploded. Daniel Banks, who directed the play at theFolger theatre in Washington DC, said that it was “written as a ritual of community healing”. The killing of Jones by an undercover police officer in Virginia in 2000 was also covered by the author Ta-Nehisi Coates in the 2015 book Between the World and Me. In 2006, after a civil trial,damages were awardedto Jones’s young daughter for his wrongful death.Deep Azure will run from 7 February to 11 April in the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse, the indoor candlelit venue run by Shakespeare’s Globe. It will be performed alongside a new production of The Tempest (17 January to 12 April) directed byTim Crouch, who will play Prospero alongside Naomi Wirthner (How to Train Your Dragon)as Ariel.Crouch is the creator of a series of acclaimed Shakespearean dramas presented from the perspective of the plays’ minor characters, including I, Caliban and I, Banquo. He said he had “been given the keys to the most interesting theatre in London. The spaces at the Globe are not anonymous black boxes that try to disappear as soon as the play begins. They are companions to any work that happens in them; good companions which support and contribute to the stories that they house.”Explore more on these topicsTheatreChadwick BosemanTim CrouchShakespeare's GlobenewsShareReuse this content"

Are we gonna get harassed or held up? We used to come over that border and they’d be, ‘Dropkicks! Come right through!’ But what’s it going to be like now?”By “now”, Casey means during the second Trump presidency, which has brought the political element always present within Dropkick Murphys’ bolshie, Pogues and Clash-influenced bruisers to the fore. The group’s resistance has found its sharpest expression at their shows, where their anthemFirst Class Loseris accompanied by videos depicting Trump and former chum Jeffrey Epstein, whileCasey’s skirmishes with a vocal minority of Maga Dropkicks fansin the mosh pit have lit up social media. He admits these fans often provoke the worst in him. “How do you know if someone’s in a cult? They hold up a hat all fuckin’ night,” he rages in one clip.“People tell me, ‘You didn’t use-ta soapbox like this’,” he says on our video call, gathering steam. “Well, we didn’t use-ta be in the midst of an authoritarian takeover!”Dropkick Murphys are still commanding big blue-collar crowds as they approach their 30th anniversary in 2026. Over the years they’ve scored numerous US Top 10 albums, Bruce Springsteen collaborations and a platinum-seller in the form of civic anthemI’m Shipping Up to Boston, boosted by its appearance in Martin Scorsese’s The Departed. But their value system, Casey says, hasn’t changed since the now seven-strong band formed with the aim “to be a voice for working people”. Class and the labour movement are key to the 56-year-old’s identity. “My father died when I was very young. I was raised by my grandfather, a labour organiser who instilled in me the value of a union. In the Boston suburb where I was raised, everyone owed their lives to a union job. It put a roof over our head.”View image in fullscreenKen Casey performing at Highfield festival, Germany, in 2023.Photograph: Dpa Picture Alliance/AlamyThe Boston of Casey’s youth was heavily Irish-American. “The English love to call us ‘plastic paddies’, but I’ve never thought of myself as Irish – I’mBostonIrish, the people that fought against the most Wasp-y, keep-the-Irish-down place that ever existed,” he says, referring to how Irish refugees fleeing the great famine of 19th-century were targeted by anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant groups and scorned by the English Protestant Puritans who had settled America. “To go from those trenches to positions of power in city hall, on the railroad and in the utility companies led to my generation being able to have the middle-class life.”He pauses for a second, but he’s not finished: Casey would make a great labour organiser himself. “When that’s your story, you need to be willing to aid the culture that’s coming next. One immigrant culture can’t close the door behind them, especially not in America. We’re all immigrants here.”A tearaway in his youth, Casey quit drink and drugs before he reached 21, “because otherwise I’d be in prison,” he says. “I had a big problem as a teen.” He ploughed his energies into the hardcore punk scene surrounding Boston venue the Rathskeller, AKA the Rat. “Punk-rock was the soundtrack to my friggin’ mayhem. I was a rebellious kid, I liked the underdog vibe.” In 1996, now booking shows at the Rat, a co-worker bet him $30 he “didn’t have the balls to start a band on three weeks’ notice”. Never one to back down from a wager, Casey formed Dropkick Murphys.His identity was stamped all over the group. Before they even used Celtic instrumentation – the Dropkicks are the rare punk band to field a bagpiper – he says the embryonic Dropkicks “sounded like [1960s Irish folk group] the Clancy Brothers meets the Ramones – the delivery, the melodies, the lyrical content. It just naturally poured out of me.”Their beginnings were hardscrabble: pressing their own singles, booking their own shows and touring in an old Boston transit bus, for reasons of poverty and pride. “We peeled the roof off under a low bypass,” he grins. “We toured for two more years with that roof open like a convertible. When it rained, I held an umbrella over the driver.”Dropkick Murphys: Rose Tattoo – videoBy the 21st century, they had become staples of the US punk-rock circuit, their annual St Patrick’s Day shows among Boston’s hottest tickets, performing and recording with their heroes. “We play Billy Bragg’s There Is Power in a Union over the PA every night before we go on stage,” Casey says. “He opened our St Patrick’s show last year with it and then played Worker’s Song with us. Afterwards, he said, ‘I felt like I was in the fuckin’ Clash for three minutes!’” Springsteen, another member of the Dropkicks’ extended family, recorded their Rose Tattoo for a charity single after the Boston Marathon bombing, and sang Peg O’ My Heart with Dropkicks in Boston, “back when my grandmother Peg was still alive”, says Casey. “He came on with her for the encore – we had to pry her off Bruce’s arm to get her off the stage. I’m almost shocked a guy of that level was so down-to-earth. But he’s always had an affinity with punk. Bruce still walks the talk.”“Walking the talk” matters to the Dropkicks; their merch is made in the US by union-approved manufacturers, while theirCladdagh Fundsupports non-profit organisations across Boston. “We were pretty beloved in our city, whether people liked our music or not, because we gave a lot back to the community,” Casey says. Not any more, however. “Now a lot of people in my circles say ‘Fuck Dropkick Murphys’,” he adds, lantern jaw clenching. “Although never to my face. They despise me and the band.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toSleeve NotesFree weekly newsletterGet music news, bold reviews and unexpected extras.

His sense of betrayal regarding “the many rank-and-file union members who are now Trump voters” is palpable. “They don’t think Trump’s coming for the unions, but he’s coming for the unions, trust me. I tell Maga friends of mine: Trump wouldn’t piss on you if you were on fire. It’s about total control for the rich. It’s class war.”What is the magic spell Trump has managed to cast over a demographic who were until recently, Casey says, “in lockstep with Dropkicks’ beliefs”? “Trump offered them a chance to say out loud things people used to have to whisper to their friends,” Casey spits. “Racism, cruelty, jokes about disabilities. A lot of white people in America believed whites will not be in control any more, especially after Obama. This is their last, desperate grasp to hold control.”The Dropkicks have met this grim moment with records that have transformed their previously cartoonish riot music into something more sober, biting and heartfelt. Two acoustic albums – 2022’s This Machine Still Kills Fascists and 2023’s Okemah Rising – set unrecorded Woody Guthrie polemics to their music. “Woody’s grandson Cole told his mom Nora, ‘Grandpa would’ve liked these guys’,” Casey beams proudly. “It made us better musicians, doing it all acoustic. But that left us with a hunger to go electric and be a punk-rock band again.” Which brings us to this year’sFor the People, which opens with Who’ll Stand With Us? A key lyric: “The working people fuel the engine / While you yank the chain.”View image in fullscreenPerforming with Bruce Springsteen in 2011.Photograph: MediaNews Group/Boston Herald/Getty ImagesIn anotherviral clip from a recent show, Casey bets a fan in a Maga shirt $100 that it wasn’t manufactured in the US; it was, inevitably, manufactured in Nicaragua, and Casey swapped the offending garment for a union-made Dropkicks T-shirt.“If America is ever going to go back to some semblance of normal, we have to bring the temperature down, we need to be able to talk to each other,” Casey says, referencing that night. “I talked to that guy afterwards, and he said, ‘I don’t let politics get in the way of family, and I consider you family’. I could have jumped down his throat, but he seemed open to reason.” He pauses. “That’s rare for Maga, though. Other days, I’m like, ‘Fuck this, I don’t even want to know these people, if this is how they think and behave’. Do I want to have a dialogue with these people? No. I’m just hoping the fever will break. I don’t need them to have a ‘come to Jesus’ moment on the difference between right and wrong – I just need them not to support what’s happening.”Does he fear blowback for his outspokenness, like that suffered byStephen Colbert– or worse?Deftones singer Chino Moreno: ‘I’ve got hundreds of drawings of myself in my house’Read more“Unlike Stephen, we have no parent company, so we can say what we want,” he says. “Regarding our safety … whatever,” he snarls, disdainfully. “I’ll never have a security guard or anything like that. But you gotta keep your head on a swivel a little bit. Back in the day, we always had a Nazi element gunning for us, but you could see them coming. Now you don’t know who’s who. I’m not sure what’s keeping other people quiet, though, especially in punk-rock. Where’d everyone go? They had the balls to speak out against Bush back in the day. But Bush didn’t have an army of trolls that come after you. Speaking out against Bush wasn’t going to cost you half your fanbase, potentially.”In his darker moments, Casey reckons “within a year, this country’s gonna fall on its face, and people are gonna feel the pain: recession, inflation, unemployment. There’s nobody coming to save us.” He says he feels “no excitement or happiness” in the group’s anti-Trump screeds winning them newfound fame. “But maybe there’s a slight sense of validation,” he adds. “I talk to the fans every night. One night, an immigrant told me, ‘I moved here, and my partner is American, we have children, and I live in fear of being deported. My own friends have turned on me, they say I’m taking American jobs.’ He was actually in tears at the end. But he said, ‘I feel like someone is speaking on my behalf’. From the earliest days of this band, we wanted to be involved in something that mattered. So we are. I wish it was a different subject and not quite so important, but …”He sighs. Maybe the border tonight will be a shitshow, but it won’t change how the Dropkicks operate in this darkest of moments. “We’re sticking our neck out and getting a lot of negative attention,” he adds. “But if we don’t do it now, it might be too late.”For the People is out now on Dummy Luck Music/PIAS.Dropkick Murphys’ European tourbegins 15 October at Alcatraz, MilanExplore more on these topicsPunkPop and rockBostonTrump administrationUS politicsfeaturesShareReuse this content"

The challenge for future generations will be dealing with the feeling of emptiness that leaves us withTue 16 Sep 2025 02.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 10.34 EDTShareIn the German fairytale The Fisherman and His Wife, an old man one day catches a strange fish: a talking flounder. It turns out that an enchanted prince is trapped inside this fish and that it can therefore grant any wish. The man’s wife, Ilsebill, is delighted and wishes for increasingly excessive things. She turns their miserable hut into a castle, but that is not enough; eventually she wants to become the pope and, finally, God. This enrages the elements; the sea turns dark and she is transformed back into her original impoverished state. The moral of the story: don’t wish for anything you’re not entitled to.Several variations of this classic fairytale motif are known. Sometimes, the wishes are not so much excessive or offensive to the divine order of the world, but simply clumsy or contradictory, such as in Charles Perrault’s The Ridiculous Wishes. Or, as in WW Jacobs’ 1902 horror story The Monkey’s Paw, their wishes unintentionally harm someone who is actually much closer to them than the object of their desire.Today, of course, most young people grow up with an enchanted fish in their pocket. They can wish for their homework to be done, and the fish will grant their wishes. They can wish to see any kind of sexual act imaginable, and (if they work around regional age-controls with a VPN) it will be visible. Soon they will be able to wish for films on a subject of their choice and these will be generated within seconds. They wish they had already finished that university essay – and lo and behold, it’s written.Everything she discusses with her AI is deemed interesting. Finally someone is properly listening, in a way no human partner couldThis change in approach will not just upend our relationship as consumers of the creative arts, of written, musical or visual content, it will also reconfigure what it means to be creative and, therefore, what it means to be human. I can imagine that most people in the near future will be able to task an AI representative with all kinds of tiresome interactions – negotiating contracts on their behalf or acting as their agent, receiving and cushioning criticism, collating information, surveying opinions and so on. And the sea will never turn dark.For now, young Ilsebills sitting in university lecture halls can still expect to be fined when their professor, who grew up in a different era, notices that she has got the enchanted fish to write yet another one of her essays. But that will only last a few more years, until Ilsebill is part of a self-confident majority and most of the professors grew up as Ilsebills themselves. Ilsebill wishes for a boyfriend, a spiritual coach, a therapist – and in an instant she will have one. With each one of these companions, it will feel as if Ilsebill has known them for years, which is literally true.One could accuse Ilsebill of complicating matters when, like her mythical predecessor, she one day actually wants to become pope and immediately does so in her small world. But if anyone can easily become the pope, then the appeal of being the pope disappears for Generation Ilsebill. Because things only become interesting and desirable when they require a certain amount of resistance, or an obstacle, to be overcome. Ilsebill, however, only knows that type of attractive resistance from learning through prompting – through ever more precise wishing.View image in fullscreenToday, young people grow up with an enchanted fish in their pocket … The Fisherman and His Wife.Illustration: AlamyShe devotes most of her energy in life to fine-tuning the tone of her results. She won’t have acquired her own ear for the tone of a piece of writing, but from gauging the way other people or AIs react to a text that she sent she will know whether the content is appropriate or inappropriate. That way, she learns to make ever more credible wishes. In the past, Ilsebill rarely met people who found things that she said interesting or remarkable. But today everything she discusses with her AI is deemed interesting and remarkable. Finally someone is properly listening, in the way no human partner could do so unconditionally.And what if the point is reached where all the wish fulfilment leaves Ilsebill feeling empty? What paths are still open to her then?The first is the path to decadence. We know this mechanism from studying very rich people. In the future, those who have enough money will be able to still afford human therapists or visit the cinema to see films made with real humans. Recently, someone on an AI forum suggested that in the future we should simply have some AI produce masses of child sexual abuse images, so that at least no real children would be harmed in their production. This suggestion was instantly ridiculed, because consumers of child abuse images are not buying just any visual stimulus, but primarily thecertaintythat real children were tortured. They insist on the credible provenance of the product, its “aura”, so to speak. If Ilsebill has enough capital, she will in a way be like them.The second path is that of small breakaway communities that artificially create difficulties and obstacles for each other, perhaps in the style of old-fashioned sports or hunting clubs, perhaps also in a sect-like manner. They meet in secret or exclusively for an underground event in some basement, which will require them to queue. There’s no goal other than the agonising act of queueing itself. I got this idea from Stanisław Lem’s novel The Futurological Congress. Today, in 2025, queuing is still free. Later generations might well marvel at this.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBookmarksFree weekly newsletterDiscover new books and learn more about your favourite authors with our expert reviews, interviews and news stories.

We use Google reCaptcha to protect our website and the GooglePrivacy PolicyandTerms of Serviceapply.after newsletter promotionThe third path is the most likely and the most obvious. Within her fairytale world of wish fulfilment, Ilsebill will discover an overarching principle that colours all her wishes anew, re-weights them, and gives them meaning: guilt. It is well known that guilt is the strongest means of binding a person to a product. A product that one loves but is ashamed to use grows powerfully in the mind and strongly attaches itself to a personality, enveloped in neuroses and real-life substitute virtues to compensate for the ever-increasing guilt.Ilsebill naturally takes on the enormous ecological guilt of the enormous waste of resources caused by AI. The main guilt is transferred from the giant corporations, the all-pervasive companies, or even the interaction of several states, straight on to Ilsebill, and she now does the logical thing of restricting and punishing herself more and more in the way she goes about her everyday life. Every morning she wakes up with the certainty that every small decision, every smallest wish, will massively damage “the planet”, “the society” or “the future”. She blossoms in her new-found role as saviour, in this system of martyr-like vicarious guilt. This role feels, not without justification, like a battle that will be fought within her for all eternity. It is the magic ingredient that can restore to her life the long-missing flavour of self-sacrifice and inner contradiction. Ilsebill doesn’t protest against the absurd waste of resources, but rather curtails all her freedoms in her private life, such as her supply of adequate nutrients, her water consumption, the number of children she has and her range of movement. In the end she dies, as a kind of Christ of corporations, and takes all her sins to her grave.The reason why so many European fairytales warned against unwise, ignorant wishes was because like most large, collectively produced complex narratives, their basic theme is individuals coming of age. How does a person grow up, how do they find their place in life, what should they pass on to the next generation, all these questions. Ilsebill, however, at least in this last scenario, no longer has the freedom to answer any of these questions by herself. It will all be decided for her.Clemens J Setz is an Austrian novelist and poetExplore more on these topicsFairytalesArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingEuropecommentShareReuse this content"

Now he is tackling the cultural divisions and colonial legacy of his homelandTue 16 Sep 2025 04.42 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 05.18 EDTShareSidi Larbi Cherkaoui is almost offended when I suggest he’s a busy man. “When people tell me, ‘You do so much,’ I cringe,” says the artistic director of the Grand Théâtre de Genève – the largest stage in Switzerland, with its ballet and opera companies – who runs his own company Eastman in his native city of Antwerp. He is also the creator of contemporary dance-theatre productions and a choreographer for film (Joe Wright’sAnna KareninaandCyrano), musicals (Alanis Morissette’sJagged Little Pill), pop (Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Madonna) and plenty more.This autumn alone, nine different works of Cherkaoui’s are being performed around the world, includingAn Accident/A Life, a collaboration with performer Marc Brew, about the car accident that left Brew paralysed from the neck down – “It’s maybe the piece I’m most proud of,” Cherkaoui says – and the UK premiere of Vlaemsch (Chez Moi), both in London.He squirms when I ask how many nights he spends at home. “Umm, does it matter?” he says by way of gentle deflection, wary of the modern way of conflating busyness with worth. “Everybody is working hard. My mother worked harder than I’m working. I don’t have kids, I don’t know how to cook. I don’t know how to drive. I just work, you know, and this is what I do. My life and work are the same thing.”Perhaps sometimes it doesn’t feel like work. When Cherkaoui first metMadonnaand had a long conversation about the choreography for her Celebration tour, “it did not cost me any energy”, he says. He was already a huge fan. “I knew all the songs, I knew the lyrics. It’s like my whole life I was studying Madonna.” What was she like to work with? “Inspiring,” he says. “She’s the most honest artist I’ve known. She really doesn’t give a fuck.”View image in fullscreen‘We have to face the pain’ … Vlaemsch (Chez Moi) by Sidi Labi Cherkaoui.Photograph: © Filip Van Roe VlaemschIn the UK, the double Olivier award-winning Cherkaoui may be best known for his collaborations with Akram Khan and Antony Gormley. In 2005’s Zero Degrees, Cherkaoui (who is Belgian-Moroccan) and the British-Bangladeshi Khan explored identity and multiculturalism, integrating text with boneless, rubber-bodied movement. For 2008’s Sutra, Gormley designed a stageful of wooden boxes as a playground for the high-leaping cast of monks from the Shaolin Temple (that piece is still touring). Cherkaoui was also a regular choreographer for experimental Belgian companyLes Ballets C de la B,layering up movement, text and live music in free-ranging thematic explorations.It sounds as though Vlaemsch has a similar format, and the show returns to the idea of cultural pluralism. The title is an archaic spelling of Vlaams (“Flemish”), and the piece examines Cherkaoui’s home region.Belgiumis a country conflicted about its identity, with deep divisions between Dutch-speaking Flanders and predominantly French-speaking Wallonia. (Cherkaoui is from Antwerp, in the Flemish north, but mostly spoke French at home, adding to his sense of in-betweenness.)He talks about Flanders holding on to its history like treasures stashed in an attic, fossilised. “There’s the desire to have a rich past, a rich culture that is sort of heroic, or at least elegant,” he says. “But deep down, Belgium, and Flanders specifically – and I would say England as well – we are colonial powers. We have had a very ugly past.” With Vlaemsch, he says, “we have to face the pain”. The result “might be too much, might be too long, might be unnerving, but I don’t care. Because for me, it’s really about addressing a couple of issues that I need to address before I die. I would hate myself if I didn’t.” The stage, he thinks, can be a place to meet difficult truths. “As artists, the funny thing is we are liars. We just make things up. But deep down, I think we reveal a lot.”View image in fullscreenExploring identity … Cherkaoui with Akram Khan in Zero Degrees (2005).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianWhile the creatives on the project are all Flemish – visual artist Hans Op de Beeck, costume designer Jan-Jan Van Essche and lute player Floris De Rycker (whose ensemble Ratas del Viejo Mundo specialise in pre-1650 polyphony) – the cast is international, with dancers from Japan, America, Congo, Canada, Germany, Russia and Ukraine, who he hopes can bring “an honest reflection on the culture”. The piece was being made in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine.Cherkaoui won’t be drawn on the politics of the rehearsal studio, but says: “I think the notion of people disagreeing is a constant for humanity.” What he is interested in are the “cultural lenses” people from different places use to analyse the world. In the studio, “we are different people with different opinions, working together to align. And I think that’s the beauty of it.” Wherever you come from, there’s cultural baggage attached. “And I feel like I’m coming with my baggage now, to Sadler’s Wells. So I hope you approach it with open arms,” he says, “because it’s going to be a lot.”Vlaemsch is a return, of sorts, Cherkaoui points out. In the past, whether it was visiting the Shaolin Temple for Sutra or Japan forTeZukA, a piece inspired by manga, “I’ve been running away from where I come from”, he says. “They were childhood obsessions but they were not really of my DNA.” Why was he running away? “Because I thought the world was so interesting, and outside was where I could breathe,” he says. “I think the world I was coming from was not one in which I could survive. As a queer, white Arab, everything about me was problematic for my environment.”View image in fullscreenInspired by manga … TeZukA (2011).Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The GuardianCherkaoui’s Moroccan father had met his Flemish mother on a nightclub dancefloor. “I think I became a dancer because I’m an expression of their love,” he says. “When I was young and they were in a good mood – which wasn’t often – but when they were having these good moments, they would be dancing to the music on the radio.” Cherkaoui’s father, however, forbade his son from dancing. “I wasn’t allowed to express myself.” His early icons were pop musicians; Kate Bush was a huge inspiration. “She was capable of singing about the most difficult subjects. It’s incredible the amount of characters she developed. She’s like an actress in her own songs, capable of putting herself in the place of anybody, and I was really educated by that.” Some people don’t take pop seriously, he says, “But I think it’s mainly because they’re uncomfortable with the simplicity with which these people express themselves.” Comedy, similarly, he thinks is one of the highest art forms because it’s so direct but so difficult to do well.It was Cherkaoui’s English teacher who encouraged him to pursue art. At 15, when his parents divorced, he began to dance. In his late teens he met a ballet director in Flanders who told him it was too late for him, but he took classes in every kind of dance anyway, and in a nice twist, one of his many jobs has been seven years as artistic director of RoyalBalletFlanders.View image in fullscreen‘Maybe the piece I’m most proud of’ … An Accident/A Life by Cherkaoui and Marc Brew.Photograph: Filip Van RoeCherkaoui’s father died four years after the divorce, but it wasn’t until Cherkaoui made the show Ihsane – a sort of companion piece to Vlaemsch, exploring his Moroccan heritage – and researched his father’s life, that he discovered that in Tangier his dad had been a trumpet player and an actor. “But when he came to Belgium, nobody cared about a Moroccan man knowing how to play trumpet,” Cherkaoui says. He was just another foreign worker.From his father, Cherkaoui realises, he may have got his artistic passion. From his mother, he got his fascination with communication and languages – she spoke many. “And the workaholic aspect is from my mum,” he admits. “I think people that are actually trying to really change the world, they are working hard,” he says. “Greta Thunberg is working hard.”Dance is a true vocation for Cherkaoui. “I’m just obsessed with the body, and I’m obsessed with the way the body can convey meaning and carry emotions,” he says. In his own way he is trying to change the world, within his cultural sphere. “Trying to show that there are other ways of looking at the world,” he says. “I want to move borders. I want to feel connection. And I will keep doing this until I am dead.”Vlaemsch (Chez Moi)is at Sadler’s Wells, London, 18-20 September.An Accident/A Lifeis at Sadler’s Wells East, London, 25-27 September.Explore more on these topicsDanceTheatreMusicalsSadler's WellsBalletOperaMadonnainterviewsShareReuse this content"

For Tom Holland and Dominic Sandbrook, the historians behind the hit podcast The Rest IsHistory, it could be the number of unexpected and overly familiar conversations with strangers. On a holiday high up in the mountains of Bulgaria, Holland was wandering around a secluded monastery when someone called out, “Love the podcast!”Sandbrook, meanwhile, is used to getting weird looks from fans who find it hard to compute that the man in front of them is one half of the soundtrack to their dog walks and commutes. “The weirdest thing that people say – which I’ve heard more than once – is, ‘My wife and I listen to you in bed every night,’” he says, looking mildly appalled.“Also, ‘I listen to you to get to sleep,’” adds Holland, in his instantly recognisable hushed tone, forever sounding as though he’s letting you in on a secret. “It’s always meant as a compliment. There’s something about our monotonous drone people just love. Maybe we need to try periodically shouting, just to keep people on their toes?”“You do that already, Tom,” Sandbrook says. “Often in a German accent.”2,000-year-old book about Roman emperors enters bestseller chartsRead moreIf you’re among the millions who listen to the world’s most successful history podcast: yes, they are really like that – a genial, articulate odd couple who love to gently bully one another. If you haven’t heard it, The Rest Is History has these two British historians tackling the entire sweep of human history, explaining everything from the Neanderthals to the fall of Liz Truss. “We’re insanely hubristic,” Holland says.Holland’s professional focus is antiquity and Sandbrook’s is modern history, though they are enthusiastic and entertaining storytellers no matter the topic. If you found history boring at school, this podcast will have you intently listening to 20 hours on the French Revolution – and that’s before even getting to the Terror. (They promise they will in early 2026 – “We’ve earned it,” Sandbrook says.) They have 15m downloads a month and more than half their audience is under 35. That their audience is so large, and so young, speaks to an appetite – or perhaps an anxiety – for the past to provide some answers about the present.View image in fullscreenHolland and Sandbrook dedicated one episode to the history of the suit. ‘I thought this [was] going to be incredibly dull subject but it was completely thrilling,’ Holland says.Photograph: Chris FloydAbout 150 episodes of The Rest Is History come out each year, including the free regular shows, plus live shows and bonus episodes for roughly 80,000 paid subscribers. It’s lucrative and exhausting work: both men remain committed to doing all their research themselves.“The mad thing is, we genuinely do all the reading and I still read people online saying, ‘Well, you can tell when they’re just reading out notes prepared by their researchers,’” Sandbrook complains. “I’ll be like, ‘I spent three weeks on that episode!’ And I’m not whingeing!”“Well, you are a little bit,” says Holland.When I ask how much time they spend together, they burst out laughing.“All the fucking time!” Holland wails. “It never stops!”Sandbrook, faux-wounded, responds, “This is sad to me, because I actually value every moment we spend together.”Can I go anywhere without people mentioning Tom Holland? The answer is noDominic SandbrookSome of their subjects are sure-fire hits with listeners – the Romans, Atlantis and the Nazis – while their more offbeat successes include history’s greatest monkeys and Elizabeth I’s sorcerer, John Dee. But the biggest deciding factors for whether they cover a subject is whether they’ll enjoy researching it and whether it is a good story – meaning they often focus on the grand narratives of history, such as the first world war or Watergate, or the lives of interesting individuals.“There are a few characters from history – General Custer, the Kaiser, General Gordon – who will never again have a better airing,” Sandbrook says. “They’re all basically slightly bad men.”When they meet their fans – perhaps in a Bulgarian monastery – they will often say they hated history at school, which says more about how it is taught today. “People love history because of the story and the narrative,” Sandbrook says. “It’s a very basic question: what happened next?“We’ve moved towards more storytelling, which is ironically the thing that history in schools has moved away from. And characters – which people don’t get particularly in schools, because it’s slightly frowned on and seen as not intellectually satisfying. We try to put the drama back in as much as possible. When Tom did his Mary, Queen of Scots series – that’s serious history, but also the stuff of a great HBO blockbuster.”Their research often leads to personal obsessions. Holland has discovered a new appreciation for the British naval commander Horatio Nelson while researching for an upcoming four-parter (“It opens up whole vistas”); for Sandbrook it was Custer, who got eight episodes to himself: “When we got into the details of the beard grown by Custer’s father, I remember thinking, ‘Maybe that’s a little too much detail.’”The two men met in 2005 at a charity quiz in London. “I recognised Tom was somebody who needed friends – lonely,” Sandbrook says.“He took me under his wing,” says Holland, immediately playing along. “I was just sitting there, peeling a napkin.”“Actually, I think it was because we both like The Lord of the Rings,” Sandbrook says. “Tom, were you not banned from watching the films at home?”“My wife refused point blank,” Holland says. “And I had bought the director’s cut, which is even insanely longer than the original. I didn’t have anyone to watch it with, so I could watch it with Dominic, my new friend.”It’s a lovely image, I say, but how do you bond with someone via a nine-hour film trilogy during which, I imagine, talking is very much forbidden?“Ah, but it is a very male way to bond – you don’t have to talk, it’s brilliant,” Holland says. “Literally, even in my dreams, I find myself talking to Dominic now.” (For the curious, yes there is fan fiction written about them.)View image in fullscreenHolland promised that ‘the podcast would not change my life in any discernible way’, Sandbrook says.Photograph: Chris FloydThe Rest Is History began in 2020 when Goalhanger – Gary Lineker’s podcast company – approached Holland to make a history podcast; his brother James, also a historian, had just made one about the second world war. “They couldn’t work out who I should be paired with and, idiotically, I suggested Dominic,” Holland says.“Yeah, you regret that now, mate,” Sandbrook says.Holland promised that “the podcast would not change my life in any discernible way”, Sandbrook says. “And the biggest single change is that now, whenever I do anything, people are always like, ‘I really like Tom Holland. Do you like Tom Holland’s books? Where’s Tom Holland?’ Can I go anywhere without people mentioning Tom Holland? The answer is no.”The show is touring Australia this year, a country both men are fond of;it is their marker for how far the podcast has spread. On their last tour there in 2023 “I remember standing there looking at the Opera House and pinching myself, thinking this is insane,” Holland says.No other show gets as up-close-and-personal as this: best podcasts of the weekRead more“I assumed we’d go to Australia and nobody would be there,” Sandbrook says. “But people recognised us in the airport and said, ‘I’m coming to your show!’ I couldn’t believe that. I thought Goalhanger had phoned ahead and employed some out-of-work actors to loiter in arrivals.”How do their fellow historians view the podcast’s success? “I’m sure it gives them nothing but unalloyed joy,” Holland says drily.“Historians – Tom and I included – are not renowned for their generosity of spirit towards other historians,” Sandbrook adds.Though this isn’t the whole truth, they amend; in 2023 the British Academy – the UK’s body for humanities and social sciences – awarded them its highest honour, the President’s Medal, for their “work to promote and popularise history to a global audience”.“That meant a lot, because that was a pat on the back from the community of academics on whose work we massively depend and without whom we simply couldn’t do what we do,” Holland says. “It was nice to know that they didn’t view us as shameless hucksters ripping them off. A huge reassurance.”“The truth is, history is quite embattled as a discipline,” Sandbrook says. “Lots of historians would probably say anything that tries to spark public interest must be a good thing … we wouldn’t have the number of listeners we have if people didn’t find history completely gripping.”The Rest Is History is touring Australia 26 November–5 December, then three shows on the Titanic in Ireland and Northern Ireland in April 2026.See here for all dates.Explore more on these topicsPodcastsPodcastingHistoryDigital mediainterviewsShareReuse this content"

The RTVE vote was held on Tuesday, the same day as a UN commission of inquiry concluded that Israel wascommitting genocide in Gaza.Explaining the decision, RTVE’s president, José Pablo López, said the broadcasters that comprise the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), which runs the contest, could no longer remain silent about Israel’s actions in Gaza.“As joint organisers of the Eurovision song contest, we share a collective responsibility,” he said. “While Israel has regularly participated in the competition, the current events and the genocide currently taking place make it impossible for us to look the other way.”RTÉ says Ireland will boycott Eurovision if Israel is allowed to competeRead moreLópez added: “It is not accurate to claim that Eurovision is merely an apolitical music festival. We are all aware that the contest carries significant political implications. The Israeli government is equally aware of this fact and leverages the event on the international stage.”Israel denies it is committing genocide in Gaza. Its ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Daniel Meron, said Tuesday’s report by the UN commission of inquiry was “scandalous” and “fake”.The EBU opened a consultation process in July with the 37 broadcasters who took part in Eurovision last year after a meeting was convened, hosted by the BBC in London, to discuss the differences of opinion on Israel’s participation in 2026. AlongsideSpain, the other “big five” Eurovision countries are the UK, France, Germany and Italy.Normally, broadcasters have to let the EBU know by October whether they will participate or not, but this year the deadline has been extended until December, allowing for late decisions not to take part.López said RTVE hoped that what he called its “visible, meaningful stand” would be heeded by other EBU members and that a decision on Israel’s participation in next year’s contest would be reached soon for the sake of the long-running competition.“Our hope is that a decision can be reached well before December, as the EBU must be aware of the serious damage being done to the Eurovision song contest, which will mark its 70th anniversary in 2026,” he said.“Therefore, we hope this decision will be made earlier and that the EBU won’t be subjected to the stress of a last-minute vote in London in December. We believe that, for the good of the festival and the values ​​it has championed since its inception, this matter must be resolved before the scheduled assembly.”The next Eurovision song contest will take place in Vienna in May. Eurovision is one of the world’s biggest TV events, with more than 160 million viewers this year.Russia wasbanned from the contestafter its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 but Israel has continued to compete over the past two years despite growing international concerns over its actions in Gaza.Slovenia’s public broadcaster, RTV, was the first to announce it would not participate, followed by RTÉ in Ireland and Avrotros in the Netherlands last week.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toThis is EuropeFree weekly newsletterThe most pressing stories and debates for Europeans – from identity to economics to the environmentEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Israel’s participation in Eurovision has been a significant topic of discussion in Finland and we have been consistently informing the EBU about the conversations happening here.“The EBU is therefore well aware of the public discussion in Finland. At Yle, we have received – and continue to receive – weekly feedback on this issue, both supporting and opposing Israel’s continued participation in the Eurovision song contest.”RTL in Luxembourg, whose main shareholder is the German media group Bertelsmann, told the Guardian it would be taking part next year as the contest’s code of conduct stresses that Eurovision “is a non-political, international entertainment event”. ARD in Germany said it was participating in the consultation process launched by the EBU.Martin Green, the director of the song contest, said: “We understand the concerns and deeply held views around the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We are still consulting with all EBU members to gather views on how we manage participation and geopolitical tensions around the Eurovision song contest … It is up to each member to decide if they want to take part in the contest and we would respect any decision broadcasters make.”Israel’s national public service broadcaster, Kan, which has been threatened with privatisation by Benjamin Netanyahu amidaccusations it is too leftist, has already decided it wants to take part.Explore more on these topicsEurovisionSpainIsraelEuropenewsShareReuse this content"

Graham has previously said he and the production team wanted to give a chance to young people “who may not normally have those opportunities” and that doing so was the show’s biggest achievement.Morgan said: “We’re so proud of Owen and so happy for him, and he’s worked so hard, and we’re delighted that the producers took the time to look for northern talent and took a chance on him. But it’s so rare they’ll take that chance, and so much talent is never looked at.”Morgan hopes that Cooper’s win will motivate more young people in the north-west to give the arts a try, and encourage a broader approach to casting that will enable people outside the capital, especially younger people, to be put on an equal footing for roles in the future.“You hope now that with the story of Owen, who you know, is just a normal kid from Warrington, more people will consider sending their kids to the school,” Morgan said. “What we really want, and what we hope Owen’s success does, is give a bit of a message out to everybody that maybe they need to look outside the box a bit. There is some really good raw northern talent out there, and in the rest of the country. Maybe come and look in different places in future to find that talent; maybe you’ll find a star.”skip past newsletter promotionSign up toFirst EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Creative organisations backing the letter include the News Media Association, which represents news publishers including the Guardian’s owner the Guardian Media Group, the Society of London Theatre & UK Theatre, and Mumsnet. There are more than 70 signatories in total.The letter claims that copyright law is being flouted “en masse” by tech companies to build AI models and raises the government’s refusal to accept amendments to the recent data (use and access) bill that would have forced AI firms to reveal what copyrighted material they have used in their systems.Such a move “actively stood in the way” of creators exercising their human rights, the letter adds, referring to the UN’s international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights (ICESCR), the Berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the European convention on human rights – the latter enforceable in the UK through the Human Rights Act.The letter points to a provision in the ECHR stating that “no one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest”, adding that removing the amendments breached UK citizens’ rights, under the ICESCR, to “the protection of the moral and material interests resulting from any scientific, literary or artistic production of which he is author”.“The government’s formal position has exhibited a shocking indifference to mass theft, and a complete unwillingness to enforce the existing law to uphold the human rights stipulated by the ICESCR, the Berne Convention and the ECHR,” said the letter.Labour has been atloggerheads with the UK’s creative communityever since launching a consultation on reforming copyright law, with the preferred option of letting AI companies use copyright-protected work without seeking the owner’s permission – unless they signal a desire to opt out of the process. The government has said this is no longer its preferred option and has convened working groups – drawn from the creative and AI sectors – to come up with solutions to the issue.Beeban Kidron, the crossbench peerwho tabled the data bill amendments, said the working groups were “packed” with US interests – members include ChatGPT developer OpenAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta – and pointed to recent government deals with Google and OpenAI as evidence of a continuing close relationship with US tech. Kidron said failure to protect copyright contravened artists’ human rights.“It’s deeply regrettable that it has come to this, but by prioritising the short-term optics of data centre announcements and trade deals, they are knowingly undermining the foundations of the UK’s creative industries,” said Lady Kidron.A UK government spokesperson said the the creative industries’ concerns over copyright were being taken “seriously” and a report into the impact of potential changes would be published by the end of March next year.“No decisions have been taken, but our focus is on both supporting rights holders and creatives, while making sure AI models can be trained on high-quality material in the UK,” said the spokesperson.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)Intellectual propertyElton JohnBeeban KidronComputingTrump administrationnewsShareReuse this content"

He said the social media backlash had extended to his family and friends as well as two other actors in the Cluedo cast.“I cannot and will not let my involvement in a show result in good people being targeted,” McLachlan said.Sign up: AU Breaking News emailCluedo, which is set to open in Brisbane in January before a national tour, was to have been McLachlan’s first theatrical role since a 2018 production of The Rocky Horror Show, which was co-produced by John Frost, now the chief executive of Crossroads Live.McLachlan withdrew from the production that year after allegations of historical sexual misconduct were made by three of his female co-stars in a 2014 production of the same show.He was also later accused of touching, kissing and groping actors without permission in Neighbours, City Homicide and the Doctor Blake Mysteries.McLachlan was ultimatelycleared of six assault and seven indecent assault allegationsin 2020. ​The Melbourne magistrate described McLachlan’s accusers as brave and honest but said it was not enough to prove the incidents amounted to assault.The magistrate also noted that changes to the standard of proof required for consent, which couldn’t be applied retrospectively as they came in after the time of the allegations, could have changed the outcome of the charges.McLachlan later instigated thendropped a defamation caseagainst Fairfax Media, the ABC and his accuser Christie Whelan Browne in 2022, citing his mental health.skip past newsletter promotionSign up toBreaking News AustraliaFree newsletterGet the most important news as it breaksEnter your email addressSign upPrivacy Notice:Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

In other words: forgetseason three, because we already know where season four is headed.In a post-Emmys conversation withDeadline, HBO’s Casey Bloys confirmed the rumour that The White Lotus season four will take place in France. Were there any other details? No. Did he offer even the slightest indication of even a sliver of what’s to come? Again, no. But this is the internet, so let’s speculate wildly nonetheless.Where in France exactly?Money problems: have we had enough of TV shows about rich people?Read moreFamously, every season ofThe White Lotusso far has been filmed at a Four Seasons hotel. This narrows things down somewhat. The Four Seasons operates three hotels in France: one in Paris, one in Megève and one on the Côte d’Azur.Obviously each of these locations would make for a profoundly different season of The White Lotus. You’d have to expect that the French Riviera is automatically out, since its mixture of Mediterranean climate and wealthy Eurotrash clientele put it too close to Taormina, the location of thesecond season.This leaves Paris and the Alps. Now, remembering the almighty fuss that everyone made about enduring the uncomfortable weather of Thailand during the filming of season three, it would make sense thatMike Whitewould steer clear of Megève, because that just seems like a nightmare. Not only would it be relentlessly cold, but it is also potentially dangerous. It would just take one bored actor to shatter their pelvis in a freak snowboarding accident to drag the entire production to a standstill. So Paris it is.View image in fullscreenLes Hôtels Four Seasons-George V et Prince de Galle à Paris.Photograph: Bruno de Hogues/Gamma-Rapho/Getty ImagesThis in itself would be no cakewalk, though. Paris is one of those cities that risks being filmed to death, with every possible angle of every possible landmark covered in any number of existing productions. You can’t imagine that anyone would be particularly happy if an integral scene was ignored because all the viewers had decided to Google which episode of Call My Agent! was also shot there.Plus the Four Seasons in Paris is easily one of the least visually interesting Four Seasons on Earth. Plus every single external shot will be papped to kingdom come if they go somewhere as obvious as Paris. Plus the weather might be crap. So, Paris. Unless it isn’t. Which it probably isn’t. Fine, Côte d’Azur then.What will it be about?So far, each season of The White Lotus has had its own broad theme. Season one was aboutmoney and class, season two was aboutsex and desire, season three was about religion and death. A fourth season will need to have a big, chewy theme of its own to stand up to the others. In a podcast episode towards the end of season three, White hinted that the next season would revolve around fame, suggesting that it might centre on some sort of film festival (another nod to the Côte d’Azur, potentially). However, at this point The White Lotus has been around so long that everyone already knows what the true theme of the season will be:entitled American touristsbeing awful to each other while having it off in ways that will make you want to bleach your eyeballs and brain.Who’ll be in it?Here’s where things might get interesting. Although each season is technically its own story, The White Lotus has enjoyed bleeding through whenever it can.Jennifer Coolidgewas in two seasons, as wasNatasha Rothwell, while Jon Gries has been in all three. Certainly the Thailand season pointed towards a future where we’d get to see Rothwell’s newly wealthy Belinda junk all her principles for a life of comfort, so maybe that will happen.View image in fullscreenNatasha Rothwell in The White Lotus.Photograph: HBOBut don’t forget thatMichael Imperioli’s character from season two was a film producer, so there’s a chance that he could make a reappearance at the festival. And Michelle Monaghan played an actor who everyone apparently recognised and loved, so maybe she could join him. Personally speaking I’d like to see White take a bolder step and reintroduce season one’s Armond as a ghost and have him float around pooping everywhere, but I suspect cowardice on the part of HBO will prevent this.Still, this is The White Lotus, so there are plenty of other roles to fill. There’s bound to be a family with a dark secret, a married couple with a dark secret who will make friends with another married couple who have a similarly dark secret, and the hotel staff. These will need to be French and, if the appearance ofLisafrom Blackpink last year is any hint, far too incongruously famous to play such a small part. Perhaps Kylian Mbappé can show up to play the guy who irons the towels.How likely is any of this?Not likely at all, since precious few details have been revealed. But since we’re probably not going to see season four of The White Lotus until 2027 at the earliest, you’ll have forgotten about all of this by then anyway. Oh well.Explore more on these topicsThe White LotusTelevisionUS televisionFranceHBODramaTV comedyfeaturesShareReuse this content"

He is Gwyneth Paltrow’s healer. Now, the tale of their shocking marriage is shared in this shallow, gushing documentary. Still, at least they have Prince Harry’s blessingHannah J DaviesTue 16 Sep 2025 00.00 EDTLast modified on Tue 16 Sep 2025 03.13 EDTShareIn 2019 – two years after her divorce from her former husband Ari Behn – Norway’s Princess Märtha Louise went public with her new partner. To say that Durek Verrett wasn’t what the Norwegian public had in mind would be an understatement: as well as being a Black American man based in Los Angeles, Verrett was also a celebrity shaman who had worked with the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow. The trailer for Rebel Royals: An Unlikely Love Story plays up his wild side and the sense that Märtha Louise was dramatically departing from tradition by dating – and later marrying – him. But, really, this Netflix documentary shows that they have a tremendous amount in common. Märtha Louise may be a princess but she is, to use a trendy word, incredibly“crunchy”– a woman who was communicating with angels and teaching energy healing way back in 2007. The pair are convinced that they met in a past life. And by the time we see them flogging their wedding pictures to a glossy magazine, it’s clear that their connection transcends the spiritual realm and extends to the financial one, too.Rebel Royals is presented entirely via talking heads – most notably, Märtha Louise and Verrett – giving it little narrative cohesion. Interesting titbits are teased throughout, such as Verrett describing himself as “soul-sexual”, and saying he had previously thought he would end up with a male partner. There is a section on the vile racism he faced inNorway– much of it from online trolls, but not helped by initial silence from his new in-laws. (As Verrett notes, when his father-in-law, King Harald, did speak out, he was praised by Prince Harry, who was himself embroiled in a race-related row with his family.)View image in fullscreenA ‘crunchy’ couple … Märtha Louise and Shaman Durek Verrett in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Courtesy of NetflixBut, really, everything here feels inescapably shallow: a mix of gushing comments from the film’s subjects, alarmist tabloid headlines about Verrett brainwashing Märtha Louise, and questions from the Norwegian media that are left unanswered. Royal expert Tove Taalesen thinks Verrett is “maybe a scam artist”, a claim that isn’t explored.Verrett denies being a scammer or a fraud, and sees any criticism towards him as a form of smear campaign, from a press that “[doesn’t] want a shaman who’s Black and bisexual marrying their princess”. That could well be the case, but the film leaves some blanks when it comes to Verrett’s past. We are told that he sold healing medallions during the Covid pandemic; a headline flashes up describing it as “immoral” but we don’t hear from Verrett himself.Verrett has also been accused of sexual misconduct towards a client, which he denies vehemently, but no questions are put to him here. Instead, we hear a voice note he sent to a friend in 2020, where he describes having “crossed a line” in a healing session by engaging in a sex act, but apparently in a way that was still consensual. “When you have a press that wants to prove to the world that I’m a charlatan, I’m a fake, I’m a conspiracy theorist, I’m evil, I’m dark – you have a very difficult situation,” he adds to camera. The result is, as with many Netflix documentaries de nos jours, a film that feels, if not one-sided, then not exactly brimming with editorial independence.Conforming to Norwegian society, he says, would make him melt down into a pile of goo like the Wicked Witch of the WestAs well as Behn’s suicide and the pain endured by Märtha Louise and her three daughters, the other unexpectedly tragic narrative thread here relates to Verrett’s health. We are told that he is undergoing frequent dialysis and is in need of a new kidney, for what would be his second attempt at a transplant. It is, of course, a sad series of events. But given Verrett’s views on modern medicine (in his 2019 book, Spirit Hacking, he described asking hospitalised patients why they “wanted” their cancer, as a form of treatment), it feels like a missed opportunity for him to explain why he believes some illnesses can be cured by shamanic means and others cannot. Instead, he merely takes the opportunity to describe himself as “a wounded healer”. As for that healing, we never get a good look at what Verrett’s shamanism consists of, let alone hearing from a happy customer or two.View image in fullscreenTo say the people of Norway were stunned would be an understatement … Märtha Louise and Durek Verrett in Rebel Royals.Photograph: Netflix/Courtesy of NetflixSometimes, as with the pandemic-era smash Tiger King – with which Rebel Royals shares its director, Rebecca Chaiklin – Netflix manages to have its cake and eat it, retaining the presence of a key quirky figure while also making them the butt of the joke. Here, Verrett is cast in that role: there is a lot of strutting, outfit changes and picky wedding planning. At one point, he pretends to vomit as he considers the unofficial cultural laws of Norwegian society, and his utter aversion to being modest. At another, he wears a jacket with the words “spiritual hustler” on the back, a sartorial choice that calls to mind the time Melania Trump wore a coat emblazoned with the words “I really don’t care, do you?” Conforming to Norwegian society would, he says, cause him to melt down into a pile of goo like the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.But there’s only so much madcap humour that can carry you through when everything else feels so flimsy. The closing part of the documentary – at the couple’s wedding in a remote area of Norway – is played for a few final laughs, with Verrett hiding under a sheet so none of the waiting paps can snap a picture before Hello!. It’s funny, but it did make me wonder whether Märtha Louise and Durek Verrett should have cut to the chase and just gone straight to reality TV instead.Rebel Royals: An Unlikely Love Story is on Netflix now.Explore more on these topicsTelevision & radioTV reviewTelevisionNorwayreviewsShareReuse this content"

But Chichester has never produced its own version of “the Danish play” until now. No pressure then for director Justin Audibert, whotook over in 2023.In a year of briskly delivered Hamlets set at sea (byRupert Goold) or soundtracked by Radiohead (co-directorsSteven Hoggett and Christine Jones), Audibert delivers not a high concept but a lucid and unhurried tragedy. In soliloquy after soliloquy, Giles Terera takes you deep into the prince’s torment, the intimacy of the Minerva accentuating the precision of his expressions. The lights come slightly up when he reaches “To be or not to be”, Terera’s eyes slowly closing on “perchance to dream” only to be rudely wakened before that line’s conclusion.View image in fullscreenHollow crown … Sara Powell and Ariyon Bakare, centre, in Hamlet.Photograph: Ellie KurttzThis Elsinore is long rotten thanks to designer Lily Arnold’s palette of greens and metallic shades. On a split-level stage, the castle’s walls are tarnished and the shine is to be wholly removed from the crown, spotlit on a cushion in the opening image. Sound designer Ed Clarke’s effects are akin to metal being stretched and vessels creaking, the ghost’s “swear!” resounding like a crack of lightning, while Arnold’s rocky coastline upstage reminds you of imminent invaders.Ryan Day’s lighting takes its cue from Hamlet’s “inky cloak”: the prince is one of many figures glimpsed in the darkness, eavesdropping in a court where the warning “no tongue” is repeatedly sounded. Terera looms in the shadows as Claudius (Ariyon Bakare) is directly crowned by Gertrude (Sara Powell) and the new king is met with an obsequious chorus of approval at a candlelit council.Through this, Terera simmers, eyes burning with hate, but melancholy tinges his delivery. His opening speeches convincingly convey a man processing the trauma of his father’s death and suggest he is already haunted, even before the arrival of the ghost (Geoff Aymer). This is a classical Hamlet who, by the time of his scorchingly lit final soliloquy, could not sound more modern, the personal turned political as he laments the deaths of thousands who “for a fantasy” fight for a plot of land.View image in fullscreenImprisoned … Giles Terera and Eve Ponsonby in Hamlet.Photograph: Ellie KurttzTerera, 48, is only a little younger than Bakare, making their characters more direct rivals for Gertrude. Eve Ponsonby, too, is a mature Ophelia, emphasising a sense of enforced arrested development and adding a sting to the reprimands of Polonius, who chides her as a “green girl” and literally, repeatedly, puts her in her place. Ophelia, a redhead dressed in green, is seemingly imprisoned within the castle’s rust-coloured walls.In a skilful performance as Polonius, Keir Charles gives us a figure of fuss and fury. Bakare delivers a slow-burning villainy as Claudius, whose trembling red right hand, concealed by a glove, is a reminder of his bloody deed and foreshadows God’s possible vengeance. Powell’s Gertrude is so racked with guilt the suggestion is that she drinks poison knowingly.At three and a half hours, the pace occasionally wavers but it is robustly acted (Sam Swann is a fine Horatio, Beatie Edney a gravedigger of earthy humour) and Audibert shows a keen understanding of the Minerva’s capacity for atmosphere. He is not the first to use Claudius’s prayer scene as an interval cliffhanger but as the former artistic director of theUnicorn, a children’s theatre, you sense he does so knowing there will always be audiences new to this play. As first Hamlets go, it’s a beauty.AtMinerva theatre, Chichester, until 4 OctoberExplore more on these topicsTheatreHamletGiles TereraChichester Festival theatreJustin AudibertreviewsShareReuse this content"

The island had already begun to appeal to city folk who came here for fresh air, sea baths and peace, but the sanatoriums set up by the renowned Dr Peter Silfverskiöld gained such a positive reputation that the isle became known as a health resort. Those glory days have long since faded butKusthotellet, a new hotel dedicated to wellbeing, aims to tap back into the restorative vibe.The conditions that first drew health-seekers to the island still pertain. It’s tucked away and protected from winds, but the lack of high ground nearby means the sun shines on its southern coast from dawn to dusk, and there’s no pollution. “This island is such a peaceful place – you can really relax and recharge your batteries,” Malin Lilton, manager of Kusthotellet, told my companion and me. “As soon as you get on the ferry your pulse rate goes down and you start breathing in the good air.”Sweden mapIn the spirit of slowing down, we had come by train from the UK with Interrail passes, stopping for the night in Hamburg. Arriving in the late afternoon in Gothenburg, we wandered the old town before heading to Styrsö via tram to Saltholmen harbour and speedy catamaran ferry. City centre to island hotel in just under an hour.Right on the coast with views across to neighbouring Donsö island, the 40-room, 10-suite hotel is a sleek creation, decorated in the cool, calming colours beloved by Scandinavians, with a light-filled restaurant, wellness area and outdoor heated pool. Our room, one of the 20 with sea views – is a spacious, uncluttered affair with a balcony.View image in fullscreenLate afternoon on Styrsö island in the Gothenburg archipelago.Photograph: Thomas Males/AlamyThe hotel is designed with sustainability in mind – there are ground-source heat pumps and water-based underfloor heating – and it’s aiming forGreen Keysustainability status. And everything has been kept as local as possible, from the staffing and food ingredients to the seaweed and salt used in the spa.That spa – named Havskuren (“The Sea Cure”) – is split into two areas. The Salt Source offers foot baths, facial treatments and an area for relaxing. The Heat Source contains a sauna, steam bath and plunge pool. There’s also a small gym. “We’re planning to offer massages soon as well,” Malin said.The menu features Nordic-influenced seafood dishes such as scallops, cured halibut, plaice and hake, as well as wholesome vegan optionsMalin also explained that cycling, walking, sea swimming and eating are also important elements in guests’ wellbeing, and presented us with two shiny new hire bikes. The 0.6 square mile (1.5 sq km) island is virtually car-free and as we explored over three days, the only vehicles we met on the smooth narrow roads were bicycles, golf carts and three-wheeled mopeds that resembled motorised wheelbarrows.One morning, having stocked up at the island Co-op, we pedalled off for a picnic lunch on Lilla Lyngnskär, a tiny islet accessible from Styrsö by footbridge. We still somehow had room forfika– coffees with a cinnamon bun and a mightychokladbollar(Swedish chocolate ball) – atCafé Öbergska, formerly an inn owned by pickled herring barons.View image in fullscreenThe new Kusthotellet wellbeing hotel.Photograph: Victor ApelgrenOur walks on the island’s wooded southern side included a memorable crepuscular hike on a footpath to a bronze age cairn at Stora Rös, the island’s highest point with a 360-degree vista across the southern Gothenburg archipelago. We shared the path down in the dark with scores of frogs, some no larger than our fingernails. Doubtless many would find their way into the stomachs of the herons we had seen hunting during the day.Back at the hotel, we dined in the high-ceilinged restaurant with views over the water. The menu features Nordic-influenced seafood dishes such as scallops, cured halibut, plaice and hake, as well as wholesome vegan options using locally farmed vegetables. We tucked into beetroot, chanterelle and oyster mushroom starters followed by charred cabbage and toasted hazelnuts over a mouthwateringly creamy potato base – all delicious.We slipped into wetsuits and into clear, even warm-ish seawater and watched Karolina pick sea plants sustainablyOne evening, after dinner we tried out the spa. Malin handed us a nose-pleasing set of creams and lotions she had made herself, and we luxuriated in the foot-baths, sauna and steam room, suffered in a freezing plunge pool, and relaxed again in the heated outdoor pool with a view across the ocean to the sparkling lights of Donsö.A bridge has joined Styrsö with this neighbour for just over 50 years, so the next day we cycled over it for an al fresco lunch at the harboursidePopsicle cafe, owned by Donsö-born sisters Kristin and Klara. Their mixture of ingredients grown by friends, tasty bread and cakes made by Klara’s mother-in-law and weekly live music has proved a hit. We returned to the harbour for a delicious dinner featuring jerusalem artichokes, butternut squash and a cauliflower sauce atIsbolaget, a high-ceilinged building that was once an ice store for fishing boats.View image in fullscreenThe Kusthotellet restaurant.Photograph: Victor ApelgrenOur final slow day was dedicated to aseaweed safari(£118pp) with potter-turned-naturalist Karolina Martinson. We began with a historical cycle tour of the northern part of the island, home to most of Styrsö’s 1,600-strong population. Karolina led us leisurely up and down miniature hills sprinkled with well-kept detached wooden houses, no two alike.Arriving at Karolina’s chosen beach, we slipped into wetsuits and clambered over rocks into the pleasingly clear and even warm-ish seawater. So followed our introduction to finger kelp, sugar kelp, fork weed, dulse, mermaid’s necklace and good old bladderwrack – all of them good for us or the planet or both. We snorkelled around, watching as Karolina showed us how she picks the plants sustainably.Our exploration done, we helped to prepare a homemade feast on the beach – traditional bread thins cooked on a stove, tofu wrapped in crispy mermaid’s necklace, light-as-air biscuits made with foraged meadowsweet, sweet bites of sugar kelp and much more besides. When we said our goodbyes, many hours later, we felt like old friends.All too soon we found ourselves at the dockside waiting for the ferry back to the reality of the outside world. After a few minutes, a woman joined us – bare-footed and apparently clad in nothing but a Kusthotellet spa robe. For all our newfound relaxed state, we clearly still had a lot to learn from the Swedes about how to be laidback.The trip was supported bytheWest Swedentourist boardandKusthotellet Styrsö(double rooms fromabout£130).

Her first thought, though, would be to tip a jar of the sweet stuff into a buttered ceramic baking dish and top it with sponge: “Make a classic, equal-parts mix scaled to your dish by creaming, say, 180g butter and 180g sugar, slowly beating in an egg and a dash of vanilla or lemon zest, and finishing with 180g self-raising flour.” Spoon that on top of the jam and bake at 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 until the sponge “bounces back” and a skewer comes out clean. Serve warm with cream or custard, and job’s a good ’un.You’ll also want jam to fill or top cakes. “Obvious things are a Victoria sponge, but that doesn’t use much jam,” saysthe Guardian’s own Benjamina Ebuehi, so she’d be more inclined to spoon buttercream over the top of a coconut cake, for example, make a dip in the middle with the back of a spoon and pop some jam in there: “That’s a nice way to decorate a cake and it also uses up a decent amount of jam.” It wouldn’t hurt, either, to use berry jams to finish a classic school dinner traybake sponge: “Once it’s out of the oven, top with jam then scatter with desiccated coconut.” Otherwise, Ebuehi says, joy can be found in a nostalgic jam tart or Italiancrostata(look out for Ebuehi’s blackberry version next week).Of course, jam is a great friend of biscuits, too, with Cuddeford and Ebuehi agreeing thatthumbprintcookies are the way to go here. Cudderford opts for jamaretti: “Whisk egg whites with sugar, ground nuts and lemon zest until firm enough to roll into balls, then toss in icing sugar.” Make an indent in the centre, spoon in the jam and bake: “They’re delicious, chewy and keep well in a sealed container for a few weeks.” Darcie Mahler, owner ofLannan bakeryin Scotland, meanwhile, would go for shortbread: “Make a simple shortbread by beating icing sugar and butter, then add flour – I use a mix of plain and spelt – cornflour, salt and vanilla paste.” Pipe that into discs, make a thumbprint, fill with jam and bake until the edges are lightly golden.A dollop of jam also gives breakfast an instant zhoosh. For Ebuehi, that means porridge or yoghurt, while no sensible person ever refused a twice-baked croissant, Cuddeford says. “Split croissants in half and spread with jam. Cream 80g butter and 80g sugar, add an egg and 80g ground almonds, then spoon into your jammy croissants, and spread some on top, too.” Sprinkle with flaked almonds, then get them in a 190C (170C fan)/375F/gas 5 oven for 20 minutes for a very good morning.There are, of course, only so many baked goods you can eat (well, in theory, anyway), so also consider spreading the love: “Put a nice bow on the jars and gift them,” Ebuehi says. “Everyone loves an edible gift.” Alternatively, get a gang over, mix a teaspoon of jam into cocktails – “with gin, lemon juice and tonic,” Cuddeford suggests – and keep that summer spirit alive.Got a culinary dilemma?

Like unwrapping an edible present, the smell hits you before anything else, which in this case is fennel, thyme and lemon. It is a delicate way to cook fish, so the sauce needs to have some character, and basil, olives and lemon with a slick of olive oil make a beautiful, late-summer seasoning. Round off the feast with a blackberry and crisp almond pastry slice that tastes all the better if you forage your own fruit.Cod with courgettes, green olives and lemon (pictured top)The sharp acidity of the lemon and olive herb salsa is stunning with the gently baked fish.Prep15 minCook1 hrServes41 large fennel bulb,trimmed and thinly sliced (using a mandoline, if you have one)3 shallots,peeled and thinly sliced2 tbsp olive oilSea saltandblack pepper1 large cod fillet(600-700g)3 courgettes, green or yellow1 lemon2 tbsp butterFor the salsa1 lemon,thinly sliced75g green olives, pitted and chopped1 handful picked fresh flat-leaf parsley,roughly chopped, plus extra to serve1 handful picked fresh basil,roughly chopped, plus extra to serve1 tsp honey2 tsp sherry vinegarHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Put the fennel and shallots in a bowl, toss with two tablespoons of oil and season generously.Lay a large sheet of baking paper on a baking sheet. Put the oiled veg into the centre, fold over the sides of the paper to cover, then bake for 15 minutes. Unwrap and stir the vegetables, then cover again and bake for another eight to 10 minutes, by which time the vegetables should be translucent and fragrant.Unwrap the parcel again, lay the fish on top of the vegetables and season well. Thinly slice the courgettes and lemon and arrange on top of the fish, then season and dot over the butter. Wrap the parcel back up and bake for 15-20 minutes, until the fish is opaque and flaky.Meanwhile, make the salsa. Char the lemon slices in a hot, dry pan until they’re starting to blacken and caramelise, then remove and roughly chop, peel and all. Transfer to a small bowl, add the chopped olives, herbs, honey and vinegar, and stir. Taste, and add more salt, honey or a dash of vinegar, if need be, to balance the flavours.Once the fish is cooked, baste it with the juices from the package, then cut into four. Serve the fish and veg on warmed plates, topped with the salsa and a sprinkling of fresh herbs. This is lovely served with boiled potatoes to soak up all those flavours.Blackberry and almond sliceView image in fullscreenThomasina Miers’ blackberry and almond slice.The almond pastry is crisp and delicious, the insides wonderfully chewy and dense.

Roll out the chilled pastry on a lightly floured surface into a 26cm square. Butter a 26cm x 26cm square baking tin and lay the pastry on top, gently pushing it into the corners and edges.Spread the jam evenly over the pastry, followed by the almond mix, smoothing it out with a palette knife. Dot the blackberries over the top, pushing them gently into the batter, then scatter over the flaked almonds. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden and set, then remove and leave to cool in the tin.Remove from the tin, sift over a little icing sugar, cut into squares and serve.The Guardian aims to publish recipes for sustainable fish.

Without it, my whole day feels slightly off. For years, that was just something I accepted about traveling or camping – theremightbe coffee, but it wouldn’t quite ground me. It would be a compromise. A little off.The Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.Learn more.That’s why I’ve spent the past few years perfecting my travel coffee setup: so I can make rich, comforting, homey coffee anywhere in the world,withouttrying to wedge an espresso machine into my carry-on. Here are the inexpensive tools that make it possible.Aeropress + Fellow PrismoView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyThis is the star of the show. The humble Aeropress is a remarkably versatile, durable little device that’s seen me through conferences, multi-state moves, and even a stretch of couch surfing between friends’ places. At its core, it’s just a simple plastic cylinder with a plunger. Add your coffee grounds, pour in hot water, give it a stir, and then plunge it like a giant syringe.I made one key upgrade, though: instead of the standard cap and paper filters, I use the Fellow Prismo, a high-pressure cap with a reusable metal filter. This swap both eliminates the need for paper filters, and aerates the coffee as you press, giving it a touch of crema and a boost in both flavor and aroma.Aeropress Original$34.98 at Walmart$39.99 at AmazonFellow Prismo$24.95 at Fellow$24.95 at AmazonLocal coffee beansView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Caffe VitaWhen I’m staying in a hotel, I’ll usually track down a local cafe and pick up a bag of beans. Most spots are happy to grind them for you, and it’s worth it: those commercial-grade burr grinders give you an incredibly even grind, which makes a big difference in flavor.Plus, it’s a great way to connect with the local coffee scene. You’re not just getting a caffeine fix — you’re tasting your travels, supporting a small business, and maybe discovering a roast you’ll end up ordering again once you’re back home. On trips to Seattle, I used to drop in to Caffe Vita for a bag of its rich and velvety Queen City blend, and KumaCoffeefor Momma Bear, a half-caf blend that makes my afternoons wonderfully buzzy without ruining my sleep schedule.Queen City coffee$20 at Queen CityMomma Bear coffee$19.50 at Kuma CoffeeCoffee storageView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyGoing to a cafe isn’t always an option though, especially if you’re miles deep in the wilderness. For those times, you’ll want to rely on either pre-ground or whole beans in an airtight container. I’ve had success using a small mason jar with an airtight lid. Durable, washable, reusable.Some travel containers like the Fellow Atmos offer a vacuum-seal feature, but I’ve tested my mason jar against dozens of vacuum sealed containers, and honestly I can’t taste a difference unless I let the coffee sit for three to four days, unopened. As long as you open your mason jar every couple days, you shouldn’t get any flavor issues. So for our purposes here, I just find a mason jar to be the easiest, cheapest, and most versatile pick by far.Ball 8 ozmason jars, 12-pack$11.39 at Walmart$11.39 at TargetHario Skerton Plus Hand GrinderView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Hario SkertonIf you’re traveling with whole beans and want that fresh-ground flavor every time, you’ll need a grinder that’s compact and reliable. I recommend theHario Skerton Plus. It’s the perfect size to pair with an Aeropress, and its ceramic burrs grind consistently without overheating your beans. It fits in your hand, packs easily and gets the job done, whether you’re camping or posted up in a hotel room.Hario Skerton Plus Hand Grinder$48.00 at Zoka Coffee$48.00 at Haro SkertonFellow Stagg EKG Electric KettleView image in fullscreenPhotograph: Jaina Rodríguez-GreyIf you’ll have access to power, theFellow Stagg EKGis my go-to travel kettle. It’s sleek, quick-heating, and insulated well enough to keep your water hot for close to an hour. The gooseneck spout gives you precise control for brewing, and the compact body fits into a carry-on without issue. I often pack my Aeropress inside the kettle itself, then stash the whole bundle in my suitcase.I’ve had mine for nearly five years. It’s a little scuffed from all the travel, but still runs perfectly – and I use it literally every day.If you’re in the woods, the Filter US editor Nick Mokey recommends theCamp Chef Stryker 200, which runs on either compact isobutane canisters, or the ubiquitous green propane cylinders you can find at any gas station. It’s also crazy fast, boiling enough water for two cups of coffee in under two minutes.Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Kettle$165.00 at Crate & Barrel$165.00 at DigsCampChef Stryker 200$76.99 at Acme Tools$78.99 at WalmartJaina Rodríguez-Grey is a freelance journalist and coffee obsessive whose work has appeared in Wired, Vice, Westlaw and beyond.
